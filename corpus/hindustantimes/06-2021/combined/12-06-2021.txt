He said the perpetrators would be booked under charges of attempt to murder and atrocities against SC/ST persons after receiving a complaint from the victims’ family.Another police official said the victim Bajrang Rawat has accused Durga Yadav and his aides Raju Yadav, Ajay Yadav, Vijay Yadav, Rajpal and others for the attack. He said Bajrang, his brother Vishal and his wife Sarita and two relatives Dilip and Rajesh were injured in the attack. Of them Rajesh suffered bullet wound on right side of the chest, Vishal suffered bullet injury in his palm while three others suffered severe injuries on head while being attacked with rods, he added.The official further said Bajrang claimed that Durga Yadav and his aides had murdered his father Bheekha Ram Rawat on October 7, 2015 in a bid to grab their 2-bigha land located alongside Shaheed Path opposite Medanta Hospital.“Yadav and his aides have been mounting pressure on Bajrang to turn hostile as he was a key witness in the murder case that is currently being investigated by the CB-CID and the accused are likely to be chargesheeted soon,” he said.Bajrang said the attack was the result of his denial to turn hostile in the case as Yadav and his aides had called him two days back for the same reason.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/five-members-of-up-dalit-family-attacked-by-goons-of-land-mafia-101623520172286.html

In the meeting, you failed to answer the queries put to you on the matter. This act and conduct on your part for not responding to the matter, and attending the meeting without any preparation is an act of indiscipline, disobedience of the orders of a higher authority, and negligence in the discharge of your official duties, honestly and diligently,” read the notice issued by Ahuja, a copy of which was accessed by HT.Ahuja set a seven-day deadline for the engineers to respond to the notices in writing, failing which disciplinary action will be initiated against them, he said.A senior official with the engineering wing, requesting anonymity, said, “The executive engineers have already acted upon the MCG commissioner’s direction. Each of them visited major waterlogging points across their respective jurisdictions, with a special focus on the underpasses where the functioning of all motor pumps were checked. For this year’s monsoon, the MCG has taken the onus of waterlogging and will act as a nodal body for all matters related to it.”The official cited above said that the engineers will put up details of their visits, along with the findings and solutions, in their reply to the notices.Ahuja had directed the executive engineers on Wednesday to submit a report on waterlogging points and possible solutions to resolve the issues within a day. However, they were unable to share any details on Thursday, following which notices were issued.“Under these orders, you (engineers) were required to put forward your opinion, observations, and experience with regard to the ways and means to mitigate the problem of waterlogging in Gurugram during the monsoon season,” the notice read.As per the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the monsoon will arrive in Delhi-NCR on Tuesday, 15 days earlier than usual.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/monsoon-preparedness-mcg-pulls-up-executive-engineers-over-failure-to-submit-reports-101623519814422.html
12-06-2021||Gurugram||Black fungus treatment after Covid-19 costs patients ₹10-12 lakh||Even as the district health department directed private hospitals to set up day-care facilities to make treatments affordable for mucormycosis (black fungus) patients, many are spending about ₹10-12 lakh at private super-speciality hospitals in the absence of government facilities.Doctors concurred that the treatment cost is high as multiple vials of the main drug used in the treatment, Liposomal Amphotericin B — a 50mg vial of which costs ₹6,000 — have to be administered daily for at least two weeks.“A patient has to take four to six vials, every day, based on the body weight, for at least two weeks,” said Dr Dhirendra Singh Kushwah, consultant, ENT, Narayana super speciality hospital in Sector 24.Patients said that besides spending over ₹3 lakh solely on the drug, they have to shell out ₹5-7 lakh for other medicines and the hospital charges for two weeks.Currently, at least 180 cases are under treatment in the district, according to the district health department data.To reduce the treatment cost, on May 10, the district health department directed private hospitals to set up a day-care facility for administering the Amphotericin B drug, which requires nearly four hours for infusion along with constant monitoring of vitals. The price of the facility has been capped at ₹2,000 per day for National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and healthcare providers (NABH) and at ₹1,500 at non-NABH facilities.Dr Rahul Bhargava, principal director, Hematology, Fortis Memorial Research Institute in Gurugram, said, “Infusion of Amphotericin-B along with other fluids and potassium takes at least six hours, which used to cost roughly about ₹8,000. Following the line of treatment where a patient will need to visit the hospital for four weeks, the overall cost of the facility adds up to ₹2,40,000. Therefore, by capping the price, the cost drastically comes down to ₹60,000.”According to him, expenditure on the treatment of one black fungus case is equivalent to treating at least 10-15 Covid-19 patients. Hira Singh, 44, a resident of Rewari district, who took underwent nose surgery at a private hospital on May 18 after getting infected with black fungus has spent almost ₹12 lakh on treatment.His nephew Dr Hitesh Yadav, an intern at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences – Rohtak, said that the family has spent almost ₹7 lakh on the amphotericin drug alone and ₹5 lakh on the surgery.“For almost 25 days, my uncle is on Amphotericin-B drug, which has to be arranged from outside. For a single vial, we had to pay about ₹8,000 to ₹10,000. Surgery, which is important in line with the treatment, cost around ₹5 lakh. Other hospital expenditures added to the overall cost. Later, he was shifted to home where he has been under medical care and getting the Amphotericin-B drug. The treatment of black fungus is highly expensive,” said Yadav.Black fungus has been found mostly among people with uncontrolled diabetes, whose immunity is compromised, or among people who are given excessive steroids or immunity-modulating drugs such as tocilizumab. According to doctors, if left untreated, it could kill up to 80% of those infected. If not detected early, it affects the orbit of the eye and the mouth, resulting in people losing their vision or jaw during debridement, the process of removing dead tissue from an infection or wound.Dr Bhargava said, “Since it can directly impact kidneys, fluid has to be given to the patient. Also, the potassium level in the blood declines. In nearly 10% of cases, it leads to potassium abnormalities which can lead to heart problems. Considering all these factors, a day-care facility is required to help patients who do not require hospitalisation.”According to Kushwah, patients are generally admitted for three to four days after the surgery where dead tissues are removed from the infected region. “Patients who have been discharged have to regularly visit the hospital for administration of the Amphotericin-B drug. For this, a few beds are reserved in the emergency ward as an infusion of the drug takes over four hours, with constant monitoring of kidney functions and potassium level in the body,” said Kushwah.In the district, at least 292 cases of back fungus have been reported by private hospitals, of which 134 are from Gurugram and the remaining from other states and districts. Currently, 180 patients are under treatment, while 28 have succumbed to the illness. Data provided by the district health department shows that at least 197 cases are diabetic. According to doctors, until last month, at least three cases were admitted every day. With the decline in the cases, it has reduced to almost three patients a week.Dr Ravinder Gera, director and head of department, ENT and neck surgery, Max Hospital, said that the ideal situation would be to admit patients to the hospital for two weeks till the time Amphotericin-B drug is required to be administered. “It is critical to monitor the impact of the drug after infusion. Potassium levels generally reduce after eight to 10 hours of the drug administration, making constant monitoring of patients crucial,” said Gera.“If the drug is given for at least seven days, then the cost comes around ₹40,000 to ₹60,000. Only after considering the vitals, a patient is shifted to oral medicines. Even oral medicines cost about ₹3,000 a day, which is also expensive,” said Gera.According to Gera, 22 cases were reported at the hospital, of which seven are currently admitted, two have succumbed to the illness, while the remaining are undertaking daily visits.Dr Jai Prakash, district surveillance officer for Covid-19, said, “In case a patient approaches a government hospital, they are referred to the medical college in Nuh or Rohtak, where the treatment is free.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/black-fungus-treatment-after-covid-19-costs-patients-10-12-lakh-101623519812698.html

12-06-2021||Gurugram||Bandhwari WTE plant on MCG priority list, October deadline set for groundwork||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on Saturday directed its waste management concessionaire, Ecogreen, to clear at least 10 acres at the Bandhwari landfill by October for setting up a waste-to-energy (WTE) plant.MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja directed the agency to clear a portion of legacy waste and move the existing compost and refuse-derived fuel (RDF) at the landfill to an alternative site to start work on the WTE plant while simultaneously continuing to clear legacy waste.“I held a meeting with representatives of Ecogreen on Thursday where I received information about the solid waste management methodology they are using to clear legacy waste. Following this, I have set them a deadline of October for clearing a portion of legacy waste, and shifting existing compost and RDF to a new site so that there is adequate space of at least 10 acres to set up the WTE project,” said Ahuja.The agreement for setting up a WTE plant was signed between the Haryana government and Ecogreen in August 2017. However, due to the 2.5 million tonnes of legacy waste enveloping the entire landfill area, there was no progress in the regard for four years. The project has now picked up momentum after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) earlier this year rapped the MCG for failing to clear legacy waste at the landfill site and directed the agency to take measures to remedy the situation at the earliest.Ahuja said he has directed Ecogreen officials to increase the capacity of trommel machines at the landfill for an increased processing rate and ensuring waste can be disposed of within the stipulated time period. Ecogreen has currently deployed eight trommel machines at the landfill that can cumulatively process around 2,400 tonnes of legacy waste daily.“We are complying with all directions as issued by the MCG commissioner. Work on clearing legacy waste from the landfill using trommel machines is in full swing. We are on course to complete the clearing of the required area for setting up the waste-to-energy plant as per the MCG’s set deadline,” said an official spokesperson for Ecogreen.An MCG official familiar with the matter said that Ecogreen representatives also apprised Ahuja about the door-to-door garbage collection, and its transportation process.“Ecogreen officials informed the MCG commissioner that in all 35 MCG wards, manual rickshaws and tripper machines have been placed for the door-to-door waste collection process. Further, they also told him that trommel machines and ballistic separators have also been installed at the Bandhwari landfill to clear and process legacy waste. For the leachate emerging from the collected waste, Ecogreen officials said that they have built storage tanks along with setting up a leachate treatment plant to collect and treat the same,” the senior MCG official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/bandhwari-wte-plant-on-mcg-priority-list-october-deadline-set-for-groundwork-101623519812162.html
12-06-2021||Delhi||Five shops in Lajpat Nagar market gutted in fire, none hurt||: A massive fire broke out at a handloom shop on Veer Savarkar Marg in south Delhi’s Lajpat Nagar market on Saturday morning, which spread to at least four more shops and damaged goods and articles worth ₹7-8 crore, said fire officials and traders in the market. No casualty was reported. Officials from the Delhi Fire Service said they received a call regarding the fire at a showroom on Veer Savarkar Marg in Lajpat Nagar market at 10.20am, following which fire tenders were immediately rushed to the spot. Atul Garg, chief of Delhi Fire Service, said, “When our teams reached the spot, the fire had spread to four adjacent shops. Initially, 16 fire tenders were pressed into service however, since the fire was massive, more fire tenders were rushed to the spot. It took 30 fire tenders and about 100 firemen close to four hours to douse the flames. The fire was somewhat extinguished by 2pm.” He added that since the incident occurred in the morning and the market was closed, there was no casualty. “The exact reason behind the fire is yet to be ascertained. It was a big fire and firemen had to break open the locks of shops to douse the flames. We stopped the fire from spreading to other shops. Nearby shops in the market were shut and the area was cordoned off to effectively carry out operations,” Garg said.Ashwani Marwah, general secretary of the Traders Association Lajpat Nagar (TALN), said the fire was so massive that smoke billowing out of the shops was visible hundreds of metres away. He suspected that the fire may have broken out due to a short circuit though the exact reason is yet to be ascertained. Traders of the market said the fire spread quickly since it broke out in a handloom shop that was located near another garments shop.  “The fire started at a handloom shop. Later, it engulfed a readymade garment shop, then a crockery shop and eventually spread to other shops. Total five stores in four buildings on Veer Savarkar Marg were gutted in the fire. We estimate a loss of around ₹7-8 crore in the fire. The market remained closed in the first half of the day. It was opened only in the afternoon after the blaze was completely doused,” said Marwah. He further said the entire Veer Savarkar Marg was blocked for vehicular movement to ensure smooth fire extinguishing operations. “One carriageway of the road is still shut. Cooling operations are still underway in that portion of the market,” Marwah added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/five-shops-in-lajpat-nagar-market-gutted-in-fire-none-hurt-101623518972015.html
12-06-2021||Delhi||Two police officers say they were beaten by protesters at Singhu||Two assistant sub inspectors (ASIs) of the Delhi Police’s special branch alleged they were branded as “government agents” and assaulted by protesters at the Singhu border in outer Delhi, where farmers have been protesting against the three farm laws for the last six months, while they were reportedly taking pictures of the event. Police said they have filed an FIR.The special branch is the intelligence unit of the police and its officers do not wear the khaki uniform. At least 40 different unions under the banner of SKM are protesting at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur -- the three interstate borders in Delhi.According to the complainant ASI, on Thursday at around 3.30 pm, he and his colleague were on duty at the border and were taking photographs of the stage of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), when a woman protester and a group of men accused him of being “a government agent”.The ASI alleged that they were beaten even after he showed them his identity card. In his statement, he said that he and his colleague rushed towards a tent and was rescued by locals, after which they informed police officers at the spot.Police said both the officers were taken to a nearby hospital, where doctors said that the nature of their injuries suggested attack with blunt objects. Police have registered a case under sections of assault, stopping public servant from doing his/her duty and other sections of Indian Penal Code. Police are yet to make any arrests in the case.Bharatiya Kisan Union chief Rakesh Tikait hinted at a case of mistaken identity. “They (policemen) must have been in civil dress and farmers might have mistaken them for media people who portray their movement in a bad light. We don’t engage in violence,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-police-officers-say-they-were-beaten-by-protesters-at-singhu-101623518911331.html

He also said that if Sachin Pilot would be angry then he would not have been in close contact with him.Leaders in the Sachin Pilot camp have also said that they are feeling ‘pressured’ by Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot to switch sides. These leaders also said that they will fight for their dues ‘within the party framework.’People familiar with the developments also said that delay in the redressal of grievances which were earlier promised is making leaders in the Pilot camp restless. They also said that the chief minister is refusing to give them their due. The Congress government in Rajasthan faced a huge crisis after Sachin Pilot and 19 other MLAs revolted against Ashok Gehlot last year.Pilot earlier this week denied rumours of him leaving the party and also refuted speculations regarding a switch to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). “Rita Bahuguna Joshi said she spoke to Sachin. She might have spoken to Sachin Tendulkar (the cricketer). She doesn't have the courage to speak to me,” Pilot had said dismissing claims of him speaking to the BJP leader over a possible switch.Congress MLA Hemaram Choudhary who resigned on May 18 also met Sachin Pilot in Jaipur on Friday morning. Pilot loyalist PR Meena also demanded expansion of the Rajasthan cabinet and said that leaders were growing impatient. “The party high command should take a decision at the earliest because everyone is waiting,” he said.

The state has 117 assembly seats. The formal announcement of the alliance was made by SAD chief Sukhbir Badal in the presence of BSP’s national general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra at a joint press conference held at the SAD headquarters here. Sukhbir said the BSP will contest eight seats in Doaba that is considered party’s stronghold because of its deep-rooted rapport with the Ravidasia community. The party will contest seven seats in Malwa and five in Majha regions, he said. Nearly 40% population in Punjab belongs to Dalits. The BSP will contest Kartarpur, Jalandhar West, Jalandhar North, Ludhiana North, Pathankot, Amritsar Central, Amritsar North and Mohali. The Mayawati-led party will also fight from Phagwara, Hoshiarpur City, Tanda, Dasuya, Chamkaur Sahib, Bassi Pathana, Mehal Kalan, Nawanshahr, Sujanpur, Bhoa, Anandpur Sahib and Payal seats. Reacting to the development, Mayawati, through a tweet, termed the alliance “a new political and social initiative that will usher in a new beginning in the prosperity of Punjab”. SAD patriarch Parkash Singh Badal described the alliance as the “beginning of a secular, federal-democratic revolution in the state and the country for a total socio-economic and political revamp of polity”. “The process of justice and equality for the poor, the downtrodden and the minorities will also get a boost with this development,” Senior Badal said in a statement. Of the 20 seats given to the BSP, eight are reserved for Scheduled Castes candidates and 11 are ones which SAD would leave for the BJP when the two parties were in an alliance. Eight seats are dominated by urban voters having sizeable chunk of Dalits. “Today is a historic day... A big turn in Punjab’s politics. This is not just an alliance for the 2022 assembly polls but for other coming elections as well as SAD has the history of not betraying its alliance partners,” Sukhbir said at the joint press conference. Sukhbir said both the SAD and the BSP has the same ideology and has always worked for the welfare of farmers, the poor and ‘khet mazdoor’. He said each and every facility extended to the weaker sections, be it aata-daal, old age pension or Shagun scheme, was started by Parkash Singh Badal. “The Congress party has not initiated a single welfare scheme for the weaker sections and is responsible for terminating schemes like the SC Scholarship scheme. It was because of these factors that there was a demand from the grassroots level of both the SAD and the BSP to come on a common front,” he said. Mishra said the BSP has chosen to align with the “strongest party” in Punjab and both parties had come together after 25 years since the 1996 Lok Sabha elections when the alliance had swept 11 out of the 13 seats. He said BSP president Mayawati wanted to come and announce the alliance herself but couldn’t make it due to Covid restrictions. Sukhbir said both parties will soon constitute a co-ordination committee to further chalk out a common strategy. After the announcement, top leaders from both factions met SAD patriarch Parkash Singh Badal at his MLA flat.

According to the MP, the inordinate delay by land acquisition department in providing land for 33.75km-long four-lane National Highway-98 between Padwa More and Hariharganj worth ₹755 crore, and similar work on National Highway-75 between Shankha and Khajuri worth ₹748 crore has put both projects in jeopardy. Ram said, “These projects were sanctioned by the central government after much persuasion. However, as the deadline for providing land has already expired on May 17, the union government may transfer funds to another state.”“I have written to chief minister Hemant Soren and the chief secretary urging them to ensure execution of work of these two projects at the earliest, so that the people of Palamu region are not deprived of these much needed projects,” the MP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/land-acquisition-delay-may-put-projects-worth-1522-crore-in-limbo-101623515491168.html

12-06-2021||Ranchi||Dead female cop’s father challenges judicial probe||Devanand Oraon, father of deceased woman police officer Rupa Tirkey, on Saturday filed another application with Jharkhand high court, seeking order to quash the state government’s recent notification through which a one-man enquiry commission was constituted to probe into his daughter’s death.Oraon’s move came within 24 hours of him meeting chief minister Hemant Soren. Oraon, along with Congress’ Mandar legislator Bandhu Tirkey, met the chief minister on Friday seeking CBI probe into his daughter’s death.Tirkey (26), who was a sub-inspector posted at Sahibganj women’s police station, was found hanging inside her official quarter at police line on May 3 night. According to police investigation made so far, Tirkey’s friend and sub-inspector Shiv Kumar Kanaujia allegedly harassed her, which led to her death by suicide. Kanaujia has been arrested in this case.However, Tirkey’s father has repeatedly raised serious suspicions over police’s “death by suicide” theory, alleging that her daughter was murdered. He has also gone as far as to claim that some people closely connected with those in corridors of power were involved in the “murder”. He doubted role of one Pankaj Mishra, a representative of local MLA.Making the same demanding of probe by the central agency into his daughter’s death, Oraon earlier filed a criminal writ petition in the high court. Jharkhand’s main opposition party BJP, and some social-tribal organisations have also supported Oraon’s demand. A BJP delegation also met Governor Draupadi Murmu early this week in this regard.Meanwhile, the state government on June 8 issued a notification appointing a one-man commission headed by Justice (retired) BK Gupta to inquire into all allegations and counter allegations and other issues related to Tirkey’s death.Filing an interlocutory application (IA) in his recent criminal writ petition, Oraon urged the court to set aside the government’s notification through which a one-man commission was appointed.He submitted that the commission, that was appointed under Commission of Enquiry Act, 1952, will not be able to investigate into a murder case, as the complete probe involves collection of evidences, verification of call records, raids and arrest of accused persons and many other aspects.Demanding a CBI probe, he stated that there was a huge difference between the commission and the CBI. “The commission can only work as per the terms of reference set by the government, but the CBI is independent,” Oraon said.He pointed out that the commission was given six months’ time to complete its inquiry, but non-institution of CBI probe for such a long period will lead to destruction of evidences. “If the government is really serious to bring out the truth, it should have referred the case to the CBI,” Oraon’s lawyer Rajiv Kumar said, while confirming filing of the above IA. He added, “As per legal provision, the commission’s recommendations are not binding to the government.”Oraon, in his criminal writ petition, has also stated that his daughter was killed and hanged by the accused. He alleged that his daughter was harassed by some of her colleagues at the instance of Mishra, and another person Dahu Yadav. Oraon alleged that going against Mishra’s wishes, her daughter refused to manage some of the cases pending before her. This led to her murder, he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/dead-female-cop-s-father-challenges-judicial-probe-101623515373508.html

The court had sought to know why there were multiple official websites for data on births and deaths offering different figures.“I am new to the department and the review has so far not been done at my level, but now I will do it on a priority basis to ensure how it could be done in a better way and to the satisfaction of the court,” he told the bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Sanjay Kumar which is hearing the matter.Subhani also said that he had talked to the additional chief secretary of the panchayati raj department and the principal secretary of the urban development department and both the departments were not maintaining any portal regarding birth and death registration and that the only portal for it was the centralised Civil Registration System (CSR) of the Registrar General of India, which has limited viewing option. “It also publishes a statistical report on the registered births and deaths during the year at such intervals and in such form as may be prescribed,” he added.Advocate general Lalit Kishore said it was the duty of the family to inform the authorities concerned about any birth and death on the basis of which data compilation is done. “The compilation of revised figures was done through a special drive ordered by the chief secretary in the light of the court order,” he said.Citing the provisions under the birth & death registration act, Bihar municipal Act and the Bihar panchayati raj Act, the AG said the designated registrar was just responsible for documenting the information given by the family regarding birth and death. “There is no provision in the legislation that makes it mandatory for public functionaries to go and collect data moving from house to house or village to village. It is the applicant who has to file an application in prescribed format for registration. The hospitals and some other institutions have also been authorised to issue certificates,” he said.However, amicus curiae Mrigank Mauli and Parul Prasad asked how could the state arrive at death figures if many families could not even apply for registrations and if the state was under no obligation to compile the data.The bench said what was important was the spirit of the Act, which delegates authority for registration right up to the level of panchayat and make compulsory registration of every birth and death. “Many people may have applied for death certificates but not got it so far. If the deaths took place at home, who reported this? During the pandemic, it is the duty of the public representatives to report to the authorities concerned with regard to deaths, as they happen to be closest to the people of the area. The government should on its own display it in digital era,” it said.The bench also cited “duty of certain persons to notify births and deaths and to certify cause of death”, as laid down in the Act. “It is the need of the hour that transparency is maintained and information is disseminated. In the digital era, can Bihar not modify rules for the sake of the people? We are not to legislate, but we will say this is a 1969 Act and we are in 2021,” it said.The AG said while the government was doing its job, a perception was being built in the media that it was hiding figures. “The fact is that after Bihar, other states are also going in for verification of data. It was an eye opener for other states,” he said. However, the chief justice said the media was doing its job and reiterated the need for transparency in dissemination of information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-to-review-system-for-death-data-complication-101623515372871.html

The incident came to light late Friday evening when the authorities were shifting 41 inmates from the home to Bal Kalyan Ashram in Patamda.“Thirty eight inmates have been shifted to Bal Kalyan Ashram in Patamda from the MTWT in Kharanghjar under Telco PS last evening (Friday). It came to notice that two inmates were missing. An investigation is underway in the matter,” said Parameshwar Bhagat, Jamshedpur deputy development commissioner (DDC).The two missing inmates hailed from Birsanagar and Ghatshila.Earlier, on June 5, two other girls were reported missing from the shelter home, which is run by Mother Teresa Welfare Trust (MTWT) NGO. The two tribal girls, aged 16 and 17, were later rescued by the police from Birsanagar on June 6 night, and a case was subsequently registered based on their allegations of sexual assault and torture at the home for the past four years.On June 7, a first information report (FIR) was lodged under Posco (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act and sections of the Indian Penal Code against Harpal Singh Thapar, director of the home, his wife Pushpa Rani Tirkey, the chairperson of East Singhbhum district child welfare committee (CWC), warden Geeta Singh, her son Aditya Singh, and another staff member Tony Singh.According to the MTWT’s list of inmates, the shelter home has 43 children, including 23 girls and 20 boys, all of whom are under the age of 18.MTWT has no links with Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity.Meanwhile, more questions marked the investigation after BJP district spokesperson Ankit Anand posted an October 2020 interview of Tirkey, where she told a local newspaper that the home had 55 inmates.“Pushpa Rani Tirkey had said in her interview published on October 24 last year that there were 55 children kept and taken care of at the MTWT in Kharanghjar. But she said there are now 43 inmates in MTWT in her press conference before fleeing from the city in the wake of sexual abuse case. I have requested the DC to probe if this is data mismatch or where 12 inmates vanished,” he said in the tweet.Jamshedpur ASP Kumar Gaurav said: “Nothing could be said conclusively till we get the final list of inmates from the Jamshedpur district Child Welfare Committee (CWC).” Accused Aditya Singh, too, is mentioned in one of the lists of inmates, he added.In a similar case at a shelter home in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur, which came to the fore three years ago, 12 people, including main accused Brajesh Thakur, were sentenced to life imprisonment in February 2020 by a Delhi court, which heard the case following orders from the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/38-mtwt-home-inmates-shifted-to-patamda-2-more-girls-missing-101623515311751.html
12-06-2021||Patna||Bihar plans leather hub at Kishanganj||As part of its push towards industrialisation, Bihar is set to come up with its own leather and textile policy and plans to develop Kishanganj as a hub of leather industry.Leather from Panjipada in Kishanganj is supplied across the country and exported as well. Establishment of industries and employment generation were key promises made by parties during assembly elections held in 2020.After the NDA returned to power in the state in November last year, the State Investment Promotion Board (SIPB) has given stage 1 clearance to a total 200 units, involving a total investment of ₹6,197 crore, in the state. Of these, 98 units involving investment of ₹4616.42 crore (74% of the total) are from food processing sector. The state’s industry department has already come out of its own ethanol and oxygen production policy. Bihar’s industry minister Syed Shahnawaz Hussain is sure the state will turn a corner sooner than later. “Another 200 units with an investment potential of over ₹3,000 crore will be taken up in the next meeting of SIPB,” he said. On the planned leather hub in KIshanganj, Hussain said, “From Kishanganj, the best leather goes to the country and abroad. Work is going on at a brisk pace towards setting up a hub for leather processing units, which will pose a challenge to leather goods from neighbouring Bangladesh,” he said.Barring four districts of Arwal, Lakhisarai, Sheikhpura and Sheohar, all the remaining 34 districts of the state have got investment proposals. Muzaffarpur, where a food park is coming up, has got investment proposals of ₹1,088 crore for 18 units. “The food park, which was sanctioned on 78 acres of land, has been extended by additional 48 acres by the government of Bihar,” said Hussain. “Haldiram Bhujiawala has submitted proposal to become anchor investor in the park which has already been given Stage-1 clearance by SIPB,” said the minister. Industry department sources said that besides Haldiram, several major national players have expressed interest to set up their units within the park. The capital city, Patna, has got stage 1 SIPB clearance for 49 units with a proposed investment of ₹818 crore, while the industrial town of Begusarai has got a proposal of ₹1,053 crore for nine units, of which two units are of ethanol worth ₹495 crore. A total of 16 units of ethanol, with a proposed investment of ₹3,110 crore, have been cleared in the first phase. “Chief minister Nitish Kumar had first made a request for making ethanol directly from maize and sugarcane in 2007. We are happy the Centre had eventually given its nod,” said the minister. Hussain said Bihar, which produces 12,000 crore litres of ethanol each year and is the fifth-largest ethanol-producing state in the country, was expected to produce 50,000 crore litres every year after proposals for 20 new ethanol units were realised. The minister said the state government will give 10 per cent subsidy for opening each unit. The state government is also eyeing to use the services of migrants who had expertise in textile sector and ceramic field.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-plans-leather-hub-at-kishanganj-101623515311188.html

The beneficiaries under PMAY(rural), which is fully funded by the Centre, are selected under 13 parameters and are mainly those who have no pucca houses. A total of 32 lakh new households have been included in the list revised over the last few years.“We expect to sanction 10 lakh homes to selected beneficiaries by July and work would start on these units in next few months. This will boost rural economy in a big way,” said Arvind Choudhary, principal secretary, rural development department. He said allotment of new units would be in addition to around 7 lakh houses already under construction, which have been allotted to beneficiaries under permanent waiting list ( PWL).He said the department is hoping to release at least two instalments worth ₹80,000 to each of the household whose unit is sanctioned for this fiscal to start the constriction of affordable houses on ground. “We are hoping to sanction at least 10 lakh houses out of targeted 11.49 lakh this year,” said Choudhary. This means the government would be releasing ₹8,000 crore to kick-start construction work on 10 lakh units this fiscal.“This will give a big impetus to the construction sector and employment of labour to boost the rural economy,” said Rajesh Parimal, deputy secretary, rural development department.Similarly, the state’s urban development department has got approval for 6,739 new units under PMAY (Urban), a senior official said. Under this scheme, ₹2 lakh is released to beneficiaries for constructing pucca houses in municipal limits of 142 municipal bodies in the state.However, the record of construction of PMAY(U) units does not make for a good reading. Sources said a total 3.37 lakh units are still pending against the total sanctioned units over the past five years. Around 42,000 houses under the scheme are in different stages of completion. “The lockdown due to Covid and restrictions have had an adverse impact on construction activity for the last two years. But we are trying to speed up the construction work,” said, a senior official in the UDD who is engaged in implementing the scheme. Anand Kishore, principal secretary, urban development department, could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/central-nod-for-11-49-lakh-rural-houses-set-to-boost-construction-in-bihar-101623515191227.html

While around 78,000 people are in the 45-59 age group, 41,413 are aged between 18 and 44, who were the last to become eligible for vaccination. The remaining beneficiaries are health care and other frontline workers. Similarly, in Charkhi Dadri, senior citizens lead with 67,000 inoculations, followed by 53,000 in the 45-59 age group and 35,800 in the 18-44 age group. In all, 1.65 lakh beneficiaries have been covered so far.Jhajjar immunisation officer Dr Sanjeev Malik said they have achieved 65% vaccination target among senior citizens, while it stands at 40% in the 45-59 age segment and less than 15% in the youngest category.“Our main focus is to inoculate more people above 45 years of age, but people are not turning up to get vaccinated in rural areas. Illiteracy, hesitancy and lack of awareness about the virus are the reasons. Response among the youngest age group has been poor too,” said Malik, adding that special vaccination drives have been conducted at Bahadurgarh and Beri, in which more than 450 people were jabbed in three days.Charkhi Dadri immunisation officer Dr Ashish Mann said they have set a target to inoculate 1.33 lakh people above the age of 45, of which 1.20 lakh (90%) have already been jabbed.Younger group catching up fast in JindMeanwhile, in Jind, beneficiaries in the 45-59 age group have pipped the seniors, while the youngest category is also catching up fast.As compared to 64,692 senior citizens, around 49,000 people have got the jab in the 18-45 age group and 65,692 in the 45-59 age group. Immunisation officer Dr Navneet Singh said they are now focusing more on the younger age group, as it can motivate the elders to get vaccinated too.“The number of those jabbed in this age group might be the lowest, but it was achieved in the shortest period of time as compared to the other groups. The numbers will rise fast as we are planning to start on-the-spot registration and vaccination facility for this age group from Monday,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vaccination-seniors-lead-in-haryana-s-jhajjar-charkhi-dadri-districts-101623515132489.html

Allies should get due respect in a coalition,” he told reporters in Patna. At present, JD(U) has no representation in the union cabinet. In the 2019 parliamentary polls, JD(U) won 16 seats in Bihar while ally BJP had won 17 seats. Six seats were won by the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) of Ram Vilas Paswan while one went to the Congress.Kumar’s party, however, did not join the union cabinet, apparently unhappy over being offered just a “token representation”.Currently, there are five union ministers from Bihar, all from BJP. LJP patriarch Ram Vilas Paswan was also a minister till his death last year. JD(U) insiders said the party, which became the second largest constituent in the NDA at the Centre after the departure of 18-member strong Shiv Sena, could ask for three cabinet-rank berths and two ministers of state. Contenders include MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lallan Singh and party’s Rajya Sabha member Ramnath Thakur. However, a section of leaders in JD(U) said the decision to join the union cabinet would depend much on whether an offer is also made to LJP. “if LJP gets representation in the union cabinet, JD(U) might not join,” a senior leader, not wishing to be identified, said.LJP, now led by Jamui MP Chirag Paswan, had fielded 100 candidates in the Bihar Assembly elections last year. JD(U) has blamed the party for damaging its prospects severely. While BJP won 74 seats, JD(U) ended up with just 43. This was the first time in the state that JDU)’s tally was less than ally BJP. Since then, JD(U) and LJP have been at loggerheads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jdu-seeks-respectable-share-in-union-cabinet-101623515131277.html

The demarcation of inhabited rural areas will be done using drone surveying technology, which would help provide the record of rights to village household owners and in turn enable them to use their property as a financial asset for taking loans and other financial benefits from banks. Will procure 10 dronesFinancial commissioner, revenue, Sanjeev Kaushal said 10 unmanned aerial vehicles or drones would be procured by the state government for the scheme. “After the completion of this scheme, the villages will be lal dora-free,’’ he said.Kaushal said this scheme was first implemented in Haryana, and after considering its effectiveness, the central government took it up across the country. Regarding the demarcation on the state’s border with Uttar Pradesh, Kaushal said the work of installing pillars at 20 places on the border in Karnal will be completed by July 15. A meeting of the deputy commissioners of Panipat, Sonepat, Palwal, Faridabad and Karnal will be held in Karnal on June 16, in which they will visit the demarcation area along the border. Kaushal also directed the officers of Survey of India to prepare a strip map of the area bordering Uttar Pradesh and Delhi so that disputes could be settled at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-to-complete-village-mapping-in-90-days-101623515073071.html

The CM was responding to SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur’s statement about not getting state government’s sanction for the solar plant that would supply power to the Golden Temple. A government spokesperson said that in a meeting held earlier this week, the power department had also pledged complete support to the project.“United Sikh Mission, a US-based organisation, had sought permission to set up a solar plant of 2 MW, about 10km from the Golden Temple. The government had no objection and the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) had given in-principle approval,” the spokesperson added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fully-support-solar-power-plant-for-golden-temple-amarinder-101623514411830.html

Denizens step up to assist house helps to get the jab||From convincing their house helps to get Covid-19 vaccine, to booking a slot for them on the mobile app, and even driving them down to the vaccination centre — residents of Delhi-NCR are doing it all to aid their house helps and staff fight Covid-19 with the help of Covid shots. Ritesh Gandotra, an MNC professional residing in Vasant Kunj, says his driver’s younger child was born during the lockdown last year, and it was imperative to ensure that his driver’s entire family is safe especially after the second wave of Covid-19. “We got him and his wife vaccinated even before us as he is usually more exposed to the outside world. This was no charity as he is our man! Unfortunately, our house help moved to her village with family without waiting for vaccination. Trying to see if she can get it there. And our cook is completely against getting vaccination. No amount of convincing has been able to make her change her mind so far, but we’re trying our best,” he says. A Delhi-based home chef, Ragini Saxena recently got her house help vaccinated, and opines that the means to book a slot has many hurdles, and therefore one must step up to help their staff. She says, “It’s something that everyone of us should take of. An initiative is needed for at least our house helps, as they are not so well educated to understand the necessity to get vaccinated, and alongside also don’t have the required resources to book themselves for a vaccine slot online. If each one of us helps at least two such domestic helps around us, the burden to vaccinate everyone will lessen from the government’s shoulders, and we’ll all be much safer in the near future.”Some are providing monetary assistance to their domestic helps, to resolve their financial crunch that’s making many opt out of the run to get vaccinated. Take for instance, Anuja Rastogi, who works in the retail industry, and says, “The first jab for one of our houses helps and our driver was done in our condominium, for which we paid ₹250. And for the second dose, I willingly registered them, and even helped in finding an appointment that took some time. This required me to drive all the way to Chhattarpur, from Gurugram, and waiting there for three hours to get it done. For my other house help, I registered on the mobile app and paid ₹1,100 to get her the first dose, and I will support her for the second dosage as well. This is the need of the hour, and no questions asked! For all of us to be safe, our house helps must stay safe first, especially since they continue to risk so much for us. This is one way to pay it forward.”Gurugrammer Shilpi Singh, a leadership coach, adds that it’s also one’s “responsibility” to do so. “Every person needs to be vaccinated. Hence, it’s our responsibility to ensure that not just our family members, but also those employed with us as our domestic staff are vaccinated well in time. Some of them may not find the process easy, therefore we need to extend help to them and if needed shouldn’t shy away from bearing the cost for the same.”Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/short-of-help-denizens-step-up-to-assist-house-helps-to-get-the-jab-101623514232430.html

Seeking that all Covid-related goods must not attract any tax during the pandemic, Manpreet, along with other finance ministers representing Congress, vehemently opposed the imposition of GST on Covid related items at this time of a national crisis, and recorded their note of dissent. The other alternative is to charge 0.1%, which is well within the powers of the GST Council, and this measure should be in place till the pandemic is over. Releasing his remarks and interventions made at the 44th meeting of the GST Council, Manpreet urged the ruling regime to include Congress representatives in the Group of Ministers (GOM). “It is preposterous that the principal opposition party of India in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha has been excluded from the GoM,” said Manpreet, adding that the vice-chairperson of the GST Council must be appointed. He regretted that the GoM is not acting with compassion, and it is parroting the Centre, perhaps out of the fear that they may not be included in a future GoM. Manpreet reminded the GoM that health care services, including all recognised systems of medicine (allopathy, Ayurveda, Unani, Homoeopathy, Yoga), are already exempt under the GST. The supply of medicine that is a part of the treatment package is also exempt since the entire transaction is considered a service. He criticised the discussion for restricting GST on government hospitals versus private hospitals stating that both treat the people of India. The idea that we need GST registration and billing and later file returns are farcical. What would a consumer feel seeing GST reflected on an invoice, the Punjab Finance Minister asked? He cautioned that the attempt to pick and choose exemptions on the grounds of inverted duty structure or cheaper imports would end up destroying the very foundation of the GST system. Finally, Manpreet said that Covid-19 related exemptions should not be over by August 31, 2021. Is Covid going to be over by then, he asked? “We need to have a more realistic and reasonable time frame and one which is based on compassion,” Manpreet said at the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/exempt-covid-related-items-from-tax-manpreet-tells-gst-council-101623512731682.html

Sarpanches and farm union leaders claim that Punjabis had been defamed as drug addicts, however, they were fighting for their rights and the farm agitation had led to drastic changes in their lifestyle. Panchayats of Matran; Balad Kothi; Dittupura; Masani; Sheron; Sangatpura; Sajuma, Turi, Sakraudi, Harditpura, Changaliwala, Gaga, Arakwas and a few wards of Lehra town have passed these resolutions. They declare that were free of the ‘Udta Punjab’ stigma, with the key slogan being ‘Nobody sells drugs, no one consumes’. Jiwan Singh, 42, husband of Daljit Kaur, sarpanch Sakraudi near Bhawanigarh, said people of the state were fighting two wars. “People of the state are fighting against the ‘black laws’ as well as drugs. The farm protest has united the youth, with even drug addicts wanting to participate. No one is consuming any type of drugs in our village,” he added.Sangrur block chief of BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) Gobinder Singh said their stir had motivated youth and women. “If 50 youngsters were taking drugs previously, now 25 have quit the habit and the others are trying. The youth is with us. The number of farmer suicides had deceased and women are massively participating in protests,” added Gobinder Singh.Jagjit Singh, 33, husband of Virpal Kaur sarpanch Sangatpura village, said, “Youngsters hailing from dalit community are into construction work and the boys of Jatt are Gursikh. These youths are not consuming drugs.”Model town number 1 sarpanch, Gurcharan Singh, said, “Residents of village had faith in the local dera and Sikhism, which protected them. There is no one who consumes Chitta in the village. Young used to spend their time in sports and religious practice,” he added. Sangrur SP (Punjab Bureau of Investigation) Gurpreet Singh said 20-odd villages had passed a resolution against the drug menace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farm-agitation-faith-spur-20-sangrur-villages-to-shun-drugs-101623511651645.html

As the work of a 24x7 water project is ongoing in the city, many city roads are dug for laying the water pipelines. Mainly the roads in the city’s central area Laxmi road, Bajirao road and internal roads have been dug up for the ambitious project. As Covid -19 cases came down, the district administration and the municipal administration unlocked the city and allowed shops to remain open. After unlocking, the traffic on city roads increased and citizens suffered a lot due to road works. Leader of the house in the PMC Ganesh Bidkar called a meeting with all officers and engineers and instructed that they should ensure that road works should speed up. Bidkar said, “It is true that the citizens are suffering due to road works but at the same time it is also important to execute the water pipeline project. Many pipelines are old. The water pipeline on Bajirao road and Kumtekar road were laid in the year 1975. Most of the work was carried out during the lockdown. Citizens should bear some trouble by considering the importance of the water project.

They ask me whether I will leave Badami and contest from Chamarajpet during the next election," the leader of opposition in the legislature assembly said. Speaking at an event in Chamarajpet, he said it is Zameer Ahmed Khan's (Congress MLA) generosity that he is asking me to contest the election from the constituency he represents. "As of now I will contest the election from Badami itself... it is important that Zameer Ahmed Khan should win (the next election) and should be in the government," Siddarmaiah said, even as Khan and those present at the event demanded that he contest from Chamarajpet. As people present at the event on Khan's insistence shouted that the former chief minister should contest from Chamarajpet, Siddaramaiah said, "... let's see later," and heaped praise on the MLA for his service to the constituency and people in need. Making it clear that he will be contesting the 2023 assembly elections, the Congress legislature party leader had recently said no decision has been taken yet on the constituency. There has been speculation within the party circles for some time now that Siddaramaiah, who represents Badami in north Karnataka, may come back to his home turf of the old Mysuru region or somewhere in Bengaluru for the next election. His loyalist and party's Chamarajpet legislator B Z Zameer Ahmed Khan has even offered to vacate the constituency for him. The Chamarajpet segment in the city has a sizeable minority population. Siddaramaiah has already announced that he will not contest again from Chamundeshwari assembly constituency in Mysuru, where he had tasted defeat during the May 2018 assembly polls. Siddaramaiah, the then sitting Chief Minister, had lost in Chamundeshwari to JD(S) G T Deve Gowda by a margin of over 36,042 votes. He, however, won Badami, the other constituency from where he had contested. Making his debut in the Assembly in 1983, Siddaramaiah was elected from Chamundeshwari on a Lok Dal Party ticket. He has won five times from this constituency and tasted defeat thrice. After neighbouring Varuna became a constituency in 2008 following delimitation, Siddaramaiah represented it till he vacated the seat for his son Dr Yatindra in the 2018 assembly polls and went back to his old constituency of Chamundeshwari. Ahead of the May 2018 assembly polls, Siddaramaiah had said it would "most likely" be his last election. Earlier, during the 2013 assembly polls too, he had said that it was his last election and went on to become chief minister after the polls. It is no secret that Siddaramaiah is nursing his ambition to become chief minister for a second term if the party wins the next assembly polls in 2023, and his loyalists like Khan have already started to openly pitch for him as the next CM candidate. This could come in the way of State Congress president D K Shivakumar's ambitions, as he too is said to be eyeing to become the Chief Minister, with some of his supporters too already batting in favour of him for the coveted post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/siddaramaiah-drops-hints-on-contesting-2023-assembly-polls-from-badami-101623504976686.html

One of the world’s largest religious gatherings, the Kumbh was held in the state from April 1 to 30, and the notified Kumbh area covered various places in Haridwar, Dehradun and Tehri districts. A committee headed by Chief Development Officer Saurabh Gaharwar has been constituted to look into the allegations and submit a report within 15 days, Haridwar District Magistrate C Ravishankar said on Saturday. Payment to all labs which had been assigned the responsibility of conducting tests -- RT-PCR and rapid antigen -- during the Kumbh has been withheld for the time being due to the ongoing investigation, he said. A detailed probe was ordered by the Haridwar administration after preliminary investigations revealed that many private labs roped in by the district health department issued fake Covid test reports in the name of random people on the basis of their identity cards and phone numbers. Preliminary investigations into the alleged irregularities had been conducted by Chief Controlling Officer of Covid Cases Abhishek Tripathi, who recommended a detailed probe into the matter. It is suspected that more than one lakh such test results had been issued by the private labs, sources in the health department said. The labs apparently did so to meet the daily testing quota of 50,000 tests set by the Uttarakhand High Court during the Kumbh, the sources said. Twenty-two private labs had been hired for the purpose by the district health department to conduct testing during the festival. When contacted Haridwar's Chief Medical Officer, S K Jha, said, "Kumbh area extends up to Rishikesh.

However, he cautioned that the chances of a third wave are "quite real", and "if it happens, Delhi has to again fight together"."We cannot afford to sit idle and our government is preparing on a war-footing to combat it," he said.He also underlined the need for expanding the vaccination drive to fight the pandemic, saying, "Our vaccination program has been running successfully. The shortage of vaccines is still a problem, but our 'Jahan Vote, Wahan Vaccination' (vaccination at polling booths) is a success."What was the second wave for the country during April and May this year was the fourth for Delhi as the city had already battled three waves till November 2020, Kejriwal said.Doctors, nurses, paramedic staff, sanitation workers, and others played a huge role in the fight against the virus, he said, adding, "I know many doctors who did not go home for days. I want to thank them on behalf of the people of Delhi."The chief minister underlined that the number of peak cases in a day in the first wave was about 4,500 which escalated to over 28,000 in the fourth.He said Delhi witnessed a huge shortage of oxygen during the fourth wave as Delhi is not an industrial state and doesn't have its own source of production of oxygen.Delhi needs 150-200 MT of medical oxygen for non-Covid purposes, apart from some amount of industrial oxygen. This requirement rose to 700 MT during the fourth wave, he said.Delhi saw a massive crisis of medical oxygen supply during mid-April to early May period, when several hospitals issued SOS for oxygen.Many deaths were attributed to this scarcity, and the Delhi government has already formed a committee of experts to examine and ascertain if those fatalities were indeed caused by the scarcity of the life-saving gas."We didn't have the means of production or even tankers to procure oxygen from states like Haryana and Uttar Pradesh on the directions of the Central government. Now, we have to be fully prepared," Kejriwal said.He mentioned that on Thursday he had inaugurated three storage tanks of 57 MT each, along with oxygen tanks of 13.5 MT each.A total of 27 PSA oxygen plants, including the 22 inaugurated Saturday, have been made operational in Delhi. Apart from these, six plants have already been started by the Central government and seven are going to begin soon, the chief minister said.Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain said that of the total PSA plants opened Saturday, 17 have been given by HCL Technologies and four by Maruti Udyog. HCL will be supplying five more plants soon, he said.HCL Technologies Chairperson Roshni Nadar and the heads of various city government-run hospitals took part in the event.The hospitals where these plants have been installed include Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital, Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, Deep Chand Bandhu Hospital, and Babasaheb Ambedkar Hospital.All these hospitals have a capacity of 9,500 LPM (litres per minute). This means, 1,000 beds daily will be able to receive oxygen from within the hospital itself, Jain said."This will let us be independent." he said, adding many plants are the pipeline."We are working on a war-footing to equip ourselves for the third wave especially on the front of oxygen availability, which was a crisis that we faced in the second wave," Jain said.HCL Technologies’ Roshni Nadar said, "HCL is contributing 21 ready-to-install Oxygen plants, imported from France, and 17 of these have already been installed across seven hospitals in Delhi. The remaining four have also arrived and will be installed over the next few days".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/third-covid-wave-chances-real-delhi-govt-preparing-on-war-footing-kejriwal-101623503350847.html

12-06-2021||Pune||Startup mantra: Noccarc turns Covid crisis into opportunity in med-tech||PUNE Noccarc is not claiming it helped alleviate the ventilator crisis in Pune and Maharashtra. At least, not yet.However, the fact is , as Pune’s struggled with ensuring enough ventilators for Covid-19 patients, especially during the first wave of Covid-19 infections in 2020, IIT Kanpur alumni Nikhil Kurele and Harshit Rathore, founders of Noccarc stepped in.Says Kurele, “Opportunities need to be created. In a population of 1.3 billion there are lot of opportunities. In the first wave we manufactured the ventilators. In the second wave, we delivered the ventilators. When we say, delivered the ventilators, those are not normal numbers. We delivered close to 2,700 ventilators in just 50 days. There are certain Covid Care centres in Pune where all the ventilators are provided by Noccarc. These are the kind of changes we are able to create.”Ventilators were not Noccarc’s original product line. In a classic case of market demand forcing a startup to pivot, the firm’s original avatar was a clean-tech startup. In fact even the name, Noccarc evolved on the steep learning curve, the founders were ascending, in a hurry.Says Kurele, “We did not want a name that sounded Indian. Nocca Robotics was the name of our startup initially. We hadn’t registered then, but we also got a legal notice from a MNC company. So, we decided to change the name. The new name was Noccarc. The first waterless solar panel cleaning robot which we designed, was in a room inside our campus, but then we realised we could not take it out. So, we had to dismantle and reassemble it.”In the beginning…Nikhil Kurele is originally from Shahdol village in Madhya Pradesh while Rathore is from Kanpur. The duo used to stay in same hostel and participated in events of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) club. “Harshit was interning at Tata Motors and I was with Tata Technologies. We had seen the industry from very close quarters. WWe listed some ideas which would come to India in five years’ time,” recalls Kurele.“We ran our startup for two years (2017 – 18) at the SIIC incubation centre of IIT Kanpur. We didn’t want to rush to market. We were confident that the solar panel-cleaning robot market would grow and be as good as the automobile market. There are several players who have entered the market since, but when we started, it was only us. In Pune itself, there are now six companies working on this concept. However, eye for detailing is the differentiating factor,” Nikhil said. Pune pivotKurele says, “In 2019, we shifted to Pune to scale the solar panel cleaning product. I had worked for Bajaj in Pune for eight months, so I knew the city very well. Apart from this, there are multiple other reasons for selecting Pune as our HQ. Firstly, Pune is not very costly and second, the attrition rate is very low. Three others joined our team. We had then raised funds from the Indian Angel Network, after which, our team size increased to 21.” Then, in March 2020, the Covid-19 outbreak hit. The solar panel cleaning project stopped. A pivot beckoned.“We had never seen a ventilator before making one. These things are science based and we had expertise with control motors. So, we could make our working model in 48 hours and when we got our factory permission, we made it in 12 hours,” Kurele adds.Team buildingKurele says, “When the second wave hit, we knew that the people working with us are from Pune. For two consecutive months we paid them a 2x salary for the same work. We have given a 3x bonus in addition to the salary to employees working on the ventilator project. Our manufacturing capacity was 30 per day, but our team took it to 100 per day. These are some small steps we used try to make an impact, not just outside, but also inside our organisation. “The culture which we have on our premises is something that creates positive vibes. Dr Saurabh Srivastava, a Padmashree awardee and co-founder and chair of institutions like Nasscom, Indian Venture Capital Association, TiE, New Delhi NCR and Indian Angel Network, mentored us to build this culture in the organisation.”Pandemic experienceIn the first wave period, Noccarc sold only 300 ventilators. Says Kurele, “We had confidence in our product and had established an assembly line. We moved into a Bhosari facility in October 2020. We knew that there is a market that will respect value. Now, we have started a 24x7 call centre for our ventilator products. We have displayed our number on the machine itself so, if any doctor or hospital has a complaint with the product s/he can call us directly. Our idea is not to just sell product, but to create value.” “The beauty of the machine lies in its compactness and how well it delivers the parameters (true and accurate). The kind of accuracy which we have achieved in this price range is also one of the differentiating factors. Another important achievement is that we have been able to give access to ventilators in tier 2 and tier 3 cities – where hospitals, doctors and patients were not able to get them,” he adds.Preparing for the third waveNarrating his experience during the second wave of pandemic in India, Kurele says, “Desperation was very high in the second wave infection period. People thought they were prepared for the second wave, but when it actually hit, it was really bad. It was more lethal. Our entire ventilator range, including paediatric, will be available soon. We will actually make healthcare affordable.”Future plansNoccarc is currently working on four products for the ICUs, slated to be ready the in next two quarters. Kurele says, “We will have 5,000 ventilators installed all over India. It will be five per cent of the total ventilators installed in India. It’s a big number that we have achieved in just one year in the critical care sector. We don’t want to disturb the market unnecessarily. We want to make a profit since we are in business, but we don’t want to do profiteering.”Apart from the ICU products, Noccarc will be getting into high-end ventilators and transportation care. “There is deep thought which goes into each and every product. We also want to have continuous development of our products. Besides, we are also entering the automobile industry. A new factory setup will be installed in Pune closer to Hinjewadi. On the other hand, we will resume the solar panel cleaning projects in Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat,” adds Kurele.Inside out“The ventilator project was the hard work and ingenuity of the two innovators, who had never even seen an ICU ventilator before this. I hope that their story will inspire entrepreneurs and innovators to transform the Indian manufacturing industry and put it on par with global standards.” says professor Amitabha Bandyopadhyay, incubation & innovation, IIT Kanpur||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/startup-mantra-noccarc-turns-covid-crisis-into-opportunity-in-medtech-101623497372512.html

Still, study circles and libraries play a major role in students lives in Pune and we are happy to return,” said she said.There are around 2,500 small and big study circles and libraries in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad area.Students from across the state and even from other states, come to Pune for studying and doing preparation for various competitive exams. There are various facilities available at these libraries right from air condition, separate desk, Wi-Fi and many more. So students prefer to go and study in this silent and peaceful environment for studying.“The decision taken by the state government today is welcomed and it will give much-needed relief to several library and study circle owners in the city. Due to both the lockdowns hundreds of libraries shut down, there was no money left to pay the rents and even students were not coming to Pune due to fear of Covid-19. Now, we hope that the situation improves and students return to the city,” said Ajaiz Shaikh, president of the Abhyasika Owners Association Maharashtra Rajya, who also is the owner of ‘Readers club’ study circle in Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/students-heave-a-sigh-of-relief-as-libraries-in-pune-city-can-reopen-with-50-capacity-from-june-14-101623496530769.html

The department has also asked to ensure that all the units are manned with sufficient experts.The state government has asked the district administration to ensure that all the special newborn care unit (SNCU), neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), High Dependency Unit for Children (HDU), mother newborn care unit (MNCU) and Paediatric Intensive Care Unit are structurally stable and that all the necessary repair works have been undertaken.The health department has also asked to increase more beds for paediatric care and to ensure that all the beds are connected to a central oxygen system.Dr Ashok Nandapurkar, a civil surgeon who is responsible for this said, “We have been asked to submit a google sheet report of all the paediatric hospitals which could be used if the third wave comes at all.”“We need to ensure that the hospitals have beds and treatment facilities for the newborns as well as that they can diagnose, treat and even provide telemedicine if needed. The hospital must be manned with experts and also nurses and health officials who can treat paediatric patients,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/paediatric-health-care-revamped-in-pune-in-anticipation-of-third-covid-wave-101623496350650.html
12-06-2021||Pune||‘Positive about international airport in Purandar, paperwork completed’: Ajit Pawar||Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar has put the ball in the Center’s court regarding the progress of the proposed international airport to be built in Pune district, HT has learnt.“We have completed the paperwork in terms of Purandar airport and have sent it to the Center. The state government is positive about this project,” Pawar said in Pune on Friday. By saying this Pawar hinted that now it’s up to the Center to give a green signal to the pending project.In February 2021, Pawar had said that a report had been submitted to the Central government regarding the new site for Purandar airport. The originally proposed site for the Pune International Airport was changed because of the opposition from the villagers in Purandar Tehsil. Then a revised proposal, with the change in the location site, was submitted to the Center for approval.But the opposition emerged for the new site as well. Even if the Center gives a go-ahead, the land acquisition process will not be a cakewalk for the administration.Speaking on the resistance from the locals during the land acquisition process for the developmental infrastructure projects, Pawar said that the rates of compensation money have been increased now and dialogue with the locals is essential.“Infrastructure projects, such as the construction of airports, ring roads, dams, face opposition from some locals. This phenomenon is not recent. Dialogue is the key in such situations. Earlier, the land compensation was very less. Now, the compensation is four times that of ready reckoner. If you get four times compensation for your land, you can buy land elsewhere,” said Pawar.A stiff resistance has also been encountered by the officials in the land acquisition process for the western part of Ring Road to be constructed by Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC).Commenting on this Pawar said that the Ring Road is necessary considering the need of Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad cities. “I personally believe that the Ring Road is necessary for PMC, PCMC, and the district’s population. If we consider the traffic in Pune city and suburbs, then the ring road is planned by thinking for the next 50 years. The benefits of this project have to be explained to the affected people. It will be discussed with them. If someone is losing the agricultural land, then more compensation can be given,” Pawar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/positive-about-international-airport-in-purandar-paperwork-completed-ajit-pawar-101623496110765.html
12-06-2021||Pune||Pune dist administration to vaccinate pregnant women with flu shots||To avoid another endemic and seasonal illness amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, the state government is now pushing the district administration to vaccinate pregnant women and those more vulnerable with the influenza (flu) vaccine. The influenza vaccine or the vaccine against Swine flu (H1N1) is proven to work effectively against respiratory illness including not just swine flu but also viruses like H3N2 and influenza B viruses.The state family welfare department has issued a notice to all district health offices to ensure that the vulnerable age groups, including pregnant women, those suffering from high blood pressure and diabetes and frontline workers attending to flu patients. Given this, the Pune administration has received over 9,000 influenza vaccines to vaccinate pregnant women.Dr Suhash Salunkhe, who is the technical advisor against Covid-19 to state, said, “Maharashtra is the only state in the country which has included influenza vaccine as part of the state routine immunization programme.”“Last year we did conduct a study to find if there is any link between Covid-19 vaccine and influenza vaccine, however, we could not find any correlation. It is important to get vaccinated against influenza since it is a seasonal illness,” he said.Dr DN Patil state immunisation officer, said, “This is a common practice and to avoid the outbreak of other ailments even as we fight against Covid-19. Pregnant women, those suffering from high blood pressure and diabetes and also those who are treating influenza patients need to be vaccinated and this is done every year.”“We want to ensure that along with Covid-19 vaccination, all routine immunization programmes and the other seasonal immunisation programmes are conducted smoothly,” he said.Dr Vaishali Jadhav, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) assistant health officer, said, “We have received about 2,500 doses from the state and we have been asked to vaccinate pregnant women at our centres.”The rural administration and the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) have also received stocks of the H1N1 vaccine.In 2009 the city along with the state saw a major outbreak of the Swine flu epidemic during which too Pune was hit hard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-dist-administration-to-vaccinate-pregnant-women-with-flu-shots-101623495990685.html

With the formation of a low-pressure zone over the Bay of Bengal, and the resulting pressure gradient, westerly winds of increasing strength are likely to draw moisture over the Konkan coast.“Widespread rainfall activity with heavy to very heavy falls likely to continue over coastal & adjoining Ghats districts of Maharashtra and coastal Karnataka during 11th to 15th June, 2021,” the IMD stated in its press release on Friday. An offshore monsoon trough persists off the Konkan coast, along with a cyclonic circulation in the west-central Arabian Sea. There is another monsoon trough persisting from above the cyclonic circulation extending central parts of the Konkan region as well.Under the “push and pull” effect of the cyclonic circulation and the low-pressure zone in the Bay of Bengal, the monsoon troughs will dispense widespread rain and thundershowers over Mumbai, Thane, Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg.Mumbai received 107mm of rain in the 24 hours ending 8:30 am on Saturday, as per the AWS at Santacruz, of which 76.5mm was received after 5:30 pm on Friday.The total rainfall received by the city so far this June comes to 641mm, surpassing the season average of 505mm. This is also 459% more than the normal rainfall for the period between June 1 and June 12, which is 114.8mm, as per the IMD data.Over the next few hours, showers above the city are expected to intensify and remain heavy till at least Monday morning. With intermittent hours of relief, heavy rainfall also remains a strong possibility till at least Tuesday.

12-06-2021||Pune||Health experts in Pune warn against rampant reopening of public spaces||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), on Friday, announced ease in curbs from June 14. Under the new order, essential and non-essential shops will now remain open till 7 pm in the city, also malls will open up with 50 per cent capacity among other relaxations.The decision was taken by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar in a review meeting held at Council Hall, Pune.While the traders, shopkeepers and shop owners in malls are happy, health experts opine that such rampant reopening of public spaces could invite a severe third wave of Covid-19 and caution needs to be taken while stepping out in public places.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, chairman, Maharashtra Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Technical Committee, said, “In today’s meeting with deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar I have clearly said that unconditional permissions cannot be given to open up shops and other entities. There should be some restrictions and easing should be done in a phase-wise manner.”“While they are trying to bring the economic activity back on track, the safety of people should be the top priority amid a pandemic,” he said.“The current decline in the number of Covid-19 cases should be monitored daily. If we see plateauing in the number of Covid-19 cases that means we are heading for a situation where there would be a recurrence. And if the graph goes up then we are likely to experience a potential third wave. Considering this point, if everything is reopened in Pune then there should be some restrictions and conditions to remain and PMC should monitor it daily,” he added.The traders on the other hand are happy with the administration’s decision to allow non-essential shops to operate till 7 pm.“It is a welcome decision that shop timings are now extended till 7 pm,” said Fatechand Ranka, president of the Federation of Trade Association of Pune (FTAP).“Since the shops were allowed to operate till 4 pm there was hardly any business. Now due to this extended timings people returning home from work could do shopping on their way,” he said.“At the same time it is extremely important for all of us, to avoid crowding at marketplaces and follow all safety measures,” said Ranka.Mahesh M, chief executive officer of Creaticity Mall, said, “We are eager to open our gates on Monday. Home improvement is now a must-do and so we are all set in terms of choice of products, sanitized stores and spaces and of course a set of SOPS are in place.”“We are prepared to provide a safe and hygienic environment, well-prepared staff, warm and courteous as usual, tech aids to ensure contactless shopping, all of these are in place,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/health-experts-in-pune-warn-against-rampant-reopening-of-public-spaces-101623495691189.html
12-06-2021||Other||Central team finds irregularities in implementation of rural housing scheme in Odisha||A Union rural development ministry team, which visited Odisha in February, has found irregularities in the selection of beneficiaries and quality of construction under the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G).The team led by Gaya Prasad, the ministry’s deputy director-general, was sent for an inquiry after the state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged irregularities in the implementation of the scheme for concrete houses to every homeless poor in rural areas.The AwaasSoft portal showed the completion of the constructions of houses in some cases but that was not found to be the case on the ground. In other cases, houses were sanctioned to two members of a family. On several houses, PMAY-G logos were found to be missing.In a letter to Odisha chief secretary Suresh Mohapatra, Union rural development secretary Narendra Nath Sinha has suggested the money sanctioned to ineligible beneficiaries be recovered and cases against government officials for the lapses. “Action may be initiated against the BDOs (block development officers) and other supervisors who inspected and certified the works. Issue show cause to the district officials for not taking action on the matter,” Sinha wrote in his letter, a copy of which HT has seen.Mohapatra refused to comment on the letter. Ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) leaders said they were not aware of the letter and hence cannot comment. Sinha wrote the quality of construction noticed during the inspections was very poor. “The state is requested to take measures to improve the quality of the houses that have been inspected during the Inquiry and bring them to a liveable standard. The state must improve the system of both quality monitoring and administrative supervision for bringing significant improvements in the quality of houses under construction and of those inspected during the inspection. The state is advised to make an assessment of the quality of all the houses constructed so far and take steps for improvement.”The central team visited Odisha after a 67-year-old BJP leader in Cuttack was killed along with an associate allegedly by BJD workers in January for pointing to irregularities in the scheme. In April, the Centre objected to the use of the logo of the state’s Biju Pucca Ghar Yojana on the PMAY-G houses. BJP leader Lekhashree Samantsinghar said the central team has exposed the Odisha government’s “blatant corruption” in implementing PMAY. “From ghost beneficiaries to outright embezzlement, the list is long. Now BJD should not protect its leaders who are the conduits for such loot,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/central-team-finds-irregularities-in-implementation-of-rural-housing-scheme-in-odisha-101623495450638.html

The procession embarks from the pilgrim centres of Alandi and Dehu in Pune district and the pilgrims march through the day and rest at night, reaching Pandharpur after a fortnight.“Just like last year this year too the procession will be simple. My humble request to the leaders is to not politicise the issue. The safety of people is the top priority,” said Pawar.“Only ten prestigious palkhis in the state will be allowed to go to Pandharpur on Ashadhi Ekadashi, via Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) buses,” he said.“Last year too due to the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in the state, we had cancelled the procession,” he said.“This year also along with each procession only 40 warkaris will be allowed in the bus. Also, for the “Ringan” and “Rath” ceremony only ten warkaris will be allowed. For the Palkhi Prasthan ceremony from Dehu and Alandi 100 warkaris will be allowed inside the temple,” added Pawar.Vikas Dhage Patil, trustee of the Alandi temple committee, said, “Warkaris are always with the government and follow the orders, but it would have been good if we were allowed to carry out the procession this year. We hope that next year we can celebrate the wari with more enthusiasm.”Before the pandemic, annually more than three to four lakh warkaris join in several Dindis (group of warkaris) with the Sant Dnyaneshwar and Sant Tukaram Maharaj Palkhi which starts from Alandi and Dehu village respectively.There are around 250 registered Dindis (group of warkaris) who follow the palkhi on its way to Pandharpur and lakhs of warkaris walk in the processions. Dindis from across Maharashtra start coming to Alandi and Dehu a week before the starting day and then both the villages are crowded with warkaris.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/no-procession-in-pune-dist-this-year-palkhis-to-reach-pandharpur-by-bus-101623495272697.html

The decision was taken after a review of the spread of Covid-19 infection, recovery rate and requirement of medical oxygen across the state during the last week of May.As per an order issued by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry Department for Promotion of Industry and Industrial Trade Explosive Section on June 8, oxygen manufacturers and suppliers are now allowed to supply more quantities of oxygen to the industries, after ensuring the supply of medical oxygen on priority to the states/union territories. The state government is yet to take a decision.“During the review meeting on Friday we discussed the issue with deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. Since the medical intake of oxygen is declining, we will soon take a decision on how much amount now should be diverted to industries,” said Vijay Deshmukh, Pune additional collector.The small scale industries in Pimpri-Chinchwad, Bhosari and Chakan are facing a hard time as demand has increased after relaxation since June 1.“Unless the supply is increased, the suppliers will keep on selling oxygen cylinders at higher rates. It is the right time to divert the 50: 50 ratio of oxygen for medical and industrial use. The central government has passed the order accordingly. The government can get oxygen as per its need after oxygen is reserved for medical use. The state government is yet to make a decision,” said Sandip Belsare, president, Pimpri-Chinchwad small scale industries.Prashant Girbane, director-general, Mahratta Chamber of Commerce Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA), said, “The impact of the second wave of Covid-19 has significantly reduced. Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) alone shows an almost 85-90% reduction in the number of patients on oxygen support. Similarly, overall Maharashtra has also witnessed a significant reduction in the number of patients on oxygen support. So the allocation also should be done accordingly.”“ Thousands of units are facing an existential threat due to this disruption. It also has an impact on the loss of jobs for those working in small companies,” he said.“Currently, the demand for oxygen is coming down every day. Right now we need 160 metric tonnes of oxygen daily. It will reduce more in the coming days,” said Suresh Patil, joint commissioner, Food and Drug Administration.Arun Bajaj, an oxygen supplier from Bhosari said, “We are not able to give oxygen cylinders to all our clients as we are not getting an adequate supply. Once the government takes a decision, it will benefit the suppliers.”Medicinal use of oxygenMonths; quantity per dayApril; 350 metric tonnesMay; 250 metric tonnesJune; 160 metric tonnesSource: Food and Drug administration Pune||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/industries-in-pune-district-want-administration-to-restore-supply-of-oxygen-101623494970671.html

MHA is yet to respond to Roy’s request.Roy, who served as the BJP national vice-president before his departure, was provided with ‘Z' category security cover just ahead of the assembly elections in Bengal. As many as 22 CRPF personnel were deployed to guard him. In addition to that, around 4-5 National Security Guard (NSG) commandos, who specialise in providing securities to high-profile individuals in India, were also deployed.Roy’s security detail has garnered just as much attention as his political career. In 2017, he returned the ‘Z’ category security provided to him by the TMC-led West Bengal state government. Roy, then a TMC parliamentarian, said that after he came to know that he had been removed from the post of party (TMC) vice-president, he asked the state to take back the high-profile security cover.After joining the BJP in November of 2017 he was provided with ‘Y’ category security. He was assigned two personal security officers (PSOs), a static guard at his residence, and a total of 11 personnel of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).The 67-year-old politician, one of the founders of TMC, had switched allegiance to the BJP after being with his erstwhile party for over 19 years. Roy was initially inducted as a member of the BJP national executive committee and is credited with engineering many high profile defections from the TMC. This Friday marked Roy’s homecoming as both he and his son in the presence of chief minister Mamata Banerjee returned to their old bastion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mukul-roy-asks-centre-to-take-back-z-category-security-cover-a-day-after-joining-back-tmc-101623492889377.html

Chief Wildlife Warden of Jammu and Kashmir, Suresh Kumar Gupta, said, “man-animal conflict will continue but it can be minimised. The overall data of the past 10 years show that the situation has improved. From 32 deaths and 365 injuries to 10 deaths and 141 injuries last year, we have certainly improved the situation. One-third of the deaths have also reduced”. Data accessed by the HT show that 196 people were killed and 2,325 were injured since 2011 in Jammu and Kashmir. Out of the total figures of deaths and injuries, Kashmir reported 118 deaths and 1877 injuries while the Jammu region reported 78 deaths and 448 injuries. Just earlier this month, the news of a 4-year-old girl mauled and killed by a leopard in Kashmir made headlines. Gupta said the government is now mulling planting 80 percent fruit and fodder trees in jungles to help herbivorous get their food within the jungles, which in turn will help carnivorous get their prey inside the jungle.According to data, in 2011-12, at least 32 people were killed and 365 were injured, the following year (2012-13) recorded 16 deaths and 305 injuries while in 2013-14, 32 deaths and 369 injuries were reported. Similarly, in 2014-15, 14 deaths and 240 injuries were reported; 24 deaths and 280 injuries in 2015-16; 22 deaths, 163 injuries in 2016-17; 14 deaths, 166 injuries in 2017-18. The year 2018-19 witnessed 13 deaths and 121 injuries while figures grew to 17 deaths and 156 injuries in 2019-20. As many as ten people were killed while 141 injuries were injured in the conflict in the year 2020-21 while in 2021-22 (up to June 6 recorded) 10 deaths and 141 injuries have been reported.Gupta said the downward trend in fatalities and injuries in recent years is due to a slew of measures. “There has been a degradation of wildlife habitat because of an increase in the human population. Now, we are focusing on the rehabilitation of wildlife and therefore 80 percent of the plantation will be of fruit and fodder trees in the forest areas to rehabilitate wildlife. It will help herbivorous animals to get food within the forests and in turn, help carnivorous get their prey within the forests,” Gupta said. He also informed that the wildlife protection department has set up 42 control rooms that work 24x7 to attend distress calls. “We are now mulling joint control room of wildlife, forest protection force and forest department because man-animal conflict mostly happens in human habitations near forests,” he added. Better equippedGupta said that the department was well equipped and has adequate cages, tranquillizer guns, trap poles, vehicles, mobikes. Net guns are a new addition to their kitty, he said. Compensation to victimsThe department provides ₹3,00,000 compensation in case of death or permanent incapacitation of a body part in such conflicts. ₹1,00,000 is provided as compensation in cases of serious injuries and ₹15,000 in case of minor injuries. “For the past seven to eight years, we are providing ₹1 crore to ₹1.50 crores every year as compensation to the affected people and their kin,” he said. Dos and don’ts to reduce conflicts The department has issued an advisory and circulated videos on social media categorically explaining the dos and don’ts. “People get killed or injured mostly by leopards and bears. Therefore, people living close to jungles, should not venture out alone. While attending nature’s call or cutting grass in their fields they shouldn’t be alone and someone should stand guard next to them because seeing an individual sitting alone in fields, animals consider them as their prey,” said Gupta. If there’s a beast on the prowl stay indoors and immediately call control rooms or dial 100, he added. The department’s field staff capture hardly 10 percent of the animals and mostly burst firecrackers to scare them away to their habitat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nearly-200-killed-over-2k-injured-in-man-animal-conflict-in-j-k-since-2011-101623476429837.html

So far 31 patients have won the battle against black fungus.Meanwhile, the Nainital High Court has directed the Central Government to provide an uninterrupted supply of life-saving medicines to Uttarakhand.On June 10, the court also directed the state government to organise district-level vaccination for the weaker sections of the society, especially those who were deprived of vaccination due to a lack of ID cards.The state government has been instructed to create a task force for the same.The court had also directed the ministry to make the information regarding the availability of Black Fungus medicine public and ensure it reaches people.Mucormycosis or black fungus is a complication caused by a fungal infection.

12-06-2021||Delhi||Evaluate Class 12 students based on past tests: Sisodia||Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia on Friday wrote to the Union minister of education Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’, making several suggestions for evaluating Class 12 CBSE students following the cancellation of their exams in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.In his letter, Sisodia suggested that the students should be evaluated on the basis of their performances in Class 12 pre-boards and practical exams, Class 11 final exams, and Class 10 board exams. The Delhi education minister said the Centre should fix the range of moderation at “plus or minus five marks” for Class 12 students.On June 1, the Centre cancelled the CBSE Class 12 exams to ward off the threat of coronavirus infections. The government said that CBSE will come up with a “well-defined objective criteria” in a time-bound manner to assess these students. The board constituted a 13-member team to fix criteria for the assessment of Class 12 students on June 4.Sisodia said that he has discussed the possible criteria for the evaluation of Class 12 students with various stakeholders. “First of all, our principle for evaluation should be that whatever method we adopt, it should be in the interest of students. And for this, we have to make decisions rising above the traditional principles. The past year has been very challenging for our students and their parents. Not all students had fair and equal opportunities to study and learn. So, we should not object if the results of these students are much better due to the proposed new evaluation process. If we prepare results on the basis of different sources and examinations, then perhaps it will do justice to all the students,” he said in the letter.The Delhi deputy chief minister suggested that the board should give 30% weightage to Class 12 pre-boards, 20 % to the Class 11 final exams, and 20 % to the performance in the CBSE Class 10 exams. The remaining 30% marks should be allotted on the basis of the practical exams conducted by the schools, he suggested.“The 20% weightage of class 10 exams should be on the basis of the subject in which the students had secured the highest marks in Class 10th. This is necessary because the subjects of Class 10 are very different from the subjects students study in Class 12,” he added.Sisodia further said that the Centre should allow schools to fix the range of moderation at +/- 5 marks, unlike Class 10 where moderation of only +/- 2 marks is allowed. CBSE uses moderation to check on “inflation of marks” and to maintain consistency.According to the evaluation criteria CBSE has set for Class 10 students, schools will have to award marks in consonance with their best performance in Class 10 in the last three academic years — 2017-18, 2018-19, and 2019-20.The selected year will be the reference year for schools, and subject-wise marks allotted by the schools for 2021 will be within a range of +/- 2 marks obtained by the school in the subject in the reference year.“Delhi has started some new schools of excellence in which this was the first batch of Class 12 students. There is no historical reference available in the case of these schools. The reference year of such schools should be taken from the nearest School of Excellence so that there is no undue harm to the children here,” Sisodia said in the letter.The Central government’s spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/evaluate-class-12-students-based-on-past-tests-sisodia-101623452962064.html
12-06-2021||Delhi||Man runs over 5 with speeding truck; held||A 93-year-old man, and four members of a family were killed when they were run over, allegedly by a speeding tipper truck in southwest Delhi’s Najafgarh early on Friday morning, said the police. The errant truck driver was arrested, and the vehicle impounded.Police said a DTC bus driver blocked the road with his bus when the truck driver tried to flee the spot. The arrested driver told the police that he dozed off while driving and lost control of the vehicle, senior officers said.Rao Jawahar Singh (93), who recovered from Covid-19 last month, was out for a walk while the other four victims – a couple and their two sons, aged five and two-and-a-half, were on their way to a temple in Gurugram, when the incident took place around 5am. The accident spot is around 150 metres away from the Najafgarh police station.The incident was captured on several CCTV cameras installed at nearby shops. Footage from one of the cameras shows the couple walking on the road with their elder son, while the younger one is in his father’s arms.The elderly man is not visible in the 50-second video clip, which was posted on social media on Friday.In the video clip, none of the five victims are in focus when the truck runs them over. However, the cameras capture the truck dragging the victims on the road and crashing into three parked cars.The entire carriageway on Thana Road, where the incident took place, is divided into two parts with concrete barriers, but only one-way traffic is allowed on the road. Local residents and relatives of the victims said the truck was travelling at a high speed from the Najafgarh police station side.“The truck suddenly swayed left and hit Jawahar Singh from behind and then ran over the other four. The bodies of three of them were crushed, and they died on the spot. The elderly man and the youngest child were rushed to the nearby Vikas Hospital with grave injuries. The old man succumbed to his wounds, and the child was referred to Safdarjung hospital where he died later in the day,” said Ram Rajoura, a relative of the family.The four other victims were later identified as Ashok Rajoura (30), his wife Kiran (27), and their two sons – Ishant Rajoura and Dev Rajoura. Ashok worked as a security guard in Vikas Hospital, and his wife was a homemaker. They lived with Ashok’s brother and two uncles.Ashok’s uncle, Satish Rajoura, said they were at home when they heard a loud crash, and rushed out to see what happened. “We knew it was an accident, but could never imagine that the victims would be my four loved ones,” said Satish.Ram said the truck driver tried to escape after the accident, but a DTC bus blocked his way about 80 metres from the spot.Local residents caught the truck driver handed him over to the police.Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said a case of rash and negligent driving causing deaths was registered and the truck driver, identified as Rajesh, was arrested.“Five vehicles were found damaged at the spot. The accident was caused by a dumper truck driven in a rash and negligent manner,” he added.Rakesh Yadav, Jawahar Singh’s grandson, said his grandfather walked at least five kilometres every morning and performed yoga to keep himself fit.“My grandfather was 93, but he was healthy. It was because of his fitness that he survived Covid-19, staying in home isolation with high fever, body ache and cough. I was sleeping when a neighbour woke me up and told me about the accident. By the time I reached the hospital, my grandfather was dead,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-runs-over-5-with-speeding-truck-held-101623452481659.html
12-06-2021||Delhi||Checks on two-wheelers in new speed limits||The new speed limits announced by Delhi’s traffic police on Friday bring users of two-wheelers under tighter regulation, addressing a gap that previously allowed speeding violations by them to often collapse in courts since road signs typically do not indicate the restrictions on how fast they can travel.Experts and traffic officials said this is crucial since two-wheeler users account for a large proportion of road accident fatalities and the lack of explicit speed limits made enforcement of rules harder for agencies.“In many instances of court challans, violators would get away without paying because technically, the speed limits for two-wheelers were not notified. The signage in the city also do not specify separately on the speed limits for two-wheelers, so an easy escape for owners is to say that they were not aware,” said a senior traffic official, who asked not to be named.According to the notification, those using scooters and motorcycles will need to follow mostly the same set of limits as car drivers will have to, but they cannot go beyond 60kmph on expressways, where vehicles are allowed to touch 70kmph.In most roads across the city, they will need to stick to the 50kmph limit and within residential localities, they cannot exceed 30kmph.Delhi government data showed that out of a little over 10 million vehicles registered in the city, 7.3 million are two-wheelers.Delhi traffic police estimates also show that out of the total road accident fatalities, two-wheeler riders and pillions account for the highest share of deaths after pedestrians and cyclists.According to an assessment in 2020, nearly 30-40% of the victims of road accidents that were on two-wheelers were either killed or injured.Road safety experts said that the tendency to speed, combined with the low level of protection for two-wheeler riders, increases the chances of fatality in case of a crash.Also Read | Delhi Traffic Police revise maximum speed limits for vehicles. All details hereIn a recent case, two men riding a motorcycle died after they crashed into a wall and fell into a drain at east Delhi’s New Ashok Nagar. Police officials said the rider was speeding and that the impact of the crash flung them.Ritu Sarangi, a Delhi-based road safety expert who has been consulting with the Delhi traffic police, said that two-wheelers riders in the 19-27 years age group have the highest tendency to speed on roads and also make for the highest share of two-wheeler fatalities.“This was a much-needed move. Two-wheeler riders make for the largest share of road occupants and they also have the most tendencies to speed and not abide by the city’s limits, endangering their own lives and also the lives of others.“With the speed limits now notified under law, enforcement teams will now be better equipped to catch the violators,” Sarangi said.Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning at the School of Planning and Architecture, who is on the speed review committee that helped decide these revised speed limits in the city, said the Delhi traffic police, as well as the road-owning agencies in the national capital must now ensure that speed limit signage across the city is revised to add two-wheelers to the list.“Now if you see the signage boards, you will always only find the limits for private four-wheelers and commercial vehicles mentioned, but this signage will first need to be changed. This will ensure that commuters know that they will be prosecuted if they flout the said limit,” Ram said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/checks-on-two-wheelers-in-new-speed-limits-101623450657054.html
12-06-2021||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh debate: Schools need checks and balances||Transparency in dealingsSchools should upload their balance sheets online as it will lead to greater transparency and increases the confidence of parents in the school. All doubts regarding the fees structure and where it is used will be clear to them. Khushboo Singla, MohaliEducation for allTransparency in every field is the need of the hour. The very fact that schools are reluctant to upload their balance sheets proves that they have something to conceal. Going public with the financial statements will make the system more transparent and also make parents feel comfortable. Otherwise ‘free and compulsory education for all’ will be a distant dream.Arti Sood, ChandigarhCome clean if you have nothing to hideDue to the pandemic, school buildings, water, electricity and numerous other things are not being used, prompting the courts to direct the schools only to charge the tuition fee. If not comfortable with uploading financial statements online, schools should at least give it to local authorities for evaluation. Schools should show their balance sheets if they have an equitable system and have nothing to hide.Aashita Sood, via emailBalanced approachOn one hand, parents paying exorbitant private school fee have the right to be informed about the utilisation of funds while on the other, schools, too, have a right to maintain their privacy for administrative purposes. Therefore, a middle way path is the best one to take to take. Vaibhav Sharma, ChandigarhValue the teachers’ effortsIn the showdown between parents and school authorities, no one’s talking about the painstaking efforts of teachers, who have been juggling their domestic duties and online classes throughout this difficult time. Reaching out to children and keeping them engaged through the virtual mode is not a very convenient thing to do from home. Teachers spend hours preparing and planning learning strategies for each session. Parents must respect the dedication of teachers and introspect. Certainly, if any, the fee hike is not arbitrary if the schools are successfully creating learning opportunities for children. In this case, uploaded balance sheets is violation of privacy of schools.Shikha Sondhi, via emailQuality comes at a priceIt is ironic that while private schools are being grilled for the exorbitant fee structure, no one’s talking about the quality of education being imparted here. Setting up a private school takes a great deal of effort and planning. Why would anyone undertake such a venture if such is the attitude of people and authorities towards it? Anju Mohan, PanchkulaDonations, extra charge fair game for these schoolsSeveral private schools have laid off their staff and are also saving on electricity and water consumption charges as classes have been shifted online. The charade under which these schools have been operating is now being questioned by parents, who have the right to know where their money is going. Most of these schools force parents for ‘donations’ and fees under sundry odd heads. I believe private schools should be forced by law to share their balance sheets with public as this is the only way to expose them.Saihibb Kaura, via emailA welcome moveThe order of the high court mandating private unaided schools to upload their balance sheets is a welcome move. Many private schools are not transparent in their financial dealings as they charge exorbitant fees on various heads from the students. Many of these schools have also become conduit for converting black money into white money. The recent order will definitely rein in those schools which have a practice of hiking tuition and other fees every academic year. The uploading of the balance sheets will also provide information at a glance the money being spent by the schools for developing the infrastructure and technology of the schools. But one grey area is that these schools may find ways to window dress their financial dealings and we are not sure whether the balance sheet will be a true one or a fudged one.Anil Kumar Yadav, ChandigarhEducation is not a business Chandigarh administration has allotted plots only to charitable trusts for opening schools. Balance sheets have to be made public due to a clause in the Act which requires the utilisation of funds for betterment and development of the unaided educational institution. The fund or profit accrued cannot be used for any personal gain or business enterprise. It is no surprise that these schools are not keen on uploading their balance sheets. The administration should penalise such schools and further conduct an audit of their accounts. The excess fee charged by these schools in the past should be refunded to parents. Vijay Malia, ChandigarhShun the hoodwinkingPrivate schools in UT have been fleecing parents by charging many ‘add-ons’ on tuition fee even during the pandemic when classes have been shifted online. When their regular expenses are minimal, except the payment of staff salaries, private schools will do well to refund the excess payments unduly charged from parents to avoid being caught off guard. Their refusal to publish their balance sheets has further strengthened the parents case. SC Luthra, ChandigarhShould be open to scutinySchools should not function like business entities. Schools, which are considered to be the temples of education, are answerable not only to students and parents but also to the society as a whole. Schools also get tax exemptions and other benefits, so there is no excuse for fleecing the parents. Further more, transparency in financial matters ensures credibility and respect. Private schools should gracefully subject themselves to public scrutiny and accountability.Usha Verma, ChandigarhBring shutters down on school not obeying ordersEducation should be given on the basis of no profit, no loss. Private schools should upload their balance sheets and give parents clarity on the fee structure. In case of a hike, parents should be consulted beforehand. Private schools have no right terming it a violation of privacy. The government should bring the shutters down on schools violating the orders.Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, MohaliTransparency will benefit all stakeholdersMost private schools this year have cut corners by laying off staff and giving salary cuts to the rest. With most teachers taking the classes from their home, there isn’t any ‘usual’ consumption of utilities, such as water and electricity at school premises. Despite this, schools are still asking for high fees. Schools refused to upload their balance sheets claiming that this would be a violation of their privacy. The right to privacy is available to artificial entities, but the field of education is a charitable initiative so releasing the balance sheets will only bring in transparency and satisfaction to all stakeholders involved. This will also allow the government to evaluate fee structure and make norms more rational. Samay Seth, via emailViolation of privacyThe high court order to schools to upload balance sheets online is a violation of privacy and privileges of schools. It presumes that private schools are business organisations like any other. Though there is no justification for arbitrary fee hike, and that too during the pandemic, putting the balance sheets in public domain is not fair. We have seen schools exploiting parents through exorbitant fees to expand operations. Without making the schools disclose their balance sheets, a case should be made for putting an end to unnecessary fee hike.DS Banati, MohaliRationalise fee during lockdownThe main duty of schools is to impart education. But it is sad to see that schools are now trying to mint money out of this noble cause. Every financial activity related to a student’s betterment should be conducted transparently. Schools should not object to upload the balance sheet. By uploading the balance sheet, school administration is not only be able to gain the trust of parents but also earn their respect of the rest of the society. This will only help them in the long run. Also, in wake of online classes, schools must set up a reasonable fee structure.Prabhjot Nagpal, ZirakpurCruel to hike fee when economy is scarredThe entry of the corporate sector in the field of education has completely changed the educational system in the country. With the public education system already destroyed, almost all parents started sending their children to fancy schools even though many may not even be able to afford it. The educational institutes set up their own so-called charitable trust and cornered cheap lands under political patronage. With the economy in choppy waters, many parents may have lost their jobs or have lesser earnings than before. In such a scenario, increasing the annual fees is a cruel move. Suresh Verma, Chandigarh Schools are pillars of development, profiteering a strict noBe it government-aided or non-aided educational institutions’, the main aim is to provide education to all. But nowadays educational institutions are just looking at earning maximum profits. The high court has done the right thing by directing schools to upload the balance sheet online. Educational institutes are pillars of development. So they should sacrifice the profit motive and make the balance sheet transparent to gain future benefits and loyalty of parents.Subhash Nagpal, ZirakpurA step in the right direction The HC order to private schools to bring in public domain the balance sheet is a step in the right direction to bring transparency in the transactions of the school since most of the them are set up to earn profits. Parents have every right to know the end use of the hefty fees charged by schools in the name of development fund. Also, some schools get aids from government and keep it under the wraps to avoid scrutiny by tax authorities. Anil Vinayak, Amritsar Schools no exceptionThere is no harm in sharing balance sheet of income and expenditure of private schools. It is not fair to club this as violation of privacy. Further most of the public and private agencies put their annual balance sheet in public domain to have transparency in their working. Apart from this, annual audit of private schools must be done and made mandatory by government approved auditors to ensure transparency in their accounts so that no finger can be raised on their working by anybody.Col TBS Bedi, MohaliDon’t forget the students in this tug of warIf schools have any grouse, they are free to seek judicial redressal but any teacher-parent friction will prove detrimental to the growth of students. The fact that schools are business entities run with fees paid by parents who are deemed financiers, proves beyond doubt that these are funded by public that earns every right to scan the balance sheets. Land for schools is earmarked at concessional rates by authorities. Reluctance of school managements to put accounts in public domain gives rise to suspicions on ulterior motives. Private schools’ right to privacy may be moot but absolute secrecy is bad for public dealing. Lalit Bharadwaj, PanchkulaWork out alternativesParents as well as the school faculty should be receptive enough to understand each other’s agony. Schools may upload balance sheets declaring their accountability. If some schools agree to reduce fees but do not agree to upload balance sheets due to privacy concerns, it shall not be dealt with strictness as the main purpose is served by reducing fees. Another way is that all the schools are asked to make their balance sheets, and share them only with the UT education department. The department could access them and take decisions on whether to reduce or not to reduce the fees for each school individually.Priyam Aggarwal, ChandigarhImmoral for school to operate with motive of profitSchools are temples of learning which nurture young minds. Unfortunately, privately-run educational establishments have been converted into corporations with a motive of profit. Many other charges are being obtained in addition to fees. The schools also earn huge annual profits by giving franchise to others. It is immoral and illegal. Certainly they should charge for maintenance which includes water, power, staff, buses etc but it should stand social logic and audit. All unaided private schools must make their balance sheets public. Army Welfare Education Society is running a large number of Army Public Schools without any government aid. It will be prudent to direct all private public schools to follow the fee structure of Army Public Schools. Col SK Aggarwal, Panchkula Ease the burden on parentsPublic auditing of private schools is not justified when other organisations too are not subject to the same. A committee should be made to check the authenticity of the hefty fee taken by the private schools, and its expenditure. Government should intervene as education is the basic right of each child. Government should also provide some grant to all private schools to ease the burden on parents. Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliRelief for parentsArticle 21(A) of the Indian Constitution gives the right to education to every child between 6-14 years. However, there are cases where private schools charge hefty fees in the name of extra-curriculum activities. The recent decision by the high court to get private schools to upload their balance sheet comes as a great relief to parents. The decision will bring transparency in the functioning of private schools and parents can also raise questions if there is any discrepancy related to fee matters. Sandeep Rawat, ChandigarhSchools oppressing parentsPrivate schools’ opposition to make public their balance sheet proves the financial oppressiveness of parents at hands of schools. It is no secret how much the authorities care for public’s problems. So, not just in Delhi, private schools across India should be subject to maintenance and audit of balance sheets online.MPS Chadha, Mohali Corroded temples of educationSchools ought to be the epitome of discipline, uniformity, equality and honesty. However, over the past few years, many of these temples of learning have corroded into money minting entities. Yasmin D Khosla, PanchkulaShould not interfere in schools’ internal mattersAsking private schools to upload their balance sheets is a threat to their privacy. The private schools are independent and have their own systems of fees and other internal matters. The government should not interfere in this task of the private schools.Saikrit Gulati, ChandigarhPrivate schools are money-minting machines When the private education system was introduced in India, there was a missionary zeal but unfortunately now it is a buyer’s market. To open private schools, the administration provides land, loans, exemption in various taxes and against this their charging reasonable money is a rightful endeavour. But the aim of the owners of these schools is to mint money by exorbitantly charging admission fees, building funds and making it compulsory to buy books/exercise books either from their schools or specifically mentioned shops. They even pay less salary to their staff. In spite of all these infirmities, they do not want to upload their balance sheet to disclose their income and expenditure statement. SK Khosla, ChandigarhExpertsIn public domain Private schools run on money collected by students and their activities happen in the public domain. If parents ask, then should be shown the balance sheets. This will also help keep a check on embezzlement.BL Sharma, former education secretary Transparency must Transparency between school and parents is important. Parents need to make sure that the fees being paid by them is utilised properly. Schools should comply with these rules soon and action must be taken against those who don’t comply.Gurpreet Katwal, PTA president, Mount Carmel School Need clarity We have found a few discrepancies in the judgement and will approach the Supreme Court for more clarity on this. Uploading balance sheets online will make school governance harder and affect the studies of students.HS Mamik, president, Independent Schools AssociationInformation misuse Schools don’t have a problem with submitting their balance sheets to the UT education department and CBSE. However, uploading these online may encourage criminal elements to misuse this information.Girish Sachdeva, Independent Schools Association Executive memberWelfare Schools have been established as charitable trusts or under Societies Registration Act. Parents are to be treated as equal partners. Schools aren’t supposed to make profit so uploading balance sheets will show if there are excess funds and make a case against annual fee hike. Pardeep Rapria, RTI activist and lawyer Reader of the weekAccountability has never done any harm Education in our society has been rewarded with respect and honour. Unfortunately, the ulterior motive of ‘profiteering’ by the private schools even in these tumultuous times has pushed the stakeholders to rebel. If educational institutions can spend a mighty amount on advertisements and publicity, it is obvious to assess their intentions. Parents are being mercilessly pressed by schools to make the payments with overheads included. Such endeavours may result in massive unschooling thereby altering the edifice of educational governance in the country. Uploading financial statements on their websites may help the schools earn their lost respect that they should have retained and deserved otherwise.Shammi Bhatia, Dhakoli||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ht-chandigarh-debate-schools-need-checks-and-balances-101623446008912.html

She was leading a sit-in near the old sessions court in Ambala. At least five such protests were staged at different petrol pumps in every sub-division of the district. “With the nation already grappling with the pandemic, the government should understand that the rise in fuel prices will increase inflation. Our party will continue to fight against such arbitrary rulings of the Modi government,” the Congress leader said. On the farmers’ agitation, Selja hit out at Haryana home minister Anil Vij for saying that there was a hidden agenda behind the protest. “The farmers only want a better price for their crop.” She, however, refused to comment on the ongoing political tussle in the Punjab Congress. Aam Aadmi Party’s Ambala unit also staged a protest against rising inflation at the deputy commissioner’s office. Reacting to the protests, Vij said, “The Opposition’s work is to raise such issues and the government’s is to find a solution. The Union government is doing whatever it can to control the spread of the coronavirus.

On May 18, the high court had asked the additional chief secretary (home) to consider and decide the complaints made by the IGP in accordance with the law expeditiously, preferably within a period of three months. Kumar had again approached high court earlier this week alleging that though the law mandated registration of an FIR on his complaint, the government had not done so. Sabharwal had told the court that the complaint against the DGP had been looked into and the inquiry had been concluded and submitted to the high court through an e mail. In his complaint, the IGP had said that on August 3, 2020, which was a public holiday, he had visited a temple. “The then SP Ambala, Abhishek Jorwal, had visited the temple the same day. This was reported in a newspaper on August 4, 2020. Based on the news item, the DGP wrote a demi-official letter to me on August 17, 2020 and asked me to inform him whether any prior sanction of government had been obtained before setting up a place of worship in Shahzadpur police station. The Ambala SP was not asked the same,” he had said, adding that he was targeted because he belonged to the SC community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/igps-complaint-against-dgp-hc-asks-haryana-to-submit-inquiry-report-101623443607607.html

12-06-2021||Chandigarh||SAD, BSP may declare electoral alliance today||In a significant political development, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) have forged an electoral alliance for the next assembly polls the details of which will be announced on Saturday, it is learnt. Both the parties are joining hands after 27 years since the 1996 Lok Sabha polls when the alliance had bagged 11 of the 13 Lok Sabha seats in Punjab. That time, BSP had won all the three seats it had contested and SAD bagged eight out of 10. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal is said to be behind the revival of the alliance. According to a senior SAD functionary, all formalities regarding the alliance were complete after many rounds of talks between Sukhbir and BSP supremo Mayawati. The BSP is likely to be given 20 seats, he said, requesting anonymity. And if voted to power, the SAD was not averse to have the deputy chief minister from the BSP since Sukhbir has already committed deputy chief minister’s post to a Dalit if his party is voted to power. For the fresh alliance, BSP general secretary and Rajya Sabha member Satish Mishra is in Chandigarh and the formal announcement will be made at a joint press conference to be addressed by the Sukhbir and Mishra on Saturday. A BSP functionary said the party pushed for 35 seats out of 117, but the SAD managed to convince the BSP leadership to accept 20 seats, of which eight are in the Dalit-dominated Doaba region. Most of the other seats the BSP may contest will be those which the SAD would leave for the BJP when the saffron party was in an alliance with the Akali Dal. “Discussions on the seats to be contested are almost final but may be announced later. This is a natural alliance in Punjab and is a shot in the arm for us. BSP though lately has reduced its votes share but that was primarly because its cadre had not tasted the power at all,” said a senior SAD functionary. According to the information, the SAD was keen on the alliance after parting ways with the BJP. The BSP has always had a significant vote share in Punjab being the birthplace of party founder Kanshi Ram, who belongs to Rupnagar district. It is learnt that the SAD is pressing BSP for not staking claim on Phillaur, Adampur and Banga seats since they are being represented by Dalit Akali MLAs and the BSP, it is learnt, was ready with the proposal. Notably, the BSP has strong presence among Dalits in all 23 seats falling under the Doaba region where the Scheduled Caste votes, mainly Ravidasias, can sway the poll results. Dalits make for almost 40% of the population in Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-bsp-may-declare-electoral-alliance-today-101623442767693.html
12-06-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A Green Park landmark||He is back. As the lockdown eases, shoe repairman Udhmi Ram has returned to his pavement stall in Green Park Market.“I’m opening after one whole month,” he says, sitting amid the numerous major and minor elements that make up his establishment. There are polishes of many shades, a metallic shoe stand, a bunch of laces hanging from a nail hammered on the pavement wall, a rusty trunk filled with old shoes and sandals, and a great deal of other tools. There’s a pink plastic rose, too.The stall might seem ordinary to a hurried passerby but that would be a mistake. Green Park Market has filled up in the recent years with retail chain showrooms and cafes, a number of old landmarks have been pushed out. The market’s neighbourhood charm has eroded. In comparison, the shoe stall is a monument. It was set up 50 years ago “on this very spot by my father, Bihari Lal, who had arrived in Delhi from Kotputli in Rajasthan.” Some of the tools date to the founder’s time, says Mr Ram, himself in his early 50s. The posters stuck on the wall are newer, put up by him. Most of these are calendar portraits of various gods, including a newspaper article on a Buddha statue in Rajgir, and a clipping that details the story of Shabri from the Ramayana.“I worship them,” Mr Singh says.This noon, sitting idle, he reveals that his customers dwindled long before the pandemic. “People these days buy new shoes rather than get the old ones mended.” A father of four, his eldest son works “as a cleaner in an office.” His children often tell him to stop working, and that they will look after him. “But coming here is a good pastime for me.” He arrives daily at 10 from his home in Mandi Gaon in bus no. 519. A single-way commute takes about an hour.Mr Singh also wants to keep working because during the lockdown neither he nor his employed son were able to earn. “We owe ₹8,000 to our grocer.”He plans to continue to come as long as “my body allows it.” His children aren’t interested to inherit his profession “and this stall will be gone after I’m done.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-green-park-landmark-101623442456089.html

12-06-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana NGOs protest interlocking tiles around trees||Slamming the civic body for ‘defying’ the orders of National Green Tribunal (NGT) wherein the Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) was directed against pouring concrete and installing interlocking tiles around one metre radius of trees, members of different NGOs under the banner of Council of Engineers staged a protest outside the civic body’s Zone-D office on Friday. Standing at the entry of MC office with placards in hands, the protesters said that the civic body has even failed to remove the cemented portion around the trees outside its Zone-D office in Sarabha Nagar and the department is continuing with the same illegal practice while taking up development projects in Ghumar Mandi, Malhar Road, Haibowal Kalan and other areas.Kapil Arora from Council of Engineers, Harpreet Soin from Wake Up Ludhiana, Jaskirat Singh and Kuldeep Khaira from Naroa Punjab Manch also joined the protest. They said that trees are unable to absorb water and other nutrients after concrete is spilled around them. According to them, even the roots of trees are damaged, which makes them weak and they fall in the event of thunderstorm and strong winds. “We had moved NGT against the illegal practice and in March, personally handed over the orders of the green tribunal to MC officials, wherein the court had directed the authorities to leave one metre radius around the trees. But they are still disobeying the orders,” Arora said. Khaira said they will also be staging a protest outside the Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) office on June 14 as they are indulging in the same illegal practice as well. “If the authorities fail to respond, then we will be left with no other option than to file a contempt petition in the tribunal,” he added. MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “Directions have already been issued to the officials of bridges and roads (B&R) department to comply with the orders of the tribunal and leave a certain portion of area around a tree. I will direct the officials of the horticulture and B&R wings of the MC to look into these complaints.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-ngos-protest-interlocking-tiles-around-trees-101623442347922.html

If the garbage dump is established, MC will start dumping waste from around 25 surrounding colonies there, due to which foul smell spreads in the area.LIT superintending engineer Buta Ram said that the LIT is only installing static compactor at the site and the location has been finalised by the MC. “The stay order has been vacated. The contractor was stopped from taking up construction on Friday and we are taking up the matter with the MC and police,” he said.Meanwhile, municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “There is some issue regarding the location.

12-06-2021||Delhi||State govt informs SC it has launched ‘one nation, one ration card’ scheme||The Delhi government informed the Supreme Court on Friday that it has commenced implementing the One Nation One Ration Card scheme, which helps beneficiaries, especially migrant workers, to avail of subsidised food commodities anywhere in the country.The bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and MR Shah was informed about the Delhi government making the national scheme functional by its standing counsel Chirag M Shroff while the court heard the suo motu (registered on court’s own motion) case on “problems and miseries of the migrant workers”.Asked by the bench, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who represented the Union government, said that Delhi was one of the four states which was yet to implement the scheme. But Shroff was quick to retort: “We are now implementing the scheme.”The statement by the city government’s lawyer follows an affidavit submitted by it in the Supreme Court, stating: “Regarding efforts to be made to encourage migrant NFSA (National Food Security Act) beneficiaries to use facilities of portability under One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC), it is submitted that in Delhi, to begin with ONORC has been implemented in circle 63, Seemapuri, and from this facility, portability facility can be availed.”The Delhi government’s affidavit, which was reviewed by HT, is dated June 8. The Union government had on June 8 written to the Delhi government to speedily implement the One Nation One Ration Card programme, pointing out that the scheme was already functional in 32 states and Union territories.Delhi government spokespersons did not comment on the matter despite repeated requests.The Delhi government and the Centre have been locked in a tussle after the state government’s ambitious plan to home-deliver subsidised foodgrain to the city’s residents, which has been blocked by the Centre citing procedural concerns.On Tuesday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to allow the home delivery scheme “in national interest” as he maintained that it was a waste of resources to have two schemes trying to do the same thing.The One Nation One Ration Card scheme programme is currently functional in 32 states and Union territories, covering 690 million beneficiaries, or 86% of those eligible for food security cover.It provides for a portable public distribution system (PDS) where food distribution takes place through a network of fair price shops that act as the final points of delivery.Nearly 7.2 million people in Delhi are eligible for subsidised food, including 1.7 million ration card holders and nearly 3 million priority households, besides other additional food insecure categories identified by the Delhi government.In its affidavit, the Delhi government has also apprised the top court of its decision to provide food grains also to those who did not possess ration cards and the benefits were envisaged for around 20 lakh persons.On Friday, the apex court heard the submissions of the state governments briefly and reserved its order for issuing further directives while observing that all states must implement ‘One Nation One Ration Card’ scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/state-govt-informs-sc-it-has-launched-one-nation-one-ration-card-scheme-101623441626204.html

The minister claimed that on May 5, they (Delhi government) issued the purchase order to V&M Galaxy to supply 20,000 oximeters at ₹1,300 each, Divesh Chaudhary for 2,000 units at the rate of ₹1,290 each, Edif Medical Systems for 5,000 pieces at ₹1,250 each, Abhilasha Commercial Pvt. Ltd for 13,000 units at the rate of ₹of 1,300. “How could the Delhi government purchase same oximeter from various firms at different prices, whereas the Punjab government has been providing Corona “fateh kits” to patients at very low price of ₹883, which included 19 items such as digital thermometer, steamer, pulse oximeter, hand sanitizer (500 ML), facemask three ply and all essential medicines,” he said. He said Punjab is the only state where treatment kits have been provided to Covid patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aap-misleading-people-on-fateh-kits-says-balbir-sidhu-101623438027467.html
12-06-2021||Bangalore||Uncertainty looms over Pak women married in India||Bengaluru: Karnataka Police on Thursday arrested a Pakistani national for illegally staying in Uttara Kannada district’s Bhatkal. According to police, she is married to a local and has been living in India since 2015 and was arrested following a tip-off.The woman was identified as Khadija Mehrin, 33, who had married Mohiddin Rukkuddin from Bhatkal in 2014 in Dubai and has three children from the marriage. Shivaprakash Devaraju, Superintendent of Police, Uttara Kannada said Mehrin has been remanded in judicial custody. He said after their marriage in Dubai she entered the country illegally and has been staying at Nawayath Colony in Bhatkal.“She had travelled on a tourist visa to India for three months in 2015 and stayed back illegally. She also obtained an Aadhaar card, a ration card, a PAN card, among others, by producing fake documents,” Devaraju said.While Mehrin was sent to judicial custody for her illegal stay, several Pakistani women are staying in Bhatkal who have either received their citizenship or are awaiting them. Marrying women from Karachi has been a long tradition in Bhatkal.“Before partisan, many Muslim families of Nawayath community, had business links with Karachi and in other parts of Pakistan. Once the partition happened, several families and friends were on either side of the border. Soon, to keep these relations going; the practice of marrying women from Karachi began. Most of them apply for Indian citizenship after the marriage,” said a senior officer of the state intelligence, who didn’t want to be named.In the 1990s, however, the fate of this Muslim-majority fishing town, which stayed peaceful even after the demolition of the Babri Masjid, changed following a political murder. “The murder of a popular RSS leader Dr U Chittaranjan, who was the first MLA to be assassinated while in office, changed the town’s political climate. This murder, over a period of time, led to communal tensions and eventually led to the creation of terrorists like Yasin and Riyaz; and the rise of far-right Hindu leaders like Anant Kumar Hegde,” the officer added.As the town’s name started getting associated with terror, the approval for citizenship of many Pakistani brides from Bhatkal became difficult.“I’m not certain about the exact numbers, but there are around 70 applications for citizenship are pending since 1992 with the home ministry’s office in Bengaluru. As per our records, there are 16 women of Pakistan nationality living in Bhatkal town of Uttara Kannada district on long-term visas. Of them, 14 are married to Indians and most of their children are born in India,” the officer added.For the families the wait for citizenship is difficult. Javeed (name changed), whose wife is Pakistani says that due to the visa restrictions travelling within the country itself is difficult. “We have to take permission from the police if we have to travel. We have been going to multiple offices and multiple police verifications have been done, but her request for citizenship hasn’t been processed yet,” he said.But the police say that the recent developments over the years have made the process even more difficult. The Pakistani wife of a suspected terror operative Syed Ismail Afaq, who is now in jail for supplying explosive material that Indian Mujahideen (IM) used in bomb strikes across India, was deported on October 7, 2019.“Her name was Arsala Abeer and then she had crossed the one-month deadline that the Union home ministry had set for her to return to her home country. The ministry of external affairs rejected her visa renewal application in August after her husband’s arrest. Arsala was living in India after periodically renewing her two-year visa after she married Afaq in 2006. This made our renewal and process for citizenship requests even more strict,” the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/uncertainty-looms-over-pak-women-married-in-india-101623437909154.html
12-06-2021||Chandigarh||If removing me as PCC chief strengthens Cong, it should be done: Jakhar||If removing him as the Punjab Congress chief strengthens the party, it should be done, said Sunil Jakhar on Friday responding to speculation that he may be replaced.His statement came a day after a three-member Congress panel set up to end factionalism in the state unit submitted its report to party chief Sonia Gandhi, suggesting a revamp to accommodate all sections.“If the Congress becomes strong by removing Sunil Jakhar, then that must be done today,” Jakhar said when asked that there was speculation that he may be replaced. When asked that the panel has said that Amritsar MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu be “suitably accommodated” in the revamped unit, Jakhar agreed that he should get a “respectable position”. However, he told reporters that they should not speculate over the panel report. “Let the committee’s report come, you should not do guess work on that. I have not read the report,” he said.Jakhar further said he would never like to become a “stumbling block” in any such effort of the party, which is aimed at strengthening it. “I have said from day one that if having someone else as the PCC chief strengthens the Congress, then it should be done,” said the former Gurdaspur MP. The Congress panel was chaired by leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, with AICC general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat and former MP JP Aggarwal as its members.Rawat had on Thursday said the report has been submitted to the Congress president, who would take a final call on the suggestions made.Though no major changes have been recommended at the top level in Punjab, the panel is learnt to have said that idhu be “suitably accommodated” in the revamped unit.Sidhu’s name is doing the rounds for inclusion in the state cabinet and elevation as the deputy CM but chief minister Amarinder Singh is reportedly opposed to it.Sidhu had quit the state cabinet nearly two years ago after his Local Bodies portfolio was changed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/if-removing-me-as-pcc-chief-strengthens-cong-it-should-be-done-jakhar-101623437907504.html

12-06-2021||Bangalore||Will remain Karnataka CM for next two years: Yediyurappa||Bengaluru BS Yediyurappa on Friday said that he will continue as Karnataka’s chief minister for another two years and dismissed any change in leadership in the southern state.“For the next two years, I will be chief minister and will focus more on development works for the state,” Yediyurappa said on Friday, exuding new-found confidence after speculation of his removal was denied by the central leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Though it remains unclear if the BJP will actually replace Yediyurappa, the 78-year-old has made his intentions clear, irrespective of what the party high command has on their minds.The statement comes a day after Arun Singh, Rajya Sabha member and BJP’s national general secretary incharge of Karnataka, said that there were no discussions of a change in leadership.“The Karnataka incharge has said that there is no question and it does not arise and that Yediyurappa will remain for the entire term,” the chief minister said.Singh mirrored the recent gag order enforced by the state unit of the BJP, restricting anyone from speaking out against the chief minister or the government.Since Yediyurappa seized power in 2019 by engineering the collapse of the HD Kumaraswamy-led Janata Dal (Secular)-Congress coalition government, the 78-year-old has been on the receiving end of sharp criticism from his own partymen. First over the choice of cabinet that prioritized his close circle and then of turncoats who helped him to power, leaving many seniors out.The clamour to remove Yediyurappa has grown louder in recent months over the handling of Covid-19, corruption, non-performance and allegations that his son, BY Vijayendra, was running a parallel administration under the aegis of his father.“No one should speak against the party. And the high command will take a call on the change in leadership,” said one senior national level office bearer of the BJP, requesting not to be named. He, however, said that Yediyurappa was operating on “borrowed time”.“Three exceptions have been made for Yediyurappa by the BJP. One is that he left the party but was given the chief minister’s post after he returned. He is 78-years-old. And despite the lack of performance, he has still not been removed. So every day since 2019 is a bonus for him,” said the person cited above.Yediyurappa’s biggest challenges have mostly come from within his own party and government, with legislators and ministers rushing to Delhi frequently to complain against him.Vijayendra had even met prominent Lingayat seers on Thursday, which some people aware of the developments said, was to mobilise support for Yediyurappa.Yediyurappa, who hails from the Lingayat community, believed to be the single largest caste group in the state, enjoys their support and is banking on them to back him this time as well.People aware of the developments said that Yediyurappa’s removal before the next election (2023) was inevitable, but it had to be done tactfully so as to avoid a repeat of the 2013 elections (in which BJP were reduced to 40 seats from 110 in 2008) and lose their only presence in southern India.Karnataka has long been considered the gateway to the south for the saffron party which is yet to make any major inroads into Tamil Nadu and Kerala, where it has little or no political representation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/will-remain-karnataka-cm-for-next-two-years-yediyurappa-101623437726778.html
12-06-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka issues unlock guidelines||Bengaluru The Karnataka government on Friday released guidelines for relaxation of lockdown restrictions across 19 districts of the state, including Bengaluru, to allow economic activities and ensure that more livelihoods are not impacted. The guidelines came a day after chief minister BS Yediyurappa announced some of the relaxations for most regions of the state and the continuation of the lockdown in 11 districts, where the Covid-19 pandemic continues to be severe. “Just because we are unlocking, it does not mean the coronavirus has gone somewhere. Till when everyone has taken two doses of the vaccine, at least over 70% of the population gets it, that’s when we can relax a little bit and live like how we used to in 2019 and early 2020,” Dr K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education, said on Friday. He said unlocking of restrictions was taken based on calculations to ensure that more livelihoods are not impacted and more people do not fall below the poverty line. Karnataka has extended the timings for essential services like grocery, meat, vegetables, liquor and other shops from 6 am to 2 pm, extending it beyond the 10am deadline till June 14. The new guidelines will come into force after 6 am on June 14. “Do not come out on the streets at once on June 14. Some people are already running around as though they have permission from now itself,” said Basavaraj Bommai, Karnataka’s minister for home, law and parliamentary affairs. Yediyurappa has also announced a night curfew on all days from 7 pm to 5 am and a weekend curfew to restrict movement in the state at least till June 21. He said the government will review the Covid-19 situation closer to June 21, and then decide on further relaxations, if any. Industries and other production facilities have been allowed to operate with 50% strength, while garment units have been restricted to 30% due to their labour-intensive process. Bommai said the relaxations were mostly to kick-start economic activities. Establishments like bars, restaurants, hotels, malls, schools and other places where high footfalls in enclosed spaces occur, remain prohibited. Religious functions and political events are also not allowed, he said. The state government said the already scheduled marriages can take place in homes with no more than 40 people and strict adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour. “No more than five people are allowed at funerals and cremations,” Bommai said. Hundreds of people had gathered for the funeral of senior BJP legislator CM Udasi in Haveri district, who died on Wednesday. Several ministers BJP leaders were also found in violation of Covid-19 norms in the state. Bommai said there were measures in place to conduct RAT (rapid antigen tests) in railway stations and bus stands. Karnataka recorded 8,249 new Covid-19 infections at a positivity rate at 4.86%, a sharp decline in the positive cases. There were 14,975 recoveries that brought down the active caseload to 203,769, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department on Friday. The fatality rate stood at 1.92% as 159 more succumbed to the virus, taking the toll to 32,644. Bengaluru recorded a sharp decline as it registered 1154 new infections. There were 48 more deaths in Bengaluru, which took the toll to 15,263, data showed. The active caseload dropped to 91,760 as 4,769 more recovered, according to the daily bulletin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-issues-unlock-guidelines-101623437666807.html

12-06-2021||Chandigarh||Congress protests fuel price hike in Punjab, Haryana||The Congress held protests at petrol pumps across Punjab and Haryana on Friday against the rise in fuel prices, and demanded an immediate rollback of the hike.Besides the steep hikes in rates of diesel and petrol, prices of other commodities of daily use like cooking oil and gas have also registered a manifold increase, senior leaders of the party said.Protests were held at various places, including Amritsar, Mohali, Kurali, Patiala, Bathinda, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Panchkula, Hisar, Gurgaon, Kaithal, Ambala, Panipat, Karnal, Fatehabad, Rohtak and Faridabad.Leading a protest in Kurali, Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar said: “The arrogant government at the Centre has constantly been increasing fuel prices instead of providing relief to the people during the current crisis. During the Congress-led UPA regime, despite international crude oil prices being very high, diesel prices hovered around ₹50, which is now near ₹90 per litre, while petrol is touching ₹100 per litre.”In Amritsar, some protesters set fire to an old car, saying they wanted to send a message to the Centre that common people are unable to afford vehicles because of the high cost of fuel. Punjab Congress leader Raj Kumar Verka said the steep rise in prices of petrol and diesel has broken the backs of the common people amid the Covid-19 pandemicIn Haryana’s Kaithal, Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala led the protest. A bullock cart was seen pulling a tractor there. Surjewala said prices of diesel and petrol are being increased at a time when the people of the country are battling the pandemic.He said the sharp rise in fuel prices has adversely hit various sections, including the farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-protests-fuel-price-hike-in-punjab-haryana-101623437367410.html
12-06-2021||Chandigarh||Kotkapura firing: SIT seeks permission to conduct lie detector test on Saini, Umranangal||The Punjab Police’s newly formed special investigation team (SIT), probing the 2015 Kotkapura firing case, moved a court seeking permission to conduct narco, lie-detector tests and brain mapping on former director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini, suspended inspector general of police (IGP) Paramraj Singh Umranangal and then Moga senior superintendent of police (SSP) Charanjit Singh Sharma.The SIT led by additional director general of police (ADGP) LK Yadav filed an application in the court of chief judicial magistrate on Friday, seeking permission to conduct narco analysis, polygraph and brain electrical activation profile (BEAP) of Saini, Umranangal and Sharma. The court has issued notice to the accused.The SIT questioned Saini for at least four hours at Chandigarh on Monday. Later, Umranangal and Sharma were also questioned. Officials privy to the development said they were asked about the sequence of events leading to the firing, besides who gave the orders to open fire at the mob that was protesting a series of sacrilege incidents. “However, all three evaded queries posed by the team. Hopefully, narco test will help getting a lead,” said a police official. According to rule, the accused has to give his consent to narco, polygraph and BEAP test before the court after which the SIT can go ahead. If the accused says no to the test, the SIT can’t conduct it.An official said seeking narco test is a tactical move on the part of the investigating team. “If the accused refuse to undergo the test, suspicion will grow further against them. If the test proves to be successful, it will be easy for the SIT to nail the accused,” he said. The SIT also recorded statements of two civilians, who were injured in the Kotkapura firing incident, on Friday at the Faridkot camp office. Two cops, including then Kotkapura head constable and another cop, who was in-charge of wireless transmission in the area also appeared before the investigation team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kotkapura-firing-sit-seeks-permission-to-conduct-lie-detector-test-on-saini-umranangal-101623437247940.html
12-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra records 11,766 new Covid cases, 406 deaths||The state saw the addition of 11,766 new Covid-19 cases on Friday, taking the tally to 5,887,853. A total of 406 fresh deaths and reconciliation of 2,213 deaths from the past few weeks took the state’s toll to 106,367.Mumbai reported 721 new cases and 24 deaths taking the tally to 714,216 and the toll to 15,079. As part of the ongoing reconciliation process, the state has been adding few hundred deaths which were delayed reporting over the past two to three months. Of the 2,213 death reconciled on Friday, 546 are from Pune, 398 from Thane, 291 in Ahmednagar, 194 in Nashik, 160 in Nagpur, 129 in Beed, 53in Satara, 49 in Chandrapur, 46 in Buldhana, 45 in Nanded among others.The state had added 8,074 deaths to its tally between May 26 and June 10. It has, however, denied to have hidden any deaths of Covid-19 patients.The public health department has said that the recent addition of the 8,074 deaths over the past 16 days was part of the reconciliation process, by which, the data entry of Covid-19 deaths is done to the state and Central portal. The government has also said that the updation of the deaths to the portal was delayed owing to the overburdened staff over the past two months during the peak of the second wave of the pandemic. It has also blamed the private hospitals for the delay in entering the information of deaths late.As part of the reconciliation exercise, the state government added 8,074 deaths from the past three-four months to its tally, witnessing a sudden spike and fatality rate. The case fatality rate jumped to 1.77% on June 10, from 1.61% on May 25, a day before the reconciled numbers started adding to the list of the death toll.“The updation of deaths lags because of the technical reasons. The state government never intended to hide the number of cases and deaths. The reconciliation process is undertaken every 15 days to tally with the data updated on two portals of the Central government and weed out the repetition of the cases. Confirmation of the cause of death also takes some time leading to the delay in the data entry about the deaths,” a statement issued by the department has stated.Kolhapur (1769), Sangli (1369), Pune (1400), Ahmednagar (697) districts continued to report high daily caseload. Of the 406 deaths reported on Friday highest, 110, were from the Palghar district followed by 50 in Pune, 22 in Satara, 20 in Ahmednagar and 18 in Kolhapur. The state case fatality rate stands at 1.81%, while the recovery rate stands at 95.4%.Meanwhile, as many as 70% of the daily caseload of Covid-19 is from the rural or semi-urban parts of the state. Of the 12,207 cases registered on June 10, 8,639 were from the rural areas while 3,568 were from the jurisdiction of the 27 municipal corporations. Barring Mumbai Metropolitan Region, all other six divisions, classified for the health administration, have been witnessing more number patients in rural and semi-urban areas. In divisions like Aurangabad, Latur almost 90% of the patients are reported in these areas.Two months ago, on April 10, around 40% of 55411 cases registered on that day were from rural areas while 59.66% were from the cities. In MMR, almost 85% of the cases were from nine big cities, in the Pune division, more than a third of patients were from cities.According to the presentation made to the state cabinet on Thursday, a few districts like Sindhudurg, Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur, Raigad are doing bad on the Covid-19 parameters including growth and positivity rate, active patients etc. The weekly positivity rate in six districts is above 10% and much above the state percentage of 5.89%. Kolhapur (16.06%) tops the chart followed by Raigad (14.90), Ratnagiri (13.74%), Pune (12.19%), Satara (11.54%) and Sindhudurg (11.23%). The districts have witnessed a high growth rate as well.Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer said, “The districts which have been witnessing a high number of cases, had started picking their infection curve late in the second wave. Sangli, Kolhapur are some of them, though Satara is witnessing exceptionally high cases despite having started getting cases from the beginning. We expect the cases in these districts to start dropping in the next few days. This will help state’s positivity rate dropping below 5% as the infection is reaching to its endemic level.”Dr Lancelot Pinto, an epidemiologist from Hinduja Hospital said, “The rural areas are likely to get affected this time because they were not exposed during the first wave, because of the strict lockdown. They have no antibodies developed during the first wave. Unless the vaccination is escalated everybody is going to get affected at some time. But the cases there will start stabilising soon.”Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray during his interaction with sarpanches from Vidarbha and Marathawada appealed to them to put in efforts to make their villages Covid-19 free. “State has augmented its health infrastructure, but the endeavour should be towards keeping people unaffected so that they do not need to come to the hospital. The village heads should form smaller groups to take care of the villagers to keep them unaffected of infection,” he said.The state has 161,704 active patients, while 6024 are institutionally quarantined. 254,301 tests were conducted in the past 24 hours resulting in the daily test positivity rate of 4.62%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-11-766-new-covid-cases-406-deaths-101623437246778.html
12-06-2021||Mumbai||Unlock Mumbai: City eligible for next level, BMC says no change in Covid curbs||Even as Mumbai now qualifies for – level two – further relaxation in lockdown restrictions, the city will continue with the existing Covid curbs for another week, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).Level two of unlock requires positivity rate to be below 5% and oxygen bed occupancy to be between 25% and 40%. The city’s positivity rate is 4.40% and oxygen bed occupancy 27.12%, according to the state government data. The city is currently under level three of unlock, which is imposed when the positivity rate is between 5% and 10% and oxygen bed occupancy more than 40%. Unlike the current curbs on timings, under level two, shops and establishments can operate during regular timings; malls and cinema halls can operate at 50% capacity and restaurants can allow patrons to dine throughout business hours. Besides, trains can be accessible for women commuters, if the BMC allows. The BMC’s circular by commissioner IS Chahal, however, stated that considering the geographical challenges, population and rain forecast for the city, level three of curbs will stay until further orders. Civic bodies in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, including Thane, Navi Mumbai, and Vasai-Virar, too, are cautious about lifting the curbs. With Mumbai and MMR connected and high mobility of people from one area to another, any decision taken in one part could impact the other. Even with the Covid-19 cases on a decline in the region and Mumbai, the authorities seem to be approaching cautiously. Surrounding municipal areas of the city in MMR too have improved on these parameters, except Kalyan-Dombivli, which remained in level three. Municipal corporation of Thane and Vasai-Virar upgraded to level two, while municipal areas of Navi Mumbai and Kalyan-Dombivli remained at last week’s levels of two and three, respectively. According to BMC officials, though the Covid-19 cases have gone down, the city is still reporting around 700 cases daily. A senior BMC official said, “We will continue with same restrictions for one week until the review next Friday. The plan is to keep Mumbai under level three for the entire month, however, the decision will be reviewed from time to time. We want to have an ideal situation where the city records around 200 cases daily for Mumbai to be brought to level two [restrictions].” Level three restrictions in the city that are expected to continue include, all shops in the city can open; restaurants can serve customers till 4pm on weekdays; private offices can be reopened with 50% staff but only till 4pm; and people can go for jogging and to gymnasiums, albeit with certain conditions. While suburban trains will still not be open for general public, commuters can travel by BEST buses provided there are no standing passengers.E-commerce firms will function regularly. Wedding ceremonies can be attended by up to 50 people. Although the state has allowed all women commuters to use local trains, last week the BMC restricted the services to medical staff and a few essential sectors. Thane municipal commissioner Vipin Sharma said, “We are in level two as per the parameters and we will continue the curbs and relaxation that we had last week.”Navi Mumbai municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar said, “We are still in level two. Our positivity rate is around 2% and [oxygen] bed occupancy is 25%-26% which is marginal. For the timebeing, there will be no change in the restrictions.” Vasai-Virar Municipal commissioner Gangatharan D said the city falls in level two. “The restrictions will be as allowed in the level two in accordance with the government order,” he said. Following the devastating second Covid-19 wave that forced a lockdown in Maharashtra from April, the government’s five-level plan to ease curbs, based on weekly positivity rate and occupancy of oxygen beds in districts, came into effect from June 7. Every week, the weekly positivity rate and occupancy of oxygen beds is review for the districts for the restrictions to be lifted or enforced. The state has classified 35 districts and 11 municipal corporations with more than one million population into five categories-- level one to five. The degree of relaxation of restrictions has been decided as per the level of severity of Covid-19 in those districts. Level one has the least restrictions, while level five will have the most. As per government order issued by Aseem Gupta, principal secretary, disaster management, relief and rehabilitation department on Friday, 12 districts have improved upon the two key parameters from last week.

The editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana added that until now, BJP did not require caste equations in UP and was reliant on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Ram Mandir issue. It also said that BJP continues to take away young leaders from the grand old party, adding that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi will have to make a new team which can be an answer to the problems plaguing the Congress. It added that the Congress is fighting for its existence in the country, except in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala. The editorial said that Prasada is unlikely to help the BJP with the Brahmin vote bank in UP. “Until now, BJP didn’t require caste calculations and was reliant on Modi, Ram Mandir and the issue of Hindutva. Now the party is in [such] a bad situation that they have to induct Prasada. If Prasada had a sway over the Brahmin votes, then why wasn’t it transferred to the Congress?” the editorial asked. Elections in UP are scheduled in early 2022.The Sena mouthpiece added that the young brigade of Congress, including Prasada who came from a family of Congress loyalists, has moved out of the party. It stated that Jyotiraditya Scindia had quit the party to join BJP in Madhya Pradesh last year, while adding that Rajasthan Congress minister Sachin Pilot is still upset with the party though his rebellion fused last year. It also said that the Punjab Congress is also divided. The editorial said that the Congress still has connect at the grassroot level in India and lauded it for the work it did in the pre-independence era and for its contribution towards nation building later. “[Congress president] Sonia Gandhi has competently carried out the responsibility [of the party] till date. Now, Rahul Gandhi will have to make a new team which can be an answer to the problems facing the Congress party,” the editorial said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-losing-brahmin-votes-in-up-shiv-sena-on-jitin-prasad-episode-101623436946773.html
12-06-2021||Chandigarh||HC gives interim protection to private secy to Punjab jails minister in cheating case||Chandigarh The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday granted interim protection from arrest in a cheating case to Bachittar Singh, private secretary to Punjab jails minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa. The high court bench of justice Manoj Bajaj while seeking response from the state by September 6, gave him the interim protection from arrest, said his lawyer, Gautam Dutt. The detailed order is awaited. The FIR in the case was lodged on May 2 in Longowal in Sangrur on the complaint of Ram Dass Bansal, proprietor of Bhavya Organics, Sangrur. Bansal has alleged that Bachittar had asked him through one Jagsir Singh to supply sugar to certain private persons, saying that he will be responsible for the dealings. Sugar worth ₹74 lakh and ₹2.2 crore was supplied by different firms, but payment was made only of ₹57 lakh and 87 lakh, with the remaining amount still due. It was claimed that Bachittar is the main accused in the case. Other accused are Abhishek Goyal, Kapil Garg and Sanjeev Kumar with at least ₹75 lakh still pending for the sugar supplied to them. Bachittar was nominated as an accused at a later stage. Before the high court, Bachittar has claimed that he was falsely implicated and had no role to play in the alleged offence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-gives-interim-protection-to-private-secy-to-punjab-jails-minister-in-cheating-case-101623436827831.html

In the case against him, Raut is alleged to have forged the commencement certificate (CC) of a building developed by him at Vijay Nagar, Nallasopara (East), and sold the flats. The matter came to light when a person complained to VVMC on March 31, alleging that Raut had issued a fake CC to him. The civic body had issued a show-cause notice to Raut, but he purportedly did not respond to it.“The CC issued to buyers were found to be fake and Raut has been booked for cheating and forgery under relevant sections of IPC (Indian Penal Code) and the Maharashtra Town Planning Act. He’s not arrested yet,” said senior inspector Rajendra Kamble of Tulinj police. Raut came in news on May 7, when he had claimed that two of his cars, a Mercedes Benz and Toyota Fortuner, were forcibly taken away from him in 2017 allegedly by two inspectors working with the then Thane Police commissioner Param Bir Singh. Raut feared that his cars could have been used in Hiran’s murder.The National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is probing Hiran’s murder recorded Raut’s statement in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/man-who-said-his-cars-were-used-in-mansukh-hiran-case-booked-for-forgery-101623436826734.html

However, the application, which came up for hearing on Friday, was deferred after Bharadwaj’s counsel contended that as the National Investigation Agency (NIA) had taken over the investigation as per the NIA Act, the application should be heard by a two-judge bench, to which the court agreed and asked the registry to place the same before a division bench. When Bharadwaj’s application came up for hearing before the single judge bench of justice Sarang Kotwal, her counsel, advocate Dr Yug Choudhry, informed the court that the application had been filed as there was a delay in filing the charge sheet and hence, she was eligible for default bail as per the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). Dr Choudhry, however, submitted that as NIA had taken over the investigation last January, as per section 21 (2) of the NIA Act, all applications and appeals pertaining to its investigation should be heard by a division bench of HC and hence, the single bench could not hear the application. After NIA sought time to respond to the application, justice Kotwal agreed with Dr Choudhry’s contention and directed the registry to place the application before the appropriate division bench. Last month, Bharadwaj’s daughter Maaysha had filed a petition seeking treatment for her mother and bail on medical grounds.

12-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: PhD enrolment up by 36%, PG by 25%, shows AISHE 2019-20 report||Higher education is becoming more accessible to students with every passing year, shows recently released All Indian Survey of Higher Education (AISHE) report 2019-20. Once again Maharashtra has reported to have attracted the one of the highest number of students by enrolling over 3 million students across higher education institutes in the state, second only to Uttar Pradesh with 4.7 million enrolments.According to the report, admissions to postgraduate (PG) and PhD courses witnessed a 19.7% rise across the country, from around 169,000 enrolments in 2018-19. PhD figures in Maharashtra rose by over 36% in one year, from 8,796 to 11,983 in 2019-20.“In the last few years, several public and private universities in the state have been attracting the brightest of minds in the field of research. Even public universities are giving out post-doctoral degrees to more and more students with every passing year. This could be due to more research and PhD fellowships being given out by state and central bodies as well as availability of more guides across universities,” said a senior official from the University of Mumbai.Overall, the Bachelor in Arts (BA) course remained the most popular among students across the country once again this year. From 9.3 million students who enrolled for the course in 2018-19, the number stood at a staggering 9.65 million in 2019-20.After witnessing a decline in the overall enrolment in professional courses, especially engineering and technology, the figures seem better in 2019-20. As per the latest AISHE report, BTech and MTech programmes witnessed a marginal rise after almost hitting a four-year low in 2018-19.The enrolment for MTech stood at 135,500 in 2018-19 and 137,051 in 2019-20. Similarly, enrolment for BTech programmes stood at 2,125,043 in 2018-19 which rose to 2,147,962 in 2019-20. Many felt the decision of the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) to encourage introduction of new age courses like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data Science and Robotics in technical colleges could be the main reason for this push.“In 2020-21 year as well, Electronics and Communication sector managed to swoop in the best of minds and many also opted for BTech in AI and Data Science fields. Since jobs in electronics as well as AI sectors are gaining more popularity, students are very clear about their ambition and aiming for seats in specific departments,” said Gopakumaran Thampi, principal of Thadomal Shahani Engineering College, Bandra.Other professional courses, including undergraduate degrees in medical, dental and law courses too witnessed a rise in enrolment this year. MBBS enrolment in the country went up by over 7% from around 267,000 to 287,000 in 2019-20. Similarly, law aspirants’ enrolment went up by 9% from 364,000 to 398,000 in 2019-20.

At an all-time high, one litre of petrol was priced at ₹102.04, while diesel was available at ₹94.15. The prices of petrol and diesel witnessed a surge of 28 paise and 30 paise, respectively, on Friday. On Thursday, one litre of petrol was priced at ₹101.76, while diesel was available for ₹93.85 per litre. In neighbouring Thane, petrol and diesel were priced at ₹102.16 and ₹94.27 per litre on Friday. Fuel prices Mumbai have been on a rise since May 3. Transporters have termed the rise in fuel prices a “sadistic demeanour”. “The continuous rise in petrol and diesel prices has sadistic undertones. Common people are facing acute pressure on their household budget, mobility has become expensive, medical expenses have touched the ceiling, inflation is at an all-time high as the traders have increased the prices of their products, even as there is widespread job and salary cuts. Small operators, who constitute about 85% of the total commercial vehicle operators, are being forced to shut down their business and face extreme loss of livelihood. The government’s sadistic approach to the perils of the transporters and the citizens is despicable and appalling. We strongly protest against the continual hike of fuel prices as it is just financially crushing the people of the country,” said Bal Malkit Singh, chairman, All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fuel-prices-surge-again-in-mumbai-petrol-priced-at-102-04-litre-101623436646761.html

District magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma had constituted an expert team to find out the cause of algal bloom in the Ganga in Varanasi and instructed it to submit a report by June 10. The team comprised regional pollution control officer Kalika Singh, Ganga Pollution Control Unit general manager PC Agarwal, assistant commissioner of police (Dashashwamedh) Awadhesh Pandey and two other officials. Singh and a team of scientists of UPPCB did spot inspection in Ganga from Mirzapur to Varanasi and collected samples of water. UPPCB scientific officer Dr TN Singh said, “We collected samples of Ganga water from various stretches of the river to find out the cause of algal bloom. The samples were tested, and results revealed that algae strains drained into the river from Mirzapur district’s Chunar oxidation pond and STP. These algae flourished in Varanasi stretch of Ganga due to presence of nitrogen and phosphorous (though mild) which mainly come in the river water from untapped drains.” A 50 MLD untapped drain in Assi area is discharged in river Ganga. Likewise, another 10 MLD untapped Ramnagar drain also falls into the river. The nitrogen and phosphorus reach the river with the sewage water, according to Dr Singh, and nitrogen and phosphorous act as fertilizer for the algae. Moreover, a report about the findings had been prepared and it was submitted to the district magistrate, said a senior official at UPPCB. Regional pollution control officer Singh confirmed it. A UPPCB scientist said that algal bloom would end as soon as flow of Ganga water increased. Ganga conservation activist Rajesh Shukla said the algal bloom in the river in Varanasi was first seen around 20 days ago but it was washed away by rain after two days. The algal bloom returned around a week ago due to which the Ganga water looked green in certain stretches. He said efforts should be made to increase the flow of water. Shukla demanded that the untapped drains discharging into the river Ganga should be tapped as early as possible. Prof BD Tripathi, chairman of Mahamana Malviya Research Centre for Ganga, River Development and Water Resource Management (MMRC for Ganga), BHU, said algal bloom was not good for the health of aquatic animals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/algae-strains-from-mirzapur-stp-caused-algal-bloom-in-ganga-101623436527895.html

The civic body also began demolition of the adjacent ground-plus-three structure that started to tilt towards the ground. Malwani, located in the western suburb of Malad comes under P-North ward, one of the city’s most densely populated administrative wards of the BMC. It has one of the largest slum clusters in Mumbai with illegally constructed structures on land owned by state revenue department or the BMC. Sambhaji Adkune, deputy collector (encroachment and removal), said, “We are giving assistance to the BMC. The BMC will identify all structures that are dangerous or illegal.” After the collapse, the Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) vacated structures in the vicinity. Mohammad Asif, a resident who vacated his house, said, “We were allowed to take our documents and important belongings. We would not like to see a repeat of what happened on Wednesday night.”Another resident Rasheed Shah said, “We do not have any alternate arrangement of buying or renting a house for now, but we will somehow manage at our relatives’ house for a few days. I have not been getting enough wages for almost 15 months now due to the lockdown as the car garage where I worked is facing losses. The compensation is only for the dead and injured. What about us? We are losing our house.” Bharat Marathe, deputy civic commissioner, said, “A team of structural auditors will survey the area. Three- and more than two-storey structures will be priority. A report will be submitted to the municipal commissioner for further action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-building-collapse-bmc-to-survey-structures-in-area-101623436527298.html
12-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Doppler radar to remain defunct for two months, IMD begins testing new radar||The India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) doppler radar in Colaba is likely to remain defunct for at least the next two months, Dr MN Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences, told HT on Friday. Meanwhile, IMD on Thursday began operating its new C-band radar in Goregaon, only on an experimental basis for the time being. The radar launch, initially planned for December 2020, has been postponed. A doppler radar provides long-range weather surveillance, detection and forecast for rainfall, cloud formation, thunderstorms and other weather conditions such as tropical storms. There are different types of doppler radars. The one currently installed near the Regional Meteorological Centre in Colaba is an S-band radar which provides surveillance up to 450-500 kilometres. A C-band radar can provide surveillance up to 250-350 km while surveillance by an X-band radar is up to 100 km.“Our Colaba radar is in a bit of trouble. We have engaged the Bengaluru-based company that assembled it for repairs, but given the current scenario with Covid and the recent lockdown, it is bound to take some time. It is a very specialised work which has been delayed due to unavailability of resources. It might take two to three months before it is running again,” said Dr Rajeevan on Friday.“However, if all goes well, our second, C-band doppler radar in Mumbai suburbs should be operational by the end of the month. There are still some things which need to be arranged before that can happen. The machine needs to be calibrated, and a steady internet connection is still needed. We have asked MTNL to provide a reliable line, until then I think a dongle is being used for connectivity in an experimental setting,” Dr Rajeevan added.Independent meteorologists said this was an unfavourable scenario, particularly during monsoon. “Absence of the S-band radar leaves forecasters pretty much in the dark. A satellite image can help in predicting the movement of larger weather features, but for more specific, real-time and local forecasting, radar is essential,” said Akshay Deoras, an independent meteorologist and PhD student at the University of Reading, England.Experts said that though the C-band radar may likely be commissioned this month, the past performance of IMD’s Colaba radar does not inspire confidence. The Colaba doppler went defunct just before the arrival of Cyclone Tauktae last month. On December 4, 2017, when Cyclone Ockhi brushed past the Mumbai coast, the radar was not functional. The radar was also not functional on multiple days during extreme rainfall events in June and July 2019, and also on June 1, 2020, about 48 hours before Cyclone Nisarga made landfall in Maharashtra.“Past performance of the S-band radar has been quite sketchy, and one hopes this will not be the case with the new doppler. Also, it’s important to note that a C-band radar suffers from higher signal attenuation than S-band radars and one cannot be a substitute for the other. We need both to work in tandem to get forecasts of real value,” Deoras explained, expressing concern at the prospect of Mumbai not having a single operational radar for the next two months. “Relying mainly on satellite images, as IMD is currently doing, will not be able to accurately predict intense rainfall of the kind that occurred on June 9. This will have direct consequences for the people of the city,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-doppler-radar-to-remain-defunct-for-two-months-imd-begins-testing-new-radar-101623436350565.html

12-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra cabinet nod to climate fund plan for coastal restoration||The Maharashtra cabinet has given its assent to the implementation of a Global Climate Fund initiative — Enhancing Climate Resilience of India’s Coastal Communities — in four districts on the Konkan coast, including Palghar, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and Raigad.The six-year project, which is funded partly by the Green Climate Fund (GCF) through the United Nations Development Programme, partly by the Union environment ministry and partly by the state government, will aim to restore about 3,350 hectares of mangroves, 35 hectares of corals and 400 hectares of coastal watershed area in these districts, in addition to creating “climate-adaptive livelihoods” for coastal communities, in the form of aquaculture projects.The state government in its cabinet meeting on Thursday appointed the additional principal chief conservator of forests (APCCF), mangrove cell, as the state projector director, allowing him to open up a bank account to receive funding from the GCF.“Maharashtra’s contribution is about $19 million, while the MoEFCC is allocating another $20 million. The state governments of Orissa and Andhra, where the project is also being implemented, are contributing $20 million each, while the GCF is providing $43 million in all,” said Virendra Tiwari, APCCF, mangrove cell. Out of $43 million, Maharashtra will be getting a share of 11.43$.The targeted areas for the project in Maharashtra are Devgad, Malvan, Vengurla, Dapoli, Guhagar, Rajapur, Panvel, Uran, and Dahanu and Palghar. Initiatives in each of the four districts will be overseen by district-level steering committees (which are yet to be created), which in turn, will report to a state-level steering committee (headed by the chief secretary). “We have already submitted an annual work plan to UNDP. That is awaiting the chief secretary’s nod before work can start,” Tiwari said.Though specific numbers for Maharashtra were not provided, the scheme aims to create employment opportunities for 1.7 million beneficiaries across three states, of which, 50% are targeted to be women. Ornamental fisheries, crab culture, mussel farming, seaweed farming and oyster farming are some of the livelihood opportunities that the scheme intends to create over the next six years. For this purpose, the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) has already provided the mangrove cell with a list of creeks and inlets along the coast which may be conducive for these activities.“We will also need to conduct an assessment of where exactly the mangrove and coral restoration initiatives need to be implemented, for which an appropriate expert organisation will be engaged. While we have some experience with mangrove restoration, coral restoration requires specialists. The idea is to translocate corals into suitable environments and let them grow naturally. Local communities will be consulted and involved in the eco-restoration efforts,” said Tiwari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cabinet-nod-for-climate-fund-plan-for-coastal-restoration-101623436296467.html

12-06-2021||Noida||Cash, gold worth ₹25 crore, allegedly looted from flat, recovered; theft was never reported, say police||The Gautam Budh Nagar police on Friday arrested six men on charges of stealing valuables worth ₹25 crore, including 40 gold bars and cash, from a high-rise flat in Surajpur in September 2020. But what is puzzling the police is that till date, no theft of this magnitude was reported from Surajpur, leading them to believe that the looted valuables may be contraband or “black money”.Police said on questioning the suspects, they allegedly revealed that they committed the theft in September 2020. When police attempted to contact the flat owner, they could not trace him. Further investigation revealed that the flat owner had a case of extortion against him in Gurugram and the police suspect that the valuables may have been illegally amassed. According to police, an informant had tipped them off about two men who were allegedly involved in a crime. When the two were apprehended in Noida’s Salarpur, police found 1kg of gold biscuits with each of them. When questioned, they allegedly confessed to having stolen the valuables from a high-rise flat, along with eight others. That information led to the arrest of four more suspects.Deputy commissioner of police (Zone 1) Rajesh S said two gangs had tied up to carry out the loot. “The suspects said after the theft, each of them received four gold biscuits and ₹65 lakh cash as their share from the mastermind,” he said.Police recovered 13kg gold biscuits, jewellery worth ₹6.55 crore, an SUV, documents of property worth ₹1 crore and ₹57 lakh from the suspects.The mastermind of the operation -- police identified him as Gopal, who is currently on the run -- allegedly held all the details of the theft and the arrested men could only give police the name of the society where the flat is located.“Suspects in custody claim that they had only specific information about the owner who, along with his father, is currently outside the country. But he has several family members in the city but no one came forward to report the robbery and neither are they co-operating with the investigation,” said a senior police officer, who did not wish to be named.Police said they suspect that the flat owner may be involved in several more extortion cases and that he probably did not report the crime as the valuables were possibly obtained illegally. “The case is being referred to the income tax department and the Enforcement Directorate. Meanwhile, we are on the lookout for the rest of the gang of robbers,” said Rajesh.The six suspects were booked under Section 414 (assisting in concealment or disposal of stolen property, knowing it to be stolen) of the Indian Penal Code at the Sector 39 police station, and sent to judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/cash-gold-worth-25-crore-allegedly-looted-from-flat-recovered-theft-was-never-reported-say-police-101623436295892.html

The court also warned that if there are more instances of building collapses, it would hold the corporations responsible. The court observations came in light of four building collapses reported in Ulhasnagar and Mumbai in the past one month, which led to deaths of 24 persons and left 23 others injured. The court also sought to know from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) as to the mechanism by which such unauthorised constructions come up and the extra-legal processes employed for the same. On Friday, a four-judge bench comprising chief justice Dipankar Datta, justice AA Sayyed, justice SS Shinde and justice Prasanna Varale was hearing a suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) instituted last year in light of the lockdown and pandemic. The bench said as the current situation was unclear it was extending the interim orders against demolition, eviction and dispossession till July 9. The bench had also taken note of the building collapses in Mumbai and neighbouring Ulhasnagar and sought the presence of all civic corporations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Regio. In the afternoon session, the chief justice along with justice Girish Kulkarni questioned the civic authorities, especially BMC and Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC), as to how the four buildings — two in each corporation limits — had collapsed, resulting in death of 24 persons. “The issue of the building collapse and the deaths pain us and we want this to stop. Eight innocent children lost their lives at Malad,” observed the bench. The court took note that residents of dilapidated structures were taking refuge using the HC’s interim order which stayed all demolitions, eviction and dispossession of properties, and said that if the civic authorities faced problems in getting dilapidated buildings, that needed immediate demolition, vacated they could always approach the court and HC would pave the way for them. Taking exception to the two collapses in Mumbai, the bench asked BMC as to why it was not able to curb such instances while it had taken appreciable measures to combat the Covid pandemic. Chief Justice Datta then questioned senior counsel Anil Sakhare about the mechanism or dashboard which BMC follows while stopping mushrooming of unauthorised structures. He stated that the civic authorities along with elected representatives of each ward should be held answerable for such incidents and said the HC would initiate judicial inquiries to unmask those guilty of allowing unauthorised structures to come up. On the suggestion by amicus curiae advocate Sharan Jagtiani, the court ordered a judicial inquiry into the building collapse and said it would name the court commissioner in the order. The bench also sought to know the modus operandi adopted by the people responsible for the unauthorised structures and asked the state to respond on its query on how a legislation was passed to regularise illegal and unauthorised structures at Ulhasnagar, and posted hearing of the replies after two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-orders-judicial-inquiry-into-malwani-house-collapse-101623436286703.html
12-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai building collapse: Owner knew that building was dangerous, say neighbours||Rizwan Siddique, owner of the Malwani building that collapsed on Wednesday night, leading to death of 12 people, allegedly knew about the precarious condition of the ground-plus-three storey structure, but could not repair it in time because of financial difficulties, his neighbours told the local police.Malwani police registered a first information report (FIR) against Siddique, who has lost nine family members in the tragedy, and building contractor Ramzan Shaikh under sections 304(II) (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.Police on Friday recorded statements of some local residents and neighbours of Siddique who told the police that some of them had apprised Siddique about cracks in the structure, but he did not undertake repairs in time.“Some witnesses said that a week ago, they had warned Siddique about damage to the structure, but he chose to delay repairs due to financial difficulties, as his food stall was shut last year during the lockdown,” said an officer from Malwani police station.Some locals said the building was built on a drain infested with rats and that the walls of the building had developed cracks and become weak due to heavy rain.Police arrested contractor Ramzan Nabi Shaikh, who had constructed the building, late on Thursday evening. In his statement, he said the house was built more than eight years ago and he did not recollect the details.He has been remanded in police custody till June 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-building-collapse-owner-knew-that-building-was-dangerous-say-neighbours-101623436106727.html
12-06-2021||Delhi||Monsoon to arrive in Delhi on June 15, ahead of schedule: IMD||The south-west monsoon is set to reach Delhi and most of north-west India by June 15, almost a fortnight ahead of schedule, due to a low pressure system building up over the Bay of Bengal, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Friday.The Met’s forecast also said that pre-monsoon showers are expected to start in the Capital from Saturday, and intensify on Sunday and Monday. This, weather analysts said, will lead to moderate to heavy rainfall, hail and thunderstorms, and bring down day temperatures in parts of the city to around 34 degrees Celsius.Some parts of Delhi got light rain and dust storms late on Thursday and early on Friday morning.The monsoon usually arrives in Delhi by June 27-28, and Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said it was set to advance swiftly this year due to weather conditions in the northern Bay of Bengal. “The reason behind this sudden advancement is the formation of a low-pressure system over northern Bay of Bengal. When a low-pressure area is formed at the onset of monsoon, it creates conditions that conducive for the advancement of monsoon.”He said that, except for some parts of Rajasthan and Gujarat, the monsoon is likely to cover all of north-west India by June 15.HT reported on Friday that the monsoon was racing across the country after arriving two days late in Kerala, and was likely to cover the entire country a fortnight ahead of the usual July 8 date under favourable conditions.Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, Skymet Weather Services, also said that the monsoon was likely to arrive by next week in Delhi.“A trough has formed over Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, covering Odisha and the monsoon activity will move along this trough. On Saturday, Delhi will start receiving patchy rain, and by Sunday and Monday, it will intensify,” he said.He added that while pre-monsoon showers are usually thundery, monsoon showers are characterised by uniform rain, and the transition is likely by Tuesday. “We can foretell monsoon arrival by patchy rain, increase in humidity, and persistent cloudiness.”Weather analysts said that the monsoon’s progress over the entire country has advanced in recent years. “We issued new monsoon onset and withdrawal dates last year after we noticed that monsoon dates had advanced in some parts while it was delayed in others due to many factors, including global climate change. The thresholds have changed,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, Union ministry of earth sciences.“For example, the new onset dates are delayed by three to seven days in many parts of central, west and east India, while the complete coverage of monsoon in the country has advanced. This year is exceptional because monsoon has covered parts of central India very early. Monsoon covered the entire country by June-end in the past also, but this year, its trajectory is exceptional,” he added.The weather pattern since August 2020 has thrown up a surprise and broken a historical record every single month -- either by being hotter, wetter, or colder than usual. This, for example, is likely to be the first June to not get a single heatwave day as rain brings down the temperature further.Met officials and scientists said that while the extreme weather recordings were the result of temporary atmospheric events in and around the national capital, the larger role of the climate crisis in the overall shifting of weather patterns was evident as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/monsoon-to-arrive-in-delhi-on-june-15-ahead-of-schedule-imd-101623434486621.html
12-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi skill university to start student intake this year||Education minister Manish Sisodia on Friday announced that the upcoming Delhi Skill and Entrepreneurship University (DSEU) will start admitting students from this academic session (2021-2022) and said the university will focus on conducting 360-degree assessment along with reaching out to schools to identify students’ interests, talent and mindset for entrepreneurship.DSEU will start admissions in July 2021 and the academic session for the degree courses will begin in September. Given the current circumstances, the university has developed a merit-based selection process, which will shortlist candidates premised on their performance in class 12 exams, vocational subjects in class 10 and 12, and their extracurricular activities in the last five years.The Delhi government established the DSEU in Dwarka last year. The university will offer 12 job-oriented undergraduate courses, including BA in Digital Media, BA in Business Management, BA in Data Analytics, and BA in Aesthetics and Beauty, among others. Initially, the university will admit 6,000 students of which, 4,500 will be enrolled in diploma courses and 1,500 in degree courses.In a statement issued by the Delhi government on Friday, Sisiodia said, “The admission process of the DESU will be such that the university will go to schools to extend admissions to all those children who want to be involved in skills learning. DSEU will focus on conducting a 360-degree assessment. While most universities are continuing with their old practice of admitting students based on grades, DSEU will be the first university in India that will focus on the overall interests, talent, and mindset of students. Such practice is new in India but is not unpopular abroad.”“Universities such as Oxford in the UK admit students based on the courses and projects they do, and not on grades in board exams. Similarly, our children now can now be certain of the fact that they will get admitted into a university that will not stress on their grades but on their intent and their interest to study skills and become entrepreneurs,” the education minister said.Sisodia on Friday also interacted with principals of Delhi government schools, the vice-chancellor of DSEU, Neharika Vohra, and MLA Atishi Marlena, through a webinar to discuss the admission plan for the university. “The purpose of this university is to impart confidence to every student, irrespective of his/her calibre. Generic undergraduate courses do not encourage our students to become entrepreneurs. We cannot think that our children will study generic and archaic courses to be future ready. They need to be equipped with adequate skills…”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-skill-university-to-start-student-intake-from-next-academic-year-101623434247194.html
12-06-2021||Other||Civil society members seek to extend 45-day deadline for raising objections||Citing restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic, civil society members want the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to extend the deadline for submitting suggestions or objections to the draft Master Plan of Delhi-2041 (MPD-2041).While DDA officials said there are no plans to extend the deadline, they said the land-owning body is planning public interactions to clear the air regarding the implementation of MPD-2041. Civil society members too have demanded awareness campaigns by DDA in slum clusters and unauthorised colonies to tell people about the provisions of the draft plan.As per the DDA’s MPD-2041 notification dated June 9, suggestions and objections have to be submitted within 45 days (July 24). While the 45-day period is in accordance to the DDA Act which mandates a period of 30-45 days for receiving objections and suggestions, civil society members said the pandemic and ensuing restrictions is ground for extending the deadline.Mukta Naik, a fellow at Centre for Policy Research, said, “This is the critical time when we want to take the proposal back to informal settlements and various workers’ groups and unions. Tell them about the provisions and help them fill up the forms. It is difficult to mobilise people during the pandemic due to the restrictions, especially in 45 days. It is important to get the views of the people who are in majority in the city.”It is learnt that the DDA is planning public interaction sessions to clear doubts related to the draft plan. A senior DDA official said, “We will explain or clear doubts related to the draft plan before they submit their suggestions/objections.”Stressing on the need to extend the deadline for submission from 45 days to six months, Shalakha, coordinator of Main Bhi Dilli, a campaign aimed at making planning in Delhi more representative and inclusive, said, “It is not just the pandemic, people are struggling with related crises like unemployment, homelessness, lack of food, education and financial insecurity. If the duration is not extended, then the draft would lack views and suggestions/objections from the public.”She said that as the entire consultation process is going to be online this time, those living in informal settlements will not be able to participate. “Last year, only a few could join the consultation meetings organised by the DDA due to technical barriers. To ensure maximum participation, it is important that on-ground consultation meetings are organised by DDA officials with all the Covid precautionary norms so that people do not face any technical and language barrier,” said Shalakha.Shakeel Abdul, convener of Basti Suraksha Manch, said, “The present provision will only ensure limited participation from people. There is a need to have on-ground consultations, especially with people in the informal settlements. There are provisions related to rental housing, in-situ redevelopment etc, which impacts these people directly. Before they can give their suggestions, there is a need to create awareness about the MPD-2041.”A senior DDA official said, “People can also manually submit their suggestions/objections with the DDA. So far, there is no plan to extend the duration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mpd2041civil-society-members-seek-to-extend-45-day-deadline-for-raising-objections-101623434006583.html
12-06-2021||Pune||PMC razes 35 illegal structure violating river’s “blue line” in Baner||PUNE Following the orders from National Green Tribunal (NGT), the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Friday, razed 35 shops built illegally on survey numbers 191 to 195 in Baner. All the structures were on the “blue line” of the river in Baner. The blue line demarcates the flood line of the water body.The roads were blocked by slow moving traffic with people gathering in groups to see the shops being razed. “The NGT, in February 2020, passed orders to clear unauthorised or illegal constructions in the blue line area of Baner. Due to the Corona pandemic, this could not be done. Hence on June 11, 2021, the building permission department took this decision and began clearing the structures,” said Yuvraj Deshmukh, superintending engineer, building department. City engineer Prashant Waghmare and Shrikant Waidande, executive engineer, PMC, were present at the site. Armed with JCBs, gas cutters 20 workers, anti-encroachment personnel, and 17 police personnel, the PMC began the action against the illegal constructions. The action took seven hours, beginning at11 am until 6pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-razes-35-illegal-structure-violating-river-s-blue-line-in-baner-101623426929099.html
12-06-2021||Pune||PMC announces more relaxations in Pune from Monday as Covid positivity rate drops below 5%||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) announced further easing of Covid-induced curbs from Monday (June 14) following a decision taken by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar during the Covid review meeting on Friday. Under the third round of unlocking, malls, libraries and coaching classes have been allowed to reopen, restaurants to allow dine-in till 10 pm with 50% capacity while other shops can operate till 7 pm, according to the order released by the civic administration. However, standalone non-essential shops will remain closed on weekends. Gardens along with open grounds will now remain open even during evening between 4pm and 7pm on all days. During the first round, non-essential shops were allowed to function while in the next round implemented last week, restaurants with dine-in till 4 pm and public transport were allowed. Under the new guidelines, gathering of more than five people has been prohibited in PMC limits and curfew will be imposed post 10 pm.The decision on relaxations was taken after Pune city’s positivity rate for the past four days was reported below 5% and the average positivity rate was recorded at 4.95% with reduction in oxygen bed occupancy last week to 23.33%. These factors made the city qualified for Level 2. However, not all relaxations applicable under Level 2 have been adopted in the city. “These relaxations will be in place from June 14 till further orders. These will be subjected to review depending on changes in positivity rate and O2 bed occupancy,” stated Vikram Kumar, Pune municipal commissioner, in his order issued on evening. Though further relaxations have been declared in PMC limits, Pune guardian Minister Pawar cautioned against recklessness in Covid compliance. “Covid has not gone away. It is essential to follow Covid appropriate norms. Some relaxations are given in PMC because its positivity rate has gone down. They will continue only if the positivity rate remains low. Experts have raised concerns about opening up and we have to be cautious,” said Pawar at a press interaction after the Covid review meeting. HT in its Friday edition had reported about the decision on unlock. The announcement was prompted after the city fulfilled the criteria of Level 2 restrictions defined by the state administration based on positivity rate. Curbs remain in PCMC, rural Pune There are no relaxations given in rural parts of the district even as the positivity rate has been reported below 10%. Pimpri-Chinchwad will also not see any changes in Covid curbs. “No relaxations have been offered in the rural parts of the district which is currently under Level 4 restrictions. Officials said that the positivity rate in rural parts varies from tehsil to tehsil and hence it was decided to continue with the existing restrictions in rural parts. Pune’s Velhe tehsil has the lowest positivity rate at 6%, but other tehsils border near 10%. According to the state guidelines, we cannot issue separate orders for each tehsil. So, for now, the restrictions in rural parts will continue,” said Saurabh Rao, divisional commissioner, Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-announces-more-relaxations-in-pune-from-monday-as-positivity-rate-drops-below-5-101623422125860.html
12-06-2021||Delhi||Sandeep Kala’s journey from petty crime to being the most wanted||In Delhi’s Mandoli jail complex, wrestler Sushil Kumar, a two-time Olympic medallist, is watched round-the-clock through CCTV cameras inside his cell. There is a guard outside his cell too. The prison officers are on high alert. Last week, gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, who was seen as a potential threat to Kumar’s life, was shifted to Tihar jail, about 32km from Mandoli. Delhi Police and Intelligence Bureau officials alerted the prison department that Kumar, arrested for murder, has a threat to his life from Sandeep Kala, 36, the most wanted man by the police. Kala is Bishnoi’s top lieutenant, who is currently running their gang’s operation.In the last two years, Kala has become the most wanted man, accused of crimes such as murder, extortion, and robbery. He carries a reward of ₹7 lakh for his arrest and is wanted by the police of four states. Kala was first arrested by a police constable while snatching a cell phone 17 years ago. It was his first crime and the start of a second life, in which he would be feared and become the most wanted fugitive in the national Capital.Also Read | Sagar Dhankad murder case: Another wrestler arrestedThe beginningBorn in 1984 in Jatheri in Sonipat, Haryana, about 69km from the National Capital, he completed schooling from his village before taking admission to an Industrial Training Institute in Sonipat. His police dossier says he fell in bad company and started demanding money from his parents, “who were not rich enough.”To earn money, Kala worked as a cable operator in his village during the early 2000s and came in touch with the cable mafia. “Those were days before Netflix and Amazon. Many local criminal gangs made money by wielding their influence over cable operations in a particular area. Every gang had dominance in a particular area. The power of a gang was gauged by the number of houses to which they provided cable networks. It was then that Kala came in touch with criminal elements,” said an officer of the crime branch, who has seen files on Kala.With the money earned from the cable business not enough, Kala tried his hand at snatching. It is unclear how many phones or gold chains he had snatched before being arrested for the first time outside a wine shop in Delhi’s Samaipur Badli.On September 29, 2004, he snatched the phone but was caught. For this crime, he spent four months in jail. These four months, police believe, would be Kala’s most formative years in his transition. “He did not look back or get reformed after coming out of Tihar jail. In fact, he graduated to bigger crimes such as robbery and extortion with his accomplices within a few months. But he was still a low-level criminal until that time,” the officer added.In 2012, his name made it to the list of the Haryana Police most wanted when he along with his three associates rammed a prison van with a truck near Dulina village of Jhajjar district and opened fire, killing three prisoners and injuring two policemen. “The killed prisoners were Bhagwan gang members, including the kingpin Shree Bhagwan, his brother Dilbagh and Anil Fauji. The attack was the fallout of a longstanding rivalry between the Bhagwan gang and Anil Chippi, for whom Kala was working,” said assistant commissioner of police Preetpal Singh Sangwan from Gurugram (Haryana) Police’s crime branch.Kala was later arrested and convicted for life in that case. He remained in jail for nearly eight years – from 2012 till February 2020, when he was released by his associates following a dramatic attack on the prison van in which he was being taken to Bhondsi jail from Faridabad court. Three assailants were chased and arrested but Kala managed to escape.His return to crime in Delhi “The bullet this time has hit the glass, next time it will hit your chest. Find someone who can save your life.” This was a handwritten message on a small piece of paper that a group of assailants left on the windscreen of a jeweller’s car after firing several bullets outside his shop in southwest Delhi’s Najafgarh in June last year. The same month, six similar threatening slips were thrown outside business establishments or houses of businessmen in southwest Delhi’s Najafgarh, Bindapur, and Baba Haridas Nagar within a week. There slips mentioned the name of “Kala Jatheri Group.” Also, all the firing and threatening slip-throwing incidents followed calls made through encrypted internet-calling platforms by persons who identified themselves as Kala Jatheri.“The back-to-back firing incidents left us as well as the higher-ups baffled not because they all were committed for extortion but the fact that the crimes were seen as an alert about the entry of a new player (Kala Jatheri) who was desperate to fill the void created in Delhi’s crime world after the arrest of some top wanted gangsters such as Jitender alias Gogi and Neeraj Bawana,” said a crime branch officer, who has arrested members of Kala’s gang.Such calls and threats spread fear among traders in outer Delhi, police said.“Apart from the extortion cases registered at different police stations, we know that there are nearly a dozen instances wherein traders succumbed to Kala’s extortion demands and never reported the matter. His gang is mostly targeting bookies, jewellers, and property dealers,” a second officer said.Deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Sanjeev Kumar Yadav said Kala is the most wanted gangster and multiple teams from Delhi and the adjoining states are looking for him and his gang members. “We have arrested many of Kala’s associates in the past few months and our operation against them is continuing.”From the interrogation of his gang members, police have learnt that during his stay in Haryana jails between 2012 and 2020, Kala come in close contact with members of the Bishnoi gang.“As per our intelligence inputs, as Bishnoi learnt about the deportation of key aide Raju Basodi’s from Thailand, he did not want to lose his grip on the extortion and contract killing business in the north Indian states. So, he planned Kala’s release from Faridabad court last year. Our informers say that after his escape Kala fled to Punjab and started working to expand the syndicate’s footprints in Delhi-NCR as well,” an officer from the special cell, who wished not to be named, said.In less than a year, the Kala gang has committed several heinous crimes, including extortion as well as contract and revenge killings in Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Punjab. His name also emerged in the killing of youth Congress leader Gurlal Singh Bhalwan in Punjab’s Faridkot in February. His involvement is suspected in nearly 300 such cases, said Sangwan.Though no police officer, authorised to issue press statements, confirmed that Kala has fled abroad, many mid level officers said Kala has fled to Dubai and he is running his operations from there. His gang members have confirmed this. With over 200 known members, Kala Jathedi gang is the biggest and strongest gang in Delhi and its adjoining states.“Kala is a gangster with whom no criminal in the NCR region wants enmity. Even criminal Jitender Gogi, who was until last year Delhi police most wanted, supports Kala.It is evident from the fact that Kala’s involvement also surfaced in the release of Gogi’s key hitman, Kuldeep Maan, from police’s custody following a gunfight at GTB Hospital on March 25,” a crime branch officer, who probed the escape case, said.Kala’s name surfaces again in Sushil Kumar caseSushil Kumar has been arrested for allegedly murdering fellow wrestler Sagar Dhankad on May 4. That evening along with Dhankad, Kumar allegedly beat another person, Sonu Mahal. Mahal is Kala’s nephew.Sensing a threat to Kumar’s life, during his court hearings, Kumar was guarded by commandos from the police’s Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team. Such commandos are used only in cases of high threat. SWAT teams have in the past been used to escort gangster Abu Salem and Indian Mujahideen terrorist Yasin Bhatkal.On June 3, when Kumar was sent to Mandoli jail in judicial custody, police handed the jail authorities a file with the names of all suspected members of Kala’s gang. For his safety, Kumar has been allotted a single cell and is constantly watched. Over the last few days, prison authorities have held many closed-door meetings to decide if Kumar should be kept in Mandoli or be transferred to the more secure Tihar jail. The Tihar complex is bigger (spread over 400 acres) and has better security, but it also has many jailed prisoners who belong to the Kala gang. The jail authorities will take a call next week.A prison officer, who was part of the meetings, said on condition of anonymity, “Kumar may be caged but he is the safest inside the prison. The real threat is outside when he steps out on bail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sandeep-kala-s-journey-from-petty-crime-to-being-the-most-wanted-101623413669642.html
12-06-2021||Delhi||Master Plan’s push for dust control could accelerate Delhi’s action plan||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA)’s draft Master Plan for 2041 released this week envisages a sustainable infrastructure for Delhi and also highlights the problem of dust pollution in the city. The document, which will steer the city’s development for the next two decades, has suggested all developmental projects should strictly follow dust mitigation measures to deal with the pollution. It also seeks to ensure that construction material, building, and demolition waste is handled in an eco-friendly manner.The DDA has proposed a dedicated dust management plan by Central Pollution Control Board, the apex body monitoring and strategising pollution control measures. It has said the plan should be used as a handbook for construction agencies in the city.DDA’s suggestions are expected to be the much-needed push for the city’s dust control measures. Authorities have imposed fines on construction agencies, made smog guns and water sprinklers mandatory at building sites, and ordered high panels and sheets to cover construction material as part of its seasonal measures to control dust ahead of the winter pollution season. Experts say the measures are often reactive and do not achieve much in the longer run. They argue while the government and pollution monitoring agencies battle Delhi’s winter pollution, the city is engulfed in a haze of dust through most part of the year, especially coarse PM 10 (particulate matter with a diameter less than 10 micrometres). This is due to the continuous construction activities, un-swept roads, and dust storms that are common in northwest India during summer.Also Read | A vision for Delhi-2041A 2015 Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur source and inventory study showed that during summer in Delhi, the overall average concentration of PM10 was over 500ug/m3, against the national ambient air quality standard of 100ug/m3. The study highlighted that crustal dust accounted for about 40% of the total particulate matter in summer. It concluded it is undeniable that air in Delhi is several times more polluted in winter because of an increased contribution of PM 2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 micrometres mostly from combustion). It suggested steps to check road dust as part of measures to improve air quality holistically in summer.Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead, Council on Energy Environment and Water, said cities across the country need to tackle dispersed sources of pollution such as open burning of waste, dust from construction sites and unpaved roads. “Pollution control boards and urban local bodies should have dedicated field inspection teams to identify such sources and ensure that they are addressed,” she said. “Secondly, we also need robust citizen grievance redressal mechanisms. The Green Delhi mobile application (which enables registration of complaints about violation of anti-pollution norms) is a great move but citizens should be encouraged to use it more actively.”The weather also plays a role in determining air quality. Delhi’s air quality on Tuesday and Wednesday suddenly deteriorated and reached the “very poor” category. After cleaner air for over two months because of the Covid-19 lockdown, Delhi’s air quality for the first time since February slipped under the danger mark.India Meteorological Department said the haze in Delhi recently was due to the impact of dust carrying storm from Rajasthan that settled over the region, pushing the air quality index to the poor zone. These storms are common during this time of year. Around May-June, south-westerly winds from Rajasthan often carry high quantities of dust.Environmentalists say the Aravalli range stood as a barrier for these dust storms and prevented them from entering the Capital. The range has shrunk by nearly 40% over the last 40 years.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment, said dust on its own is not life-threatening. She added in a metropolitan city like Delhi, it gets mixed with substances such as vehicular emissions, industrial fumes, residue from waste burning, and other combustion and becomes toxic.These coarse particles break down into finer particles (such as PM 2.5 or PM 1) as they constantly remain suspended in the air. The particles can easily seep into human organs or even into the bloodstreams.Roychowdhury called for the need to tackle pollution levels in Delhi as a year-long problem. “It is promising that through the Master Plan 2041, the DDA has tried to acknowledge that pollution is a multi-sectoral issue. We will need to plug all the sources and all agencies concerned will have to be roped in to make a visible impact.”Dr D J Christopher, who heads pulmonary medicine at Vellore’s Christian Medical College, said Indians have 35% reduced lung capacity due to air pollution in comparison to Caucasians. “Air pollution was the second-highest risk factor in India, second only to child and maternal malnutrition.”The DDA has also suggested a “robust monitoring framework for tackling environmental parameters”. “Data collected from such monitoring shall be regularly published through online platforms to improve awareness about these issues. Crowdsourcing of information may be explored for parameters like air pollution and noise levels, reporting on illegal dumping of solid and liquid wastes into greens and water bodies,” says the draft Master Plan.Delhi has 37 air quality monitoring stations. IIT-Kanpur scientists, in collaboration with a Mumbai-based environmental start-up, have also installed over 30 micro-monitors, which help get more localised pollution recordings.SN Tripathi, who leads the National Clean Air Programme, said that more sensors will ensure more thorough data and that eventually will help Delhi efficiently manage the pollution sources. “If I want to go out for a run or I have a senior citizen or a child at home and want to know the air quality levels in my area, I need to know the pollution level in my location. In a mega-city like Delhi, we still do not have enough air quality monitoring sensors.”The draft Master Plan also suggests the involvement of citizens in controlling pollution. “Citizens and other stakeholders play a critical role in managing pollution at the local level. All concerned agencies shall take steps to improve awareness, and provide adequate and reliable information to engage stakeholders as implementation partners.”SN Tripathi, who leads the National Clean Air Programme, said that more sensors will ensure more thorough data, and that eventually will help Delhi efficiently manage the pollution sources. “If I want to go out for a run or I have a senior citizen or a child at home and want to know the air quality levels in my area, I need to know the pollution level in my location.

In his complaint, Haji cited a debate on a Malayalam news channel quoting Sultana purportedly calling Patel a “bio-weapon”. He said her words were in “bad taste and intended to create hatred and aversion in the minds of people.” According to the FIR lodged by Kavaratti police, a case under sections 124 A (sedition) and 153 B (hate speech) of the Indian Penal code has been registered against the filmmaker. She has been summoned to the police station on Monday.Sultana said she used the word but did not attack the country or the Union government. “I was referring to some of the decisions of Patel which infuriated local people. Despite popular sentiment, he continues to antagonise people. As a local resident I have right to criticise him,” she said in a Facebook post.Meanwhile, several local BJP leaders on Friday protested against the sedition charge slapped against the filmmaker.Lakshadweep Sahitya Pravarthaka Sangam, a body of writers, has come out in support of Sultana.The Supreme Court on May 31 expressed concern over the misuse of India’s sedition law and said it will define the contours of the colonial era penal provision to indicate what does and does not constitute sedition.For over a month, residents of the archipelago have been protesting against the administrator, saying his moves will affect the “unique culture and tradition” of the island. The draft Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation that Patel has introduced proposes to develop the islands as a major tourist destination. Residents allege it will destroy the islands’ character and identity since 97% of the islands is covered by pristine forests and 95% of its Muslim population belongs to the Scheduled Tribe category.Many parliamentarians, former bureaucrats and artists have described the draft regulations as arbitrary and aimed against the community of the islands.The Kerala assembly passed a unanimous resolution seeking the recall of the administrator. As many as 93 retired bureaucrats sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticising the “partisan attitude” of the new administrator and urged him to protect the unique culture and tradition of the islands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sedition-case-slapped-on-lakshadweep-filmmaker-for-remark-about-administrator-101623405205591.html

At least 1,300 Indian SIM cards were smuggled to China,” said SS Guleria, DIG BSF (South Bengal Frontier), adding that the accused's statements need to be verified.It is not clear, for instance, how they managed to procure such a large number of SIM cards in the first place. Interrogation also revealed that Junwe’s associates used to hide the SIM cards in their undergarments to smuggle them out of India.Han Junwe, a resident of Hubei in China, was arrested by the BSF when he was trying to enter the country through the Indo-Bangla border in Malda district on Thursday. One of his associates, Sun Jiang, was arrested by the UP police earlier this year.Also Read | New moon tide to hit today, coastal districts of Bengal on alertSun Jiang named him as an accomplice during his interrogation by the UP police and the process to issue a Blue notice was initiated. A Blue Notice is issued to collect additional information about a person’s identity, location or activities in relation to a crime.Han Junwe told his interrogators soon after his arrest that his request for an Indian visa was rejected after Sun Jiang’s arrest, leaving him with no option but to try to enter India either via Bangladesh or Nepal.In his initial interrogation, Han Junwe also told BSF officers that he owns a hotel in Gurugram and has been to India at least four times since 2010. While some of the hotel staffers are Chinese, some Indian nationals have also been employed at the hotel, he said, according to the police.The BSF has handed over the case to the West Bengal Police. A four-member team of the Anti-Terrorist Squad of Uttar Pradesh Police reached Malda on Friday morning to interrogate the accused and take over the case."It is here that the role of specialised agencies like the ATS and NIA comes into play.

12-06-2021||World||US rolls out major bills to clip Big Tech’s wings||US lawmakers unveiled sweeping antitrust measures Friday aimed at tempering the dominance of Big Tech firms including Apple and Facebook, in what may be the most ambitious effort in decades to break corporate monopolies.A bipartisan group of House members introduced five separate bills that propose changes so comprehensive they could reshape the largest US technology and entertainment companies and force an overhaul of their business practices.In a bid to ward off corporate consolidation, the measures would make it harder for mega-companies like Amazon and Google to buy out smaller competitors, and facilitate the breakup of firms that use their dominant position in their core business to make deep inroads into another."Right now, unregulated tech monopolies have too much power over our economy," the House Judiciary's Antitrust Subcommittee chairman David Cicilline, a Democrat, said in introducing the measures."They are in a unique position to pick winners and losers, destroy small businesses, raise prices on consumers, and put folks out of work."The goal, he said, is to "level the playing field" and ensure that powerful tech companies follow the same rules as other businesses.The bills follow a 16-month investigation by the Antitrust Subcommittee into the state of competition in the digital marketplace, and particularly the unregulated power wielded by Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.Silicon Valley giants have come under increasing fire in Europe and the United States due to concerns about monopoly-like power.And US President Joe Biden and other G7 countries are keen to set a global tax rate of at least 15 percent on multinational firms, in a bid to optimize tax revenue from tech behemoths.'Power over innovation'The antitrust bills need to be debated and voted favorably out of the Judiciary Committee before receiving a vote by the full House of Representatives.They would also need approval from the Senate before they could be signed into law by Biden.One of the bills increases the fees for mergers so that regulators have more funds to police corporations and enforce antitrust laws."Big Tech has abused its dominance in the marketplace to crush competitors, censor speech, and control how we see and understand the world," said House Republican Ken Buck, who took direct aim at some of the largest players."Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google have prioritized power over innovation and harmed American businesses and consumers in the process."The reform effort comes amid heightened scrutiny of large tech platforms which have increased their dominance during the coronavirus pandemic.US state and federal antitrust enforcers last year filed suits targeting Facebook and Google alleging illegal dominance of their respective markets.And last month Amazon was hit with an antitrust suit from the capital Washington, which claimed the tech giant abuses its dominant position in online retail sales, harming consumers.The Computer & Communications Industry Association, of which Google, Amazon and Facebook are members, warned that the latest legislation is too "interventionist" and could mark the biggest departure from US antitrust policy in a century."At a time when consumers are frustrated with higher prices and fewer options in other segments of the economy, it's perplexing that the Committee would not prioritize broad reform" rather than narrow action against a few companies, CCIA President Matthew Schruers said in a statement."Writing regulations for a handful of businesses will skew competition and leave consumers worse off."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-rolls-out-major-bills-to-clip-big-tech-s-wings-101623521482084.html

The steps include slashing the time taken to develop and license vaccines, treatments and diagnostics for future disease to under 100 days.The G7 - Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US - will publish the pact on Sunday, alongside its final communique containing further details on the B3W.“The #CarbisBayDeclaration marks a proud and historic moment for us all,” British PM Boris Johnson tweeted. “The world’s leading democracies will commit to preventing a pandemic from happening again, ensuring the devastation caused by Covid-19 is never repeated.”World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus welcomed the health pact, saying the UN agency will examine a British proposal to create a “Global Pandemic Radar” to send early warnings of future outbreaks.Boris warns EU over post-Brexit tradeBritain will do “whatever it takes” to protect its territorial integrity in a trade dispute with the EU, Johnson said, threatening emergency measures if no solution was found. The threat seemed to break a temporary truce in a war of words over part of the Brexit deal that covers border issues with Northern Ireland, the focus for tensions since Britain left the EU last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g7-pact-on-pandemics-pledge-to-contain-china-101623520986672.html

The bidding closed seven minutes after the auction began. The identity of the winner - presumably an ultra-wealthy space aficionado - was not immediately disclosed.The July 20 launch of Blue Origin's New Shepard booster from West Texas would be a landmark moment as U.S. firms strive toward a new era of private commercial space travel.Blue Origin's founder and Amazon.com Inc executive Bezos, the world's wealthiest man and a lifelong space enthusiast, has been racing against fellow aspiring billionaire aeronauts Richard Branson and Elon Musk to be the first of the three to travel beyond Earth's atmosphere."To see the earth from space, changes you. It changes your relationship with this planet, with humanity," Bezos said in a video before the final bidding took place, adding that his brother Mark will join him on the trip.As the month-long bidding process leading up to the live auction closed on Thursday, the winning figure stood at $4.8 million, fueled by entries from more than 6,000 people from at least 143 countries, Blue Origin said."Putting the world's richest man and one of the most recognized figures in business into space is a massive advertisement for space as a domain for exploration, industrialization and investment," Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas told clients earlier this month.While the funds raised from the event are earmarked for charity, Blue Origin is hoping to galvanize enthusiasm for its nascent suborbital tourism business.However, Branson, who founded Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc , may attempt to steal Bezos' thunder by joining a possible test flight to the edge of space over the July 4 weekend aboard Virgin's VSS Unity spaceplane, one person familiar with the matter said.The race is fueled by optimism that space travel will become mainstream as nascent technology is proven and costs fall, fueling what UBS estimates could be a $3 billion annual tourism market by 2030.Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic, as well as Musk's SpaceX, have also discussed using their rockets to link far-flung global cities. UBS says that long-haul travel market could be worth more than $20 billion, though several barriers such as air-safety certification could derail the plans.Blue Origin has not divulged its pricing strategy for future trips.Reuters reported in 2018 that Blue Origin was planning to charge passengers at least $200,000 for the ride, based on a market study and other considerations, though its thinking may have changed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rocket-trip-to-space-with-jeff-bezos-sells-at-auction-for-28-million-101623519427190.html

According to a CNN report, the G7 leaders aired serious differences over the approach and the disagreements reportedly became so sensitive at one point that all internet was shut off to the room.“There was some interesting discussion, and a little bit of differentiation of opinion on, not whether this threat is there but on how strong, from an action perspective, I think different G7 members are willing to take things,” CNN quoted the official as saying.While the G7 leaders unveiled an infrastructure plan for the developing world to counter China’s Belt and Road program, reports suggest that there was no immediate consensus on how forcefully they should call out Beijing over the alleged human rights abuses. Several leaked documents have revealed China’s brutal and systematic crackdown on Uyghur Muslims, an ethnic minority group in Xinjiang, in which they have called it a “struggle against terrorism, infiltration and separatism.”Also Read | G7 leaders to sign Carbis Bay Declaration to prevent pandemic in 100 daysUS President Joe Biden has reportedly taken a more hawkish stance but some other leaders are wary of the risk of being seen as an outright anti-China bloc.

German chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed the idea, however, she didn’t want to frame the move as an anti-China effort. “This is not about being against something, but for something,” Merkel told reporters.The G7 Leaders’ Summit formally began on Friday evening at Carbis Bay, a seaside resort and village in Cornwall, UK.

Nearly half the new cases were in Moscow — 6,701 compared with 2,936 a week ago.Faced with the spiking figures, Moscow authorities said enforcement of mask- and glove-wearing on mass transit, in stores and in other public places would be strengthened and that violators could face fines of up to 5,000 rubles (USD 70).For the entire pandemic period, the task force has reported nearly 5.2 million infections in the country of about 146 million people, and 126,000 deaths.However, a report from the state statistics agency Rosstat on Friday found more than 144,000 virus-related deaths last year alone.The statistics agency, unlike the taskforce, counts fatalities in which coronavirus infection was present or suspected but is not the main cause of death.The agency's report found about 340,000 more people died in 2020 than in 2019; it did not give details of the causes of the higher year-on-year death toll.The higher death toll and a lower number of births combined to make an overall population decline of 702,000, about twice the decline in 2019, Rosstat said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russias-covid-19-cases-spike-by-nearly-50-in-a-week-101623516124484.html

Here is the reason||A town in northern Croatia is selling its abandoned houses for one kuna which is 11.83 in Indian rupees as the population of the town has been falling steadily, Reuters reported. The town will also pay one for repairing after a house is purchased. However, the unbelievable price does not come without any conditions. The buyers will have to be below the age of 40 and they will have to commit to staying at Legrad, the Croatian town, for at least 15 years, the report said. "We turned into a border town with few transport connections to other places. Since then the population has been gradually falling," said the town's mayor, Ivan Sabolic.Where is the town?The town is near the border with Hungary and has around 2,250 inhabitants. About 70 years ago, the number was double. How did its population come down?Legrad was once the second-biggest population centre in Croatian territory, but then it suffered from the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire a century ago when new borders left it sidelined, the report said. So far, the town has been able to sell 17 properties have been sold. Since these houses would require repair works, the municipality says it will pay 25,000 kuna towards any refurbishments needed, and for new residents wishing to buy a privately-owned home, the town will cover 20% of the price or up to 35,000 kuna, the mayor said."After some media reports about our action we got enquiries about houses from very distant places like Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Argentina or Colombia," the mayor said. But as immigration rules are complex in Croatia, the municipality is keeping it local. Here are the conditionsIndividuals or couples who want to settle in Legrad include that they must be financially solvent and under the age of 40.They also need to commit to staying at least 15 years.The town offers employment opportunities in food production, wood processing and metal processing industries.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/this-croatian-town-is-selling-houses-at-rs-12-here-is-the-reason-101623513749714.html

"To stop the growth of infections and to save people's lives, today I signed a decree providing for non-working days between June 15-19."The order affects all employees in the Russian capital, a city of 12 million, except for essential workers.Non-essential workers are not required to work from home during the period, but will still retain their salaries.Together with the weekends and a public holiday on June 14, it means most Moscow workers will not return to their offices until June 20.The mayor also announced the closure of food courts and playgrounds while restaurants, bars and clubs will be baned from serving customers between 23:00 and 06:00.Sobyanin also called on employers to transfer at least 30 percent of non-vaccinated employees to working from home after the week-long shutdown.- Slow vaccination - Cases have been on the rise across the country in recent weeks as Russia struggles to innoculate its citizens despite domestic vaccines being widely available to the public.A spike in cases has also been reported in Russia's second city Saint Petersburg, which is co-hosting the Euro 2020 football championship.Earlier this week, Sobyanin said Moscow would be opening several field hospitals to accomodate the influx of patients.Russia has been among the countries hardest hit by the pandemic, with the sixth-highest number of cases in the world, according to an AFP tally.Kremlin critics have accused authorities of downplaying the severity of the pandemic by only counting fatalities where the coronavirus was found to be the primary cause of death after autopsy.On Saturday, Russia registered 13,510 new coronavirus cases and 399 deaths, according to a government tally.Russia imposed a strict lockdown when the pandemic first swept across the country last spring.But within months authorities had lifted most measures, opting to protect the struggling economy and pinning their hopes on curbing the outbreak with vaccines.Officials have registered four homegrown vaccines -- Sputnik V, its single-dose version Sputnik Light, EpiVacCorona and CoviVac.Russia's domestic vaccination campaign started in early December, ahead of most countries, but Russians have been hesitant to sign up.Polls show that more than half of respondents do not intend to get vaccinated.So far 18 million Russians - or 12 percent of the population -- have received at least one dose of a vaccine.Putin -- who the Kremlin said was vaccinated in private with one of Russia's jabs -- has repeatedly called on Russians to get immunised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moscow-announces-non-working-week-as-covid-19-cases-hit-a-six-month-high-101623507195931.html

Speaking to Sky News at the G7 Leaders’ Summit 2021, Johnson said the Delta variant of Sars-CoV-2, first identified in India, is more transmissible and the cases, along with the levels of hospitalisation, are increasing.“Now, we don’t know exactly to what extent that is going to feed through into extra mortality, but clearly it’s a matter of serious, serious concern,” the UK PM told Sky News on Sunday.The final step of the United Kingdom’s planned four-step roadmap out of lockdown has seemingly been thrown in doubt with the rise of the Delta variant.

The street was barricaded to keep out vehicle traffic at the time of the shooting, Chacon said.It was unclear what sparked the shooting.Eleven of the injured people were taken to one local hospital, another person was taken to a different hospital, and the other person went to an urgent care facility with gunshot wounds, Chacon said.“Our officers responded very quickly,” the interim chief said. “They were able to immediately begin life-saving measures for many of these patients, including applications of tourniquets; applications of chest seals.”Chacon also said some officers transported patients to hospitals in their police cruisers due to the nature of the scene, where it was hard to contain the crowd and get ambulances to those who were injured.The shooter was not immediately arrested. Chacon said the description that police had of the suspect was “not very detailed,” but said the person was believed to be a man.Investigators were reviewing surveillance video and other evidence from the area, Chacon said. He asked anyone with information on the shooting to contact police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/13-injured-in-downtown-austin-shooting-suspect-not-in-custody-101623501129875.html

Blue Origin said that more than 7,500 people from 159 countries have registered to bid for the third berth—the first two are reserved for Jeff Bezos and his brother Mark Bezos—on New Shepard, a launch vehicle named after Alan Shepard, the first American to fly to space.Over a month-long three-phase bidding process, which included sealed and unsealed online bidding in the first two, will conclude with a live auction on Saturday. According to Blue Origin, the current high bid for a seat on New Shepard is at $4.8 million, which means the winner of the live auction will probably need to pay more than $5 million.The US-based space company said that the winning bid amount will be donated to its foundation, Club for the Future, to “inspire future generations to pursue careers in STEM and help invent the future of life in space.”Also Read | Jeff Bezos going into space on July 20, beating ‘space barons’ Musk, Branson to itEarlier on Monday, Jeff Bezos, in an Instagram post, announced that he will travel to space along with his brother, a dream he had since was five years old. "To see the Earth from space, it changes you. It changes your relationship with this planet, with humanity. It's one Earth. I want to go on this flight because it's a thing I've wanted to do all my life. It's an adventure, it's a big deal for me,” said Bezos in the video.A post shared by Jeff Bezos (@jeffbezos)The launch of the New Shepard booster on July 20 will be a landmark moment for US firms striving toward a new era of private commercial space travel. While Blue Origin has not divulged its pricing strategy for future trips, a Reuters report in 2018 suggested that the space company was planning to charge passengers at least $200,000 for the ride, based on a market study and other considerations."Putting the world's richest man and one of the most recognized figures in business into space is a massive advertisement for space as a domain for exploration, industrialization and investment," Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas told clients earlier this month.The live auction for a seat on Blue Origin’s New Shepard is expected to start at 12:45pm EDT (10:45pm IST) and last a few minutes.

Domestic vaccination rates have shot up in recent weeks.Over 845.2 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines had been administered across China as of Thursday, the national health commission (NHC) said in an update on Friday.Also on Friday, a health official with the NHC said a total of 622 million people in China had been vaccinated in China by Thursday. However, it wasn’t clear how many people in China had been fully vaccinated against the infection.In China’s Covid-19 vaccination programmes, out of seven shots, five require two doses, one requires a single dose, and one needs three injections.A Covid-19 vaccine from a Sinopharm unit, Beijing Institute of Biological Products, has also obtained approval to be used on people aged between three and 17 in China, CDC’s Shao said.In China, 21 Covid-19 vaccines are undergoing clinical trials at various stages, Zeng Yixin, NHC deputy director said earlier this month.By the end of 2021, China is expected to vaccinate at least 70% of “target groups”, Zeng said.China has set a target for 40% of the population to be fully vaccinated by the end of June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-conducting-clinical-trials-on-covid-19-nasal-spray-vaccines-101623498691248.html

All you need to know||The leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) rich nations are on Saturday expected to sign the ‘Carbis Bay Declaration’, a landmark global health declaration aimed at preventing future pandemics, according to a Downing Street statement. The UK government said the G7 leaders will commit to using all their resources to prevent a pandemic from ever happening again.The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has claimed more than 3.7 million lives so far, according to Johns Hopkins University, and caused economic devastation owing to the restrictions placed by governments around the world to contain the virus. Talking about the Carbis Bay Declaration, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said though the world developed and manufactured Covid-19 vaccines at an unprecedented pace, it needs to prevent a pandemic like this from ever happening again.“That means learning lessons from the last 18 months and doing it differently next time around...I am proud that for the first time today the world’s leading democracies have come together to make sure that never again will we be caught unawares,” he said, according to Downing Street.Also Read | G7 mulls reallocating $100 billion from IMF funds to Covid-hit nationsG7 nations comprise the US, UK, Germany, France, Canada, Italy and Japan.

Together we need to build on the significant scientific and collaborative response to the Covid-19 pandemic and find common solutions to address many of the gaps identified,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom, director-general of the World Health Organization.G7 leaders have gathered at Carbis Bay, a seaside resort and village in Cornwall, UK, for the three-day summit.

Michael Packard, 56, wrote on Facebook that he was in the humpback whale’s closed mouth for about 30-40 seconds before the large rorqual species rose to the surface and spit him out."A humpback whale tried to eat me...I am very bruised up but have no broken bones," wrote Packard.Speaking to CBS affiliate WBZ-TV, Packard, whose job is to pluck lobsters off the sandy bottom, said that he was about 45 deep in waters off Provincetown he suddenly “ felt this huge bump, and everything went dark”. At first, the diver feared that he was attacked by a shark but lack of teeth made him reconsider.“And then I realised, ‘Oh my God I’m in a whale’s mouth...and he’s trying to swallow me',” he told WBZ-TV after being released from the hospital.Packard said he thought about his kids and wife and told himself, “[t]his is it, I’m gonna die.”Also Read | 3 held for smuggling whale vomit worth ₹7 crore in GujaratAs soon as the lobsterman began to struggle, the humpback whale, he said, went up to the surface and started shaking his head. “I just got thrown in the air and landed in the water,” Packard recalled. “I was free and I just floated there. I couldn’t believe. . . I’m here to tell it.”Captain Joe Francis, who was heading a fishing charter nearby, told the local news channel that he had a front to witness the escape as he saw Packard come flying out of the water “feet first with his flippers on and land back in the water.” “We got him up, got his tank off. Got him on the deck and calmed him down and he goes, ‘Joe, I was in the mouth of a whale’ he goes ‘I can’t believe it, I was in the mouth of a whale Joe!’,” said Francis.Jooke Robbins, director of humpback whale studies at the Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown, Massachusetts, told news agency AFP that she had no reason to doubt the story. "I didn't think it was a hoax because I knew the people involved... So I have every reason to believe that what they say is true," she said, adding that whales have large mouths but throats so narrow that they wouldn’t be able to swallow a human.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/humpback-whale-swallows-us-lobsterman-alive-then-spits-him-out-101623489755898.html
12-06-2021||World||No more negotiations: France asks UK to 'keep its word' on Brexit deal||France's president Emmanuel Macron on Saturday told British prime minister Boris Johnson that the United Kingdom should "keep its word" to Europe and uphold the Brexit divorce deal framework that it had signed, news agency AFP reported citing people familiar with the matter in Macron's office. The agency, citing its sources, further added that Macron had explained to Johnson in no uncertain terms that Britain needs to uphold the Brexit deal it signed. The development comes amid tumultuous relations in Europe, a looming threat of a trade war between the European Union (EU) and Britain over the Northern Ireland Protocol.On the sidelines of the G7 summit in Cornwall, French president Emmanuel Macron had reportedly warned Johnson a day ago that not a single clause in the Brexit divorce deal is up for negotiation now, six months after it was signed. However, Macron is also looking for a 'reset' of France-UK relations, news agencies reported, since months of tension between the two countries over the Brexit deal has left bilateral relations strained.British foreign secretary Dominic Raab, stepping up his attacks on the European Union, told BBC radio that there ought to be a more "pragmatic" solution t the Northern Ireland dispute. "They can be more pragmatic about the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol in a way that is win-win or they can be bloody-minded and purist about it, in which case I am afraid we will not allow the integrity of the UK to be threatened," news agency Bloomberg quoted Raab as saying.UK prime minister Boris Johnson is playing host to fellow Group of Seven leaders along the English coast, with all eyes on how the leaders discuss a path out of the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as other economic plans. French president Macron has pointed out that both France and the UK have a common vision for international and transatlantic relations, including on arms control, according to an official in the G-7 delegation.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-more-negotiations-france-asks-uk-to-keep-its-word-on-brexit-deal-101623489038477.html
12-06-2021||World||Joe Biden to urge G-7 leaders to call out, compete with China||The United States plans to push democratic allies on Saturday to publicly call out China for forced labor practices as the Group of Seven leaders gather at a summit where they will also unveil an infrastructure plan meant to compete with Beijing’s efforts in the developing world.The provocative proposal is part of President Joe Biden’s escalating campaign to get fellow democratic leaders to present a more unified front to compete economically with China in the century ahead, according to two senior administration officials who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the plans for the seaside summit publicly.The officials said Biden wanted G-7 leaders to speak out in a single voice against forced labor practices targeting Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities. Biden hopes the denunciation will be part of the joint communique released at the summit’s end, but some European allies have been reluctant to so forcefully split with Beijing. It may not be clear until the three-day summit ends on Sunday whether the leaders will take that step.The wealthy nations’ leaders were all smiles and unity as they were welcomed to the summit on Friday by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on the freshly raked sand of Carbis Bay in southwest England for their first gathering since 2019.Last year’s gathering was canceled because of COVID-19, and recovery from the pandemic is dominating this year's discussions, with members of the wealthy democracies' club expected to commit to sharing at least 1 billion vaccine shots with struggling countries.China also loomed large over the meeting on the craggy coast of Cornwall. Biden's proposed critique of China's labor practices was to be raised as the allies unveil an infrastructure proposal dubbed “Build Back Better for the World,” a name that echoes the slogan of the American president's election campaign.The plan calls for spending hundreds of millions of dollars in collaboration with the private sector. It's designed to compete with China’s trillion-dollar “Belt and Road Initiative,” which has launched a network of projects and maritime lanes that already snake around large portions of the world, primarily Asia and Africa. Critics say the projects often create massive debt and expose nations to undue influence by Beijing.Britain also wants the world’s democracies to become less reliant on economic giant China. The U.K. government says Saturday’s discussions will tackle “how we can shape the global system to deliver for our people in support of our values,” including by diversifying supply chains that currently heavily depend on China.Not every European power has viewed China in as harsh a light as Biden, who has painted the rivalry with the techno-security state as the defining competition for the 21st century. But there are signs that Europe is willing to put greater scrutiny on Beijing.Weeks before Biden took office last year, the European Commission announced it had come to terms with Beijing on the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment, a deal meant to provide Europe and China greater access to each other’s markets. The Biden administration had hoped to have consultations on the pact.But the deal has been put on hold, and the European Union in March announced sanctions targeting four Chinese officials involved with human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Beijing responded by imposing sanctions on several members of the European Parliament and other Europeans critical of the Chinese Communist Party.Biden administration officials see the moment as an opportunity to take concrete action to speak out against China’s reliance on forced labor as an “affront to human dignity."While calling out China in the communique wouldn't create any immediate penalties for Beijing, one senior administration official said the action was meant to send a message that the G-7 was serious about defending human rights and working together to eradicate the use of forced labor.An estimated 1 million people or more — most of them Uyghurs — have been confined in reeducation camps in China’s western Xinjiang region in recent years, according to researchers. Chinese authorities have been accused of imposing forced labor, systematic forced birth control, torture and separating children from incarcerated parents.Beijing rejects allegations that it is committing crimes.The leaders of the G-7 — which also includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan — also hope the meeting at the seaside resort will energize the global economy.Opening three days of talks, Johnson on Friday warned that world leaders must not repeat errors made over the past 18 months — or those made during the recovery from the 2008 global financial crisis. If not, he said the pandemic “risks being a lasting scar” that entrenched inequalities.He said the G-7 will announce a package of health measures aimed at reducing the chances of another pandemic. The “Carbis Bay Declaration” will aim for a 100-day goal to develop vaccines, treatments and diagnostics for future diseases and to bolster surveillance for new illnesses.Johnson said the goal of the measures was “to make sure that never again will we be caught unawares.”Brexit will also cast a shadow on the summit Saturday, as Johnson meets one-on-one with European leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron amid tensions over Britain's implementation of U.K.-EU divorce terms.Macron will also hold talks with Biden — a meeting between allies who recalibrated their relationship during the four years of President Donald Trump’s “America first” foreign policy.Macron’s preference for multilateralism was out of step with Trump’s isolationist tendencies. But the Trump era was often framed by Macron as a clarifying moment — one in which Europe had to step forward as America drifted away from alliances and toward Trumpism.Biden will end his eight-day European trip with a summit in Geneva with Russia's Vladimir Putin. Putin, in an interview with NBC News that aired Friday, said the Russian relationship with the U.S. has “deteriorated to its lowest point in recent years.”But he added that while Trump was a “talented” and “colorful” person, Biden was a “career man” in politics, which has “some advantages, some disadvantages, but there will not be any impulse-based movements” by the U.S. president.To cap the day Friday, Queen Elizabeth II — Britain’s biggest global star — traveled from Windsor Castle near London for a reception with the G-7 leaders and their spouses at the Eden Project, a futuristic botanical garden housed inside domes that features the world’s largest indoor rainforest.Senior royals — including heir to the throne Prince Charles, his son Prince William and William’s wife, Kate — joined the leaders for the reception and a dinner of roasted turbot, Cornish new potatoes and greens with wild garlic pesto, cooked by a local chef.The choice of an ecologically themed venue was deliberate. Climate change is also a top issue on the agenda, and hundreds of protesters gathered in Cornwall to urge the leaders to act, some dressed as sea creatures such as jellyfish. Demonstrators deployed a barge off the coast with two large inflatable figures depicting Biden and Johnson on board.___Lemire reported from Plymouth, England.

The Correctional Services Department said it would not comment on individual cases.Chow was released from the Tai Lam Correctional Institution in Tuen Mun, in Hong Kong's New Territories district, at about 10am local time.She did not speak to the media before she was ushered into a car with friends and fellow democracy activists.Supporters shouted "Agnes Chow add oil", a Cantonese-language expression of encouragement that was widely used at the protests that roiled the city.Some supporters wore black T-shirts and yellow masks and one held a yellow umbrella, a symbol of protests in the former British colony dating back to 2014.Chow, along with Wong and Nathan Law, who has since been given asylum in Britain, came to prominence as teenage activists during the 2014 protests to demand universal suffrage.The three founded the democracy group Demosisto in 2016, which dissolved hours after Beijing passed a contentious national security law for the city last year amid fears it could be targeted under the legislation.The law has stifled the pro-democracy movement and raised concern about prospects for the autonomy Hong Kong was promised under a "one country, two systems" formula when it was handed over to China in 1997.Chow was also arrested last year on suspicion of "colluding with foreign forces" under the security law but has not faced any charges related to that.Fluent in Japanese, Chow has a sizable following in Japan, particularly on social media, and had travelled to the country frequently before her arrest.

However, in a statement released on Friday, Health Canada said these were being withheld and “will only be released for distribution” once it “is satisfied that they meet the department’s high standards for quality, safety and efficacy”. This move came after Health Canada learnt that a drug substance was produced at the Emergent BioSolutions facility in Baltimore, Maryland, inspected by the FDA which flagged multiple areas of concerns.Health Canada noted the substance is an “active ingredient that undergoes further processing before becoming the final product”, the vaccine. “The final Janssen vaccines were manufactured at a different site located outside of the US,” it said.It added, “We will continue to ensure that products coming from the Emergent facility, or any other facility, will only be imported and distributed in Canada if they are of high quality and safe for use.”It said the department is currently working with Janssen and the FDA to obtain all information it needs to complete its “assessment, prior to releasing the Janssen vaccines for distribution”.Canada has also received 1.5 million doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccine made at the same facility and Health Canada said it is also working with them “to ensure the facility meets manufacturing standards, and that all vaccine are of high quality”.However, the AZ vaccines have already been distributed and administered across the country. Health Canada asserted that it “remains confident that the 1.5 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine imported from this facility meet quality specifications”.On April 25, Health Canada had stated that the Janssen vaccines expected to arrive did not originate from the Emergent facility. The information about the active ingredient came to the department since that statement was issued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-halts-distribution-of-j-j-covid-19-vaccine-101623479189893.html
12-06-2021||World||North Korea's Kim Jong Un asks officials to strengthen military might: Report||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has called for amassing the country's military power and asked defense troops to go into a state of "high-alert posture", reported the China Global Times Network (CGTN) on Saturday, citing a statement by KCNA, the state media of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). According to the report, Kim Jong Un attended a top military commission meeting, where he instructed defense officials to take care of structural issues be alert in reacting against changing political situations in the Korean Peninsula.Also Read: Once ‘deeply-moved’ by K-Pop, North Korea’s Kim Jong Un calls it ‘vicious cancer’: ReportDue to relatively murky media exposure in North Korea, Kim Jong Un's whereabouts and ambitions are often a favourite for speculation among political quarters. He made his first public appearance in about a month on June 5, with state media showing him at a party meeting that discussed ways to improve the country’s deteriorating economy. Off-beat stories ranged from speculations about the North Korean leader losing weight -- as evidenced by his latest Swiss watch -- to him branding Korean pop (K-pop) music as "vicious cancer". Even so, the media's focus has not shifted from scanning Kim Jong Un's military ambitions.Also Read: US waiting to see if North Korea wants to engage in diplomacyKim Jong Un, the Supreme Leader of North Korea and the head of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), is closely monitoring the "recent fast-changing" situation in the Korean Peninsula, according to the CGTN report. Calling for a boost in the nation's military power, the North Korean leader also asked officials to address organisational issues associated with the military, such as dismissals, transfers, and appointments, as per the report citing a KCNA statement.Kim Jong Un's entire focus was on augmenting national defense, the KCNA statement detailed, with the North Korean leader discussing several "important tasks" and a "fresh turn" in context to the country's military might. The WPK will be conducting a plenary meeting of its central committee later in June, the report added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-asks-officials-to-strengthen-military-might-report-101623474976503.html

It is widespread. I would say global. It’s also not just amongst physicians but likely affecting other healthcare workers.”She also noted that the coronavirus crisis had increased physician burnout, a phenomenon that was rising even before the pandemic struck.The study was based on survey responses from 302 internal medicine physicians who worked for Vancouver General Hospital and St Paul’s Hospital in Vancouver, British Columbia between August and October 2020.Burnout was defined as “an occupational syndrome characterised by emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation - which is a lack of care about the work. It also affects workers’ sense of personal accomplishment”.Women and younger doctors were more likely to feel the impact, as burnout “was prevalent among 71% of women compared to 64% of men”. It was also found to be highest, at 74%, among younger physicians, aged between 36 and 50. Meanwhile, visible minority physicians had 1.8 times higher odds of feeling low personal accomplishment in comparison to white respondents.Among other survey findings, 63% of respondents reported emotional exhaustion, 39% reported a lack of care towards the job, or depersonalisation, and 22% reported feeling low personal accomplishment.The study pointed out the “prevalence of burnout and its components in the current study are generally higher than those reported prior to the pandemic”. A systematic review of 176 studies from 2018 reported a prevalence of overall burnout of 48.7%, while a recent meta-analysis of 22,778 medical and surgical residents identified a 51% aggregate prevalence prior to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/docs-complain-of-burnout-consider-leaving-profession-canadian-study-101623476609824.html
12-06-2021||World||Biden administration closes Trump-era office for victims of immigrant crime||The Biden administration said Friday it has dismantled a Trump-era government office to help victims of crimes committed by immigrants, a move that symbolizes President Joe Biden's rejection of former President Donald Trump's repeated efforts to link immigrants to crime.Trump created the Victim Of Immigration Crime Engagement Office, known by its acronym VOICE, by executive order during his first week in office in January 2017.US Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it was replacing VOICE with a "more comprehensive and inclusive victim support system.”VOICE will be replaced by The Victims Engagement and Services Line, which will combine longstanding existing services, such as methods for people to report abuse and mistreatment in immigration detention centers and a notification system for lawyers and others with a vested interest in immigration cases.The new office will add a service for potential recipients of visas designated for victims of human trafficking or violent crimes in the United States.“Providing assistance to society’s most vulnerable is a core American value. All people, regardless of their immigration status, should be able to access victim services without fear,” said Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.Stephen Miller, a key architect of Trump’s immigration policies, called the decision to close VOICE a “moral stain on the conscience of our nation."He likened the new office to the Drug Enforcement Administration opening “a call center to help drug dealers get lawyers and amnesty for their crimes."The Department of Homeland Security “is a law enforcement agency, not a legal help center for criminals and lawbreakers," Miller said.Jon Feere, an ICE official during the Trump administration, said he referred a man to VOICE whose sister was killed by an intoxicated driver and that the office helped families understand the status of immigration cases.The change of tone regarding immigration has been striking between the two administrations.While studies suggest immigrants are less likely to commit crime than native-born, Trump relentlessly sought to establish a link. He launched his 2016 presidential campaign by portraying Mexicans in the country illegally as violent criminals and frequently highlighted the MS-13 gang, which was started by Salvadoran immigrants.To advance his immigration agenda, Trump invited “angel families” — people whose loved ones had been victims of crimes by immigrants — to campaign rallies and high-profile speeches.Trump's office for victims of violent crimes appears to have had little impact.Its most recent quarterly report posted online for the last three months of 2018 said it fielded 781 calls during the three-month period — and that just 256 of the calls pertained to services it offered. About half were requests on the status of immigration cases, and many of the rest were referrals for assistance, such as social services to help cope with impacts of domestic violence or assault.The office was used as a platform by the Trump administration to promote a link between immigrants and crime.“I’ve had to hold the hand of too many mothers who lost a child to a DUI or somebody else who’s been raped by an illegal alien or someone with a nexus to immigration,” Barbara Gonzalez, the then-director of VOICE, told reporters in October 2019. “It is a problem we cannot ignore as a country.In April, the Biden administration ordered US officials to avoid using terms like “illegal alien” and instead use the phrase “undocumented noncitizen.”Vice President Kamala Harris drew strong criticism from some of the administration's pro-immigration allies for telling would-be migrants during a visit to Guatemala on Monday, “Do not come ... Do not come," and that they would be denied entry at the US border with Mexico.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-closes-trump-era-office-for-victims-of-immigrant-crime-101623473953756.html

12-06-2021||World||Two Indian-Americans win coveted US journalism honour||Two Indian-Americans were among winners of the top American awards for journalism announced on Friday.BuzzFeed News’ Megha Rajagopalan won a Pulitzer for international reporting, with contributors Alison Killing, a licensed architect and Christo Buschek, a programmer, for a series exposing the scale of internment of Uighur Muslims in China’s Xinjiang province. This was the first Pulitzer for BuzzFeed News, a digital news publication founded in 2014.Tampa Bay Times’ Neil Bedi won the Pulitzer for local reporting with Kathleen McGrory, for their investigative series on a Florida county police’s use of computer modelling to identify potential crime suspects, including children who either performed badly at school or were victims of abuse at home. Bedi has since moved to ProPublica, a non-profit publication focusing on investigative news.“I’m completely shocked! I’m very grateful to my team and the many people and organisations from inside and outside BuzzFeed News who supported this project,” Rajagopalan wrote in an email in response to a request for comments. “Most of all I am grateful to the former detainees who took risks to share details of what they experienced inside Xinjiang’s camps. The public owes them a great debt, as do I.”BuzzFeed said in a report that Rajagopalan was the first reporter to visit an internment camp used to hold Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang province at a time - in 2017 - when the Chinese government was denying their existence. She was shortly ejected from the country and the Chinese government refused to renew her visa.Ben Smith, the then BuzzFeed editor who has since joined the New York Times, recalled that episode in a tweet, as his tribute to an erstwhile colleague. After the Chinese government refused to renew her visa, he wrote, he and a senior editor at BuzzFeed, “met with government officials. They said we were welcome to send literally any other reporter - just not Megha”.It wasn’t known whether or not BuzzFeed sent another reporter instead, but Rajagopalan persisted, and continued reporting on the camps from London, along with the two contributors, Killing, an architect who specialises in forensic analysis of architecture and satellite images of buildings, and Christo Buschek, a programmer who makes tools for data journalism.Born to parents from India, Rajagopalan was raised in Maryland, a state abutting the national capital Washington DC, and went to the University of Maryland. “I’m deeply grateful to them for their support,” Rajagopalan said of her parents. “Nobody in my family has ever worked in media, but they have always supported my career in journalism, and have been my biggest cheerleaders since I was a student.”Celebrations broke out in the tiny, but increasingly vocal, minority community of Indian-Americans. “Congrats @meghara (Rajagopalan’s twitter handle)!” wrote Indiaspora, a leading advocacy for the community, on twitter. “We are lucky to have leaders like you taking the Indian diaspora community to new heights!” It wished Bedi in a separate tweet.“Winning this prize is an incredible honour. I’m proud of the Tampa Bay Times team for this work and I’m grateful to all the families who spoke to us for this story,” Bedi wrote in an email. Bedi was born and raised in New Jersey. His parents moved to the United States from New Delhi in the 1990s. “I owe all of my success to my parents. They taught me to be ambitious and caring, two of the most important things in journalism.”In other categories - Pulitzers are awarded for a wide range of areas, from journalism to drama to fiction - teenager Daniella Frazier was awarded an honorary Pulitzer for her chilling but unwavering video of George Floyd’s killing that served as an irrefutable evidence in the conviction of his killer, a white police officer, and went viral around as a stark reminder of persisting racism in America.The New York Times was honoured with a Pulitzer for public service journalism, for its coverage of the Covid-19 epidemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-indian-americans-win-coveted-us-journalism-honour-101623473790195.html
12-06-2021||World||Mouse sperm survives in space for nearly six years, births healthy pups||The most well-travelled mouse sperm in history left Earth in 2013, its destination being the International Space Station (ISS). After almost six years of soaking high levels of cosmic radiation in space, the free-dried sperm was brought back to the planet in a SpaceX shuttle and used to breed litters here on Earth to assess how it held up over time in outer space. The result was astonishing, to say the least. The study, conducted by a group of Japanese researchers, found that despite being stored in space for years, the mouse sperm remained viable and produced a number of "healthy, normal" pups.The results of the study, published in the journal Science Advances on Friday, showed that the freeze-fried mouse sperm had resulted in the birth of 168 health pups, free of any genetic defects whatsoever. In fact, there was seen to exist little difference between mice fertilized by space sperm and sperm that remained confined here on Earth, said developmental biologist and lead author of the study Teruhiko Wakayama to news agency AFP. He added that all the pups had a normal appearance and lacked any abnormalities.The viability of freeze-dried mouse sperm in space might not sound like a macher in scientific advances, but it shows a way or two about humanity's hopes for long-term intergalactic travel. If mankind ever hopes to travel to other planets solar systems or perhaps galaxies away, they will need to seriously think about long-term space colonies, which will require researchers to come up with viable ways of ensuring mammalian reproduction, not just of humans but of other animals too, survives the onslaught of cosmic radiation in outer space.Wakayama, the lead researcher for the said study, seems to have been inspired by the science fiction of Robert Heinlein and Isaac Asimov himself. Although he originally wanted to be an astronaut, he later settled on becoming a scientist, always amazed by the sense of wonder over space exploration, he told AFP.Wakayama and his colleagues at the University of Yamanashi in Japan had launched the three boxloads of mouse sperm, each containing 48 ampules of the freeze-fried material, to the ISS back in 2013 for long-term study. Now the director for Advanced Biotechnology Center at the University of Yamanashi, Wakayama is quite satisfied with the results and said that in the future, humans will need to maintain the diversity of genetic resources, not only for humans but also for pets and domestic animals, for long-term space travel and also as a failsafe in case of a disaster on Earth. The freeze-dried sperm used in the study could be stored for up to 200 years on board the orbital outpost, the team's calculations revealed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mouse-sperm-survives-in-space-for-almost-six-years-births-healthy-pups-101623470356732.html

In an interview with American media outlet NBC News, Putin hardly concealed his admiration for ex-president Trump, calling him an "extraordinary" and "talented" individual, while he referred to Biden as a career politician disparate with such traits.Also Read: 'Can't get away with making threats': Putin likens US behaviour to Soviet UnionPutin's statements regarding US-Russia relations come just ahead of his meeting with Biden at Geneva next week. "We have a bilateral relationship that has deteriorated to its lowest point in recent years," news agency Reuters quoted Putin as saying, citing transcripts of the interview put out by NBC News. The Russian president also took his time to refute allegations against his regime on a host of issues, ranging from alleged ransomware attacks against the US emanating from Russia, aggression against Ukraine, jailing of dissidents, and questionable foreign policies in the Middle East.The deaths of several dissidents of Putin's regime, including that of ex-KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko who was poisoned in 2006, have over the years been directly blamed on Moscow. When asked about these incidents, Putin simply dismissed the question as "verbal indigestion", adding that some of those accused in the murder cases are already in prison.Also Read: Biden says will stand with European allies ahead of Putin summitIn the context of recent ransomware attacks that Washington says have been traced back to Russia, Putin blatantly denied any knowledge of the hackings and said that he will, in turn, seek to establish a cyberspace agreement with Biden.Finally, when asked about a recent report in the Washington Post report which accused Russia of supplying Iran with an advanced satellite to track military targets across the Middle East, Putin dismissed it as "fake news". "At the very least, I don't know anything about this kind of thing," Putin was quoted as saying at the interview with NBC News.Joe Biden, for his part, has said that the United States desires to establish a "stable and predictable relationship" with Russia. However, America will not hesitate to respond in "a robust and meaningful way" if the Russian government continues to engage in detrimental activities, Biden added. It remains to be seen what the future lies for US-Russia relations ahead of Biden's eight-day visit to Europe this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russias-putin-says-ties-with-us-at-all-time-low-recalls-trump-as-talented-extraordinary-man-101623466474786.html

Now, well into the second year of global lockdowns, school closures, economic disruptions, and shrinking national budgets, families are forced to make heartbreaking choices," Unicef's executive director Henrietta Fore said in a statement.Also read | Child labour rises 1st time in 20 years, Nobel laureate demands actionWorld Day Against Child Labour is being observed on Saturday and the UN has made 2021 the International Year for the Elimination of Child Labour, calling urgent action needed to meet a goal of ending the practice by 2025.Here's what the report on child labour said:1. There has been a significant rise in the number of children aged 5 to 11 years in child labour, who now account for just over half of the total global figure.2. The number of children aged 5 to 17 years in hazardous work has risen by 6.5 million to 79 million since 2016.3. In sub-Saharan Africa, population growth, recurrent crises, extreme poverty, and inadequate social protection measures have led to an additional 16.6 million children in child labour over the past four years.3. Covid-19 is endangering that progress even in regions where there has been some headway since 2016, such as Asia and the Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean.4. Globally, nine million additional children are at risk of being pushed into child labour by the end of 2022 as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.5. A simulation model shows this number could rise to 46 million if they don’t have access to critical social protection coverage.6. Children already in child labour may be working longer hours or under worsening conditions because of additional economic shocks and school closures caused by Covid-19.7. Many more may be forced into the worst forms of child labour due to job and income losses among vulnerable families.8. The agriculture sector accounts for 70 per cent of children in child labour (112 million) followed by 20 per cent in services (31.4 million) and 10 per cent in the industry (16.5 million).9. Nearly 28 per cent of children aged 5 to 11 years and 35 per cent of children aged 12 to 14 years in child labour are out of school.10. Child labour is more prevalent among boys than girls at every age. When household chores performed for 21 hours or more each week are taken into account, the gender gap in child labour narrows.11. The prevalence of child labour in rural areas (14 per cent) is close to three times higher than in urban areas (5 per cent).To reverse the upward trend in child labour, the ILO and Unicef are calling for adequate social protection for all, including universal child benefits. They have also called for increased spending on free and good-quality schooling and getting all children back into school, including those who dropped out before Covid-19.The global bodies there should be a promotion of decent work for adults so that families don’t have to resort to children helping to generate income. The ILO and Unicef said there should be an end to harmful gender norms and discrimination that influence child labour. Investment in child protection systems, agricultural development, rural public services, infrastructure and livelihoods should also come through, they said.Source: International Labour Organization.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-world-day-against-child-labour-key-points-on-the-practice-101623465166507.html

Why is it observed?||World Day Against Child Labour, which aims to spread awareness about the illegal employment practice and also talk about the ways to eradicate it completely, will be observed on Saturday by people across the globe. It was launched by the International Labour Organization (ILO), an agency of the United Nations, in 2002. This year’s theme is ‘Act now: End child labour’.Child labour exists across the globe and children, mostly from poor families, are forced to work in hazardous conditions which leads to unending physical, mental and social exploitation and suffering from the employers. Children are deprived of living their childhood to their fullest and also miss the opportunity of attending schools.According to the latest report by the ILO and Unicef, child labour has soared to 160 million worldwide, the first increase in 20 years.There also has been a significant rise in the number of children between 5-11 years in child labour, who account for over half of the global figure. “The number of children in child labour has risen to 160 million worldwide -- an increase of 8.4 million children in the last four years -- with millions more at risk due to the impacts of Covid-19,” the report added.Also Read| Child labour rises 1st time in 20 years, Nobel laureate demands actionDeveloping countries like India contribute maximum towards child labour. According to the census of 2011, 259.64 million children belonged to the age group of 5-14 years of which 10.1 million were child labourers. Be it manufacturing of firecrackers in Tamil Nadu’s Sivakasi, the country’s bangle making industry, roadside eateries and restaurants, construction sites or even the house help, children from unfortunate sections have always been the soft target.Unicef India representative Dr Yasmin Ali Haque told news agency PTI on Thursday the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has aggravated the risk of child labour in the country as more families have been pushed to poverty. “Children in poor and disadvantaged households in India are now at a greater risk of negative coping mechanisms such as dropping out of school and being forced into labour, marriage, and even falling victim to trafficking,” Haque added.In recent years, reports have emerged that several consumer brands of global prominence including Forever 21, Cadbury, H&M, GAP etc- were caught employing children in their manufacturing units to save up on additional costs. Many activists and non-governmental organisations (NGO) have raised their voices against this and have also urged people to not buy products from such brands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-day-against-child-labour-2021-what-is-it-why-is-it-observed-101623460905243.html

Democrats called the seizures “harrowing” and an abuse of power.The announcement by Inspector General Michael Horowitz came shortly after Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco made the request for an internal investigation. Horowitz said he would examine whether the data subpoenaed by the Justice Department and turned over by Apple followed department policy and “whether any such uses, or the investigations, were based upon improper considerations.”Horowitz said he would also investigate similar Trump-era seizures of journalists' phone records.House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and another Democratic member of the panel, California Rep. Eric Swalwell, said Apple notified them last month that their metadata had been subpoenaed and turned over to the Justice Department in 2018, as their committee was investigating the former president's ties to Russia. Schiff was then the top Democrat on the panel, which was led by Republicans.While the Justice Department routinely investigates leaked information, including classified intelligence, subpoenaing the private information of members of Congress is extraordinarily rare. The disclosures, first reported by The New York Times, raise questions about what the Justice Department's justification was for spying on another branch of government and whether it was done for political reasons.In a statement, White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said the Trump administration's conduct is “shocking” and “clearly fits within an appalling trend that represents the opposite of how authority should be used.”Bates said one of President Joe Biden's top reasons for seeking the presidency was “his predecessor’s unjustifiable abuses of power, including the repugnant ways he tried to force his political interests upon the Department of Justice.”The Trump administration’s secretive move to gain access to the data came as the president was fuming publicly and privately over investigations — in Congress and by then-special counsel Robert Mueller — into his campaign’s ties to Russia. Trump called the probes a “witch hunt,” regularly criticized Democrats and Mueller on Twitter and dismissed as “fake news” leaks he found harmful to his agenda. As the investigations swirled around him, he demanded loyalty from a Justice Department he often regarded as his personal law firm.Swalwell and Schiff were two of the most visible Democrats on the committee during the Russia probe, making frequent appearances on cable news. Trump watched those channels closely, if not obsessively, and seethed over the coverage.Schiff said the seizures suggest “the weaponization of law enforcement by a corrupt president" and urged the Justice Department to do “a full damage assessment of the conduct of the department over the last four years.”Senate Democratic leaders immediately demanded that former Attorneys General Bill Barr and Jeff Sessions, who both oversaw Trump's leak probes, testify about the secret subpoenas. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin said in a statement that “this appalling politicization of the Department of Justice by Donald Trump and his sycophants” must be investigated. They said Barr and Sessions are subject to a subpoena if they refuse.Prosecutors from Trump’s Justice Department had subpoenaed Apple for the data, according to a committee official and two other people familiar with the matter. The records of at least 12 people connected to the intelligence panel were eventually shared by the company, including aides, former aides and family members. One was a minor.Apple informed the committee last month that the records had been shared and that the investigation had been closed, but did not give extensive detail. The committee official and the two others with knowledge of the data seizures were granted anonymity to discuss them.The Justice Department obtained the metadata — often records of calls, texts and locations — but not other content from the devices, like photos, messages or emails, according to one of the people. Another said that Apple complied with the subpoena, providing the information to the Justice Department, but did not immediately notify the members of Congress or the committee about the disclosure.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement that the data seizures "appear to be yet another egregious assault on our democracy” by the former president.“The news about the politicization of the Trump Administration Justice Department is harrowing," she said.The committee official said the House intelligence panel will ask Apple to look into whether additional lawmakers were targeted. The Justice Department has not been forthcoming on questions such as whether the investigation was properly predicated and whether it only focused on Democrats, the official said.It is unclear why Trump's Justice Department would have targeted a minor as part of the probe. Swalwell, confirming that he was told his records were seized, told CNN on Thursday night that he was aware a minor was involved and believed that person was "targeted punitively and not for any reason in law.”The Senate Intelligence Committee was not similarly targeted, according to a fourth person who was aware of the probe and granted anonymity to discuss it.There's no indication that the Justice Department used the records to prosecute anyone. After some information related to the Russia investigation was declassified and made public during the later years of the Trump administration, some of the prosecutors were concerned that even if they could bring a leak case, conviction would be unlikely, one of the people said.Federal agents questioned at least one former committee staff member in 2020, the person said, and ultimately, prosecutors weren’t able to substantiate a case.The news follows revelations that the Justice Department had secretly seized phone records belonging to reporters at The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN as part of criminal leak investigations. Following an outcry from press freedom organizations, the Justice Department announced last week that it would cease the practice of going after journalists’ sourcing information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-justice-dept-opens-probe-into-trump-s-seizures-of-democrats-journalists-data-101623446005213.html

Member states can loan or donate their SDR reserves to other countries for their use.The United States, which has targeted the SDR allocation to be distributed around the "late (northern) summer," on Friday said: "We strongly support the effort to recycle SDRs to further support health needs."The IMF had no immediate comment.IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, who will speak virtually with G7 leaders this weekend, on Wednesday told a separate event that she expected the fund's governors to approve a $650 billion boost in SDRs in mid-August.The global lender is continuing to study how best richer countries could donate or loan their reserves to benefit poorer nations. Details are expected in early autumn.French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday called on the other G7 nations to find an agreement on reallocating $100 billion in SDRs to African states.World finance chiefs agreed in April to issue new SDRs and extend a debt-servicing freeze to help developing countries deal with the pandemic, although only $34 billion of the $650 billion in new reserves will be allocated to Africa, since SDRs are issued according to the size of a member's holding in the IMF.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g7-mulls-reallocating-100-billion-from-imf-funds-to-covid-hit-nations-101623439000587.html
12-06-2021||World||US Law enforcement struggles to hire since Floyd killing by cop||Law enforcement agencies across the country experienced a wave of retirements and departures and are struggling to recruit the next generation of police officers in the year since George Floyd was killed by a cop.And amid the national reckoning on policing, communities are questioning who should become a police officer today.Mass protests and calls for reforming or defunding the police, as well as the coronavirus pandemic, took their toll on officer morale. The rate of retirements at some departments rose 45% compared with the previous year, according to new research on nearly 200 law enforcement agencies conducted by the Washington-based Police Executive Research Forum and provided to The Associated Press. At the same time, hiring slowed by 5%, the group found.The wave comes as local lawmakers have pledged to enact reforms — such as ending the policies that give officers immunity for their actions while on-duty — and say they’re committed to reshaping policing in the 21st century. And recruiters are increasingly looking for a different kind of recruit to join embattled departments.Years ago, a candidate’s qualifications might be centered around his — yes, his — brawn. Now, police departments say they are seeking recruits who can use their brain. And they want those future officers to represent their communities.“Days of old, you wanted someone who actually had the strength to be more physical,” Atlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant said. “Today’s police officers, that’s not what we’re looking for. We’re looking for someone who can actually relate to the community but also think like the community thinks.”But the climate today, coupled with increases in crime in some cities, is creating what Chuck Wexler, the head of the Police Executive Research Forum, called a “combustible mixture.”It’s creating “a crisis on the horizon for police chiefs when they look at the resources they need, especially during a period when we’re seeing an increase in murders and shootings,” Wexler said. “It’s a wake-up call.”The data from Wexler's organization represents a fraction of the more than 18,000 law enforcement agencies nationwide and is not representative of all departments. But it’s one of the few efforts to examine police hiring and retention and compare it with the time before Floyd’s killing in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. Former officer Derek Chauvin, who pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck while Floyd was handcuffed behind his back, was convicted of murder and is awaiting sentencing.Researchers heard from 194 police departments last month about their hires, resignations and retirements between April 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021, and the same categories from April 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020.By comparison, the changing public attitude on policing is well documented. In the past year, as many as half of American adults believed police violence against the public is a “very” or “extremely” serious problem, according to one poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.“It’s hard to recruit the very people who see police as an opposition,” said Lynda R. Williams, president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, who previously worked on recruitment efforts for the Secret Service.Bryant knows firsthand. In the weeks after Floyd’s death, a white officer, Garrett Rolfe, shot and killed Rayshard Brooks, a Black man, in the parking lot of a Wendy’s.In quick succession, Rolfe was fired, the chief resigned and the local district attorney announced charges, including felony murder, against Rolfe — a rare step in police shootings. Some cops left the force, which currently has about 1,560 officers — about 63% of the force is Black, 29% white and 5% Latino.Then came the “Blue Flu” — when a high number of police officers called out sick in protest. Bryant, then the department’s interim chief, acknowledged that it had occurred in Atlanta after Rolfe was charged.“Some are angry. Some are fearful. Some are confused on what we do in this space. Some may feel a bit abandoned,” Bryant said last summer in an interview at the height of the crisis.But it hasn't shaken the resolve of some, like Kaley Garced, a hairdresser-turned-police officer in Baltimore who graduated from the academy last August. Despite the protests and attitudes toward law enforcement, she stayed with her career choice with a plan to interact with residents.“Earning their trust” leads to better policing, she said. Citizens who trust officers will not be afraid to “call upon you on their worst day” and ask for help.Williams said she believes the next generation of law enforcement will bring a new outlook and move the profession forward by making departments more diverse and inclusive.“They are the change that they want to see,” Williams said.Recruitment is still a challenge. In some cities like Philadelphia, departments are spending more time scouring a candidate’s social media to hunt for possible biases. In others, pay disparities — a longtime problem — still exist, making it difficult to attract would-be officers and keep newly trained recruits when a neighboring jurisdiction offers more money and benefits.In Dallas, city leaders spent much of the last decade struggling to draw candidates and stem the outflow of officers frustrated by low pay and the near collapse of their pension fund.Despite those efforts, the force now stands at about 3,100 officers — down from more than 3,300 in 2015 — a loss at a time when the city’s population has grown to more than 1.3 million. The force is about 44% white, 26% Black and 26% Latino. This means officers handle more calls and detectives more cases, all amid increased racial tension.In 2016, five officers were killed in Dallas by a sniper who was seeking revenge for police shootings elsewhere that killed or wounded Black men. Two years later, an off-duty officer fatally shot her neighbor in his home. She was fired and later was sentenced to a decade in prison for murder.Mike Mata, president of the Dallas Police Association, said the national political climate and local pay and pension issues have been compounding challenges to hiring in Dallas.In 2019, however, a consulting firm Dallas hired to review its department found that it needed not simply more officers but also a “realignment of strategy, goals, mission, and tactics.” That finding rings true to Changa Higgins, a longtime community organizer.“You don’t need to focus on hiring more officers,” Higgins said. “You need to focus on how you got these guys allocated.”In Los Angeles, the department is fighting against a decade-long image of scandal and racial strife from the Watts riots in 1965 to the bloodshed in 1992 after a Simi Valley jury's acquittal of officers who brutally beat motorist Rodney King.Capt. Aaron McCraney, head of the Recruitment and Employment Division, and Chief Michel Moore ticked off the issues facing the 48 new recruits — more than half of whom were women — last year, noting that the pandemic, civil unrest and economic uncertainty were just some of the challenges the new officers would face.“Even though these are tough times, these are difficult times, these are interesting times,” McCraney said, “these times will pass, and we’ll get on to things better.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-law-enforcement-struggles-to-hire-since-floyd-killing-by-cop-101623438799338.html

It’s not clear if the heart inflammation is caused by the shots, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The UK government said on Friday the Delta variant of the virus is 60% more transmissible in households compared to the Alpha variant, first identified in Kent, southeast England.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antony-blinken-calls-upon-china-to-allow-new-covid-origin-probe-101623437400703.html

This organisation, wearing tinted glasses, has been misleading the public and spreading lies and rumours about Xinjiang. Its so-called report is like adding one more page to its record of lies,” spokesperson Wang Wenbin said.“We urge the relevant organisation to abandon its persistent prejudice against China, stop fabricating and spreading disinformation and look at relevant issues from an objective and just perspective,” Wang added.Sleep deprivation, beatings, and the use of “tiger chairs” - iron chairs with iron buckles to restrain those being questioned - were recorded, the report said, adding that detainees could be hooded and shackled during questioning.“It should shock the conscience of humanity that massive number of people have been subjected to brainwashing, torture and other degrading treatment in internment camps, while millions more live in fear amid a vast surveillance apparatus,” Callamard added.Hong Kong to censor filmsHong Kong censors are to vet all films for national security breaches under newly expanded powers. The government said the Film Censorship Ordinance has been expanded to include “any act or activity which may amount to an offence endangering national security”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amnesty-calls-xinjiang-a-dystopian-hellscape-101623436949143.html
12-06-2021||World||G7 talks open with elbow bumps||G7 leaders on Friday opened their first in-person talks in nearly two years, with an expected pledge to donate a billion Covid-19 vaccine doses to poor countries on the agenda in a show of Western democratic cohesion.The club of leading economies - Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and United States - says a joint approach is the world’s best chance for recovering from the global health crisis, and tackling climate change.Welcomed by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to the beachside summit venue in Carbis Bay, southwest England, the leaders posed for a family photo before opening their first session of talks on “building back better” after the pandemic.Johnson opened the G7 summit with a message for the world leaders to “learn lessons” from the pandemic and warned that it was vital not to repeat mistakes of the “the last big economic recession of 2008”.The meeting presented a “huge opportunity” for global pandemic recovery, Johnson told his fellow leaders in opening remarks, as they sat socially distanced and without masks at a round-table. The focus was on, he said, “building back greener, building back fairer and building back more equal”.The UK announced it would provide £430mn ($606mn) to support the worst affected by being out of school, most of them girls, and called on its G7 allies to follow suit. The money will go to the Global Partnership for Education.US president points to multilateralismUS President Joe Biden ditched Donald Trump’s isolationist stance to ram home a message of resolve by the G7 and NATO against both Beijing and Moscow, as he heads into his first sit-down with Russian President Vladimir Putin next week.“I’m looking forward to reinforcing our commitment to multilateralism and working with our allies and partners to build a more fair and inclusive global economy,” Biden tweeted from the G7 in Cornwall.Campaigners say the G7’s vaccine donations pledge for this year and next - including 500 million US doses - is far too little, too late to end a pandemic that has claimed over 3.7 million lives worldwide.“If the best G7 leaders can manage is to donate one billion vaccine doses then this summit will have been a failure,” Oxfam said, insisting the world needs 11 billion doses.But the G7 wants to rise to competing “vaccine diplomacy” efforts launched by China and Russia, with the Biden administration stressing it expects nothing in return for its donated jabs.The leaders are also expected to outline more help for developing nations to build up infrastructure, as a counterpoint to the debt-fuelled spending by China in Africa, Asia and Latin America.The initiative “will embrace a high standards, transparent, climate friendly, non-corrupt mechanism” for infrastructure investment in the developing world, a senior US official said.‘Indestructible’ relationsUnderpinning the US-led diplomatic revival, Biden and Johnson on Thursday adopted a new “Atlantic Charter”, modelled on the pact signed by their World War II predecessors to help build a new world order.Johnson dislikes the decades-old phrase “special relationship”, arguing it makes Britain look subservient to Washington, telling the BBC that it should be viewed as “indestructible”.He also played down any differences with Biden over the restive British province of Northern Ireland, ahead of showdown talks between Johnson and EU chiefs on Saturday to tackle deep fissures opened up by Brexit.British foreign secretary Dominic Raab hit back on Friday after French President Emmanuel Macron launched a broadside over the UK back-pedalling regarding post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland.Raab told Sky News “change must come from the European Commission side” and that “we are not negotiating or haggling the integrity of the UK”.Johnson will hope to lighten the mood at a beach barbecue on Saturday, joined by his new wife Carrie and other G7 spouses, with a sea shanty band and toasted marshmallows around fire pits.That will follow a reception for the G7 leaders on Friday evening hosted by Queen Elizabeth II at Cornwall’s Eden Project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g7-talks-open-with-elbow-bumps-101623436210628.html

The applicant had taken certain obscene photographs and videos of the victim and used them for blackmail to maintain a physical relationship with her for the last four years, according to the FIR.On December 8 last year, the woman got married to another man and moved to Delhi. According to her, she came back from Delhi to Mahoba on February 8, 2021. Later, the accused abducted her and thereafter, from February 18 till March 2, she resided with Khan at Orai, along with his sister, where he started compelling her to change her religion, the FIR said.The applicant’s counsel argued, “The victim resides in the same locality where the applicant resides. In such circumstances, it is unswallowable proposition that in a small city like Mahoba, she was not aware about the background of the accused.” Advocates Gayatri Rajput and Dinesh Kumar Singh represented the applicant.After hearing the parties concerned, the court observed, “Keeping in view the nature of the offence, evidence on record regarding complicity of the accused and without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, the court is of the view that the applicant has made out a case for bail. The bail application is allowed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-grants-bail-to-man-booked-for-rape-forced-conversion-in-up-101623521731495.html
12-06-2021||India||Leaders quit Lakshadweep BJP over sedition case against filmmaker||Over a dozen leaders from Lakshadweep have quit the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday protesting against the sedition charges slapped on island-based filmmaker Aisha Sultana for her remarks against the administrator during a TV debate last week. During a debate in one of the Malayalam channels, Sultana had called the union territory administrator Praful Khoda Patel a bio-weapon launched by the Union government and later island BJP president C Abdul Khadar Haji had filed a police compliant against her. The case was registered by Kavaratti Police under Sections 121 A (sedition) and 153 (B) (assertions against national integration) of the Indian Penal Code and she was asked to appear before the police on June 20. The FIR said the accused generated hatred and opposition to the Union government by falsely and with ulterior motives stating that the government deployed a bio-weapon against the people of the island. Sultana is currently settled in Kochi. Peeved leaders said the BJP president’s compliant was “false, unjustified and against the spirit of the island”. “You have filed a false and unjustified compliant against Sultana who pointed out undemocratic actions of the administrator. This will ruin her family and future and this is not in the right spirit of the island,” said one of them, Abdul Hameed Mullipuzha, general secretary of the Kavaratti unit “We can’t go ahead like this. I am resigning from the party,” said B C Cheriya Koya, president of the Andrott unit. Earlier a section of party leaders had resigned and participated in the day-long fast observed by the people on June 7. But the BJP has underplayed these resignations. “Most of them had quit much early. They are raking up their resignations repeatedly to get attention. The party is intact in the island,” said national vice-president of the party A P Abdullah Kutty. Sultana later defended her statement and said she will move the High Court against the police action. “I had used the word bio-weapon in one of the TV debates. I did not attack the country or the Union government. I was referring to some of the decisions of Patel which infuriated local people. Despite popular sentiment, he continues to antagonise people. As a local resident, I have every right to criticise him,” she said taking to Facebook to justify her position. She said the BJP leader who filed a complaint against her had betrayed the land and spirit of islanders. Many film actors and others have extended support to her and deplored the local administration’s move. The Kerala government also said it will provide legal aid to her. The state assembly had passed a resolution unanimously two week ago seeking the recall of the administrator. For over a month residents of the archipelago have been protesting against some of the decisions of the administrator saying they will affect the unique culture and tradition of the group of islands. They are up in arms against three draft regulations that propose to develop the island as a major tourist destination, goonda act and plan to restrict slaughtering of cattle. They also allege these regulations will destroy the islands’ character and identity since 97% of the islands are covered by forests and 95% of its Muslim population belong to the protected scheduled tribe category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leaders-quit-lakshadweep-bjp-over-sedition-case-against-filmmaker-101623521552900.html
12-06-2021||India||Djoke’s on Rafa-is-GOAT camp after epic clash of titans on clay||MUMBAI The 2021 Roland Garros was expected to see a new chapter in modern tennis’ long-lasting GOAT (greatest of all time) debate. Spain’s Rafael Nadal was to turn up in Paris, get on a red-hot run on the red clay, maybe, just maybe, drop a set or two in the process but eventually—like he has done for the four consecutive years—win a 14th title. It’s that routine. That would have put Nadal above Switzerland’s Roger Federer in the Grand Slam men’s singles record list of 20 and, statistically, at least, given the Nadal-is-GOAT camp something to crow (or bleat) about. As it turns out, there’s been a twist in the tale, and it could well end up being a new chapter -- only, not what was scripted. Blame it on the third cog of the so-called Big Three of tennis (58 slam titles between them since 2003 when Federer won his first) decided to do a little history writing of his own. On a Friday evening that culminated into the night , and across four pulsating sets of arguably the best tennis seen in years, Novak Djokovic did what no other mortal has ever managed to or even come close to doing at what has become the Spaniard’s own patch of clay in Paris: beat Nadal in the semi-finals; beat Nadal after he took the first set; beat Nadal a second time at the Roland Garros after also being the last man to do so in 2015. The world No. 1’s titanic triumph booked him a spot in the French Open final for a second straight year; he will take on a first-time slam finalist and in-form Greek Stefanos Tsitsipas. Should the Serb cross the line on Sunday, he will add a 19th title to his Grand Slam tally, one below Federer and Nadal in the record list.The 34-year-old Djokovic, the youngest of the trio (Nadal is 35 and Federer, 39), could also become the first player in the Open Era to own will all four Grand Slam titles at least twice, a feat Nadal (he has won the Australian only once, in 2009) and Federer (French Open; 2009) haven’t achieved so far. The Australian Open winner could even be looking at a slam sweep this year, which would give him 21 Majors and the sole ownership at the top of the chart. Djokovic is the defending champion at Wimbledon and usually ruthless on hard courts on which the year-ending US Open is played, so it’s not beyond the realm of possibility. Still, irrespective of the outcome on Sunday, Djokovic’s tactical, physical and mental dismantling of the 13-time French Open champion has shown the world how good he really is, and also necessitated some recalibration of all that GOAT talk.For one, there is his superior head-to-head record against Federer (27-23) and Nadal (30-28), or his record stranglehold on the top spot of the world rankings. Djokovic has bossed over his two biggest rivals even on their most dominant surfaces. Djokovic has beaten Nadal twice at the French Open, double the count of the only other player to do so (kudos, Robin Soderling). Against eight-time champion Federer at the Wimbledon, Djokovic has a 3-1 win-loss record. Contrast that to the record of Nadal (0-2) and Federer (1-4) against Djokovic at his most productive Slam, the Australian Open, where he is a nine-time champion.Then, there is his recent form. Since the 2015 season when a two-way marathon suddenly became a three-way sprint with Djokovic winning three of the four slams, the Serb has allowed neither the Spaniard nor the Swiss to get better of him on tennis’ most important stages. Since then, Djokovic has met Nadal four times in the slams, and won thrice, and Federer, five times, and won all. Of the last 10 Grand Slams, Djokovic has won six to Nadal’s three and Federer’s zero. Believers in the church of Nole (as Djokovic is called by family and friends) say that could have been seven, had Djokovic, on a 29-match unbeaten streak, not been defaulted from the US Open fourth round last year for accidentally hitting a line judge with the ball.That was an aberration, as was his only defeat in a slam since the start of last year, a straight-sets thrashing by Nadal in the final of the 2020 French Open. Like his spectacular turnaround against the same opponent on the same surface on Friday showed, Djokovic is in no mood to slow down as he nears the top. “Each time you step on court with him (Nadal), you know that you have to climb Mount Everest to win against this guy here,” Djokovic summed up his victory.On Friday, in a match that history may well remember as the best four-setter ever played -- some passages of play in the second and third sets were breathtaking -- he sprinted up the mountain. If he wins on Sunday night, he can plant the flag.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/djokes-on-rafa-is-goat-camp-after-epic-clash-of-titans-on-clay-101623521012047.html

German Chancellor Angela Merkel specifically referred to PM's mantra and conveyed strong support, reports said. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison referred to his discussions with PM Modi earlier about TRIPS waiver and conveyed strong support of Australia.Calling for global unity, leadership, and solidarity to prevent future pandemics, PM Modi in his G7 address emphasised the special responsibility of democratic and transparent societies in this regard. Prime Minister committed India's support for collective endeavours to improve global health governance. He sought the G7's support for the proposal moved at the WTO by India and South Africa, for a TRIPS waiver on Covid-related technologies.Also Read | Internet shut off during G7 session as leaders debate over China: ReportPM Modi in his address highlighted India's ‘whole of society’ approach to fight the pandemic, synergising the efforts of all levels of the government, industry and civil society. He also explained India’s successful use of open source digital tools for contact tracing and vaccine management, and conveyed India's willingness to share its experience and expertise with other developing countries.The G7 leaders on Saturday debated how strongly they should respond to China which led to serious differences among the world leaders and the internet of the room was shut off, reports said.PM Modi's other two sessions in the G7 summit are scheduled for June 13. The theme was Building Back Stronger, Building Back Together and Building Back Greener.On May 11, it was announced that PM Modi will not attend the G7 Summit in person, as the second wave of the pandemic was at its peak. The UK supported PM Modi's decision and said all efforts would be taken to ensure his participation in the Summit is seamless, "as if he were actually in the room".UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson had invited PM Modi to attend the outreach component of the G7 Summit being held in Cornwall in the UK from 11-13 June (guest countries' component starts on 12 June) along with Australia, Republic of Korea and South Africa.India first participated in the Outreach Session of the G7 Summit in 2003. This is the second time that the Indian Prime Minister will be participating in the G7 meet. India had been invited by the G7 French presidency in 2019 to the summit as a goodwill partner and the PM participated in these sessions on climate, biodiversity on oceans as well as on digital transformation.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-earth-one-health-pm-modi-says-at-g7-australia-supports-trips-waiver-101623508430624.html
12-06-2021||India||Orange alert for Mumbai, Konkan coast till June 15||Mumbai and the entire Konkan coast in Maharashtra are likely to see heavy to extremely heavy rainfall at isolated locations on Sunday and Monday. Raigad and Ratnagiri districts have been placed under a red category storm alert for Sunday and Monday, indicating a higher chance of severe weather, while Mumbai, Thane, Palghar and Sindhudurg districts have been placed under an orange category storm warning.Earlier on Saturday, the IMD had issued a red alert for Mumbai and the entire Konkan region, but this was later downgraded to an orange category alert for all districts except Ratnagiri and Raigad, as the “heavy rainfall belt has moved southwards”, IMD officials clarified. However, with the formation of a low-pressure area over north Bay of Bengal and cyclonic circulations in the Arabian Sea facilitating strong westerly winds, an active rainfall spell is expected over the Konkan coast for at least the next four to five days, IMD officials said. Mumbai has now recorded a total of 706.1mm of rain (as of 5:30 pm on Saturday) -- as against the monthly average rainfall of 505 mm -- between June 1 and June 12. This includes rainfall accumulation from pre-monsoon showers between June 1 and June 8. In the 24 hours ending 8:30am on Saturday, Mumbai had received 107mm of rainfall, as per the automatic weather station at Santacruz. In the nine hours ending 5:30 pm, the Santacruz observatory recorded 64.8 mm rain.Mumbai’s only operational doppler radar at Colaba, meanwhile, was revived after over three weeks of inoperation on Saturday. The radar had been defunct since May 16, a day before Cyclone Tauktae passed the city on its way to Gujarat. Dr MN Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences, had told HT on Friday that it was likely to remain defunct for at least two months. Despite repeated requests, IMD officials did not clarify the reason for the radar’s speedy repair.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/orange-alert-for-mumbai-konkan-coast-till-june-15-101623518492030.html
12-06-2021||India||Kerala govt orders SIT probe into axing of protected trees||The Kerala government on Saturday constituted a special investigation team (SIT) under Additional Director General of Police S Sreejith to investigate the alleged smuggling of centuries old rosewood and teakwood from Wayanad and other districts after misusing a government order that allowed cutting of trees on revenue land allotted to farmers before 1964. The SIT will have officials from forest, vigilance, revenue departments and the crime branch, the government said. The rampant felling of trees invited enough embarrassment for the government and the opposition has been planning to move the high court for a central agency probe. After the Muttil (Wayanad) incident came to light in which 101 rosewood trees, some of them as old as 500 years, were smuggled out many other districts also reported similar cases. In Thrissur, officials have foiled an attempt to burn stumps of cut teakwood trees to destroy evidence on Friday night. Green activists said trees worth more than ₹500 crore were plundered using a weird government order and they suspect a nexus between politicians, officials and the timber mafia behind this. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday said it was a serious issue and the government will not spare anyone found guilty. The government had admitted in the high court last week that a big mafia ring was involved and recovered trees were the tip of the iceberg. Wood from trees worth ₹50 crore have been seized so far. In October 2020, the state revenue department had issued an order allowing felling of protected trees like rosewood and teak grown by farmers in the assigned land. Under the guise of this order, wood worth crores of rupees were smuggled out from private and forest land. Poor farmers were given paltry amounts after they were showed the government order by timber mafia. Conservationists said without the consent of the political leadership principal secretary (revenue) A Jayathilak should not have issued such a controversial order. Sniffing trouble, Wayanad district collect Dr Adeela Abdullah had alerted her superiors last October but nobody took notice. On the other hand, Divisional Forest Officer (Flying Squad) P Dhanesh Kumar who played a key role in unearthing the alleged smuggling was reinstated in the probe team after a huge outrage. After the case was discovered, he was shifted to an insignificant post and forest minister A K Saseendran admitted on Friday that he was not aware of the abrupt transfer of the officer. A daring official, he survived two attempts on his life. He was the first to seize a truckload of rosewood in February but there were many attempts to silence him. The bigger picture of the alleged plunder came to light two weeks ago after a truckload of wood was seized from Ernakulam. Kumar was instrumental in reclaiming over 7,500 acres of forest land. The Wildlife Protection Society of India had honoured him in 2006 for tiger protection and later he received the chief minister’s award in 2007 for busting an inter-state sandalwood gang. Two plants in the Western Ghats have been named after him-- Rotala Dhaneshiana and Syzygium Dhaneshia. “I can’t talk about the case. But I will be on the forefront to save forest and wildlife,” is all he had to say.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-govt-orders-sit-probe-into-axing-of-protected-trees-101623516872054.html

I believe dialogue is the solution to every issue,” the former chief minister of erstwhile J&K further said.Meanwhile Mufti’s party, the PDP, also condemned the attacks. “Strongly condemn the heinous attack in Sopore which has consumed 5 lives. Our souls have been scarred for decades now by such wanton acts of violence. Mutilated bodies, ravaged homes and murder of dreams-- that's the trail attacks like these leave behind,” the party tweeted via its official handle.Earlier in the day, armed militants opened fire on security forces in Kashmir’s Sopore town, killing two policemen and two civilians. Also, three others including two policemen, were also injured in the attack.Director General of Police Dilbagh Singh said that the militants fired at a police party deployed for ensuring Covid appropriate behaviour. He also said that an operation has been launched to nab the culprits.“The forces have launched an operation in the area and we are hopeful that we will soon bring to justice the perpetrators of the crime... According to our information, the LeT is involved and we have almost identified the militants in the attack, but we will not share their details yet,” news agency PTI quoted DGP Singh as saying.Vice President of the Jammu Kashmir National Conference (JKNC) Omar Abdullah also condemned the attack and expressed his condolences for the families of those who lost their lives. “Terrible news coming in from Sopore. Such attacks must be condemned without reservation. Prayers for the injured & condolences to the families of the deceased,” he tweeted. His party, the JKNC, too said that “JKNC unequivocally condemns the killing of two cops and a civilian in Sopore today and prays that the bereaved families find enough strength to bear the irreparable loss. Government must ensure a stop to such brutal loss of lives,” in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pdp-leader-mehbooba-mufti-condemns-sopore-attack-says-guns-won-t-resolve-any-issues-101623515038189.html

12-06-2021||India||No evidence of severe illness among children in third wave: Report||The Lancet Covid-19 Commission India Task Force in a report said that there appears to be no substantial evidence that a probable third wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic will cause greater illness in children.“Based on the data available, there appears to be no substantial evidence to suggest that children would be more affected or would have greater illness severity due to Covid-19 infection in the anticipated third wave. Studies also indicate that children have milder disease, better prognosis, and low mortality in comparison to adults,” the report accessed by news agency PTI said.“Most children with Covid-19 are asymptomatic, and amongst those symptomatic mild infections are predominant. Most children have a fever with respiratory symptoms, and often present with gastrointestinal symptoms (such as diarrhoea, vomiting, pain in the abdomen) and atypical manifestation compared to adults. The proportion of symptomatic children increases as age increases as does the severity in such age groups,” the report further added.It also pointed out that the infection’s symptomatology in Indian children is globally comparable. The report said data of approximately 2,600 hospitalised children, below the age of 10 years (which excluded neonates) from 10 public and private hospitals in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra and the Delhi-NCR region were taken for collection and analysis.The report said that mortality rates among these surveyed children who were hospitalised due to Covid-19 was 2.4 per cent and about 40% of those children had died suffering from comorbidities. “Nine per cent of all hospitalised COVID-19 positive children presented with severe illness, under 10 years of age. The above observations were similar during the two surges of Covid-19 infections India has experienced,” the report highlighted.Sheffali Gulati, Sushil K Kabra and Rakesh Lodha, three doctors from AIIMS also contributed to the report. Kabra said that less than 5% will require hospitalisation and the mortality rate among them is 2%.“Say out of 1 lakh, 500 children get hospitalised and 2% of deaths are reported among them. So in one lakh, the mortality of just one or two children is seen. In children, as such the disease is less severe,” Kabra was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.“Very low proportion requires hospitalisation and a very small proportion of mortality is reported. Mortality is also contributed by underlying diseases in the form of comorbidities like diabetes, cancer, anaemia or severe malnutrition. In normal children, mortality is extremely rare,” he further added.The report also highlighted that among older teens mortality rates are low but mortality appeared to be marginally higher for obese teens compared to those who are not obese.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-evidence-of-severe-illness-among-children-in-third-wave-report-101623514447726.html

Since the meeting took place a day after BJP’s national vice president Mukul Roy, who left TMC to join the BJP in 2017, returned to the TMC on Friday, it fuelled speculations that Banerjee too may return to the Trinamool Congress. Both Ghosh and Banerjee, however, said that it was a courtesy visit, and no political discussions were held. “I came to meet a relative, who stays nearby. Kunal Ghosh is like my brother and friend. I called him and as he was at home, I came to meet him. We didn’t have any political discussions,” said Banerjee. The fact that Banerjee, a few days ago, had criticized the BJP in a social media post after the party’s debacle in the recently held assembly polls also added to the speculation. The TMC had won 213 seats while the BJP had won 77. “I still stick to my point. It is not right to threaten a party with President’s Rule and try to play on communal lines, when the party has returned to power with a thumping victory. I have reservations and will oppose it,” said Banerjee. Ghosh too said it was a courtesy visit and that Banerjee had come to meet him as he had come to meet an ailing relative who stays nearby. “It was just a courtesy meet. Earlier too he had come to meet me at my house,” said Ghosh. The BJP, however, tried to downplay the event saying that the party was more concerned with party workers who are coming under attack every day. “We don’t have time for all these things – who met whom and whether that person had tea with sugar. Our workers are under attack every day. Post poll violence is going on and we are more concerned with that,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP’s spokesperson in the state. Some turncoats, who left the TMC and BJP ahead of the polls, have openly said that they want to return to the party and have even sent apologies to the TMC chief, while a few others have ‘sent feelers’ to TMC leaders by criticizing the BJP. TMC chief Mamata Banerjee, however, made it clear on Friday that the party is not going to accept all the turncoats who are willing to return.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-mukul-roy-s-return-bjp-s-rajib-banerjee-meets-tmc-leader-101623511291527.html

12-06-2021||India||GST on Remdesivir, medical oxygen, Covid-19 essentials slashed till Sept 30||The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council on Saturday temporarily removed GST on two medicines, slashed tax rates on 15 other items such as drugs, medical grade oxygen and testing kits to 5%, and reduced the levy on ambulances to 12% for a little over three-and-a-half months in order to provide relief to people fighting the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.GST on Amphotericin B and Tocilizumab has been slashed from 5% to zero, while taxes on Remdesivir and anti-coagulants like Heparin have been reduced from 12% to 5%. A flat GST rate of 5% is kept for all such drugs that would be recommended by the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) and the department of pharmaceuticals (DoP) for Covid-19 treatment.After the 44the meeting of the council, its chairperson and Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the levy of 5% GST on Covid-19 vaccines would continue as 75% vaccines are available to people free of cost in government hospitals even as the tax burden would be borne by the Central government.“These rates will be valid till September as against August-end [that was] recommended by the GoM,” she said. According to the Union finance minister, the GST Council would review the situation later and take a decision on extending the exemption period further. GST Council is chaired by Sitharaman and finance ministers of states are its members.The 43rd meeting of the council on May 28 had decided to form a group of ministers (GoM) to consider tax-waivers on individual Covid-19 essentials such as vaccines, testing kits, drugs, medical oxygen, oxygen concentrators, ventilators, alcohol-based sanitizer and hand wash. A day later, Sitharaman constituted an eight-member ministerial panel under the convener-ship of Meghalaya chief minister Conrad K Sangma, which submitted its recommendations to the council on June 6.In order to bring down costs on oxygen, oxygen generation equipment and related medical devices, the council reduced GST these items from 12% to 5%. They are medical grade oxygen, oxygen concentrator, oxygen generator (including personal imports), ventilators, ventilator masks, canula and helmet, BiPAP machine and high flow nasal canula (HFNC) device.GST rates on Covid-19 testing kits and specified inflammatory diagnostic kits -- D-Dimer, IL-6, Ferritin and LDH – have also been brought down from 12% to 5%.Other Covid-19 related relief materials have been also made cheaper. While GST on pulse oximeters (including personal imports) has been reduced from 12% to 5%, taxes on hand sanitizer, temperature check equipment, and gas, electric and other types of furnaces for crematorium, including their installation have been slashed from 18% to 5%. Relief is also given on purchase of ambulances by reducing GST on them from 28% to 12%.MS Mani, senior director at Deloitte India said that the shorter duration of exemptions would make difficult for businesses to plan new investments and expand supply chains. “Businesses engaged in their manufacture and trading would hope that the period is extended beyond 30th September,” he said.Abhishek Jain, tax partner at consultancy firm EY said that the council’s decision to bring down the GST rates on key Covid-19 relief items would “reduce the cost of such critical Covid-19 items for the end users”.The GoM was constituted after several states demanded GST waiver on Covid-19 essentials. Other members of the GoM were Gujarat deputy chief minister Nitinbhai Patel, Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, Goa transport minister Mauvin Godinho, Kerala finance minister KN Balagopal, Odisha finance minister Niranjan Pujari, Telangana finance minister T Harish Rao and UP finance minister Suresh Kr Khanna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-on-remdesivir-medical-oxygen-covid-19-essentials-slashed-till-sept-30-101623507811335.html
12-06-2021||India||India did not see 5-7 times excess Covid-19 deaths. Govt explains why||The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on Saturday informed that States and Union Territories record Covid-19 deaths as per guidance issued by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).In an official release, the ministry slammed a renowned international magazine for publishing an article that claimed that "India has suffered perhaps five to seven times 'excess deaths' than the official number of Covid-19 fatalities".The union health ministry said that the article was speculative article, is without any basis and seems to be misinformed.It added that the unsound analysis of the said article is based on the extrapolation of data without any epidemiological evidence.Studies which are used by the magazine as an estimate of excess mortality are not validated tools for determining the mortality rate of any country or region, the government said."The so-called "evidence" cited by the magazine is a study supposedly done by Christopher Laffler of Virginia Commonwealth University. An internet search of research studies in scientific databases such as Pubmed, Research Gate, etc., did not locate this study and the detailed methodology of this study has not been provided by the magazine."Another evidence given is the study done in Telangana based on insurance claims. Again, there is no peer-reviewed scientific data available on such a study," the statement said."Two other studies relied upon are those done by Psephology groups namely "Prashnam" and "C-Voter" who are well versed in conducting, predicting and analyzing poll results. They were never ever associated with public health research. Even in their own area of work of psephology, their methodologies for predicting poll results have been wide off the mark many times," it said.By their own submission, the magazine states that "such estimates have been extrapolated from patchy and often unreliable local government data, from company records and from analyses of such things as obituaries", the statement saidStating that it has been transparent in its approach to Covid data management, the government said that as early as May 2020, to avoid inconsistency in the number of deaths being reported, the ICMR issued 'Guidance for the appropriate recording of COVID-19 related deaths in India' for correct recording of all deaths as per ICD-10 codes recommended by World Health Organisation (WHO) for mortality coding.States and UTs have been urged through formal communications, multiple video conferences and through the deployment of Central teams for correct recording of deaths in accordance with laid down guidelines.Union Health Ministry said that it has also regularly emphasized the need for a robust reporting mechanism for monitoring district-wise cases and deaths on a daily basis.States consistently reporting a lower number of daily deaths was told to re-check their data. A case in point is the Union Government writing to the State of Bihar to provide a detailed date and district-wise break-up of the reconciled number of deaths to the Union Health Ministry.As per the ministry's release, it's a well-known fact that there shall always be differences in mortality recorded during a profound and prolonged public health crisis such as Covid pandemic and well-conducted research studies on excess mortalities, usually done after the event when data on mortalities are available from reliable sources.

12-06-2021||India||Twitter sends notices to cartoonist Manjul, other users||Unnamed law enforcement agencies have asked Twitter to take down certain tweets of popular cartoonist Manjul, fact-checking website Alt News co-founder Mohammed Zubair and others, over alleged violation of law. Manjul, Zubair and retired IAS officer Surya Pratap Singh have shared screenshots of the notice sent by the microblogging platform on their Twitter handles over the last few days. Sources said the Ministry of Electronics and IT was not involved in sending these legal requests to Twitter. It wasn't clear which agencies have flagged these tweets by these users and for what violations. Emails sent to Twitter did not elicit a response. Meanwhile, the screenshot shared by Manjul showed Twitter as saying: "In the interest of transparency, we are writing to inform you that Twitter has received a request from Indian law enforcement regarding your Twitter account @MANJULtoons, that claims the ... content violates the law(s) of India". It further stated that Twitter has “not taken any action on the reported content at this time as a result of this request”. Twitter, in its notice, said it is the company's policy to notify users if it receives a legal request from an authorised entity (such as law enforcement or a government agency) to remove content from their account. Twitter further informed the account holders that while the platform is unable to provide legal advice, "we want you to have an opportunity to evaluate the request and, if you wish, take appropriate action to protect your interests". "This may include seeking legal counsel and challenging the request in court, contacting relevant civil society organisations, voluntarily deleting the content (if applicable), or finding some other resolution," Twitter added. Mohammed Zubair and Surya Pratap Singh also shared screenshots with similarly worded notices from Twitter on their own accounts. These three users each have lakhs of followers on the platform. Twitter has had several faceoffs with the Indian government over the past months, including during the farmers' protest and later when it tagged political posts of several leaders of the ruling party BJP as "manipulated media". Twitter has also been facing heat for delay in complying with the IT rules that mandate large digital platforms to undertake greater due diligence and make them more accountable and responsible for the content hosted by them. Social media companies will have to take down flagged content within 36 hours, and remove within 24 hours content that is flagged for issues such as nudity and pornography under the new rules. Under the rules, significant social media intermediaries -- those with over 50 lakh users -- are required to appoint a grievance officer, a nodal officer and a chief compliance officer. These personnel have to be residents in India. Earlier this week, Twitter assured the Indian government that it is in advanced stages of finalising the appointment of chief compliance officer as required under the new IT rules, and that it will submit additional details within a week. Twitter has also stated that India will be one of the first countries in which it pilots a new approach of building an in-market team to "locally tailor" its global product to the needs of the region. As part of its strategy, the company is scouting for a 'Staff Designer', who will help the platform establish a bespoke product strategy for Twitter in India and execute against it with support from a dedicated local team. Twitter has an estimated 1.75 crore users in India, as per data cited by the government recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-sends-notices-to-cartoonist-manjul-other-users-101623503346799.html

The agency called Choksi’s “gratuitous offer” of being interviewed at the place of his choice outside India meaningless, citing large evidence, oral and documentary, with which he needs to be confronted.The affidavit accuses Choksi of misleading courts in Dominica by claiming there are no proceedings against him in India. He is fully aware of proceedings in India and has even appointed lawyers there, says the affidavit, a copy of which HT has seen. The affidavit, filed by deputy inspector general Sharda Raut, explains the procedures of investigations and criminal trials in India. It says Choksi, according to the Criminal Procedure Code, cannot be tried in absentia. It is only after an accused is produced in court or appears in court that charges can be framed for a trial to begin. Raut flew to Dominica on May 28 along with other officers in a special jet with documents to back India attempts for Choksi’s deportation from Dominica. Choksi went missing from Antigua and Barbuda, where he is a citizen, on May 23. He was found in Dominica the next day and has since been charged with illegal entry into the Caribbean country. Choksi’s lawyers, Vijay Aggarwal, Wayne Marsh, and his wife, Priti Choksi, have alleged he was abducted and taken to Dominica. HT on Saturday reported about two affidavits India has filed in the Dominica court detailing serious fraud charges against Choksi and proof that he continues to be an Indian citizen. Choksi’s lawyers have maintained he has given up his Indian citizenship and hence cannot be deported.The Dominica court refused to grant Choksi bail on Friday saying he is a flight risk, and that he has no ties to the country. It observed the court cannot impose any conditions to ensure he will not abscond. The CBI affidavit has called Choksi the “mastermind” behind a series of companies. It says there is evidence that the businessman laundered funds using dummy companies and market operators, round-tripped in the guise of fraudulent export-import transactions with entities in places such as Dubai and Hong Kong. The affidavit says Choksi owes $950 million (close to ₹7,000 crore) to the public sector bank, in which the Indian government has an 85% stake. It adds the CBI made attempts to arrest Choksi after the fraud was unearthed in 2018, but his whereabouts were unknown. The CBI affidavit says there is an Interpol red notice issued against Choksi, which is the highest level that can be issued in respect of a fugitive. It also refers to other cases under investigation against Choksi in India. They include fraud cases registered in Bengaluru and Delhi in 2015 and 2016 as well as a 2018 cheating case. Vijay Aggarwal, Choksi’s lawyer, said they are not bothered by the affidavit as the facts stated therein are not relevant considerations before the court hearing his client’s bail plea. He added they have the liberty to reapply for bail. “Every day in custody is a fresh circumstance and bail can be re-applied. The court has not ruled on merits but only on the ground that we need to satisfy the court about my client‘s presence in Dominica to face the trial and prove his innocence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/choksi-a-fugitive-from-justice-cbi-tells-dominican-court-101623502771356.html
12-06-2021||India||IMA to hold nationwide protest against assault on doctors||The Indian Medical Association (IMA) will hold a protest against various incidents of assault on doctors on June 18, its chief Dr JA Jayalal said on Saturday.Jayalal said that in recent months, incidents of assault have increased on doctors who were working on the frontlines and demanded that the government bring a law under the CrPC and the IPC for the protection of doctors and healthcare workers.“We demand that the government introduce a central protection law under the provisions of CrPC and IPC and also ensure that all government and private hospitals have a mandatory security structure,” Jayalal was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.In the past few months, doctors have been assaulted in Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and West Bengal, Jayalal said, adding that it is the duty of the government to provide adequate security to frontline workers.“Doctors serving in Covid-19 wards have been brutally assaulted in Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and West Bengal. It is the government’s responsibility to ensure that frontline workers are safe while battling a pandemic,” he said.Jayalal highlighted that on June 18 during the ‘Save the Saviours’ protest hospitals will continue to operate normally. The IMA has asked all its state and local branches to participate in the protest by wearing black badges, masks, ribbons and shirts. It has also asked doctors to organise awareness campaigns against violence targeting healthcare professionals.“The Indian Medical Association (IMA) will lead a protest of healthcare workers on June 18 against assault on healthcare professionals with the 'Save the Saviour' slogan. No hospitals will be closed. Doctors will bear black badge, black mask, or black shirt,” Jayalal further added.Earlier in June, a doctor at a Covid care centre (CCC) in Assam was assaulted by a mob. In a separate incident, family members of a child thrashed a doctor in Karnataka following her death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ima-to-hold-nationwide-protest-against-assault-on-doctors-101623501990096.html
12-06-2021||India||Defence minister clears policy on declassifying war records||In a significant development that will help set the record straight on India’s military history, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday approved a new policy to declassify war histories and records of other military operations in a time-bound manner to give the country an accurate account of events, provide authentic material for research and counter unfounded rumours, the defence ministry said in a statement. The policy on “archiving, declassification and compilation of war and operations histories” mandates the setting up of a committee headed by a joint secretary in the defence ministry and consisting of representatives of the armed forces, external affairs ministry, home ministry and prominent military historians (if required). The development is significant as the military has faced uncomfortable questions about several events including the sinking of an Indian warship in the 1971 Indo-Pak war, the 1999 Kargil war and contentious war accounts authored by veterans. It was not immediately clear if the policy would lead to the declassification of the Henderson Brooks-Bhagat report on the reasons behind India’s defeat in the 1962 India-China war. “The committee will take a view on earlier wars and operations,” an official familiar with the developments said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Australian journalist Neville Maxwell had made portions of the Henderson Brooks-Bhagat report public in March 2014 by uploading it on the internet triggering a debate on India’s worst military defeat and the events that led to it. The report practically held the entire civilian and military leadership responsible for driving the country into a war it wasn’t prepared for. The BJP then demanded that the report, authored by Lieutenant General Thomas Bryan Henderson Brookes and Brigadier PS Bhagat, be declassified immediately. But in July 2014, then defence minister Arun Jaitley told Parliament that the release of the document would not be in national interest. The government declassified the 1947-48 Kashmir operations in 1987. The defence ministry’s History Division has published histories of the 1962, 1965 and 1971 wars. The responsibility for declassification of records rests with the respective organisations as specified in the Public Records Act 1993 and Public Record Rules 1997, the defence ministry said in the statement. “According to the policy, records should ordinarily be declassified in 25 years. Records older than 25 years should be appraised by archival experts and transferred to the National Archives of India once the war/operations histories have been compiled,” the statement said. The ministry’s History Division, set up in October 1953, will be responsible for coordination with various departments for compiling, seeking approval and publishing war and operations histories. All organisations under the ministry will transfer the records, including war diaries, letters of proceedings and operational record books to the History Division for upkeep, archival and writing the histories, the statement said. The new policy lays down timelines for compilation and publication of war and operations histories. “The above-mentioned Committee (under the joint secretary) should be formed within two years of completion of war/operations. Thereafter, collection of records and compilation should be completed in three years and disseminated to all concerned,” the statement said. Sensitive information will not be released, the officials said. “The history of wars and operations compiled within five years will be for internal consumption first and later the committee may decide to publicly release whole or parts of it, considering the sensitivity of the subject,” said one of the officials cited above. Experts welcomed the move. “It’s good to have certain aspects of a war or a campaign declassified for people to know the rationale behind those actions, how they were carried out and the lessons learnt. But there are certain aspects that are confidential and need not come out in the public domain keeping national interest in mind,” said Lieutenant General VK Ahluwalia (retd), director, Centre for Land Warfare Studies. Expert panels including the Kargil Review Committee have underlined the need to have war histories written with a clear policy on declassification of war records in order to analyse lessons learnt and prevent future mistakes, the statement added. The government appointed a committee in October 2001 under former defence secretary NN Vohra to look into publication of war histories. After it submitted its report in July 2002, the History Division approached the United Service Institution of India (a think tank) to scrutinise its war histories and eliminate distortions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defence-minister-clears-policy-on-declassifying-war-records-101623502110962.html

Govt replies||When Bharat Biotech's Covaxin was allowed for restricted emergency use under the clinical trial mode in January, beneficiaries had to fill a form mentioning whether they had any kind of allergies as the company at that time suggested advised not to take the vaccine if one has allergies. As Bharat Biotech provided more data, its vaccine was removed from the 'clinical trial' mode.So, can people with allergies can take Covaxin now? Without specifying the name of the vaccine, Dr VK Paul of Niti Aayog said if one has a severe allergy issue, then it's better to consult a doctor before getting vaccinated. But if it is a common allergy issue of skin, then there should be no hesitation to take any Covid-19 vaccines.#IndiaFightsCorona:📍कोविड-19 टीकाकरण पर अक्सर पूछे जाने वाले प्रश्न✅ क्या एलर्जी वाले लोगों को टीका लगाया जा सकता है❓❓❓➡️ आइए जानिए इसके बारे में👇#Unite2FightCorona #StayHomeStaySafe pic.twitter.com/q6iYtWcrOPAIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria said if one is on allergy medication, then the medication should be continued after vaccination. "If there is any allergic reaction post the vaccination, then once can report to the doctors at the vaccination centre," Dr Guleria said.According to Bharat Biotech, the manufacturer of the vaccines, individuals with a history of allergies to oral medications or a family history of allergic reactions, or who might have a mild allergy to vaccines (but no anaphylaxis) may still get vaccinated.But those who have known allergies to any component of Covaxin should not take the vaccine, the company said. And these components are 6µg of whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 antigen (Strain: NIV-2020-770), and the other inactive ingredients such as aluminium hydroxide gel 250 µg, TLR 7/8 agonist (imidazoquinolinone) 15 µg, 2-phenoxyethanol 2.5 mg, and phosphate buffer saline up to 0.5 ml.As far as Covishield is concerned, one should not take the vaccine if the first dose of it creates a severe allergic reaction, Serum Institute of India had disclosed it in its fact sheet. If one has a known allergy to any ingredient of the vaccine which includes L-Histidine, L-Histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, Magnesium chloride hexahydrate, Polysorbate 80, Ethanol, Sucrose, Sodium chloride, Disodium edetate dihydrate (EDTA), one should not take the vaccine, the company said earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-to-do-after-covid-19-vaccination-if-you-have-allergies-govt-replies-101623501360497.html
12-06-2021||India||ICMR’s 4th national serosurvey ‘will tell us about antibodies in vaccinated people’ as well: All you need to know||Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is all slated to conduct the fourth national serosurvey in the country this month, Dr VK Paul, Member of Niti Ayog (health) told reporters during a press briefing on Friday.A serosurvey is useful in detecting the presence of Covid-19 antibodies in the human body; the presence of antibodies signifies the person has been exposed to the virus. Sero-surveys test the liquid part of blood or ‘serum’ and not fluid present in the nose, throat, and mouth. Sero-surveys provide us with a broad picture of the spread of the infection.What we know about the fourth national serosurvey so farThis will be the fourth serosurvey conducted by the ICMR in the country, after the third nationwide serosurvey conducted between December 17, 2020, and January 8, 2021. It will be conducted in 70 districts across the country and will also include children aged six years and above. Paul stressed the need for state-wide serosurveys to “protect our geographies” from threats of the pandemic. He urged states to conduct serosurveys at Covid-19 hotspots and infection spots at district and state levels.The fourth survey will be the first one to be conducted after vaccination has been rolled out for the general population. Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCBM) advisor Dr Rakesh Mishra told news agency ANI that this new survey will tell us more about the presence of antibodies in vaccinated adults.What have we learnt from serosurveys so far?As per the last survey, at least one in five Indian above the age of 18 years had been exposed to coronavirus by January 8. Experts opined that the findings were indicative of a large proportion of the country – nearly 80% – remaining susceptible to the virus. The last serosurvey also established that seroprevalence in children between the ages of 10 and 17 was at 25.3%, whereas in healthcare workers, it stood at 25.7%.A serosurvey also gives nuanced data along the gender and occupational lines. The last survey found that more women (22.7%) had Covid-antibodies compared to men (20.3%). It also established that out of the 7,171 health care workers from taluk hospitals, community health centres, primary health centres, etc, from each district covered in the serosurvey, doctors and nurses were affected the most with a seroprevalence of 26.6%, followed by paramedical staff (25.4%), field staff (25.3%), and administrative staff (24.9%).All three serosurveys conducted till date have been carried out in 700 villages, 70 districts from 21 states in the country. In the first one, adults were surveyed during the period of the second half of May to early June, and seropositivity of 0.73% was reported. The second survey was carried out during August and September and it found seropositivity of 6.6% amongst all those aged 10 years and above.Serosurveys, however, do not tell us if the population tested is protected from any further infections. It detects all antibodies present in the body and not all antibodies are protective in nature. Thus, vaccination in combination with Covid-appropriate behaviour remains the key to fighting Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmrs-4th-national-serosurvey-will-tell-us-about-antibodies-in-vaccinated-people-as-well-all-you-need-to-know-101623499726255.html
12-06-2021||India||'No, India not hiding Covid-19 toll,' Centre replies to criticism in 4 points||India's mechanism to monitor Covid-19 death is robust and there is no question of "five to seven times excess deaths" than the official number of Covid-19 fatalities, as claimed by an international magazine, the Centre said. Without naming The Economist, which claimed that "the government's numbers represent a disturbingly small fraction of the real figure", the union health ministry on Saturday said the analysis is not sound.In a sharply worded rebuttal, the Centre raised a few questions over the methodology on which the article on Covid-19 death in India is based.One, the ministry said the article is speculative and the analysis is based on extrapolation of data without any epidemiological evidence.Two, the article has taken data from studies that were not done by validated tools, the Centre said.Three, the study they have quoted is supposedly done by Christopher Laffler of Virginia Commonwealth University. "An internet search of research studies in scientific database such Pubmed, Research Gate, etc., did not locate this study and the detailed methodology of this study has not been provided by the magazine," the ministry said.Another study was done in Telangana based on insurance claims, the Centre said adding that there is no peer-reviewed scientific data available on such studyFour, two other studies by Prashnam and C-Voter have been quoted in the article. The ministry said these firms are well versed in conducting, predicting and analysing poll results and even then their poll predictions have gone wrong. They were never ever associated with public health research. "Even in their own area of work of psephology, their methodologies for predicting poll results have been wide off the mark many times," the Centre said.The overall Covid-19 toll in India shot up after the Bihar government revised its toll saying the government got to know from various sources that the number of Covid-19 deaths is more than what has been reported as many deaths in private hospitals, homes went unaccounted. From 5,458, the toll went to 9.429 after the revision, triggering speculations in the international media whether India's Covid-19 death toll has been manipulated. At present, India's Covid-19 death toll stands at 3,67,081, starting from the beginning of the pandemic in 2020.Emphasis on correct recordingThe Centre clarified that it has several mechanisms in place to check if there is any under-reporting of data at any level. "States consistently reporting a lower number of daily deaths were told to re-check their data. A case in point is the Union Government writing to the State of Bihar to provide detailed date and district-wise break-up of the reconciled number of deaths to Union Health Ministry," it said.'Difference in death figure is possible but...': CentreThe Centre accepted that difference in mortality recorded during a public health crisis and after may differ, but such studies are done after the crisis is over, when data on mortalities are available from reliable sources. "The methodologies for such studies are well established, the data sources are defined as also the valid assumptions for computing mortality," the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-death-in-india-not-under-reported-centre-raises-5-questions-over-international-analysis-101623495901194.html

The GST council also reduced the tax rate on anti-coagulant Heparin from 12% to 5%. The government's decision to reduce taxes on mucormycosis medicine comes after the disease led to loss of lives in several states. Following the outbreak of the disease, several state governments also declared the disease an epidemic last month. The Centre on Saturday also allocated at least 170,000 vials of Amphotericin B to all states and Union Territories in order to effectively treat the disease. The government also said that it has allocated 321,100 vials of Liposomal Amphotericin-B to all the states until June 9. The government last month announced that it has given licence to 5 companies to speed up the production of Liposomal Amphotericin B injections. Mucormycosis cases rose amid the second wave of the Covid-19 crisis in thousands of patients across the country. Mucormycosis damages the eyes, noses, sinuses, lungs, brain and even was found in the intestines of a patient. It can cause blindness, create lesions and also become fatal. The disease, according to experts, affects diabetics and people who are immunocompressed. Experts have also highlighted that the disease affects diabetics and people who have been administered steroids during their recovery phase. Among other announcements made at the GST Council meet, the body decided to retain the 5% tax rate on Covid-19 vaccines and announced relief on ventilator masks, canula and helmet by reducing the tax from 12% to 5%.

Truth does not concern him, propaganda does,” the Congress leader alleged and urged people to question the government over its handling of the crisis.Sonia Gandhi writes to PM Modi on Covid-19 crisis, flags 3 issuesPriyanka also said that PM Modi concentrated on building image when he decided to export vaccines to other countries and did not bother to think about his own countrymen. She also said that the vaccine registration platform is ‘convoluted’ and ‘designed to slow down the vaccination process’ in her statement.“Instead of distributing free vaccines across the world to boost his own image, had he paused for a moment and protected his countrymen first, the people would not be standing in line today grappling with a convoluted registration system designed to slow down the vaccine process,” Priyanka said.Manmohan Singh writes to PM Modi, suggests ways to tackle second wave of Covid-19In her two-page statement, the Congress leader also alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi chose not to listen to the recommendations of the Empowered Group, which was set up by his own government to tackle the pandemic and also ignored the recommendations of the parliamentary committee on health. Priyanka also said that from the beginning of the pandemic the Modi-led government avoided taking responsibility and hid the truth.“As a consequence, when the second wave hit us with unprecedented force, the government lapsed into a state of inaction. This inaction enabled the virus to spread with far greater ferocity and cause untold suffering,” she further added.Manmohan Singh writes to PM Modi on Covid-19: Full text of letterPriyanka Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi along with other senior leaders, including former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, have been very critical of the government’s handling of Covid-19, especially when cases and deaths rose during the second wave. Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi on separate occasions have also written to the Prime Minister providing suggestions and urging him to implement those. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in turn has accused the Congress of politicising the pandemic and using it as a ‘tool’ to malign the image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/behaved-like-a-coward-priyanka-gandhi-harshly-criticises-pm-modi-101623490537866.html

We don't engage in violence,” Tikait told news agency ANI.Tikait alleged that both the police and the government want to instigate farmers and that if cops have been visiting the protest site frequently contact should have been established with the protestors. “They can file an FIR (First Information Report) but there should be something to write in it,” Tikait said.Two Special Branch officers were allegedly assaulted by a group of protesting farmers at Singhu Border on June 10, Delhi Police said on Saturday. After a recent increase in the number of protesters coming from Panipat, Delhi Police officers from the Special Branch were reportedly conducting an on-ground analysis at the Narela border when the alleged incident occurred.The two injured assistant sub-inspectors of the Special Branch were reportedly clicking pictures of the protest site when the alleged attack happened."A woman came to us and questioned what we were doing there. Then others came and surrounded us. They all seemed to be drunk. They attacked us. My colleague sustained a fracture in his hand. Somehow we managed to save ourselves," one of the police personnel told ANI.An FIR has been lodged at the Narela police station against unknown persons, reported ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-don-t-engage-in-violence-rakesh-tikait-defends-protesting-farmers-after-delhi-police-s-complaint-101623489207976.html
12-06-2021||India||On Digvijaya Singh's J&K comment, BJP equates Congress with Pakistan, 'Uneducated', says Singh||The BJP on Saturday leaked an audio clip of senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh conversing with a Pakistani journalist in a Clubhouse chat room where Singh was heard saying that the Congress would have to relook the decision of revoking Article 370 in J&K as the decision was extremely sad. "Really? This is what Pakistan wants," BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya tweeted, sharing the clip."In a Club House chat, Rahul Gandhi’s top aide Digvijaya Singh tells a Pakistani journalist that if Congress comes to power they will reconsider the decision of abrogating Article 370," Malviya wrote.Digvijaya Singh, however, washed his hands off the controversy and said uneducated people might have not understood the difference between 'shall' and 'consider'.The audio leak led to a political furore with the BJP ministers taking to Twitter and accusing the Congress in unison "This is the same Digvijaya Singh, who had termed the Pulwama attack just an accident. He had called the 26/11 attack a conspiracy of RSS and also tried to give clean chit to Pakistan at that time. It is all part of that toolkit. Digvijaya Singh said if Modi ji comes out of power and Congress's government comes, it will re-establish Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir," BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra said.Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said the comment proves that Pakistan and the Congress are on the same pedestal. "Poor governance, low credibility, bleak future & yet dream about freeing Kashmir from India. Birds of the same feather flock together!," the minister tweeted.In a Club House chat, Rahul Gandhi’s top aide Digvijaya Singh tells a Pakistani journalist that if Congress comes to power they will reconsider the decision of abrogating Article 370…Really? यही तो पाकिस्तान चाहता है… pic.twitter.com/x08yDH8JqFUnion minister Jitendra Singh said comments like this would facilitate the further perpetuation of terrorism in J&K. "It's also an indication of desperation prevailing in Congress party to try to seek to come back to power, at whatever cost it might be, even it amounts to usurping or questioning the integrity of Mother India," the minister said.Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri said democracy was only in the hands of the ruling elite and insaniyat died when "instigators of violence sent their own kids abroad and gave stones to children of common folk". "Instead of playing to the gallery across the border Congress must come to terms with abrogation of article 370," the minister tweeted.What is Clubhouse and what did Digvijay Singh say?Clubhouse is an invite-only app where chatrooms are created on various issues and speakers are invited to talk on the virtual platform.As deciphered from the audio clip shared by Malviya, Digvijaya Singh said, "Democracy was not there in Kashmir when they revoked Article 370. Then Insaniyat was not there because they had put everyone behind bars. Kashmiriyat is something that is basically the fundamentals of secularism. Because in a Muslim majority state, there was a Hindu Raja and both were together. In fact, Kashmiri Pundits were given Reservation in Kashmir in government services. So therefore, the decision of revoking Article 370 and reducing the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir is an extremely sad decision. And the Congress Party would certainly have to have a relook into this issue."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/digvijaya-singh-clubhouse-chat-leak-what-former-madhya-pradesh-cm-told-a-pakistani-journalist-101623488938399.html

A big turn in Punjab's politics,” Badal said in a joint press conference.The decision to tie up with the BSP was taken at the SAD's core committee meeting.

12-06-2021||India||Govt seeks equitable allocation of vaccine doses at pvt centres||States should collate the demand for coronavirus vaccine doses in private vaccination centres in their region and either coordinate the procurement of doses themselves or let the Centre do it, the Union health ministry has suggested -- a move aimed at ensuring that the administration of doses by private hospitals and centres is equitable across the country.Currently it is skewed in favour of the large cities, especially metros, with most of the allotment being monopolised by large hospital chains. Officials admitted that doses through this channel have not been allocated equitably since big private hospital chains are seen to have been able to corner the bulk of the quota under this mechanism, and states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, and Assam have lost out since they have fewer private hospitals than others.Now, the Union ministry wants the states to get a sense of the demand and come up with an allotment mechanism – or let the Centre do it.“There are two options available with the states and Union territories: the first one is to aggregate the demand and facilitate procurement from companies; the second is to aggregate the demand and let the government of India facilitate procurement,” said an official aware of the matter on condition of anonymity.Last week, the Union government changed its vaccine policy and said it would once again be in charge of sourcing vaccines and allocating them to the states (the policy before May 1, when it allowed states to procure directly from suppliers). Of the total vaccines available, 75% are to be reserved for this, with the remaining 25% available to te private sector (the 25% for the private sector was also a change introduced starting May 1). The new policy is to start from June 21, until which, the current policy (50% sourced and allocated by the Centre, for 45+ age group; 25% sourced by states, for 18-44 age group; 25% sourced by private hospitals) will continue. As per the Co-WIN dashboard, of the 36,116 sites conducting Covid vaccination, 1,587, or 4% , are in the private sector. The new mechanism does not mean there will be a change in the purchase mechanism – private hospitals will still need to strike direct deals with the vaccine makers. A report in the Times of India on Saturday said the distribution and allocation of Covid vaccines for private hospitals will be divided among states in proportion to their populations. A second official, who asked not to be named, said the communication to this effect sent out by the Union health ministry was in the nature of a recommendation and the final decision rests with the state governments. “The advice is based on the disparity that was seen between bigger cities and private hospitals and tier-2/3 cities and rural areas, and smaller hospitals. Many of the smaller private hospitals that were earlier running vaccination centres stopped conducting the vaccination drive because of a lack of an adequate number of doses. This way states can ensure smaller hospitals also get the required share,” this person added. According to a June 4 Union health ministry statement, in the month of May, a total of 74 million (7.4 crore) doses were available for vaccination. “Out of these, about 18.5 million (1.85 crore) doses were earmarked for procurement by the private hospitals. The private hospitals have been able to procure 12.9 million (1.29 crore) doses in the month , out of which they administered 2.2 million (22 lakh) doses.” On June 10, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan chaired a meeting with the states and Union territories. The progress of vaccination was reviewed at the meeting in light of the revised guidelines for implementation of the national Covid-19 vaccination programme and recent advisories. Less than adequate private sector participation in the Covid-19 vaccination drive was highlighted at the meeting.The limited presence of the private sector and its unequal spread was particularly stark in states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, and Assam.As of Saturday, around 259 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have been distributed among states. About 11 million doses are still left with the states and Union territories to be administered in the coming days. According to the Co-WIN dashboard, as of Saturday evening, close to 249 million doses have been administered across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-issues-advisory-for-equitable-distribution-of-vaccines-to-private-sector-101623480090023.html
12-06-2021||India||Diesel price crosses ₹100-litre mark for first time in country||The price of diesel crossed the ₹100 per litre mark for the first time in the country on Saturday as it is now sold at ₹100.05 a litre in Rajasthan’s Ganganagar after state-run oil companies raised auto fuel rates for the 23rd time in 40 days. The latest hike took auto fuel rates to yet another record across the country as pump prices of petrol jumped by 27 paise per litre and diesel by 23 paise on Saturday. The latest hike has made petrol costlier by ₹5.72 per litre and diesel by ₹6.25 across the country since May 4, a day after the result of five assembly polls was declared. Petrol in Delhi is now sold at ₹96.12 per litre and diesel at ₹86.98 a litre. While fuel rates in Delhi are the benchmark for the entire country, retail prices of the two fuels differ from place to place because of variations in state taxes and local levies. Petrol price is also inching towards ₹100 mark in Bengaluru as the fuel is now sold at ₹99.33 a litre, the second-highest among metros after Mumbai. The financial capital has the highest fuel rates among metros. Petrol is currently sold at ₹102.30 per litre in Mumbai and diesel at ₹94.39 a litre. The unidirectional upward movement Since May 4 saw petrol breaching the ₹100 mark in various cities across the country, particularly in Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. Some of the cities selling petrol for over ₹100 per litre are Mumbai, Ratnagiri, Parbhani, Aurangabad, Jaisalmer, Ganganagar, Banswara, Indore, Bhopal, Gwalior, Guntur and Kakinada, Chikmagalur, Shivamogga. Fuel is costliest in Ganganagar (Rajasthan), where petrol is selling at ₹107.22 per litre on Saturday Surging international oil rates and exorbitant domestic tax structure are two key reasons for high rates of petrol and diesel in pumps. Indian fuel retailers align pump prices of petrol and diesel with their international benchmark rates of the previous day. Benchmark Brent crude, which fell marginally by 0.56% at $71.49 per barrel on the first day of trade this week (Monday), firmed up later this week to close at $72.69 a barrel on Friday, 0.23% up from the previous trading day. Pump prices of fuels are also high because of taxes. In Delhi, central levies account for 34.8% of petrol’s price and state taxes, 23.08%, according to official data of June 1. On diesel, central taxes are over 37.24% while state taxes are about 14.64%. Through 2020, as global crude prices fell, the central government raised excise duty on the fuel to shore up its finances. States too followed suit -- with revenues hit on account of the pandemic. Even as international oil prices saw volatility in the last one month, pump rates of auto fuels in India moved only in the upward direction. For instance, despite Brent crude had plunged to $65.11 on May 20, the lowest in these 34 days; petrol and diesel rates went up the next day by 19 paise per litre and 29 paise a litre respectively. According to executives working in state-run oil marketing companies, pump prices are also high because companies were recovering their past revenue losses like the one suffered for 66 days since February 27 when rates were not raised because of assembly elections in four states and one Union territory. During the 66-day pause on a rate hike, state-run retailers had also reduced petrol and diesel rates by 77 paise and 74 paise a litre, respectively in four small steps. But, the entire gains to the consumers were quickly reversed in the first four consecutive rounds of rate hikes starting from May 4. The government deregulated the pricing of petrol on June 26, 2010, and diesel on October 19, 2014. Accordingly, state-run retailers are free to change pump prices every day. Public sector retailers — IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL)— control almost 90% of the domestic fuel retail market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/diesel-price-crosses-rs-100-litre-mark-for-first-time-in-country-101623476909635.html

At the same time, Moody's has downgraded Cliffton Ltd's senior secured bond rating to B1 from Ba3.The outlook on the ratings is negative.The rating downgrade reflects adverse impact of reduced passenger traffic and airport revenue in the current fiscal year ending March 2022 due to surge in daily infection numbers since late March."We believe the consequent reduction in revenue will lead to additional debt being required to complete the airport's expansion and prolong the recovery in DIAL's financial metrics to a level consistent with a Ba rating," said Spencer Ng, Moody's Vice President and Senior Analyst.DIAL is the concessionaire for the Indira Gandhi International Airport which is located in the political capital of India and operates under an operations, management and development agreement with the Airports Authority of India.Cliffton Ltd is an orphan special-purpose vehicle established to facilitate a USD bond issuance. Proceeds from the transaction were used to subscribed to INR non-convertible debentures issued by DIAL which does not have any equity interest or management control in Cliffton Ltd.Moody's said the negative outlook captures downside risks over the next 12 to 18 months, given material uncertainty in recovery of India's passenger traffic which will be heavily influenced by when travel restrictions are lifted and successful rollout of vaccines as outlined by the government.Passenger traffic at the airport had likely fallen by more than 60 per cent in May from the February level. Given a large majority of DIAL's revenue is linked to airport traffic, Moody's expects revenue to fall in line with the drop in passenger numbers.Whilst pandemic-driven revenue declines are not uncommon among rated airports, DIAL has limited capacity to offset reduced cash flow by cutting dividends or deferring its capital expenditure in a meaningful way under currently announced plans.As such, Moody's expects the airport to need additional debt -- relative to previous forecasts -- in lieu of operating cash flow lost due to second coronavirus wave to complete its ₹9,800 crore expansion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-international-airport-ratings-downgraded-to-b1-by-moodys-101623474500638.html
12-06-2021||India||As Modi and Yogi meet, the story behind BJP’s UP saga||Soon after Yogi Adityanath was sworn in as the chief minister (CM) of Uttar Pradesh (UP) in March 2017, the architect of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s spectacular victory (and now the Union home minister) Amit Shah visited Lucknow. In an informal chat with editors, he quipped, “We had consultations with 44 senior party leaders before deciding on Yogi’s name. Still, the media remained in dark.” Other names were subjects of widespread speculation, but Yogi Adityanath wasn’t considered one of the front runners. And that is why, till the BJP high command makes a categorical announcement on the decisions taken at their meetings regarding the political situation in UP, all contentious issues, right now in public domain, will remain in the realm of uncertainty. However, it can be safely concluded that a range of meetings in recent weeks, in Delhi and Lucknow, have largely revolved around the state assembly polls (to be held early next year) and remedial steps needed to iron out friction in the party, correct caste equations through cabinet expansion and poll alliances, defuse the rising anger against Adityanath in the party’s rank and file, and steps needed to improve the government’s image after what is widely perceived to be the mismanagement of the second wave. Significantly, this is not the first time that a section of party cadres and lawmakers have rebelled against the CM’s style of functioning, sharing their angst with the central leadership. But addressing these voices have become more urgent, as the party high command knows a friction-ridden party can’t swim through choppy electoral waters especially after a clear dent in the state government’s image. Also read: UP CM Yogi Adityanath meets BJP brass amid talk of rejigChintan baithaks spark speculation The uncertainty was triggered by a flurry of meetings held during the devastating second wave of Covid-19. Though “chintan-baithaks”, internal review meetings, are an integral part of the BJP’s culture, and in an election year the deliberations are obvious, the seeming madness in the method. Amid growing complaints of Covid mismanagement by BJP lawmakers and upsets in panchayat polls, Adityanath went on a tour of the state, visiting all the 18 divisional headquarters. He did his last divisional tour on May 30. A day later, on May 31, two senior party leaders — national vice-president and UP-in-charge, Radha Mohan Singh, and national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh — landed in Lucknow. They held three-day long feedback sessions with a dozen odd ministers, members of legislative assembly (MLAs), members of Parliament (MPs) and party functionaries. They also had a dinner meeting with the chief minister and visited the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) office in the city. The meetings ended on June 2, with the leaders tweeting in favour of Yogi. Despite the tweets, the political uncertainty did not subside while Yogi refused to discuss anything in the media. However, what intensified the speculations was Radha Mohan Singh’s sudden visit to Lucknow again on the night of June 5. He met Governor Anandiben Patel on June 6, which was a Sunday. He even met the UP assembly speaker Hriday Narayan Dikshit the same day; the latter said, “they discussed literature”. Generally, Raj Bhawan gives appointments on Sundays only when necessary and the explanation from Singh that “it was a courtesy call” did not convince many. The fallout was obvious. A flurry of political activities raised a range of questions about what was in the offing — from buzz about a change of leadership to murmurs of a cold war between PM and CM over cabinet expansion to disagreements about who should be the primary face for 2022 assembly polls. Interestingly, a party which usually discourages washing dirty linen in public , somehow encouraged it through its actions. Also read: Yogi brings suggestions for BJP’s Mission Uttar PradeshCold war between CM and PM? Party leaders often describe Adityanath as stubborn and short-tempered, but he is also not politically naïve. He fully knows that rarely have CMs survived after taking up cudgels with the prime ministers. He is young and is ambitious, but willing to wait. One reason quoted for the growing differences between PM and CM was the induction of AK Sharma, a Bhumihar from Mau and a former bureaucrat from Gujarat who is understood to be close to the PM, in the UP cabinet. Interestingly, ever since Sharma became a member of the legislative council (MLC) in January 2021, speculations have been rife about his induction in the cabinet as deputy chief minister. The CM’s detractors claim that while he has no issue in inducting a third deputy CM (he already has two deputy CMs), he would be unwilling to part with the crucial home and appointment departments. Political experts feel that the issue is overblown, and it’s too trivial in the larger scheme of things to cause a discord, especially when the PM’s wish — if indeed Sharma’s appointment was a source of discord — would easily prevail.Thus, if there is a thorn in their relationship, the sense in UP’s power corridors is that there has to be a more serious reason than Sharma’s induction. The CM would not like to burn bridges with the all-powerful PM, even if he enjoys support from Hindutva organisations. Rarely have those CMs who defied the party high command survived. Kalyan Singh, the temple hero who grew in RSS, had challenged the late Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpyayee and had to eventually quit the party. He formed Rashtriya Kranti Party, allied with Mulayam Singh Yadav in assembly polls only to rejoin the parent party. Again, his differences grew in the party he quit and campaigned for Mulayam Singh Yadav in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections only to return home. Will Adityanath actually take up cudgels with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and potentially jeopardise his political career? He may be the mascot of Hindutva but not bigger than Modi. While he has been denying his national ambitions from the day he took office, there is also no doubt that he has emerged as a frontline leader in the party. But this was only because the BJP created a national “Yogi brand”, sending him to campaign in every election held since he took charge. Unlike his previous avatar, where Adityanath ran his own organisation, he is aware that there is a larger party organisation with which he has work to realise his ambitions. Change of leadership? While there is speculation about a change in leadership, this appears unlikely at the moment. Before leaving Lucknow, the Delhi-based BJP leaders had tweeted and hailed the CM’s management of Covid in the state. BL Santosh tweet read as, “Remember it’s a state with 20+ Cr population.When municipality CMs could not manage a city of 1.5Cr population, Yogi ji managed quite effectively.” BJP’s national vice-president and UP in-charge Radha Mohan Singh described the UP government’s handling of the Covid situation as “unparalleled” and described speculations about change in leadership as a “figment of someone’s imagination.” All these were followed by the CM’s meetings with Shah, BJP President JP Nadda, and on Friday evening, PM Modi. And so far, the message is, “no change in leadership”. Yogi has thanked all for their ‘ guidance.There are good reasons why status quo may prevail. For one, unlike the Congress, where CMs have been changed at fairly regular intervals in states governed by the party, irrespective of political exigencies such as elections or controversies that directly hurt a CM’s image, the BJP leadership has not experimented with frequent changes in the states. And now with barely a few months left for the party to hit the campaign trail, any change of leadership, leaders believe, will do more damage than good. Second, though Adityanath was earlier associated with the erstwhile Akhil Bhartiya Hindu Vahini, and is not a homegrown Sangh leader, he was groomed in the same ideology by his Guru Mahant Avaidnath, who was closely associated with Vishwa Hindu Parishad. Many in the BJP do flag stories of the time when the CM, as head of the Hindu Vahini, used to dictate terms for an alliance with the BJP and fielded candidates against the party. Interestingly, in 2002 assembly elections, he had fielded Radha Mohan Das Agarwal against the BJP from Gorakhpur and won the seat too. (Agarwal won the 2007, 2012 and 2017 elections on the BJP ticket.) But all of this is now history. Hindu Vahini is by and large lying defunct. Adityanath has thrown his lot almost fully with the Sangh-BJP machine. He is a monk who prays before people wake up, thereafter its politics and politics. Three, the BJP appointed Adityanath as CM, ignoring claims of several senior party leaders, as a part of their long-term vision of generational transition. The overall arching argument is that elections are too close to take the risk of changing leadership, which may upset his supporters. There is a TINA (There is no alternative) factor at play — with the sense that changes at this juncture may ruffle more feathers than ironing them. As said earlier, BJP high command can always spring surprises.Should Adityanath be the face of 2022 polls? Apparently, the BJP high command faces a dilemma on contesting state polls on Modi’s face. Amplifying their concern are the recent reverses in West Bengal where despite the display of their might, the party lost to a two-term CM, Mamata Banerjee, who is the leader of a regional party, the Trinamool Congress (TMC). The anti-incumbency factor did not work against her, nor did the desertions from TMC on the eve of elections. There is, therefore, a view that state elections should not always be held with Modi as the face, for a loss is interpreted as a dip in the popularity of the leader or deterioration of the party’s national strength. The 2017 assembly elections were fought on the basis of Modi’s charisma and appeal, and even the coming together of the Samajwadi Party and the Congress had miserably failed to check the BJP from decimating the Opposition. The BJP and allies independently won 325 assembly seats without projecting any chief ministerial candidate. However, 2022 is going to be different. Can the CM win the state for the BJP? Will he be able to activate the disgruntled party cadres and leaders? Apparently, the party has yet to find an answer to this tricky question – Adityanath or Modi or both. To be sure, the PM will campaign, but the question is the messaging around the state polls and leadership. Is this a plan to distance Centre, channel anger? But none of these theories fully help explain the controversy. Some party insiders claim that through the political churn of the last fortnight, two purposes have been achieved. The first is the party has distanced its tallest leader, PM Modi, from the “Covid mess” that prevailed in the state. Second, much of the public anger has been defused. Right now, UP voters are discussing the central leadership’s unhappiness with the state government more than the floating bodies in the Ganges. The cadre is also more content. They have found an outlet to express their woes, and have been heard. The ministers have been pushed to the wall as their performance too has been questioned. The MLAs, too, have been told to explain their service to their constituency. They would want the ticket again.With the CM’s meeting with the PM on Friday evening, either the recent unrest in the party will come to an end — or it could well mark another chapter in BJP’s UP saga. Either way, as details emerge, what is clear is that the state will remain the primary focus for the party in the coming year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-modi-and-yogi-meet-the-story-behind-bjp-s-up-saga-101623473728948.html

12-06-2021||India||Pilot run of home delivery scheme on hold this month||Amid an ongoing tussle with the Centre, the Delhi government has virtually put on hold its plan to implement a pilot run of the doorstep delivery of ration scheme in the city this month.In an order issued on Thursday, the Delhi food department directed fair price shops to start disbursing ration among beneficiaries for the month of June from Friday, including in Seemapuri where the government was planning to carry out the pilot run of the doorstep delivery scheme.The additional allocation made to each beneficiary under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) will also commence simultaneously, said the government order, a copy of which HT has seen.A Delhi government spokesperson did not respond to requests by the reporter seeking comment.While people are entitled to 4kg wheat, 1kg rice and 1kg sugar under regular ration scheme in the Capital, they will get an additional 5kg food grains under PMGKAY till Diwali, as announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 7.While food grains under PMGKAY are 100% subsidised, the Delhi government had announced free regular ration for the months of May and June.Delhi has 1.78 million ration card holders which translates to 7.2 million beneficiaries.Last Saturday, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal has “rejected” the scheme citing lack of Centre’s approval and a pending case in the Delhi high court.The L-G office, however, said Baijal did not “reject” the scheme and only “advised for the constitutional scheme of things to be followed in letter and spirit”.This was the second time this year that the scheme was stalled due to differences between the Delhi government and the Centre.The scheme was to be launched on March 25, but the Union food and consumers affairs ministry wrote to the Delhi government on March 19 raising two objections to the scheme — the use of the term “mukhyamantri (chief minister)” for a scheme involving the distribution of food grains allocated under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), and that any change in the delivery mechanism in the NFSA requires an amendment that can be done only by the Parliament.On Tuesday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and urged him to approve the scheme in the “national interest”.In his letter, Kejriwal assured the Prime Minister that the Delhi government was ready to make whatever changes the central government will suggest in the long-delayed scheme to deliver ration at the doorsteps of the beneficiaries in the Capital.He said his government only aims to provide ration to the poor and did not want any credit for the implementation of the scheme.The scheme was first approved in March 2018 but could not be implemented because of administrative issues, largely over approved methods to distribute ration under the NFSA.It also led to a tussle between the elected government and lieutenant governor, leading to a demonstration outside the L-G’s office by the top leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pilot-run-of-home-delivery-scheme-on-hold-this-month-101623454232742.html
12-06-2021||India||Indian Mujahideen operative in Tihar jail lied about Antilia bomb scare role ‘to stay relevant’||Jailed Indian Mujahideen (IM) operative, Tehseen Akhtar, lied when he took responsibility for parking an explosives laden car outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house in February -- all because he wanted to remain relevant, a Delhi Police inquiry has revealed.On March 10, central intelligence agencies traced a message on Telegram from a little-known terror group called Jaish-ul-Hind claiming responsibility for parking the Scorpio vehicle with 20 gelatin sticks on a road outside Ambani’s residence, Antilia, in Mumbai on February 25.The message was traced to a phone in Akhtar’s cell in Tihar’s jail, where he is serving a death sentence in the 2013 Hyderabad blasts case. For a month, investigators from Delhi Police’s special cell interrogated Akhtar, who initially said his newly formed terror group parked the car outside Antilia but later admitted that he made the whole thing up.“We submitted a report that the claims are false. Akhtar was interrogated for several hours. Initially, he tried to mislead us by claiming that terror group was real,” said an officer familiar with the details of the inquiry.“There was also no evidence that the terror group exists. Later, he admitted he had made it up. He was just doing it to mislead investigators and show that he is still relevant. This is all mentioned in our report,”added the officer on the condition of anonymity.Police have confirmed in their report that Akhtar, Indian Mujahideen, or his self-claimed new terror group had no role in the Ambani case and have closed the probe, officials aware of the matter said.This is the latest twist in the sensational case that led to a major churn in Mumbai Police, the transfer of the city’s police commissioner and the eventual resignation of the state home minister. Sachin Vaze, a former police officer, was accused in the case and dismissed from Mumbai Police.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested four people, including former Vaze for the Antilia security scare and the murder of Mansukh Hiran, owner of the Scorpio car. Hiran’s body was found on March 5 after it washed up in a creek in Thane.The source of the Telegram message was traced to Tihar’s jail number 8 after which Delhi police was requested to join the probe. Police and jail officers then found two phones - one manufactured by Oppo and another by Vivo -- inside the cell. A team of officials from the intelligence bureau and special cell started probe into the claims.The fear was that absconding and jailed IM leaders had come together to form a new terror group.“Top operatives such as Riyaz Bhatkal, Iqbal Bhatkal, Amir Raza were never arrested. With almost all foot soldiers and key operatives of IM, such as Akhtar and Yasin Bhatkal behind bars, it is possible that the absconding leaders are using Akhtar and his social media skills to add strength to this new group. There is a possibility of Akhtar sending the Telegram message to divert the line of investigation,” an officer investigating the case said on March 16.During the inquiry, police found that an Oppo cell phone, smuggled inside the prison, was used by other prisoners. Akhtar has used the Oppo phone to send the messages.Akhtar was arrested from Naxalbari, Darjeeling in March 2014. Police said at the time that Akhtar alias Monu was the “operational chief” of IM and was heading the group’s operation, after Yasin Bhatkal’s arrest. The 30-year-old was convicted in the 2013 Hyderabad serial blast that killed 18, and charged in 2010 Varanasi blast that killed two, 2011 Mumbai serial blasts that killed 26, and 2013 Patna rally blast that killed five.NIA is currently probing the case and sought an extension of the detention period of the five accused – former Mumbai Police personnel Sachin Vaze, Riyazuddin Kazi, Sunil Mane and Vinayak Shinde, and cricket bookie Naresh Gor. On Wednesday, a special court granted the agency 60 more days to file a charge sheet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-mujahideen-operative-in-tihar-jail-lied-about-antilia-bomb-scare-role-to-stay-relevant-101623449109677.html
12-06-2021||India||Mukul Roy’s move fans talk of turncoats following suit||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) vice-president Mukul Roy’s return to the Trinamool Congress on Friday stoked speculation that several leaders who switched sides ahead of the assembly polls were on their way back to Bengal’s ruling party.Some turncoats such as former assembly deputy speaker Sonali Guha, former legislator Dipendu Biswas and leader Sarala Murmu have openly said that they want to return. Some others, like former forest minister Rajib Banerjee, have criticised BJP.“Just like a fish cannot survive out of water, I cannot survive without Mamata Banerjee. I am severing all ties with the BJP and would join the TMC whenever Didi calls me,” Guha told reporters.But on Friday, Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee made it clear that the party was not going to accept all turncoats.“Those who had betrayed the party ahead of the elections to strengthen the BJP had bitterly attacked the TMC party during campaigns will not be taken back. Mukul never attacked the TMC. There are, however, some leaders who may have gone with Mukul and may want to come back. The party will take a decision on this,” said Banerjee.At least 34 TMC legislators and former lawmakers joined the BJP in the last two years. Around 19 of them were given assembly tickets but only five won.Earlier this week, BJP leader Rajib Banerjee warned that “people will not take kindly to threats of President’s Rule” against an elected government, referring to statements by Adhikari that post-poll violence necessitated imposition of central rule. Rajib also skipped a meeting of the state BJP on post-poll violence. Prabir Ghosal, former MLA of Uttarpara in Hooghly who joined the BJP with Rajib Banerjee, also expressed his “unhappiness”.Senior TMC leaders said several BJP leaders, including sitting legislators, are in touch with the party. “Let us see how many people are coming back,” said Roy.BJP dismissed the speculation. “We don’t know who these people are [who are willing to leave BJP and return to TMC]We are the largest party in the world and there is a democracy in the party. We are not a family-centric party. We have some ideologies which run the party. If someone feels that he is feeling breathless and would be able to serve the people by moving to another party, then BJP respects it,” said Jay Prakash Majumdar, BJP’s vice president in West Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mukul-roy-s-move-fans-talk-of-turncoats-following-suit-101623447104144.html
12-06-2021||India||‘May have spoken to Tendulkar’: Pilot says held no talks with BJP||Former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot on Thursday denied that the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Rita Bahuguna Joshi reached out to him and urged him to join their fold, something the latter claimed on a news channel .Joshi, who joined the BJP in 2016 after quitting the Congress, said Pilot was unhappy in the Congress and that she talked to him about joining the BJP.Bahuguna told a news channel that, “Congress has... lost its ground in north India and their party people are losing faith. I welcome him and for long was asking Jitin ji. I even called Sachin ji and told that people like you should be into positive politics to take the country ahead, support Narendra Modi and BJP.”Dismissing her remark, Pilot said: “Rita Bahuguna Joshi claimed that she spoke to Sachin. She might have spoken to Sachin Tendulkar. She does not have the courage to speak to me.” Joshi could not be reached for a comment.In July last year, Pilot, and his supporters left Jaipur to camp at a secret location in Haryana, threatening the stability of the Ashok Gehlot government. Pilot was removed as the state Congress president (and deputy CM), and it was only when the Gandhis intervened and set up a committee under general secretary Ajay Maken that he returned to the fold. Earlier this month, 43-year-old Pilot told HT that the panel has failed to resolve the issues and said: “It is unfortunate that so many of the party workers who worked and gave their all for getting us the mandate are not being heard.”Pilot’s comments are significant as they come soon after the defection of Uttar Pradesh Congress leader Jitin Prasada to the BJP and after a committee appointed by the Congress leadership to resolve issues in Punjab, where CM Captain Amarinder Singh is up against dissidents in his own party led by Navjot Singh Sidhu, submitted its recommendations on Thursday.Congress legislator Hemaram Choudhary, who resigned from the state assembly last month, met Pilot on Friday amid talks of internal rumblings again brewing in the party’s state unit. All India Congress Committee general secretary Bhanwar Jitendra Singh on Wednesday came out in support of Pilot, and said the promises made to him should be fulfilled.“Whatever talks happened between the [Congress] high command and in-charge general secretary (Priyanka Gandhi Vadra) should be fulfilled. I believe there is nothing wrong if he has raised an issue. If some issue is unresolved, then it can be raised. In Congress, everyone is free to speak,” he said.People familiar with the developments said that Priyanka Gandhi was working to resolve the turmoil brewing in the state unit and Pilot was slated to meet her in Delhi on Sunday. An MLA considered close to Pilot said on condition of anonymity that the former deputy CM is in touch with Priyanka Gandhi, who has asked him to be patient.However, a person associated with Vadra’s office said there was no meeting planned between her and Pilot or Rajasthan unit, adding that the two leaders have been in touch from the beginning.There was no response from the CMO till the time of press.Political analyst Manish Godha said, “The Sachin Pilot faction is well aware that the time is running out – the government in Rajasthan has completed over 2.5 years and now not much time is left. The party is already in fix with the Punjab politics where Navjot Singh Siddhu is in confrontation with CM Captain Amarinder Singh, so this is the right time for Rajasthan dissident faction to get their deal done.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/may-have-spoken-to-tendulkar-pilot-says-held-no-talks-with-bjp-101623446746374.html
12-06-2021||India||Shrewd strategist returns to TMC after rift with BJP||Recognised as a shrewd election strategist, Mukul Roy’s tryst with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lasted only 42 months because of growing differences between him and other leaders, including state party chief Dilip Ghosh, and the relationship worsened after he was named as candidate for the assembly polls, said leaders aware of developments.Roy was a former Union minister and Rajya Sabha member but had never won an election when he was named the BJP’s candidate from Krishnanagar Uttar.“He was a TMC Rajya Sabha member and even served as minister in the Manmohan Singh government but for a person who never won a public election, an unfamiliar seat posed a risk. Yet, he made it although his son could not retain the Bijpur seat in North 24 Parganas district, Roy’s home turf. He felt some people in the party wanted to see him lose,” said a senior BJP state office-bearer.Roy joined BJP on November 3, 2017 in Delhi where Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta and general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya welcomed him. He was not given any significant post but worked hard in the districts and engineered numerous defections from the TMC. He became the BJP’s election strategist in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and helped the party post its best-ever tally of 18 seats. On September 26 last year, Roy was appointed BJP’s national vice-president but differences in the state unit became apparent when Ghosh and others skipped a programme to felicitate him.Roy was not asked to head the party’s election committee for the assembly polls as legislator Suvendu Adhikari, who switched in December 2020, grew in importance.“Rivalry between old BJP leaders and TMC turncoats were visible in the party after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. On the eve of the state polls, we found many former TMC leaders getting divided in camps and owing allegiance to leaders in Delhi. The effect was felt on the ground,” said a second state BJP leader.The rift only widened after BJP slumped to a loss in the election, winning just 77 seats to TMC’s 213. “After he defeated Mamata Banerjee, Adhikari was made leader of the opposition and Roy was asked to nominate his name. This became a bone of contention,” said the leader quoted above.BJP national secretary Anupam Hazra also hinted at factional differences. “Lobbying and projecting one or two leaders while ignoring and insulting capable leaders, has had its effect. Bengal BJP should stop this lobby politics immediately and utilize leaders in accordance to their merit,” Hazra wrote on social media on Friday.Roy’s political life began in the Youth Congress, where he quickly grew close to then opposition leader Banerjee and was one of the founding members of the TMC in January 1998.Banerjee wanted him to be the party’s face in Delhi and coordinate with national and regional parties. He was sent to the Rajya Sabha where he served from 2006 to 2017. In 2006, he was also appointed TMC’s national general secretary that made him the party’s second-in-command.When Banerjee resigned as Union railways minister in 2011 to become Bengal’s chief minister, she picked Roy as her replacement in the Union cabinet for a few months. Before that, he was minister of state for shipping for about two years.But he fell out with the party in 2015 and was removed from all posts amid reports of differences with leaders close to Abhishek Banerjee, Banerjee’s nephew. In 2017, he resigned with his name shrouded in corruption allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shrewd-strategist-returns-to-tmc-after-rift-with-bjp-101623446526822.html
12-06-2021||India||UN arm’s report praises govt over Aspirational Districts programme||A United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report has found India’s Aspirational Districts Programme, the development drive across 112 most backward districts, is a “catalyst for expediting development” that brought about “major changes” in sectors such as health care, nutrition, and education.The first UNDP appraisal of the Aspirational Districts Programme (ADP) also recommended a realignment of sectors and focus, the addition of topics such as environment and gender, and pointed out that disparities among districts does not facilitate fair competition.The report mentioned that, in these districts, the health sector has seen the setting up model anganwadi centres, efforts to increase number of institutional deliveries, reduction in Severe Acute Malnutrition among children, and improving antenatal care, among other measures.In education, the UNDP noted that several districts have adopted innovative methods to suit local requirements. It pointed to an app developed in Jharkhand’s Godda that converts syllabus into smart classes to reach over 70,000 students.The report also praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said, “the commitment shown by the top most political leadership” has “greatly contributed in its success”, underlining regular monitoring of the programme.The appraisal said that while most districts highlighted their efforts focused in health and nutrition, education, and even agriculture and water resources, “the sectors of Skill Development and Financial Inclusion require immediate prioritisation among the Aspirational Districts to reach their full goals”.It also noted that sectors such as infrastructure indicated significant improvements, but still have scope for further improvement, especially in the “more remote districts and those plagued with the double burden of countering LWE activities”.Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said, “We picked up 49 indicators... We rank districts on a real time basis. We are basically hand-holding these districts that account for 21% of the country’s population.”The report, however, highlighted that sectors with lesser weightage need improvement, require alternative solutions to bridge gaps of technical expertise, while the “lack of human resources and technical capacities at the district and block level” remain as a challenge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/un-arm-s-report-praises-govt-over-aspirational-districts-programme-101623445712970.html
12-06-2021||India||SC agrees to end proceedings against two Italian marines||The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to close all proceedings in India against the Italian marines who killed two Indian fishermen off the coast of Kerala in 2012 after being informed that compensation of ₹10 crore for the families of the victims has been deposited in the registry of the top court.“We accept what you are proposing. We will pass our order on Tuesday,” said the bench of justices Indira Banerjee and MR Shah. It added that it was of the view that the compensation money should be transferred to the Kerala high court so that disbursement could be properly monitored.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, accepted the court’s suggestion, so did the counsel for the Kerala government and the Republic of Italy.In April, the Centre informed the Supreme Court that the families of two Indian fishermen killed by Italian marines have been “adequately” compensated as it sought expeditious closure of proceedings before the SC and a criminal trial pending before a special court in Delhi.According to the Centre’s compliance affidavit dated January 5, which HT has reviewed, the Italian government offered to pay a total of ₹10 crore in damages. The families of the two deceased fishermen have agreed to a compensation of ₹4 crore each in addition to the ₹2 crore already paid by the Italian government. The injured owner of the boat also consented to receiving damages of ₹2 crore.Mehta informed the bench headed by then Chief Justice of India SA Bobde that the victims’ families were paid the compensation, as ruled by an international tribunal in May 2020.However, on being informed that the compensation of ₹10 crore was yet to be disbursed to the families of the victims, the top court asked Italy to first deposit the money with the ministry of external affairs, which will subsequently deposit it in the top court for releasing it to the victims.The case pending before the Supreme Court is an appeal filed by the two marines, Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone, against a May 2012 judgment of the Kerala high court, which held that Kerala had jurisdiction to try them. The high court ruled that the marines enjoyed no state immunity since their act of shooting at the fishermen was in defence of neither the vessel nor the state.The marines and the Italian government approached the top court, which shifted the trial to a special court in Delhi in 2013 where it went on till the Supreme Court stayed it in 2015 after taking note of proceedings pending before the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) at The Hague, Netherlands. Meanwhile, the marines were allowed to go back home on an undertaking by the Italian ambassador that they would come back when required.The arbitral proceedings before PCA were instituted under the United Nations Convention on Law of Seas on June 26, 2015, after Italy served a notice on India under the international agreement that defines the rights and responsibilities of nations with regard to their conduct and use of world seas and oceans and management of natural marine resources.In May 2020, the tribunal ruled that the marines enjoyed immunity since they were exercising official functions in their capacity as Italian state officials when the incident occurred. It, therefore, ordered India to stop criminal proceedings against them. At the same time, the tribunal held that Italy violated India’s right to navigation by firing at the fishing boat and said that the country would have to compensate India for loss of life and damage to property.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-agrees-to-end-proceedings-against-two-italian-marines-101623444785906.html
12-06-2021||India||Dalit activist, poet Dr Siddalingaiah dies of Covid-19||Poet and Dalit rights activist who used his poetry to raise awareness about social injustice, Dr Siddalingaiah, succumbed on Friday to Covid-19. He was 67.Known for his humour and hard-hitting poetry, Siddalingaiah, has also been a member of Karnataka’s legislative council twice.“Dr.Siddalingaiah narrated the pain of Dalits through his writings and awakened them. He endured the pain and his poems gave the required blaze to the Dalit movement. His services to the state and Kannada language as Chairman, Kannada Development Authority and as a two-time MLC are commendable,” BS Yediyurappa, the chief minister said on Friday.“In his death, we have lost a great writer with social concern, who strived for the betterment of the under-privileged classes. I pray to Almighty to grant peace to the departed soul and strength to the bereaved family and followers to bear the loss,” the chief minister added.Siddaramaiah, the Congress’ leader of the opposition said that Siddalingaiah had made his poetry a weapon through which to take the fight for social justice forward.His poem, Yarige Banthu, ellige bantu, nalvathayelara swatantrya (who got it, where did it come from, (19)47’s independence), propelled him as one of the leading voices of the movement, converting the song into an anthem which is used even now in protests and other rallies of backward communities.The poet was one of the most prominent voices for social justice and was one of the co-founders of the Dalit Sangharsha Samithi.“Dr. Siddalingaiah will be remembered for his prolific writings, poetry and contributions towards social justice. Saddened by his passing. My thoughts are with his family and many admirers in this hour of sadness. Om Shanti,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a post on Twitter.“The demise of Dr Siddalingaiah has left a huge void in Kannada literature. An eminent poet, social activist and academician, he became a fierce voice for the poor and marginalized and also enriched public discourse through his writings. My condolences to his family & followers,” Ram Nath Kovind, President of India shared on Twitter.The Karnataka government announced that his last rites would be performed with full state honours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dalit-activist-poet-dr-siddalingaiah-dies-of-covid19-101623439168173.html
12-06-2021||India||UP CM Yogi Adityanath meets BJP brass amid talk of rejig||Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday, and later held discussions with Union home minister Amit Shah and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president JP Nadda.Adityanath also met Nadda and President Ram Nath Kovind amid speculation of churning in the party’s state unit ahead of assembly elections early next year. “Met honourable PM Narendra Modi today and received his guidance,” Adityanath tweeted after the meeting.The meetings came on a day BJP vice-president Mukul Roy switched to the Trinamool Congress and speculation arose that a reshuffle of the Union cabinet was on the cards.The Adityanath-led government has been battling dissension and criticism of its Covid management with both opposition leaders and senior BJP lawmakers attacking the administration. The party also performed poorly in recently held village body elections, finishing behind the Samajwadi Party and failing to win in Modi’s home constituency of Varanasi and state capital Lucknow.A top party functionary said the state’s Covid response and development projects were discussed.“There are several development projects such as the Jevar airport and the Purvanchal Expressway that are nearing completion, and the CM wanted to discuss this with the PM. The party’s performance in the recently concluded panchayat elections and the upcoming state elections were also part of the discussions,” said the functionary on condition of anonymity.The developments came a day after Shah met Apna Dal leader Anupriya Patel and Praveen Kumar Nishad of the Nishad Party , both allies of BJP in Uttar Pradesh , triggering speculation that the party leadership wanted to iron out differences. “There is talk of accommodating the allies in the state’s council of ministers. But it all depends on Delhi (the central leadership),” said a second functionary. Apna Dal has nine MLAs while Nishad Party has one.A third leader said that in his meetings with Adityanath on Thursday, Shah suggested that the UP leadership needed to develop consensus and address concerns of factionalism within the state unit.“The party has seen two of its oldest allies, Shiv Sena and the Akali Dal ,walk away so the central leadership has called for better ties with the allies. This message was also relayed to the UP CM,” the third person said.The Sena broke its 35-year-old relationship with BJP in 2019 after disagreement over the Maharashtra chief minister’s position and the Akali Dal walked out of the National Democratic Alliance last year over the three controversial farm bills.In Delhi, Modi’s meeting with Nadda and Shah, which came soon after his meeting with Adityanath, was meant to take stock of the government’s progress and next year’s state elections, said a fourth person aware of developments. HT learns that all union ministers have been asked by the Prime Minister’s Office to prepare presentations on the work accomplished by their ministries in the past two years. They have also been asked to give an account of key schemes that account for the bulk of their budget or schemes that offer direct benefits to the people.“After Corona, there has been an economic slowdown and so many schemes that required more funding have not been able to get the extra allocation. The review exercise will take into account the schemes that require additional funds; and assess which of social schemes can be expanded further or tweaked,” this person added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yogi-meets-bjp-brass-amid-talk-of-rejig-101623439106863.html
12-06-2021||India||Monsoon to cover entire country by June 16, a fortnight ahead of schedule||The South-west monsoon is likely to cover the entire country except south Rajasthan and Kutch region of Gujarat during the next 5-6 days, at least a fortnight ahead of schedule, IMD said in a statement on Friday. Monsoon has advanced into many parts of south Gujarat region, south Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, and most parts of North Bay of Bengal and most parts of West Bengal, on Friday.The northern limit of monsoon (NLM) is passing through Diu, Surat, Nandurbar, Raisen, Damoh, Umaria, Pendra Road, Bolangir, Puri, Canning and Malda.The conditions are favourable for further advance of south-west monsoon into some more parts of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, remaining parts Chhattisgarh and Odisha, entire West Bengal, Jharkhand and Bihar, some parts of east Uttar Pradesh and remaining parts of North Bay of Bengal during next 48 hours.IMD scientists said conditions are also favourable for monsoon onset over some parts of northwest India including Delhi between June 12 and 15 owing to rain and thunderstorms expected in the region. Monsoon normally makes its onset over Delhi around June 27.A low pressure area has developed over northwest Bay of Bengal and adjoining Odisha and Gangetic West Bengal coasts with the associated cyclonic circulation extending upto mid-tropospheric levels. It is likely to become more marked during the next 24 hours and will move west-northwest across Odisha. Under its influence; widespread rainfall activity with isolated to scattered heavy to very heavy falls are very likely over most parts of east India and adjoining Central India from Friday onwards.“Monsoon has been very active this year right from onset. The westerly and southwesterly winds are very strong over Arabian Sea and now a low pressure area over Bay of Bengal is pulling the monsoon flow. Both branches on the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal side are supporting the advancement of monsoon over the country except dry regions of Rajasthan and Kutch,” explained RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.IMD last year announced new monsoon dates based on onset data from 1961 to 2019, and withdrawal data from 1971 to 2019. Until 2019, the onset and withdrawal dates were determined based on records between 1901 and 1940. As per the old monsoon progress dates, the monsoon would cover the entire country only by July 15.Extremely heavy rain (≥ 20 cm) is likely over Odisha on Friday; over Chhattisgarh during the weekend; over East Madhya Pradesh on June 13 and 14; over Vidarbha over the weekend. Due to the strengthening of westerly winds along the west coast in association with the low pressure area; widespread rainfall activity with heavy to very heavy rains are likely to continue over coastal & adjoining ghat districts of Maharashtra and coastal Karnataka during June 11 to 15. Isolated heavy rainfall is likely over Kerala and Konkan till June 15.Due to west-northwest movement of the low-pressure area and its remnant, widespread and heavy rain is very likely over parts of northwest India (excluding Rajasthan) during June 12 to 14. Very heavy rain is also very likely over Uttarakhand on June 12.It is also expected that the onset of monsoon over some parts of northwest India will happen next week between June 12 and 15. “The low-pressure system will move west-northwestwards and there will be easterly winds in the region. We are expecting widespread rains in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Punjab etc because of this. Conditions may be favourable for monsoon onset over this region including Delhi during that period,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.Thunderstorms are likely to be especially severe over West Bengal, Sikkim, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, northwest Indian Himalayas and will be accompanied by frequent cloud to ground lightning and strong gusty winds. This may cause injuries leading to casualties to people and animals working outdoors, IMD has warned.Monsoon’s progress over the entire country has advanced in recent years according to IMD scientists.“We had issued new monsoon onset and withdrawal dates last year because we noticed that monsoon dates had advanced in some regions and delayed in some regions in recent years due to many factors including global climate change. The thresholds have changed now. For example, the new onset dates are delayed by 3 to 7 days in many parts of central, west and east India because we noticed this delay while the complete coverage of monsoon in the country is advanced.“This year is exceptional because monsoon has covered parts of central India very early. Monsoon has covered the entire country by June end in the past also but this year its trajectory is exceptional. Monsoon dates have definitely changed in recent decades, its a very dynamic system. Its movement is strongly influenced by low pressure systems forming over Bay of Bengal. I remember a very long time ago the first monsoon low would form over Bay of Bengal around June 15, but now its forming early as you can see,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences.“Last year also monsoon had covered the entire country by around June 26 so its not rare. The movement of monsoon depends on how early a low pressure system forms. Its active progress will sustain till the low pressure system sustains and then monsoon progress may weaken temporarily. In recent years monsoon onset dates have advanced because of a change in its pattern,” said DS Pai, scientist and head of climate research services at IMD Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-to-cover-entire-country-by-june-16-a-fortnight-ahead-of-schedule-101623439047583.html
12-06-2021||India||Study flags ‘unfortunate location’ of power projects, climate crisis||The severity of the February 7 glacial overflow that triggered a flash flood and swept away two hydroelectric plants in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district can be attributed to the “unfortunate location” of the power projects downstream, the effect of climate crisis, and the topography of the mountain, according to a study authored by 50 scientists.The paper, published in the journal Science on June 10, underscored the risks of rapid expansion of hydropower projects in unstable regions that are already affected by global warming, which leads to the melting of glacial ice — an issue several environmentalists have repeatedly pointed out before and after the February disaster.A glacial breach in the upper reaches of the Himalayas on February 7 and led to a flash flood that swept away the Rishiganga hydel dam project and the National Thermal Power Corporations’s Tapovan Vishnugad project — killing over 200 people, mostly workers at the two sites.Researchers found that the height of the overflow, at 5,500m above sea level, provided ample gravitational energy while the rock and ice ratio resulted in near-complete melting of the ice, making the flow of the debris faster and easier downstream. “The unfortunate location of multiple hydropower plants” in the direct path of the flow of the debris and water was the third reason for the severity of the flash flood, the paper said.“The disaster indicates that the long-term sustainability of planned hydroelectric power projects must account for both current and future social and environmental conditions while mitigating risks to infrastructure, personnel, and downstream communities,” said the study based on research led by the geoscience department of the University of Calgary (Canada).Researchers noted that a majority of the casualties, 190 out of 204, were workers of the two plants who had little to no warning.“This leads us to question what could have happened if a warning system had been installed. We estimate that a suitably designed early warning system might have allowed for 6 to 10 min of warning before the arrival of the debris flow at the Tapovan project...,” the study said, adding that a new flood warning system has since been installed near Raini, where the impact was felt.Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar on March 15 said that the 7 under-construction hydel plants along the Ganga will be allowed to go ahead, but no new project will be given authorisation in the ecologically sensitive region. The Centre’s stand will be communicated to the Supreme Court, which is hearing on the issue, said a senior ministry official, on the condition of anonymity.Reseachers also warned of more such disasters in sensitive areas such as the Himalayas as the impact of global warming is increasingly felt. “The Chamoli event may be seen in the context of a change in geomorphological sensitivity and might therefore be seen as a precursor for an increase in such events as climate warming proceeds,” the paper said.Experts and activists agree. “We also conducted research on the February 7 disaster... It demonstrated very clearly that the barrages of Rishi Ganga and Tapovan hydropower projects acted as force amplifiers for debris...The Ravi Chopra committee have argued again and again that hydropower projects in the paraglacial zone above 2,000 m height obstruct river flow and are dangerous,” said Navin Juyal, a retired geologist at the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad.“...To save investments in a few hydropower projects are we willing to lose more lives and destroy the river? I don’t understand their stand. If another such disaster happens in monsoon, we have had it,” said Mallika Bhanot, member of Ganga Ahvaan, an Uttarakhand-based NGO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chamoli-disaster-study-flags-unfortunate-location-of-power-projects-climate-crisis-101623439048152.html
12-06-2021||India||Makeshift cremation site in Bengaluru closed as Covid toll dips||Bengaluru: The Bengaluru district administration has shut down one of the three the temporary crematoriums in the city on Friday and is planning to shut the other two soon, as the daily number of deaths due to Covid-19 saw a sharp decline, officials said. The city reported on 48 Covid-19 related deaths on Friday, while the death figures on Thursday and Wednesday were 47 and 50 respectively. The weekly Covid case fatality rate (CFR) in Bengaluru peaked during the May 29-June 4 week to touch 7%, the highest seen in 2021 so far. During this period, the city witnessed 25,699 fresh Covid-19 cases and 1,797 deaths. Out of the three temporary, open crematoriums in and around Bengaluru, one has been shut down and a call of the others will be taken soon, officials added. The three open crematoriums in Tavarekere, Anekal and Giddanahalli were opened in early May after the 13 electric crematoriums were unable to handle the number of dead bodies coming in every day. Out of these three, Giddanahalli has been shut down. “During the peak, we were getting around 25-30 dead bodies a day, while our capacity was to cremate eight bodies a day,” recalled Vinod, in charge of the Summanhalli electric crematoriums. At Tavarekere open crematorium, only 5 sheds were available prior to the second wave of Covid-19. However, as the number of deaths increased, 41 sheds were created so that cremations could be conducted. “We saw the highest number of deaths on May 7, when 84 bodies were cremated at Taverakere,” said Nagaveni N, executive officer, Bangalore South Taluk Panchayat, who is in charge of the open crematorium. “On Wednesday and Thursday, we didn’t get a single body. There were two cases today (Thursday). But since last week, the numbers are low,” she added. Meanwhile, the situation was similar Anekal, where no dead bodies were brought on Wednesday. Since two other electric crematoriums Peenya and Banashankari are undergoing repairs, these two Anekal and Tavarekere  have been kept operational, said officials of the district administration. “We will be winding up operations at the other crematoriums as well. While the infrastructure that we have created, like the sheds meant for cremations, will remain. However, the human resource like the contract labourers and the supervisors will be relieved of duties in the due time,” said Bengaluru Urban deputy commissioner, C J Manjunath. Even at the electric crematoriums, the employees are breathing a sigh of relief. Vinod, a supervisor at Summanhalli crematorium said that in the past one week, they received more non-Covid cases. “We are getting around 10-15 dead bodies per day and most of them are non-Covid cases. If you look at today’s (Friday) numbers, there were only four cases,” he said. Raghavendra, an employee at the crematorium said that they were finally able to get some time to sleep. “During the peak of the pandemic, we were working till 2 am. We were cremating so many bodies that the furnace broke down at one point. It took some time before we could get it running. I hadn’t gone home during the peak, now we are getting some time to relax,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/makeshift-cremation-site-in-bengaluru-closed-as-covid-toll-dips-101623437846770.html
12-06-2021||India||61 Sri Lankans arrested in Mangaluru, Madurai||Bengaluru/Chennai: In a joint operation, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu Police on Friday arrested 61 Sri Lankan nationals who were found living illegally in the two states. Eleven others were also arrested for helping the Sri Lankans with their stay.While 38 Sri Lankans were arrested from Mangaluru in Karnataka, 23 were held from Madurai in Tamil Nadu. Besides them, seven and four agents, were arrested from the two places, respectively. According to Karnataka Police, the Sri Lankan nationals had entered India through the sea around March. After staying in Madurai for a while, some of them moved to Bengaluru and then to Mangaluru, they added. Mangaluru city police commissioner N Sashi Kumar said the arrests were made based on a tip-off from Tamil Nadu Police. “We have also arrested seven Indian nationals who were helping these Sri Lankan nationals. All the accused have been booked under relevant sections,” he said. Tamil Nadu police are yet to ascertain the nationality of the agents arrested. As per information available with Karnataka Police, the Sri Lankan nationals had paid ₹10 lakh Sri Lankan rupees (around ₹3 lakh in Indian currency) to an agent based in Sri Lanka to take them to Canada. The group was slated to leave in container vessels, cargo ships or private boats from Tamil Nadu. “They were staying in lodges in Tamil Nadu and after the police checks intensified during the state elections, some of them were shifted to Shantinagar in Bengaluru. Later, they split into smaller groups and arrived in Mangaluru,” Kumar said.“Our Q branch police have secured them and legal processes are going on for their remand,” a senior official in the Karnataka intelligence department said, not wishing to be named. Following the arrests, a case was registered at Mangaluru South Police station under sections 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy) and 370 (buying or disposing off any person as a slave) and 420 (cheating) of Indian Penal Code, section 14 of Foreigners Act, 1964 and section 12 (1) (a) of Passport Act, 1967, Karnataka Police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/61-sri-lankans-arrested-in-mangaluru-madurai-101623437606814.html
12-06-2021||India||Covid risk low in inoculated health staff: Study||Vaccines against coronavirus disease protect against severe disease and death, shows a study by Christian Medical College, Vellore, that found 9.6% of completely vaccinated health care workers contracted the viral infection as against 27.2% of those who were unvaccinated.Of those who did get the infection after completing a 14-day period following both doses of the vaccine, only 0.9% were hospitalised as compared to 4% among those who were unvaccinated. Fewer patients needed oxygen support and admission to the intensive care unit among those vaccinated as compared to the unvaccinated group. Among the completely vaccinated individuals, only 0.06% needed oxygen therapy and 0.03% had to be admitted to the ICU. In comparison, 0.7% of the unvaccinated individuals needed oxygen therapy and 0.5% needed ICU care.“Vaccines are working well! Good against infection (in healthcare=high transmission), great against severe disease. Here is the 1st data from healthcare workers at @OffCMCVellore …. Next step, study protection against variants,” vaccine expert and professor of microbiology at the institute Dr Gagandeep Kang said in a tweet.The incidence of infection among the fully vaccinated health care workers is higher than what has been reported in other hospitals from India and abroad. While Chandigarh’s Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) reported 1.6% infections in fully vaccinated individuals, Delhi’s Indraprastha Apollo hospital reported a figure of 2.62%.According to the CMC study yet to be published in Mayo Proceedings, a study of 23,324 health care workers from the UK showed 3.8% got infected among those vaccinated and 38% among the unvaccinated. Infection occurred in 6.9% of the vaccinated health care workers, according to a study from Jerusalem.However, a study from a Delhi hospital that has been treating only Covid-19 patients for over a year saw an 11% infection rate in vaccinated health care workers. The researchers of the study say that the higher rate of infection was likely a function of exposure to the virus among health care workers and the severe surge of cases with the Alpha and Delta variants in April and May.“We realise that future waves can at best be prevented or at worst mitigated through aggressive and widespread vaccination,” the CMC-Vellore study concluded.The study reported that among people who tested positive during the study’s duration – vaccinated and unvaccinated – the female to male ratio was 3:2 and the median age for infection was 33 years. Most of the infections also happened in April coinciding with the surge in cases of Covid-19 across the country.The study acknowledged a shortage of vaccine doses could have led to many not getting their second shot. “Some health care workers (17%) could not take the second dose, initially due to vaccine shortage and subsequently despite vaccine availability, due to changes in guidelines on the interval between doses,” the study said.“No vaccine is 100% effective, but several studies have shown that the vaccines offer close to 100% protection against severe disease and deaths. To my mind, the report from CMC Vellore is one of the best studies to come out of India so far; it is very systemically done and shows that the need for hospitalisation, ICU care, and oxygen support was also less among those vaccinated,” said Dr GC Khilnani, chairman of PSRI Institute of pulmonary and critical care and former head of the department of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.He added, “What the CMC study also shows is that the number of infections was higher among those who had received just one dose in comparison to those who got both the doses. So, the previous thought that one dose of Covishield can offer sufficient immunity is not true.”A recent pre-print study from the National Institute of Virology shows that the neutralisation titre of Covaxin reduced 2.7 fold with the Delta variant in circulation in Delhi during the April-May surge. Lower antibodies, however, does not mean that a person is not protected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-risk-low-in-inoculated-health-staff-study-101623437548457.html

12-06-2021||India||More cases of illegal tree cutting emerge in Kerala||After reports of rampant tree felling in Kerala’s ecologically fragile Wayanad came to light, many similar incidents surfaced in Idukki and a few other districts on Friday, forest officials said. They added that accused in most cases misused a government order that allowed felling of protected rosewood and teak trees on revenue land allotted to farmers. At least 54 cases, including 42 in Wayanad alone, have registered so far, with more such incidents being reported from Idukki, Thrissur, Kasaragod and Kannur districts. Some of the accused have moved the Karnataka high court for anticipatory bail, an official aware of the developments said. One of the accused, Roji Augustine, on Thursday told a news channel that he paid ₹25 lakh to influence forest officials. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Friday said the government will take up the issue seriously adding that a high-level probe team has been constituted. “It is a serious issue, and we will not spare anyone found guilty. A multi-level team comprising crime branch, vigilance and forest officials has been constituted to probe the incident,” he said. Five cases of tree felling in protected areas were registered in Idukki and three each in Thrissur and Kannur districts on Friday, forest officials said. Meanwhile, divisional forest officer P Dhanesh Kumar, who unearthed the large-scale tree felling incidents in Wayanad, has been transferred to another forest division. When asked about the transfer, Karnataka forest minister A K Saseendran said he was not aware of this. However, senior officials at the forest department said it was a routine transfer. As the issue snowballed into a major controversy, former revenue minister E Chandrasekhar said the order to fell trees in the land allotted to farmers before 1964 was withdrawn after reports of its misuse. “It was a long-pending demand from farmers who were allotted revenue land before 1964. The government did it with good intention, but it was misused by some vested interests, and it (the order) was withdrawn when misuse came to light,” he said. Opposition Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have alleged that revenue and forest ministers of the previous Left Democratic Front (LDF) government were aware of the large-scale felling of trees from protected areas. The issue came to light two weeks ago when a truckload of rosewood used for making high-quality furniture was seized from Ernakulam. The state forest department found the trees were axed by violatingthe October 2020 order that restricted the felling of trees grown on land assigned under the Kerala Land Assignment Act. One of the officials cited above said that smugglers used the order to also cut trees on private and forest land. Trees worth ₹50 crore have been seized so far from different parts of the state, the official added. However, conservationists in Kerala said it was just tip of the iceberg. “We suspect trees worth ₹500 crore were smuggled. Officials and leaders are acting as if they were quite unaware of this. But we suspect it was done with the connivance of all,” said N Badusha, a conservationist from Wayanad.Meanwhile, Union minister of state for External Affairs V Muraleedharan, who hails from Kerala, on Friday visited Muttil in Wayanad, one of the tree-felling sites. He said timber mafia used the order in connivance with officials and politicians to loot forest wealth. “Those who condemned authorities in Brazil for fire in Amazon forests a few months ago were conspiring here to cut large tracts of forest land that will cause irreparable damage to the environment,” the Union minister said, adding that the state government was hand in glove with timber mafia. He also questioned the silence of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, a member of parliament from Wayanad, over the incident. Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar on Thursday sought a report into the incident. Leader of opposition in Kerala legislative assembly VD Satheesan said he will visit Wayanad on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-cases-of-illegal-tree-cutting-emerge-in-kerala-101623437486872.html
12-06-2021||India||Mukul Roy’s decision to quit BJP driven by differences brewing since last year||For 67-year-old Mukul Roy, the tryst with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ended in 42 months mainly because of the differences between different lobbies of state and central apparatchiks, said leaders aware of the development. “Even before the recent assembly polls were announced, many BJP leaders suspected that Roy might leave. Although he contested the polls and won the Krishnanagar North seat in Nadia district, he was staying aloof,” said a senior officer-bearer of the Bengal BJP who did not want to be quoted. “He was a TMC Rajya Sabha member and even served as minister in the Manmohan Singh government but for a person who never won a public election, an unfamiliar seat posed a risk. Yet, he made it although his son could not retain the Bijpur seat in North 24 Parganas district, the home turf of Roy. He felt some people in the party wanted to see him lose,” the leader added. Roy joined the BJP on November 3, 2017, at the party’s headquarters in Delhi where Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya welcomed him in front of the media. “I have full faith that the BJP will gain from Mukul Roy’s experience and grow in Bengal,” Prasad said at that press conference. Roy was not given any significant post and was inducted as a member of the national executive committee. Roy, however, worked hard in the districts and engineered numerous defections from the TMC. He became the BJP’s election strategist in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in which the saffron camp’s seat tally shot up from two to 18 and that of the TMC fell from 34 to 22. On September 26 last year, Roy was made the national vice-president of the party, which everyone saw as a reward for his performance. But differences in the state BJP became apparent at a programme held in Kolkata to felicitate Roy for his elevation in the BJP hierarchy. It was marked by the absence of state president Dilip Ghosh and a host of other leaders. They were all in the districts, holding rallies in support of the new farm laws. Vijayvargiya, who was made election observer for West Bengal and national secretary and co-in-charge of West Bengal Arvind Menon were also felicitated at that programme. Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta addressed the audience among whom the overwhelming presence of leaders and workers who defected from the TMC was noticeable. “I was born in Bengal but now I am working for the BJP central unit. If the BJP leadership wants to entrust me with any responsibility I will carry it out sincerely. Ousting the Mamata Banerjee government should be our only goal,” Roy said during a short speech. This immediately stoked speculations that Roy might be made head of the election committee for the assembly polls which was due in about six months. “That did not happen. Suvendu Adhikari, who joined the BJP in December, last year, was projected as a policy decider. After he defeated Mamata Banerjee in the assembly polls, Adhikari was made leader of the opposition in the state assembly and Roy was asked to nominate his name. This became a bone of contention,” said a state BJP leader who did not want to be quoted. “Rivalry between old BJP leaders and TMC turncoats was visible in the party after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. On the eve of the assembly polls, we found many former TMC leaders getting divided in camps and owing allegiance to leaders in Delhi. The effect was felt on the ground with the TMC winning 213 of the state’s 294 seats against the BJP’s 77,” said the leader. Former TMC Lok Sabha member Anupam Hazra, who was made a national secretary in place of Rahul Sinha, a veteran leader, in September 2020, spoke out on social media on Friday after Roy joined the TMC. “Lobbying in the Bengal unit of the BJP and projecting one or two leaders while ignoring and insulting capable leaders, has had its effect. The Bengal BJP should stop this lobby politics immediately and utilize leaders in accordance to their merit. Hope I will be invited to the coming party meetings according to protocol. I joined the BJP during its bad days and I will remain in the party. I am writing this with an aim to stop the dirty lobbying,” Hazra wrote in his social media post. Reacting to Roy’s exit, Dilip Ghosh said, “I don’t know if it is a loss because his presence did not yield much profit.” As a founder member of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) since its birth in January 1998, Roy was one of the closest aides of Mamata Banerjee. She wanted him to be the party’s face in Delhi and coordinate with national and regional parties. Roy was sent to the Rajya Sabha where he served from 2006 to 2017. In 2006, he was also made national general secretary of the party which made him the second leader in the hierarchy. In 2011, when Mamata Banerjee ousted the Left Front government and resigned as Union railway minister, Roy served as minister of state for railways for a few months. Before that he was minister of state for shipping for about two years. During the assembly polls, Mamata Banerjee added to speculations about her stand on Roy when she drew a comparison between Roy and Adhikari. “Poor Mukul has been fielded from Nadia district although he hails from North 24 Parganas. He is not as bad as Suvendu,” Banerjee said at a rally on March 30. Her public statement convinced many that Roy would eventually return to TMC which he left over differences with leaders close to Abhishek Banerjee. He was suspended for six years for anti-party activities. “With Banerjee now holding the post of national general secretary the old equations no longer exist,” said a TMC leader. Recognised as a shrewd strategist rather than a street leader, and often referred to as Chanakya, Roy managed to engineer defections in the TMC because he knows the strengths and weakness of the party in not only the North 24 Parganas, his home turf, but also several other districts. “Roy knows Bengal like the palm of his hand. The poll results have proved that nobody is indispensable in the TMC. However, Roy’s return may prompt many leaders and grassroots level workers, who switched sides under his influence, to follow his footsteps. Such an exodus will affect the image of BJP’s national leaders who welcomed deserters in such large numbers in 2019,” said colum||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mukul-roy-s-decision-to-quit-bjp-was-driven-by-differences-brewing-since-last-year-101623437428394.html
12-06-2021||India||Reviewing reducing gap between jabs, says govt||India’s vaccination expert group is reviewing the decision to delay the second doses of Covishield, a top government expert said on Friday, as new scientific evidence from other countries suggest a single dose may not be adequately protective against the Delta variant of the coronavirus that has swept across the country.Vaccine efficacy rates plummeted to under 35% in people who had only their first dose when exposed to the variant, data from the UK showed last month, prompting many experts to urge the government to reverse its decision to make a mandatory 12-week gap between doses. The latest among these was by Dr K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India.Also Read | Wide variation in coverage across states marks India’s vaccine drive“His suggestion has been made based on data in the context of mutations in the virus; he has quoted two-three quality studies and suggested the interval should be reduced again to 8 weeks as was practised earlier. Let it be examined by our NTAGI (National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation in India). It is a process. Even United Kingdom must have changed it after reviewing the data by scientific committees and experts,” said Dr VK Paul, member, Niti Aayog.“Earlier they (UK officials) were giving it at 12 weeks and we were giving the second dose at a shorter interval because our experts felt it wasn’t safe to increase the interval. The decisions are made based on scientific evidences,” said Paul.Serum Institute of India (SII) locally manufacturers Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 AZD1222 vaccine under the brand name Covishield. The vaccine was tested using a four week prime-boost regimen but real world data from UK showed it led to a better protection when the second dose was delayed by 8-12 weeks.“We will assign the responsibility to our scientific forum created in the country for the purpose. I am sure they are already addressing the issue, and will examine it keeping in mind the Indian context; the Indian disease pattern and the presence of variants circulating here. They need to take a comprehensive view and they will. We will abide by the decision made by the experts in this regard. Having said that, there is no need to panic, and switch rules overnight; these decisions must be taken carefully,” Paul added.Experts said the four weeks is ideal in a pandemic situation to administer the second dose. “In the middle of the pandemic, postponing the second dose is not logical. For a vaccine like Covishield, 4 weeks gap is ideal, and if there is no hurry then for getting optimal immunity, 12 weeks’ time is good. However, part of the problem was short supply of vaccines which is why the gap was increased in the first place,” said Jacob John, former head, department of virology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.Earlier this week, the centre took a decision on reducing the period for a certain category of people who have to travel abroad either for studies or employment opportunities, and those who are part of the Indian contingent for Tokyo Olympic.“In case of Covishield, we decreased the length of the period based on existing evidence for those who have taken their first dose and need to travel for specified reasons as the modifications will help them complete their vaccine dosage,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry.The vaccination process is picking pace in the country, said Paul, while adding that it was set to improve further in coming weeks with vaccine supplies increasing.“It is obvious that as compared to the previous month, this month there were more vaccine doses available for use, and it will increase further. The process will further streamline under the Centre-state collaboration, especially vaccine procurement and distribution. Our request to people is make effort and take both the doses on time, particularly for health care and front line workers, and beneficiaries above 45 years of age.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reviewing-reducing-gap-between-jabs-says-govt-101623437368679.html
12-06-2021||India||HC seeks Centre, Tamil Nadu replies on proper Covid toll record||The Madras high court said on Friday there are grievances across the country that all Covid deaths may not have been appropriately recorded, seeking responses from the Union and Tamil Nadu governments on the matter.The court said accurate recording is necessary for families to avail themselves of relief from state and central governments offered for Covid deaths and also for the future to help in studies dealing with the pandemic.A bench comprising chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy made the observations on a public interest litigation that sought state officials be directed to implement an effective policy to report the cause of death correctly. That should to be in accordance with the law, ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) guidelines and other relevant parameters, including international standards, to enable people to benefit from government schemes without any hindrance, the plea added.“All over the country, there are grievances that all the deaths that have been caused by the pandemic may not have been appropriately recorded...As far as this state is concerned, there are reports in some quarters that unless a positive test report was issued in respect of the patient, the subsequent death would not be recorded as a Covid death,” the court said, acknowledging that the petition had a raised an important point.This came a day after Tamil Nadu health minister M Subramanian told reporters that Covid-19 patients who test negative at the time of death and die due to other complications such as heart attacks and breathlessness will not be counted under Covid deaths. He was responding to charges by opposition leaders that people were losing financial compensation due to Covid not being listed as the cause of mortality in death certificates. Subramanian said the state is following ICMR guidelines.The court said it is necessary to conduct an appropriate study and, if required, by a specialised team. “It would also be fit and proper to require death certificates already issued to be revised, if necessary; if only not to deny the relief due to the family of the deceased in terms of the several schemes announced by the central and the state governments,” the bench observed.The court said that it wasn’t attempting “to go into the specialised domain of doctors” but “it is elementary that the major ailment suffered by a person” may result in the heart being affected and subsequent death. “However, the cause of death in such a case may not be appropriately attributed to just a heart attack, but the underlying reason for the heart being attacked ought to be regarded as the real cause. So it has to be done in case of deaths triggered off by Covid-19, even if the person suffered from co-morbidities.”The court will address the matter in detail when it comes up on June 28, by when the state has to submit a preliminary response. A copy of the petition has been directed to be sent to additional solicitor general R Sankaranarayanan so that the Union’s response can be obtained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-seeks-centre-tn-replies-on-proper-covid-toll-record-101623437367939.html
12-06-2021||India||States must implement One Nation One Ration Card policy for migrants: SC||The Supreme Court on Friday asked the West Bengal government to implement the One Nation One Ration Card scheme “immediately” to help beneficiaries, especially migrant workers, to avail of subsidised food commodities from anywhere in the country.While the counsel for the state government flagged the issue of seeding ration cards with Aadhaar, the top court was emphatic that “no excuse will be considered” and that West Bengal must make the scheme functional.“In fact, all states must implement this scheme so that migrant workers can benefit,” remarked the bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and MR Shah, which was hearing a suo motu (registered on its own motion) case pertaining to “problems and miseries of migrant workers”.Also Read | State govt informs SC it has launched ‘one nation, one ration card’ schemeThe scheme is currently functional in 32 states and Union territories and allows eligible beneficiaries to get food grain under the National Food Security Act from fair price shops across India without securing a new ration card. Apart from West Bengal, Assam, Chhattisgarh and Delhi are the other states yet to implement it, according to Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was representing the Centre. The Delhi government, however, submitted in court on Friday that it will implement the scheme.Reserving its order on issuing further directives in the case, the bench asked counsel for all state governments to submit a brief note on the implementation of the scheme and other policy measures taken to ensure supply of sufficient dry ration and provision of transportation facilities to migrant workers.During the hearing, the court also asked the Union government whether the Pradhan Mantri Atmanirbhar Scheme could be extended to migrant workers who did not have the ration cards since the other scheme for distributing free grain, the Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan Anna Yojana , which has been extended till November, may not cover those not having ration cards.Senior advocates Dushyant Dave, Colin Gonsalves and Anand Grover, appearing for several applicants in the matter, expressed concern that around 30 million workers in the unorganised sector could be left out for want of ration cards.In response, solicitor general Tushar Mehta and additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, who represented the Union government, emphasised that PM Garib Kalyan Yojana had identified around 800 million people for distribution of free food grain amid the coronavirus crisis.Stating that 8 lakh metric tonnes of food grain has been given to the states, the law officers added that it is now for the respective state governments to frame suitable schemes to make certain the supplies received under the Garib Kalyan Yojana reach all the beneficiaries.The bench, however, told the Union government that it should consider extending Garib Kalyan Yojana temporarily to even those who did not have the ration cards. SG Mehta said that he would need to take instructions regarding this from the competent authority.Meanwhile, the court also expressed its displeasure that the creation of a national portal or database to register unrecognised workers has moved slowly and that the Union government was asking for four more months just to create a module.“This project began in August 2020 and not even a module is ready. What is this? ₹417 crore has been released so far but there is nothing done till date and you are asking for 3-4 months more just to create a module,” the bench asked the S-G.Mehta responded that the National Informatics Centre (NIC) has taken over the project and that he will seek instructions on expediting the process.“This cannot be left to the bureaucracy anymore. Your officers have been doing nothing. Just because your director says they do not have time, this cannot be put on hold forever. Identification and registration are the first steps in ensuring benefits reach migrant workers,” said the court, indicating it will also issue some directions regarding the timeline for the national portal to register such workers.On the last date of hearing on May 24, the bench underlined that registration of unorganised workers should be completed as early as possible and there should be a common national database created with the coordination of the state governments.“We also impress upon the Central government and the state governments to complete the process of registration of organised workers at an early date so that unorganised workers are able to reap the benefit of different schemes of the Centre and the states, which, without proper registration and identity card seems to be difficult to implement on the ground,” it said while asking for the status of the national portal.During that hearing, the court directed that migrant workers be provided with dry ration under any suitable scheme of the Centre or state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-must-implement-one-nation-one-ration-card-policy-for-migrants-sc-101623437306817.html

On June 7, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced free vaccination for all, and also stated that the Union government would take charge of procuring vaccines and allocating them to states. The following day, the government announced a deal it signed a day before to buy 440 million doses from SII and Bharat Biotech, to be delivered between August and December. A 30% advance has been made towards this.After the initial order from PM Cares Fund, the government placed two subsequent orders (one in mid-April and another on April 22) for the supply of a total of 210 million doses of Covishield and 75 million doses of Covaxin according to publicly available information.According to the response provided in the RTI, the next order was to Biological E for 300 million doses.

12-06-2021||India||China passes a new, stricter law against criticism of its forces||China has passed a new law banning defamatory remarks against military personnel as the country tries to weed out comments critical of the armed forces, many of which were made on social media in the context of the India-China border conflict.The new law will add to the arsenal of existing legal measures under a 2018 legislation that says any individuals or groups defaming or slandering martyrs’ names, portraits or reputation will be punished and held criminally responsible.It was under the existing legislation that a popular Chinese blogger was given an eight-month jail sentence for posting comments considered slanderous against the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers who were killed in last year’s clash with the Indian Army at Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh.The new law was passed by China’s rubber stamp Parliament, the National People’s Congress (NPC), on Thursday.“No organisation or individual may in any way slander or derogate the honour of servicemen, nor may they insult or slander the reputation of members of military forces,” the new legislation said, according to a report by the state news agency Xinhua.The Xinhua report said that the new law allows prosecutors to act if the slander seriously affects soldiers’ “performance and missions”. It also banned the desecration of plaques in honour of military personnel.“Prosecutors can file public interest litigation in cases of defamation of military personnel and the infringement on their legitimate rights and interests that have seriously affected their performance of duties and missions and damaged the public interests of society,” the new law states.Song Zhongping, a former PLA instructor and Hong Kong-based military affairs commentator, said the legislation which also covers families of service personnel was meant to bolster the Chinese army’s sense of mission.“Previously, our legal instruments were not complete and this new law will provide more comprehensive protection for the rights and honours of our soldiers,” Song told the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post.Chinese state media listed several cases of perceived defamation – many involving PLA’s deadly clash with the Indian Army in 2020 – that may have hastened the passage of the law that was put up to the NPC in April.In a separate case, a 63-year-old man detained by the “…Beijing police after he was found to have slandered martyr Wang Wei and insulted Wang’s wife in a WeChat group earlier in April. Wang was a Chinese air force pilot who died when his fighter jet collided with a US military reconnaissance aircraft in the South China Sea in 2001,” a state media report said.So far, Beijing has admitted that four of its soldiers died in the fierce hand-to-hand combat between the Indian and the Chinese armies on June 15, 2020, in Galwan Valley along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh. Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in the clash, which was the most serious military conflict between the two sides in over four decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-backdrop-of-lac-face-off-china-passes-a-new-stricter-law-against-criticism-of-its-forces-101623436707990.html
12-06-2021||India||Blow for BJP as Mukul Roy back in TMC fold||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) vice-president Mukul Roy returned to the Trinamool Congress (TMC) after four years on Friday amid indications that more dissidents will follow him, dealing a body blow to BJP in a state it hoped to win two months ago.Considered one of the architects of BJP’s rise in a state where it has traditionally struggled, Roy joined TMC at an event in Kolkata in the presence of chief minister Mamata Banerjee and her nephew and party general secretary Abhishek Banerjee. “Mukul is an old boy of our family. Old is always gold,” said Banerjee as Abhishek draped shawls around Roy and his son, former legislator Subhranshu Roy, who also switched from the BJP to the TMC.“Nobody can stay in BJP. They do not allow anyone to live with dignity and peace. Mukul was pressured and threatened by probe agencies. His health was getting affected. He will have mental peace here,” Banerjee added.Banerjee said more BJP leaders will join TMC but added that those who “betrayed” the party won’t be considered. “Mukul did not say a word against us during the elections. The traitors who left us during the polls and helped the BJP will not be taken back,” she said.During the election campaign, Banerjee repeatedly called her protege-turned-rival Suvendu Adhikari, who joined BJP last year and is now the leader of opposition, a traitor. Adhikari also threw barbs at her, accusing her of communal bias and calling her “Mamata Begum”.Sitting next to her, Roy said he never had any differences with Banerjee. “I am happy that I have been able to come out.I can see old faces here. I am happy that Bengal will regain its old glory under the leadership of Mamata Banerjee, who is a national leader,” he said. BJP leaders said Roy’s absence will not affect them. “We congratulate Roy on his new innings in the old party. The BJP is the world’s largest political party. It is not run by a dynasty. One individual does not make any difference. This was his personal decision. Since he won the Krishnanagar North seat on a BJP ticket we hope he will resign as legislator and start with a clear conscience,” said BJP state vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar. “However, it would be an insult to Roy if someone says he was in the BJP because he was scared by probe agencies. He is not a child,” added Majumdar. A former Union minister and Rajya Sabha member, Roy was one of the TMC’s founding members in 1998, and acted as the party’s second-in-command and top election strategist. But he was removed as party general secretary in 2015. He finally quit in 2017 and joined the BJP, marking the first high-profile exit from TMC. At the time, Roy was named in the 2013 Saradha chit fund scam and the 2016 Narada sting operation corruption case. Roy was credited with helping the BJP rebound from its loss in the 2016 election in which it won just three seats and post impressive performances in the 2018 village body elections and the 2019 Lok Sabha election, when the party registered its best-ever tally of 18 seats. In the 2021 polls, Roy was named the BJP candidate from Krishnanagar Uttar amid speculation of growing differences between him and Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh. He won the seat, his first electoral victory, but the BJP lost the election to the TMC, which secured 213 seats. Subhranshu Roy also lost his constituency of Bijpur. But on Friday, Banerjee and Roy appeared to have buried the hatchet. “I never had differences with Mukul…,” she said. “I never had differences with Mamata Banerjee, I don’t and never will in the future,” quipped Roy. The development comes amid rising tensions between the BJP and the TMC. Last month, soon after the election results were announced, violence broke out with TMC workers targeting BJP supporters and workers. Then, the Central Bureau of Investigation arrested three senior TMC leaders in the 2016 Narada tapes case, sparking furious protests by Banerjee. West Bengal and the Centre also clashed after Banerjee skipped a cyclone review meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the Union government recalling former Bengal chief secretary and the CM refusing to release him and calling the order unconstitutional. Since the election results were announced on May 2, several TMC turncoats have publicly appealed to Banerjee to forgive them.This includes former assembly deputy speaker and Banerjee aide Sonali Guha, and former legislator Dipendu Biswas. Speculation about Roy rose when Abhishek Banerjee called on Roy’s ailing wife Krishna in a Kolkata hospital on June 2. Hours later, Ghosh rushed to the hospital and the next day, Modi called up Roy to inquire about his wife’s health. On June 9, Roy skipped a key meeting called by Ghosh.At Friday’s press conference, Banerjee said she will decide later on what position Roy will hold but added that he will continue working as before. She got agitated at the mention of Adhikari, who defeated Banerjee from the high-profile Nandigram seat, and ended the press conference. “We will take back only those who did not spread bitterness,” she said. Adhikari was in Delhi earlier this week, and met with home minister Amit Shah, BJP President JP Nadda, and the Prime Minister to discuss the post-poll violence in the state although HT learns that the issue of imminent defections from the party also figured in his conversations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/blow-for-bjp-as-mukul-roy-back-in-tmc-fold-101623436707360.html
12-06-2021||India||Mehul Choksi case: India files affidavits in Dominica||The Indian government has filed two affidavits in the Dominica high court establishing Mehul Choksi’s Indian citizenship and the serious nature of the fraud he committed on Punjab National Bank (PNB), people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. HT first reported on May 30 that this would be the line India’s arguments in Dominica would take.The affidavits were filed by Sharda Raut, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) deputy inspector general handling the PNB fraud investigation, and Azad Singh, consular officer at the high commission of India to the Commonwealth of Dominica, on Thursday, a day before Choksi’s bail plea was to be heard in the high court.The people cited in the first instance said Raut and Singh’s affidavits provide detailed evidence against Choksi pertaining to criminal conspiracy, cheating and money laundering and the reasons why he needs to face investigations in India.The affidavits also explain that Choksi’s surrender of Indian citizenship was never approved by the authorities and he was an Indian citizen when the crime was committed.Choksi’s lawyers have sought to examine India’s affidavits.Indian government officials are confident that Choksi will be sent to India as he entered Dominica illegally and is making up stories of abduction, and the involvement of random persons and woman to delay the whole process.In the coming days, Indian officers will argue in the court in Dominica that Choksi’s Antiguan citizenship is disputed after the Antiguan government initiated the process to revoke the same in 2019, and that he should therefore be sent to India.Dominica hasn’t officially commented on Choksi’s deportation to India yet but its actions have shown that the island nation is inclined to send him to New Delhi for face charges.For example, while issuing a statement earlier this week, Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit of the Republic of Dominica referred to Choksi as an Indian citizen.Subsequently, in multiple affidavits filed by it in the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court (ECSC) as well as magistrate’s court in Roseau, Dominica, police has claimed that Choksi is wanted for 11 charges in India and the only document found on him confirmed that he was born in India.Choksi has alleged that he was abducted from Antigua by the Indian and Antiguan police officers along with his female friend, Barbara Jarabik (who was part of the plot according to his version of events) on May 23. He said he was then taken to Dominica in a vessel, in charges denied by Antiguan Prime Minister Gaston Browne.His habeas corpus plea in ECSC, which talks about alleged torture and seeks repatriation back to Antigua, where he is a citizen, has been adjourned sine die. His bail was being heard in the high court at the time of filing of this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/choksi-case-india-files-affidavits-in-dominica-101623436706804.html
12-06-2021||India||Pawar, Kishor meet amid buzz of new tie-up||Mumbai: Political strategist Prashant Kishor on Friday called on Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar at his Mumbai residence and held talks for nearly three hours, fuelling speculations that efforts had already begun to form a national coalition against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the Centre ahead of the 2024 Parliamentary elections.This is Kishor’s first meeting with Pawar after the victory of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the Trinamool Congress in the assembly elections in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, respectively. He had helped craft the election strategy for these parties in the polls. After the results on May 2, the election strategist had said that he was “quitting this space”.According to people familiar with the development, Kishor arrived at ‘Silver Oak’, Pawar’s residence in south Mumbai, at around 11 am and left the venue at around 2 pm along with the NCP chief’s daughter and Baramati MP Supriya Sule. State NCP chief Jayant Patil also visited Pawar’s residence for some time during this period. The possibility of an alternative to the ruling BJP at the Centre was among the topics of discussion during the meeting, the people cited above said. “Pawar saheb has been working to bring all opposition parties together against the BJP. It is natural that the issue would be discussed,” a senior NCP leader said, preferring anonymity. The meeting with the poll strategist came a day after Pawar said that the Maha Vikas Aghadi -- comprising mainly NCP, Shiv Sena and Congress -- will not only complete its five-year term in Maharashtra but also perform well in the 2019 assembly and Lok Sabha elections. “There was a lot of buzz going around soon after the chief minister’s (Uddhav Thackeray) one-on-one meeting with the Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) in Delhi. As I said, we have never worked with the Shiv Sena in the past but Maharashtra has been watching the party for the past many years. Shiv Sena is a party that can be trusted. Even if people are raising doubts over the meeting, I have no doubt that the MVA government will not only complete its tenure of five years but also perform well in the Lok Sabha and state assembly elections and represent the state and the country,” Pawar had told a small gathering of workers at the NCP headquarters on the occasion of the party’s 22nd foundation day on Thursday.During the 2019 polls, Kishor was the political advisor to Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray before the 2019 assembly elections.Senior NCP minister Chhagan Bhujbal said Pawar will definitely consider roping in Kishor if the latter comes up with any strong poll ideas. “He (Prashant Kishor) is a successful election strategist and has helped various parties win the polls. I don’t know the exact reason behind the meeting but if he comes up with a suggestion, the NCP chief will certainly consider it,” Bhujbal said. Deputy chief minister and the NCP chief’s nephew Ajit Pawar, however, downplayed the issue. “Prashant Kishor has already declared quitting the profession as a poll strategist based on his experiences. So, a political discussion is out of the question. People from various walks of life come to meet Pawar saheb,” he told reporters in Pune.“Several leaders wanted to know about Kishor’s strategies, considering the success he has got in different elections. There is nothing wrong in such a meeting,” Shiv Sena MP and spokesperson Sanjay Raut said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pawar-kishor-meet-amid-buzz-of-new-tieup-101623436647407.html
12-06-2021||India||Pak assembly passes bill to give right of appeal to Jadhav||New Delhi: Pakistan’s Parliament has passed a bill that will help Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav appeal against the death sentence given to him by a military court amid protests by the opposition, which accused the government of violating parliamentary principles.The legislation to facilitate appeals by foreign nationals convicted by a Pakistani military court was among 21 bills passed by the National Assembly or lower house of Parliament on Thursday. The opposition boycotted the session and contended the government had bulldozed the legislation through the House.The International Court of Justice (Review and Re-consideration) Bill of 2020 is on the same lines as an ordinance that was issued by the Pakistan government last year to facilitate Jadhav’s right to appeal against the death sentence given to him by a military court for alleged involvement in espionage and subversive activities.Jadhav was arrested in March 2016 in Balochistan on charges of spying and sentenced to death the following year. India has rejected the charges levelled against the formal navy officer and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business. The ICJ stayed Jadhav’s execution in 2018.The bills were passed after the Speaker of the National Assembly suspended the rules of business, which was challenged by the opposition. However, the opposition was defeated in a vote 112-101.According to reports in the Pakistani media, opposition members shouted slogans such as “Modi ka jo yaar hai ghaddar hai” (Modi’s friend is a traitor) and “Kulbhushan ko phansi do” (Hang Kulbhushan), and PML-N MP Ahsan Iqbal said the government had passed the bill to provide relief to an “Indian spy”. Foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi defended the decision to pass the bills by saying that they could be delayed once the budget session began on Friday. He also said that opposition MPs who were against the bill to provide relief to Jadhav were “speaking the language of India”.“India wants Pakistan not to abide by the decision of the ICJ and the opposition also wants this,” he said. Law minister Farogh Naseem added the ICJ had asked Pakistan to enact legislation to provide the right of appeal to Jadhav. If the bill wasn’t passed, India could initiate contempt proceedings against Pakistan in the ICJ, Naseem said.Pakistan People’s Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said the bill was meant to give safe passage to an “Indian spy”. He said, “You were advocating the case of Kashmiris and now that of Kulbhushan?”The bills will have to be passed by the opposition-dominated Senate or upper house before the president gives his assent to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-assembly-passes-bill-to-give-right-of-appeal-to-jadhav-101623436526716.html
12-06-2021||India||Roy’s move fans talk of turncoats following suit||Kolkata: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) vice-president Mukul Roy’s return to the Trinamool Congress on Friday stoked speculation that several leaders who switched sides ahead of the assembly polls were on their way back to Bengal’s ruling party.Some turncoats such as former assembly deputy speaker Sonali Guha, former legislator Dipendu Biswas and leader Sarala Murmu have openly said that they want to return. Some others, like former forest minister Rajib Banerjee, have criticised BJP.“Just like a fish cannot survive out of water, I cannot survive without Mamata Banerjee. I am severing all ties with the BJP and would join the TMC whenever Didi calls me,” Guha told reporters. But on Friday, Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee made it clear that the party was not going to accept all turncoats.“Those who had betrayed the party ahead of the elections to strengthen the BJP had bitterly attacked the TMC party during campaigns will not be taken back. Mukul never attacked the TMC. There are, however, some leaders who may have gone with Mukul and may want to come back. The party will take a decision on this,” said Banerjee. At least 34 TMC legislators and former lawmakers joined the BJP in the last two years. Around 19 of them were given assembly tickets but only five won. Earlier this week, BJP leader Rajib Banerjee warned that “people will not take kindly to threats of President’s Rule” against an elected government, referring to statements by Adhikari that post-poll violence necessitated imposition of central rule. Rajib also skipped a meeting of the state BJP on post-poll violence. Prabir Ghosal, former MLA of Uttarpara in Hooghly who joined the BJP with Rajib Banerjee, also expressed his “unhappiness”.Senior TMC leaders said several BJP leaders, including sitting legislators, are in touch with the party. “Let us see how many people are coming back,” said Roy. BJP dismissed the speculation. “We don’t know who these people are [who are willing to leave BJP and return to TMC]We are the largest party in the world and there is a democracy in the party. We are not a family-centric party. We have some ideologies which run the party. If someone feels that he is feeling breathless and would be able to serve the people by moving to another party, then BJP respects it,” said Jay Prakash Majumdar, BJP’s vice president in West Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/roys-move-fans-talk-of-turncoats-following-suit-101623436466681.html
12-06-2021||India||Grant protection to interfaith couple: Allahabad HC to police||The Allahabad high court has directed the Moradabad police to give protection, when it is sought, to an interfaith couple who alleged that private respondents were interfering with their marital life and liberty. The court said the petitioner (woman) having converted to Islam would not be a relevant factor while ensuring that there is no interference in the liberty of the petitioners unless there is any allegation by the woman regarding forcible conversion.Justice Salil Kumar Rai passed the order on June 8 while hearing a petition filed by Yashi Devi, aged about 20 years and Guchhan Khan (second petitioner), aged about 40 years. They got married on January 11, 2021 after Yashi Devi converted to Islam. The matter pertains to Moradabad district of Uttar Pradesh.The petitioners requested the court to issue necessary directions to the respondents not to interfere with their marital life and liberty.It was claimed that the petitioners were majors (adults) and had solemnised the marriage of their own free will. Referring to the Supreme Court judgment in the case of Lata Singh vs State of UP, the high court observed that the law is settled that it is the right of couples to live peacefully without any interference in case they are majors.The court said that in view of the clear enunciation of law by the Supreme Court in the Lata Singh matter, “It is obligatory for the concerned authorities to ensure compliance of the above directions in view of Article 141 of the Constitution of India, which clearly provided that the law declared by the Supreme Court shall be binding on all courts within the territory of India.”The court directed that in case the petitioners face any genuine threat to their life and liberty or they are harassed contrary to the law laid down by the apex court, it shall be open for them to approach the senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Moradabad and furnish the necessary details in that regard such as proof of their majority, marriage and the harassment being faced. The SSP shall take all steps as may be required by law to ensure that the petitioners’ life and liberty are not interfered with, keeping in view the directions issued in the Lata Singh case, the high court said.“It is also clarified that the petitioners, if major, are entitled to live together even if not married and, therefore, proof of their marriage would not be required and shall not be insisted upon by the concerned police officer,” the court added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/grant-protection-to-interfaith-couple-allahabad-hc-to-police-101623436406670.html
12-06-2021||India||Ration distribution: Delhi-Centre feud intensifies after war of words||The political fight over Delhi’s proposed doorstep ration delivery scheme showed no signs of abating on Friday as Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the plan was a false promise and a scam at the behest of the “ration mafia”, drawing a sharp response from chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who accused the Centre of obstructing a public welfare initiative.Prasad said the Delhi government plan was nothing but a “jumla” (gimmick), and if it was serious about benefiting citizens, it should institute a separate ration scheme and delivery mechanism.“The Indian government purchases the ration, the Indian government pays for it, the Indian government is required by law (National Food Security Act, 2013) to distribute it. If you (AAP government) are so enthusiastic, then formulate your own separate scheme and come to us. We promise to review it with an open mind,” the minister said at a press conference.Kejriwal said the Union government should work cohesively with state governments for overall progress of the country instead of fighting with them, while his deputy Manish Sisodia mocked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ruling at the Centre as “Bharatiya Jhagda Party”.“Today people want to see such a leadership at the Centre which, instead of abusing and fighting the state governments all day, takes everyone along. The country will progress when 130 crore people, all the state governments and the Centre work together as Team India. So being rude is not good,” Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi.Earlier, in March, Kejriwal said the scheme would not bear the CM’s name, amid accusations by central functionaries that he was trying to appropriate credit.The National Food Security Act, 2013, mandates the Union government to provide 5kg of subsidised grains every month for each of nearly 800 million eligible beneficiaries. The grains are distributed through a network of fair-price shops across the country, known as the public distribution system (PDS).The Delhi government has floated a proposal to make home delivery of ration for the state’s beneficiaries. Officially spelling out its stand, the food ministry said last week that while it had no objections on the Delhi goverment’s proposal, it was against dismantling of the current system of distribution of cheap grains through PDS. The Centre said the Delhi government should launch a separate scheme for home delivery.Prasad said on Friday that the chief minister “is talking about home delivery of ration when he even failed to provide oxygen to the people of Delhi.The Delhi government is under the control of the ration mafia.” He said Delhi adopted the e-authentication method for ration cards in January 2018 but put an end to it within four months. The e-authentication method is a national programme to digitally record subsidised food distribution.The minister alleged that it was halted because the ration mafia pressured the government, as more than 400,000 fake ration cards were seized. He asked when the state government would resume the process of e-authentication.Sisodia said the Union minister was making excuses for the obstructionist approach adopted by the Centre against states not ruled by the BJP.“They blame Delhi for oxygen shortage. But who messed up on oxygen supply? The BJP-led government at the Centre. It was only after the Supreme Court intervened, they ensured adequate supply of oxygen. Millions of children kept pleading for the board exams to be cancelled but BJP leaders kept them confused until the Supreme Court intervened,” the deputy chief minister said.“ For vaccines, they were adamant in forcing states to approach manufacturers and continued to criticise Delhi, West Bengal, Maharashtra and other non-BJP states… Whether it comes to oxygen, board examinations, ration, vaccines, there is a common factor in all of these and it is the central government’s failure. If an IIT graduate chief minister (Kejriwal) thinks that when pizza and electronics can be delivered at people’s doorstep then why not ration, what is wrong with that?”Prasad hit out at the Delhi government for not adopting the one nation, one ration card scheme even as 34 states/UTs had done so. The programme enables beneficiaries to withdraw ration anywhere in the country, regardless of the state where their ration card is registered.He alleged that the Delhi government had no data on Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe beneficiaries in the national capital. Prasad’s comments came days after Kejriwal alleged that the Narendra Modi-led Centre was deliberately stalling its proposal to ensure home delivery of subsidised food.“Just two days before the doorstep delivery of ration scheme’s implementation in Delhi, the central government stopped it. They say we didn’t take approval. We took approval not just once, but five times,” Kejriwal had said. “Legally, we don’t need the Centre’s approval but we did so out of courtesy.”The Delhi government was set to launch the scheme in early June, planning to cover 7.2 million beneficiaries. Each beneficiary was entitled to 4kg packaged flour and 1kg rice at their doorstep.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ration-distribution-delhi-centre-feud-intensifies-after-war-of-words-101623434007166.html
