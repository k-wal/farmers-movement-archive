According to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) data, 120,188 births were registered in 2020, which is the lowest since 2015 and a dip of 23% when compared to 2019.According to data shared by the BMC, institutional deliveries dropped by almost 23% in 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The number of childbirths registered with BMC hit the five-year low since 2015 with 120,188 births in 2020. In 2019, 148,898 births were reported, while in 2018, 151,187 were recorded. In 2017, 155,386 births were recorded, 152,952 in 2016 and 174,902 in 2015.However, contrary to popular belief that institutional births went down in 2020, probably due to Covid-19 as people are preferring home deliveries. But the data states otherwise as even home births have hit the five-year low in the city. In 2020, 256 home births were reported in the city, 353 in 2019, 415 in 2018, 528 in 2017, 704 in 2016 and 1,465 in 2015.According to experts, the births going down due to Covid will even have more impact in 2021. Besides, the impact of 2020 on those living in Mumbai is expected to be felt in 2021, they opine. Dr Nikhil Datar, a city-based gynaecologist said, “A woman gives birth after around nine months of pregnancy. To understand, how Covid affected women’s decision-making about pregnancy and childbirth we will have to wait for 2021 and 2022’s data. In 2020, the birth rate in Mumbai has gone down due to migration. Due to the loss of a job or the convenience of working from home, many families went to their hometowns. This might have contributed to lesser births in the city, but I do not see any direct relation between Covid and birth rate going down in 2020 at least.”Dr Datar added, “Also, I have always thought that at least in Mumbai we might not see a trend wherein home births will increase due to Covid-19. The data also has proved it there is no infrastructure available for having home births in Mumbai like how it is done in rural areas.”Another Dr Ashok Anand, gynaecologist from Sir JJ Hospital said, “When it comes to 2020, there was fear among many for delivery in hospital due to Covid. We also saw many preferring private hospitals over government-run hospitals in 2020 for deliveries considering many government hospitals were turned into covid centres. However, another reason for births going down could also be migration to hometowns due to work from home and lockdown or even many going out of Mumbai for deliveries considering other cities were not impacted much during the first wave.”The data further reveals that stillbirths which means death or loss of a baby before or during delivery increased in 2020 compared to 2019. According to data, 1,131 stillbirths were registered in the city in 2020, 904 in 2019, 1,396 in 2018, 1,684 in 2017, 1,818 in 2016 and 2,225 in 2015.In terms of overall deaths, the city reported the five-year highest death toll in 2020 amid the outbreak of covid-19. As per the data, 112,603 deaths were reported in 2020, 91,223 in 2019, 88,852 in 2018, 89,037 in 2017, 86,642 in 2016, 94,706 in 2015.Meanwhile, though overall deaths went high, the death toll of infants and neonatal went down significantly in the city during 2020. Between 2015 and 2019, every year between 3,400 to 4,500 deaths of infants were reported, however, in 2020, the number came down to 2,649. Further, neonatal deaths between 2015 and 2019 were between 2,100 to 2,700, however, in 2020, the number came down to 1,858.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-birth-rate-down-23-in-2020-compared-to-2019-bmc-data-101623781086573.html
15-06-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC seeks state, FRA reply to PIL on school fee hikes||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday sought a response from the state government and the Fee Regulatory Authority (FRA) to the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Atul Bhatkhalkar seeking directions to the school education department to constitute the divisional fee regulatory committees, to decide on the fee structure for the new academic year.The PIL has also sought orders restraining schools from hiking fees for the new academic year and to collect fees at a deducted rate in lieu of schools and colleges functioning virtually and not incurring overhead costs which are included by the FRA while fixing fees. The division bench of justice Sunil Deshmukh and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the PIL, was informed by senior advocate Dr Birendra Saraf that he was prompted to file the PIL after he received numerous complaints from parents in the western suburbs complaining of schools debarring their children from attending classes, as they had not paid fees. Dr Saraf further submitted that the complaints were pertaining to aided and non-aided schools and the grievances from parents of regular students as well as students who had secured admission under the Right to Education Act. The petition states that the schools after getting interim relief last year from the HC on the implementation of the May 8 government resolution had forced parents who were affected by the pandemic and faced financial difficulties to shell out the hiked fees. The government resolution (GR) had restrained schools from hiking fees for the academic year 2020-21.The HC had, however, stayed the implementation of the GR but asked schools to allow parents to pay the fees in instalments and not debar students from attending school virtually or withhold their progress reports for non-payment of fees. The petition states that the schools had failed to comply with the latter order and had not only debarred students but also withheld the progress reports. Dr Saraf further stated that the schools had not formed the executive committee for deciding on fee structure and hence as per the Maharashtra Fee Regulation Act, sought formation of the Divisional Fee Regulation Committee and also reduction of fees to 50% for students admitted to unaided schools under RTE Act. The PIL also prayed for a reduction in fees in lieu of virtual classes among other orders. The additional government pleader for the state submitted that under the powers conferred upon the state government by the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Fee Regulation) Act, 2011 a Divisional Fee Regulatory Committee was already constituted and sought time to file an affidavit setting on record the information concerning the functioning and address of the authority which the court allowed and posted hearing of the PIL to June 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-seeks-state-fra-reply-to-pil-on-school-fee-hikes-101623781026527.html
15-06-2021||Mumbai||Every Covid death is reported: Mumbai civic body chief||Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Tuesday clarified the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is following all protocols laid down by the government bodies, including Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), and is not underreporting single death due to Covid-19. HT had on Tuesday reported how in Mumbai, 11,125 people died of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in 2020. However, along with this, the number of non-Covid-19 deaths also increased significantly in 2020, which raises doubts whether Mumbai is underreporting deaths due to the viral infection. “We are diligently reporting each death to the ICMR and the increase in non-Covid deaths in the city does not mean that those who die because of Covid are labelled as non-Covid deaths,” he said. “I will be the last person to underreport Covid deaths in the city. Ever since the outbreak of Covid, the BMC has updated and shared all data transparently and there is no question of underreporting. In fact, there are few patients who are from outside the city and come to Mumbai for treatment, but sometimes they die here. The death certificate issuing authority is BMC in this case and we are reporting their data also in Mumbai’s toll.” In 2019, the city reported 91,223 deaths, which went up to 112,603 in 2020 (a 23% increase), the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) data revealed. If we subtract Covid-19 deaths from 2020’s overall toll of 112,603, the city saw 101,478 non-Covid deaths in 2020, a significant spike from 2019 (91,223 deaths) and 2018 (88,858 deaths). This means that there was a 2% spike in non-Covid deaths from 2018 to 2019, and an 11.24% leap from 2019 to 2020. Also, in the first three months of 2021, between January and March, overall, 23,114 deaths have been reported in the city. Of this, only 579 were recorded as Covid deaths, so there were 22,535 non-Covid deaths. Chahal added, “For example, we had a politician flying down to Mumbai from Jalgaon for treatment. He was Covid positive patient of Jalgaon, but unfortunately, he died in Mumbai. We issued a death certificate for him and have also added that number in our death count. Also, we need to understand that not all patients who die of Covid are deaths due to Covid.” He said there are patients who are being treated for cancer and are in the last stage during their treatment. During their admission for treatment, they test positive but later they die due to preexisting medical complications. So, for those having underlying disease, the death is not necessarily termed as a Covid death. These types of deaths also find a mention in the list of ICMR. The ICMR itself mandates data in this format. Chahal added, “If the Central government stops taking such data, we will stop uploading data in that format. But we are just following what is required by government authorities. We also have several cases where patients are admitted in hospitals for months due to terminal diseases. At times, such patients get infected and catch Covid and they later die due to their existing medical complications.” Meanwhile, as of Tuesday, the city reported 15,216 deaths and the mortality rate is 2.12%. The city reported 572 cases on Tuesday and 14 deaths. The city’s recovery rate is 95.11% and there 17,519 active cases in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/every-covid-death-is-reported-mumbai-civic-body-chief-101623781027130.html
15-06-2021||Mumbai||Pune tops in daily active cases, Mumbai second||The state on Tuesday recorded 9,350 new Covid-19 cases with 388 deaths. However, Pune continued to clock the highest number of active cases, as well as the fatality rate in Maharashtra.Maharashtra has a total number of 1,38,361 active Covid-19 cases, of which, Pune is leading with 17,623 cases, followed by Mumbai with 17,519.Similarly, in terms of fatality, of the total 1,14,154 deaths, Pune leads with 15,593, followed by Mumbai with 15,216.Till now, Mumbai was leading in the number of deaths, however, this changed on June 13 when Pune recorded 15,187 deaths, while Mumbai recorded 15,183. From the last two days, Pune continued to outdo Mumbai in the number of deaths.Since the outbreak of Covid-19 cases last year, Pune has recorded 17% of the total cases in Maharashtra with a caseload of 10,37,780, of the total 59,24,773 in the state.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, who is the advisor for the government of Maharashtra on Covid-19 management, and a resident of Pune, said, “Even before Mumbai, Pune had travellers coming from the Middle East and China, who were infected with Covid-19 virus. They infected the locals and it subsequently spread to the semi-urban and rural pockets.”Salunke attributed the high mortality rates to those citizens coming from the peripheral areas. “Many of the citizens living in peripheral areas which lacked proper hospitals thronged to Pune for treatment in the second wave. However since many were late in admitting themselves, they succumbed to the virus resulting in high death rates,” said Salunkhe.Dr H K Sale, Executive Director, Noble Hospital situated in Hadapsar said the second wave was aggravated due to twin factors of the overwhelming number of patients and lack of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour of the citizens. “The second wave mutant of the virus was lethal resulting in large number of people getting infected, No one was prepared to handle such a huge load and the whole medical infrastructure was overburdened. Other factor was that the citizens became negligent and let their guard down,” rued Dr Sale.There were 202,638 tests done on Tuesday while the number of recoveries was 15,176.Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Mumbai clocked 572 new Covid-19 cases and 14 deaths. The total number of cases in Mumbai reached 716,351 with 15,216 deaths. Mumbai has been getting less than 1,000 new Covid-19 cases from May 31 onwards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pune-tops-in-daily-active-cases-mumbai-second-101623780966507.html
15-06-2021||Mumbai||Students going abroad can get second vax dose in 28 days: Mumbai civic body||After the Central government gave its approval, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Tuesday announced bringing down the minimum gap for a second dose of Covishield from the existing 84 days to 28 days for students going abroad, those travelling for work and those participating in Tokyo Olympics.This follows a week after the Central government had asked all the state governments to bring down the interval gap for Covishield’s second dose to 28 days. For this, the Central government had given three categories which included students who have to take foreign travel for educational purposes, persons who have to take up jobs in foreign countries followed by athletes, sportspersons and accompanying staff of Indian contingent attending International Olympics games in Tokyo, Japan.The BMC, is since over 15 days, is vaccinating students who have secured admission to foreign universities, for free. However, with the revised direction, free vaccination will also be done for persons going for jobs in foreign countries and those travelling to Tokyo for the Olympics.The civic body in a circular issued by municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal has stated that free vaccination for the above-mentioned categories will be conducted three days a week on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday on a walk-in basis. The BMC has designated seven civic-run hospitals in the city to undertake the above vaccination drive. This includes Dahisar jumbo centre, Kasturba, KEM, SevenHills, Cooper, Shatabdi, and Rajawadi hospitals.In the circular, the BMC has made it mandatory for the above three categories to carry valid documents with them to prove their eligibility for vaccination. For students travelling for educational purposes, admission confirmation letter of the foreign university, visa form issued by the foreign university followed by persons travelling to a foreign destination for work, a letter from the employer is mandatory. In the case of those travelling for the Tokyo Olympics, a letter from the concerned sports department will be sufficient, according to BMC.The above arrangement of giving Covishield doses in 28 days gap for the above categories will be an arrangement valid till August 31, 2021, for now, according to BMC.Meanwhile, until Tuesday, the BMC has vaccinated over 3,100 students who are heading to foreign countries for educational purposes. On Tuesday, 75,867 citizens were vaccinated followed by since January 16, 2021, 4,187,747 citizens have been vaccinated in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/students-going-abroad-can-get-second-vax-dose-in-28-days-mumbai-civic-body-101623780906555.html
15-06-2021||Delhi||AAP claims only 20% drains cleaned by MCDs, BJP holds PWD responsible||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP)-led municpal corporations of Delhi (MCDs) have failed in cleaning drains even as the monsoon is set to hit the city in a few days. Senior AAP leader and the party’s municipal affairs in-charge Durgesh Pathak said every year, there is waterlogging in Delhi during the monsoon and this year, too, the municipal corporations could clean only “20% of drains” so far. “The monsoon may arrive anytime in Delhi but the MCDs have cleaned only 20% of drains. If there is waterlogging in Delhi this year as well, and if anyone dies, then the Delhi BJP will be responsible. I demand that the Delhi BJP clean all drains on war footing…It is unfortunate that the BJP ruled MCDs do not clean drains ahead of the monsoon and that is why the national capital faces massive waterlogging every year,” Pathak said in a statement. Pathak added, “Delhi is the national capital where the President of India, the Prime Minister of India, judges, and representatives of other countries live. Such an important city faces waterlogging only on account of the poor governance of the BJP-ruled MCDs.” Responding to Pathak’s remarks, North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash said it is the Delhi government that has not cleaned its big drains. He said MCDs are responsible only for minor drains located in colonies and along internal roads, while all major drains are managed by the Delhi government’s public works department and other agencies.“We have cleaned over 80% drains in our jurisdiction and removed 9,580 metric tonnes of silt. But drains under the PWD, Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation, the Delhi Jal Board and the irrigation and flood control departments are yet to be cleaned fully. At many locations, workers have removed silt from drains but left it on the roadside. Instead of blaming us, the AAP should ask its government to clean drains on priority,” Prakash said. Similarly, East Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Nirmal Jain also accused the PWD of not cleaning its drains. “They (PWD) have not cleaned drains and at several places, workers have left silt on the road itself. I have written to the PWD to get the silt removed so that waterlogging does not occur this monsoon,” Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-claims-only-20-drains-cleaned-by-mcds-bjp-holds-pwd-responsible-101623780787180.html
15-06-2021||Noida||Noida: 337 spots identified for CCTV installation for women safety||Noida: The Gautam Budh Nagar police have identified 337 locations across the district where high resolution CCTV cameras will be installed under the state government’s safe city project with a focus on women’s safety, officials said on Tuesday.The spots that have been identified for CCTV camera installation include Sector 18 market, Harola market, Sector 15 metro station, Shani temple Sector 14A, Sector 75 market, Sector 37 crossing, Haldawni and Kulesra markets, Shahberi, Cherry County, Alpha commercial belt, and Charmurti crossing. The district has been allotted ₹132 crore for the project which aims at making GB Nagar safer for the public, the officials said. “The zonal deputy commissioners of police and the women cell have identified 337 areas in Noida, Central Noida and Greater Noida where the CCTV cameras will be installed,” said Vrinda Shukla, deputy commissioner of police (women safety).Shukla said that the spots cover a wide range of areas like markets, metro stations, places of worship, and educational institutions, among others. “With a focus on the safety of women, the areas have been identified after extensive public feedback, inputs from previous police initiatives and the information shared by the women police teams working in the field,” she said.The officials said that the deadline of the project has not been fixed yet and the spot identification was the first step.“We will start working on installing the new equipment as soon as possible. In addition to CCTV cameras, technical surveillance is also being ramped up. We will work with respective departments in the district to start work on the project,” said Pushpanjali, additional commissioner of police (headquarters).Pushpanjali further said that SUVs with female cops will also be rolled out soon. “We will also set up women police booths in public areas which will act as help desks. Construction of pink toilets and a women’s shelter home is also in the pipeline,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-337-spots-identified-for-cctv-installation-for-women-safety-101623780727306.html
15-06-2021||Noida||E-surveillance project in Noida: Detailed survey of traffic intersections begins||NOIDA: The Noida authority on Tuesday said that it has started conducting a detailed survey of traffic intersections in the city where high-tech cameras and speed detection devices will be installed under the intelligent traffic management system (ITMS) project. The survey will be completed within a week and the authority will begin the installation of cameras and other necessary infrastructure from June 21, said officials. “The detailed survey will help in better installation of infrastructure to put the city under electronic surveillance. The authority aims to make the project functional by January 2022,” said SC Mishra, senior project engineer of the Noida authority. The installation work was supposed to start in May but it got delayed due to the Covid 19 pandemic, said the officials. The authority will spend ₹64.49 crore on the project. In February this year, it had selected a private firm to install and maintain this project that is likely to benefit thousands of commuters who have to face traffic congestions during peak hours.Under the ITMS project, initially 84 traffic intersections will be put under e-surveillance monitored from a control room to be set up in Sector 94. The authority will install 40 adaptive traffic control units, 18 speed detection devices, 22 variable message signboards and 693 automatic numberplate reader cameras, among other equipment.“We reviewed the project with the Noida authority last week and made some suggestions to make sure that the project works effectively. We suggested that a detailed survey should be carried out before installation of the cameras and other equipment, because each traffic intersection has its own challenges in view of managing traffic. Once the new system becomes functional, it will certainly improve traffic management and contain street crimes too,” said Ganesh Prasad Saha, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Gautam Budh Nagar. Police officials said that with the help of these automatic cameras, it will be easier to identify traffic violators. In May 2016, the UP government had asked administrations in 12 cities, including Noida, to improve the traffic congestion in order to reduce pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/esurveillance-project-in-noida-detailed-survey-of-traffic-intersections-begins-101623780606480.html
15-06-2021||Noida||Two more arrested for attack on Muslim man in Ghaziabad; not a communal episode, say cops||The Ghaziabad police on Wednesday arrested two more suspects in the case of a 72-year-old Muslim man being beaten up and his beard forcibly cut on the afternoon of June 5, after a video, purportedly of the incident, went viral on social media two days ago. Officers leading the investigation said the suspects were known to the victim Sufi Abdul Samad, who hails from Anupshahr in Bulandshahr district. They also said the incident was one of “personal dispute” and not communal as at least one of the arrested men is a Muslim. Police identified the arrested men as Kallu (single name) and Mohammad Adil. On Tuesday, they had arrested Pravesh Gurjar, the prime suspect. While Gurjar and Kallu are Hindus, Adil is a Muslim, police said.Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural), said Samad, who made a living by selling “taveez (amulets for good luck)”, was beaten up over the amulets that he had sold the suspects, which apparently had not brought the wearers any “good luck”.“Investigations have revealed that the suspects knew Samad as he often came to Loni and handed ‘taveez’ to people, promising it would bring them good luck. He also offered a ‘taveez’ to some of the suspects in this case, but those did not bring them any luck. So, they were angry with him and called him to Loni on June 5. Samad arrived in Loni and reached the house of prime suspect Pravesh Gurjar, which he later claimed was ‘an unidentified location’,” said Raja. Police also said Samad was not made to chant “Jai Siya Ram”, as alleged by him during a Facebook Live session with a Loni politician on June 7. They further said Samad had made no mention of this or his beard being chopped in his complaint to the police the same day.In his complaint, Samad said on June 5, he arrived in Loni, Ghaziabad, and boarded a shared auto which had a few male passengers, apart from the driver. He alleged that he was forcibly taken to an isolated place where he was confined and badly thrashed by about 7-8 men, who also chopped his beard using a pair of scissors. A video later surfaced of the incident, in which the suspects were purportedly seen beating up Samad and chopping his beard, but no religious chant or conversation was audible in the video. Raja said their investigation had revealed no communal angle to the incident and that the present case was one of “personal dispute”. “We arrested two more suspects, Kallu and Mohammad Adil, who were present in the house where the victim was thrashed. In the video, the suspects and the victim were talking about the ‘taveez’ but they overwrote the conversation with some song. We have some more suspects whose names have come to light and they will be arrested soon,” the SP said. But Samad’s family refuted the police version. Samad’s son Babbu (single name) said, “My father went to Loni to visit a friend whose wife had died a couple of months ago. There, the suspects gave way to the incident. Since we are poor, the police can say anything. But everything is clearly seen in the video -- how my father was beaten up and his beard chopped off. We took help from the local politician in Loni as when we reached the police station with a complaint on June 6, the personnel there were not very cooperative.” “We have our own small-time businesses, and my father is not into things like ‘taveez’. He is nursing his injuries and is upset by what has happened with him,” he added. Police, meanwhile, said they will add Section 295a (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings) of the Indian Penal Code to the case registered at the Loni Border police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/two-more-arrested-for-attack-on-muslim-man-in-ghaziabad-not-a-communal-episode-say-cops-101623780487078.html
15-06-2021||Noida||GB Nagar medical staff gets hands-on training for paediatric care||Around 150 medical professionals are being trained in paediatric care in Gautam Budh Nagar in anticipation of a possible third wave of Covid-19 infection that could affect children.They are the first batch of around 500 professionals who will be trained. Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) and Sharda Hospital are giving hands-on training to these professional using mannequins and dummy equipment.Dr Ambrish Gupta, nodal officer appointed by the Directorate of Medical Education and Training Uttar Pradesh (DGMEUP), is overseeing the trainings. “Five-day modules have been created for the batches of 50-60 professionals which is conducted in an auditorium in Sharda Hospital. Since the venue has a seating capacity of 300, we are able to follow social distancing and Covid protocols as well as train staff,” said Dr Gupta. While Sharda Hospital is in its third week of training, GIMS started the same on June 14. While Sharda Hospital is open to medical students and healthcare workers from all over the district, GIMS is currently training only for its own staff.On Monday, GIMS also started its first workshop in Basic Skills for medical students and non-pediatric staff. The hospital has created a skill lab, similar to one at Sharda Hospital, which is equipped with baby dummies for training.“Participants are provided with practical training on interactive mannequins to check their techniques. The trainees are taught how to intubate the babies, insert IVs and use resuscitation protocols on them,” said Dr (Brig) Rakesh Gupta, Director, GIMS.Dr Ranjeet Ghuliani, Additional Medical Superintendent and Professor of Pediatrics at Sharda Hospital, who is one of the experts on the training committee said, “The physiology of a child is very different from that of an adult and hence intensive training is required to treat such cases. In fact, training is being given for post-Covid complications like Multisystem Inflammation Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) as well. Last two weeks we have training around 110 nurses of which around 30 nurses were from GIMS as well. This week we will start training medical interns in batches of 50 each and so on”.Experts have earlier said that there was no evidence to the claim that the children would be severely affected in case of a third wave although they may have a greater infection share as they had not been vaccinated yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-medical-staff-gets-hands-on-training-for-paediatric-care-101623780307718.html

But at the moment it is only upto four km. Apart from that the low pressure area from Bay of Bengal has weakened and with it the push for south-west monsoon has weekend as well,” said Mahesh Palawat, Vice President, meteorology and climate change, Skymet.With rain, the daytime temperature soared by three notches in the past 24 hours.According to IMD, Noida’s maximum temperature was 39.1°C and minimum was 27.4°C on Tuesday. As per the Central pollution control board’s (CPCB) air quality index (AQI), Noida’s air was under the “satisfactory” categroy. The air quality for Greater Noida was 164 and for Gaziabad was 141 both satisfactory.“Rainfall and aerosol washout are expected to improve AQI. AQI is likely to stay in the Moderate to Satisfactory category for tomorrow and likely improve further to the Satisfactory category for 17th and 18th June,” said A statement from the System for Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/monsoon-likely-to-delay-by-four-days-mercury-simmers-in-noida-101623780246479.html

The woman started working in a factory in Greater Noida and became self-dependent lately, police said.The woman filed a complaint on May 21 this year, alleging that a person named Pawan Dankad had been posting her photos and mobile number on Facebook. “I started getting random calls and messages from different people. They informed me that the photos and contact number were shared by Pawan Dankad on social media,” she said. A case was initially registered against Dankad under Section 63 of IT Act, police said.The SHO said that the cyber cell investigated the matter and found that Pawan Dankad was a fake ID. “This Facebook account’s IP address was traced to her husband Raghav,” he said.Police have also seized the suspect’s mobile phone. The suspect told police that he posted objectionable photos of his wife on social media as he was not happy with his married life.“My husband used to drink heavily and would not give me sufficient money to meet the expenses. This would lead to frequent quarrels between us. However, I had never thought that he would be posting such things using a fake ID,” the woman said.The suspect was produced in court and sent to judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-security-guard-arrested-for-posting-wife-s-objectionable-photos-101623780189127.html
15-06-2021||Noida||Malls, restaurants to reopen with 50% capacity from June 21 in Noida, Ghaziabad||The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday decided to relax night curfew timings and allowed malls and restaurants to partially open from June 21.The new curfew timings will be from 9 pm to 7 am. Earlier, it was between 7pm to 7am. Markets will still be required to shut on weekends for sanitisation.“The chief minister, during a review meeting, directed that restaurants and malls can also open up with 50% capacity with Covid help desks to screen visitors,” said Navneet Sehgal, UP’s additional chief secretary (information). He added that the decision was taken in wake of declining in Covid-19 cases. The partial Corona curfew was imposed from the night of April 30. Restrictions were relaxed for districts having fewer than 600 active Covid-19 cases from June 7. Markets and restaurants in Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar welcomed the move but said more easing was required. “The two-hour extension will give a chance to shoppers to come out after wrapping up their work for the day. The evening hours usually see an increase in customer footfall. We hope that the market efficiency will increase up to 40-50% with this decision,” said Sushil Kumar Jain, president of sector 18 market association, Noida. “The weekend is the time when people move out for purchases. It would be better to shift the ‘weekend closure’ to other day,” said Pradeep Gupta, convener of Vyapari Ekta Samiti – Indirapuram in Ghaziabad. “The closing time of 9pm does not attract many customers. We have to shut by 8pm at least so that we can clean the premises,” said Vikas Singh, owner of a food-chain restaurant in Noida Extension. “Since many small restaurants face financial issues, the government should come out with some support system.” Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of the Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad) said it was time to allow economic activity. “The number of Covid cases has come down considerably since they peaked from mid of April and the trend continued till mid of May. On the other hand, the economic activity should also open up, but all precautions must be observed. It should not be the case that people disregard the Covid protocols once more relaxations come into picture,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/malls-restaurants-to-reopen-with-50-capacity-from-june-21-in-noida-ghaziabad-101623780186490.html

This roughly works out to about 23.78% of total vaccinations, .district immunisation officer Dr Neeraj Tyagi said, adding that vaccinations in this age group has slowed down since the start of June.“As slots for vaccinations on Co-WIN portal open on Sundays at 10am, at least 40% of slots for the 45+ age group go vacant while the 18-45 slots are filled up within hours. Moreover, even for the 45+ age group slots that are booked, almost 20% don’t turn up for the shot,” said Dr Tyagi.He further said, “The trend is being seen in urban as well as rural centres and there is no distinction between the two demographies.” On Tuesday evening, over 20 Covid vaccination centres on the Co-WIN portal showed open slots for the 45+ age group for June 15-17. These included private as well as government centres.District magistrate Suhas LY said while the health department volunteers are carrying out awareness drives in urban as well as rural areas, efforts need to be made by citizens as well.“The district administration is aware of the vaccination hesitancy among the 45+ age group and the health department is trying to address this by motivating and encouraging people to get the jab and also by holding free vaccination camps. Efforts also need to be made by society at large to educate the misinformed and help create awareness regarding vaccination” said Suhas.Dr NK Sharma, president of IMA, Noida chapter, said there are still some rumours and misinformation about vaccinations doing the rounds in the district.“Since April this year (when vaccination of 45+ age group was started), doctors in Gautam Budh Nagar have been getting all sorts of queries from this age group regarding vaccination. They wanted to know whether the vaccines were safe or check the veracity of rumours or misinformation. It has been seen that there is a lot of fear among the people aged above 45 years. As doctors, we make it a point to inform and educate people and create awareness among them to get vaccinated,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/45-age-group-showing-vaccine-hesitancy-says-gb-nagar-health-dept-101623780006462.html

As a result, the district is left with a stock of over 3,000 doses of the injection which will expire in January 2022, said officials of the district health department. According to official records, the district received 6,255 doses of remdesivir from April 1 to May 31. As many as 2,839 doses were given to various government facilities, while 394 were provided to different private hospitals. “In all, we provided 3,792 doses to different government and private facilities, and some batches comprising 556 doses were returned due to adverse drug reaction events. Now, we have a stock of 3,019 doses of remdesivir, but there is hardly any taker. The last batch of 200 doses was provided to Santosh Medical College on May 25 and thereafter no hospital has asked for the drug,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad. “However, we have decided not to return the stock,” he added. During mid of April when patients faced difficulties in getting remdesivir and some cases of black marketing also emerged, the district administration had identified six distributors who were tasked to provide the drug to hospitals and other Covid centres. Experts said that the health department should keep the stock for future use. “The present stock of remdesivir may come handy, in case the thrid wave of the pandemic arrives. Remdesivir has yielded encouraging results in combination with other drugs in Covid treatment,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter). “The requirement of remdesivir has now considerably reduced as the number of cases has also declined significantly,” he added.On June 8, the Ghaziabad administration had formed nine different teams for better management of Covid-related activities. One of the teams headed by additional district magistrate (finance) is tasked to ensure ambulance services and availability of life-saving drugs like remdesivir and tocilizumab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/no-takers-for-remdesivir-since-may-25-ghaziabad-left-with-3-000-doses-101623779946533.html
15-06-2021||Noida||GB Nagar may follow Bikaner model of door-to-door vaccination||The Gautam Budh Nagar health department is analysing the “Bikaner model” of door-to-door vaccination underway in Rajasthan. Under the model, people who are 45 and older can register for the vaccine against Covid-19 on a helpline launched by the Rajasthan government, Live Hindustan reported. A vaccine van will reach people’s homes only when a minimum of 10 people have registered from the same address. The van will then move to another address, but a medical team will stay back to keep an eye on the people who have been vaccinated for adverse events. The drive began on Monday. Earlier, the drive had been kicked off in Jodhpur and Pali districts.GB Nagar district magistrate, Suhas LY, said, “The Bikaner model of vaccination is very similar to our chief minister’s vision of inoculating the people residing in rural areas through the common service centres (CSCs). It can be very handy in the remote areas as well as in the high-rises. Adequate number of ambulances and mobile teams will be ready to carry the vaccine vials to the doorsteps. The district administration will release a helpline with a WhatsApp number for people to register for the shots with their names and address,” he said. The DM also said that if the Bikaner model will be adapted, once at least 10 people register, the vaccine van will leave for the desired destination. “The requirement of a minimum of 10 registrations before the mobile van rolls out will minimise the wastage as one vial of vaccine can be used to give the jab to 10 people. While the vaccine van will go from one address to the next after administering the shot, a medical team in back-up will stay with the vaccinated persons for observation,” he said. District chief medical officer Dr Deepak Ohri said that 447,162 people under the 18-45 age group had been vaccinated till Tuesday, which is nearly 50% of the total vaccination. “The participation of women in the vaccination drive is also as per our expectations, which is nearly 46% of the total vaccination. Even the number of adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) in the district is less than 0.002%, which is much better than national AEFI of 0.011% and state’s 0.006%. In terms of number of vaccination, GB Nagar district stands second after Lucknow’s figures of 1,157,910,” he said. The official sources said that GB Nagar has a population of around 2.1 million, of which nearly 1.6 million over the age of 18 years are eligible for vaccination. As per the Co-WIN portal, 904,057 doses had been administered in the district till Tuesday. While 793,187 have taken their first dose, as many as 110,870 have been given both the shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-may-follow-bikaner-model-of-door-to-door-vaccination-101623779886510.html

They were taken to the Gaimukh area in neighbouring Thane during the day for the purpose of investigation, an official said. A special court here has remanded Santosh Shelar and Anand Jadhav, the two accused, in the NIA's custody till June 21, he added. While the NIA officer said that both Shelar and Jadhav were arrested from Malad area of Mumbai on June 11, a senior police official in central Maharashtra's Latur district said they were nabbed from Latur MIDC area on June 10. "On the face of it, both were involved in the conspiracy to plant the SUV with explosives near Ambani's south Mumbai residence," the NIA official said. The Central agency also suspects that they played a role in the murder of Hiran, a Thane-based businessman who had claimed that the SUV found near Ambani's residence `Antilia' on February 25 had been stolen from his possession, the official said. Hiran was found dead in a creek in Thane on March 5. Shelar is involved in a Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) building project in Malad and allegedly has connections with a well-known former `encounter specialist' police officer, sources said. When produced before the court, one of the accused shouted the name of this retired police officer, the sources added. Assistant inspector of Mumbai police Sachin Waze, now dismissed from service, is the prime accused in the case and has been arrested. A total of four policemen -- three officers and a constable -- and a cricket bookie were arrested in the case earlier. The two cases, earlier being probed by Maharashtra Police, were later taken over by the NIA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ambani-bomb-scare-case-police-arrest-two-more-persons-101623778379557.html

A new course at the UG level has been designed in PRSU. Under this, admission to the graduate level will be through an integrated course which will enable the student to continue studying till the PG level. These courses have been approved by the Board of Studies (BoS) of the state university recently and will now be placed before the academic council (AC) and the executive council (EC) for final approval. Once approved, this will be introduced in the new academic session (2021-22), university officials said.Also, if the student wishes, he or she will be able to leave studies in the middle and re-join at a later stage to complete the studies. Akhilesh Kumar Singh, vice-chancellor, Rajju Bhaiya State University, said, “Following the instructions of the government, the common minimum syllabus prepared by the university under the NEP-2020, is only for the graduation level at present. In this, UG courses have been made semester-based and follow the concept of multiple ‘entry and exit’ system in the larger interest of the students,” he said.The students of the state university will also have the freedom of pursuing a Master’s programme with research in four years under this. The UG curriculum under the new integrated course has been divided into six semesters. A student completing the first two semesters and wishing to leave would earn a certificate, while if a student wishes to leave after completing four semesters, he/she will be able to do so with a diploma, while students completing six semesters will be awarded a bachelor’s degree.On completion of four years, a ‘Bachelor with Research’ (Master with Research) degree will be awarded to the student while on completion of five years, one will get a Master’s degree, the V-C explained. Efforts have been made to make traditional courses also employable. Additional programmes have also been added in traditional subjects like geography, sociology, history and economics.Under the NEP, credit and grading have been fixed for every semester.

However, the silent morcha will take place in Kolhapur on Wednesday.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, on Tuesday, said, “We appealed to the morcha organisers to cancel it, but they are going ahead. Their preparations are almost done and it is not possible to cancel. We have offered Yuvraj Sambhajiraje a discussion with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. In democracy, everyone has a right to agitate.”Pawar added, “The Supreme Court had scrapped the reservation for Marathas. We requested the central government to make necessary amendments. There are some demands with the state government. We will definitely sort it out, whatever is within the limits of the state government.”Yuvraj Sambhajiraje, who is in Kolhapur, said, “Maratha Kranti morchas are always silent. We will ensure that it will be peaceful and follow the norms. We have invited all the MLAs and MPs from Kolhapur district to attend. Elected members will speak at the morcha and clear their stand.”Kolhapur district guardian minister Satej Patil said, “The Maha Vikas Agadhi (MVA) government is firm on getting reservations for the Maratha caste. I will remain present for the Maratha Kranti Morcha and support the demands made by Yuvraj Sambhajiraje.”As Kolhapur district has the highest positivity rate in western Maharashtra, the administration is worried. This is the first morcha after the Supreme Court’s decision. NCP leader and deputy CM Ajit Pawar said the BJP is restless after losing the power in Maharashtra. “They believed that the MVA government would lose power in a year. As the government is stable, now they are trying to instigate various groups and asking them to carry out morchas. As an opposition party, it’s right that they should agitate, but they should also understand that the MVA government is stable as long as Congress leader Sonia Gandhi, NCP leader Sharad Pawar and Shiv Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray stand firm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maratha-kranti-morcha-to-take-place-in-kolhapur-despite-ajit-pawar-s-request-to-cancel-over-covid-worries-101623778146417.html

The stratified random sampling for the survey, which will include children in the 6-17 age group for the first time, has to be modified further, they said.Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, Haryana health department, said, “The survey has been postponed for a few days, and is likely to start within this week. It was delayed due to the addition of new parameters in the sampling strategy.”Data collection of the sero survey has to be done on a mobile application, which will also be modified with new changes.A serological survey is done to detect the body’s immune response to the coronavirus infection. Out of the total 8,800 participants, over 3,520 children of six to 17 years will be covered in this serological survey, which will be held across Haryana on June 15 and 16. Of these, 5,280 people will be adults, 2,640 children of 10-17 years, and 880 children of six to nine years.This comes as children are not being covered under the ongoing vaccination programme. The survey results will help in analaysing the trend for the possible third wave of Covid-19, with children likely to be the most affected.Out of the 400 samples in Gurugram, at least 160 children between six and 17 years will be covered in 20 clusters. Their blood samples will be collected to check for IgG antibodies. It will also provide information on the proportion of the population having Covid-19 antibodies even if they did not have symptoms or diagnosis with the disease.About 60 people from the health department were trained earlier this week, to conduct the stratified multistage random sampling. A team comprising three members has been formed for each cluster. It includes a doctor, auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM), and a lab technician.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “Our teams are ready to start the survey once we receive the green signal from the Haryana health department. New guidelines will be shared with the team in a few days.”Gurugram has conducted two rounds of sero survey in 2020, where the sero-positivity rate in the urban areas was recorded at 18.5%, while it increased to 25.9% in the second round.

Later, they return duplicate phones using the e-commerce website’s return policy.” Rao said that similar cases have been registered at multiple police stations in the city and they have arrested four people for stealing iPhones after replacing them with cloned ones. “On May 30, we had arrested a delivery associate of an e-commerce company for allegedly stealing seven iPhones and replacing them with dummy phones in the boxes. The consignment had Apple’s iPhone 12 Pro Max model, which was marked undelivered and was deposited to the warehouse on the same day. Later, the phones were found to be fake,” he said.During the investigation, the police found that several accounts were created on the website using aliases and mobile numbers procured on incorrect documentation. The gang members had ordered items of high value. “Making use of the return policy of the e-commerce website, the accused packed duplicate products in the company packaging and returned them. The people then received a refund for the original product,” said Rao. The police said similar cases have been reported in Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Pune, Mumbai and Bengaluru. More than 50 people have been arrested this year from different cities for such scams, the police said. Rao said that in as many as 100 instances, the gang had cited performance issues for returning the phones. They pasted the IMEI number of the original products on the duplicate one so as to not arouse suspicion. “The cloned phones were brought from Delhi. We have questioned the shopkeeper dealing in these fake mobile phones that are also called dummy phones,” he said. A case under Section 420 (fraud) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at IMT Manesar police station and the IP address of the suspects was identified. The police said they use cyber café and other public networks to order the electronic gadgets.Aditya Singh, authorised representative for Amazon, told the police that these cases have been reported since 2019. “Earlier, a gang from Rajasthan was arrested that used to order cameras and later return them after replacing them with cloned ones. The same modus operandi is followed by the Gururgam gang. They give locations of remote places where our delivery persons do not deliver and a third party delivery man is sent. As the delivery man cannot make out a difference between a clones and original phone, refund is initiated and later they are found to be fake,” he said, adding that similar cases are being reported from Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/amazon-duped-with-dummy-phones-in-returns-case-filed-101623777726375.html
15-06-2021||Gurugram||GMDA’s flood control room to be functional by this week||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) is likely to make its flood control room functional later this week, to manage waterlogging issues in the district during monsoon, officials said on Tuesday.“This year, we are setting up the flood control room early as Gurugram has been receiving rainfall at frequent intervals in the past few weeks. We usually take a timeline of monsoon arrival by July 1 and make it functional by then, but this year, preparations started early. At present, the negotiations for setting up the flood control room are done, and we are waiting for a final approval from senior officials, following which, it will be functional by the end of this week,” said a senior official, infrastructure-II division, GMDA.The flood control room ensures that waterlogging issues being reported by the people are resolved at the earliest, with workers and machinery available on time for smooth functioning of the stormwater system during the monsoon.Usually, two people manage the work at such flood control rooms, but the information about this facility is yet to be released.The GMDA had invited tenders last month, and it set a deadline of June 1 for companies to submit proposals for the flood control room worth ₹69 lakh.This year, the authority has arranged for six temporary additional suction pumps that will be used in addition to the permanent ones placed at critical points. They will also make arrangements for super sucker machines in case of heavy waterlogging during the peak monsoon.At a few critical points, like Narsinghpur service lanes, water can be removed from the streets only by using machinery, said the officials. The authority plans to deploy pumping sets and diesel generator sets at these locations, so that the work is not hampered during power cuts. Places such as Golf Course Road underpass, Sheeba Apartments in Sector 28, and Hero Honda Chowk among others, are some of the critical locations.In 2019, the GMDA had placed eight dewatering pump sets, four tractor-mounted suction pumps, one earthmover, two super sucker machines, and 5,000 gunny bags at a flood control room in Sector 53. About 10 people worked there 24X7, in shifts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gmdas-flood-control-room-to-be-functional-by-this-week-101623777668599.html
15-06-2021||Gurugram||Aravalli encroachment: Faridabad activist arrested for ‘instigating crowd’||The Faridabad police on Tuesday afternoon arrested an activist from Khori village for allegedly instigating protesters and booked 150 residents for gathering in violation of prohibitory orders.A student activist who visited Khori village with the activist on Tuesday, requesting anonymity, said, “We had learnt from the villagers that electricity and water supply to the area had been disconnected for the past two days. We visited the place today (Tuesday) to see what the condition was and if people needed any help. When we were leaving the village, police officials stopped our vehicle and arrested Nirmal Gorana.” Gorana, the general secretary of Bandhua Mukti Morcha, had been working with the residents of Khori village to seek rehabilitation from the district administration, as their houses on Aravalli land are to be demolished soon. Residents of Khori have been protesting since the last week, after the Supreme Court — holding that there cannot be a compromise or concession on forest land — ordered the demolition of houses encroaching on the Aravalli forest area in Faridabad district. Anshu Singla, the deputy commissioner of police (NIT), said that Gorana was violating the Covid-19 protocols by organising gatherings and was instigating them to violate the Supreme Court order. “He was trying to disturb the peace of the city by violating all guidelines and was violating Section 144 (of the CrPC) imposed in the area,” he said. Singla said they received information that nearly 150 protesters had gathered in the village and were raising slogans against the district administration. “They were planning to pelt police parties deployed in the area with stones. The protesters and social activists had set up tents and were using microphones to instigate dwellers,” he said. A case was registered against more than 150 people on Tuesday and one person was arrested. Other identified suspects allegedly fled the spot, but their names have been mentioned in the FIR, the police said. On Monday, the Faridabad district magistrate released an order prohibiting gathering of five or more persons “within a radius of 200 meters of village Khori” fearing heavy protest by occupants and the possibility of unrest.The order stated, “...prohibit the gathering of five or more persons, the carrying of weapon of offence like firearms, swords, gandasa, lathis, barchas, kulahris, knives, and other weapons within 200 meters of encroachment area in village Khori... till completion of work.”Residents, however, alleged that police officials pelted stones at Gorana’s vehicle while he was leaving the village and arrested him. “We already did not have water supply in this area and used to manage with tankers, but now, the administration has stopped their entry. The electricity supply has also been disconnected for three days. Nirmal Gorana and his team were just learning about the situation, and he was arrested while leaving. The police pelted stones to stop his vehicle,” said a resident. In a joint statement, four social organisations, Basti Suraksha Manch, Working Peoples’ Charter, Bandhua Mukti Morcha and National Alliance of People’s Movements, said, “The police is patrolling every street and every intersection in Khori village. They are beating people as soon as they exit their houses. Many people have begun shifting their household items and the police are attacking them too. Despite a meeting between district officials wherein Khori residents were granted three additional days, the ground reality is that there are hordes of police in the village, terrorizing the residents and arresting people arbitrarily. Section 144 is still imposed in the area and there is no electricity or water.”Police said teams are patrolling in the area to maintain the law and order situation but refuted allegations that they were stopping people who were trying to move out of the area. “Neither are we stopping anyone nor are we beating or troubling any resident. We are only keeping a close watch on the activities taking place in the area and to ensure people are safe and secure,” said Singla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/aravalli-encroachment-faridabad-activist-arrested-for-instigating-crowd-101623777669163.html

15-06-2021||Gurugram||Creeks in Aravallis will be cleaned to prevent waterlogging on Golf Course Road: MCG||Four natural creeks in the Aravallis that serve as a vital catchment area for recharging groundwater table, water run-off from which causes waterlogging on Golf Course Road, will be cleaned on priority, officials said on Tuesday.The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja issued a directive to the civic body’s joint commissioners during a review meeting of civic issues, including flood preparedness, held at the MCG’s Sector 34 office on Tuesday.The four creeks are located close to Golf Course Road, at sectors 26, 42, 54, and 56. The run-off rainwater from these creeks was identified as one of the primary reasons for waterlogging on the seven-kilometre Golf Course Road during last year’s monsoon, in August.As per MCG and Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority’s (GMDA) joint drainage plan, work on cleaning of drains was allocated in October last year, and around 60% of the work has been completed. The pending work was hampered due to encroachments, the report states.“Work on cleaning of the four creeks as well as clearing encroachments on them is going on. In the meeting, I directed the joint commissioners concerned to inspect the work on the ground and expedite it on priority,” said Ahuja.“The main objective is to ensure that there is no blockage in the creeks. Besides the prevention of flooding on Golf Course Road, we want to ensure that maximum amount of rainwater can be used for groundwater recharge while the excess can be naturally channelled towards the nearest water body or natural drain,” he said.On August 19 and 20 last year, the city received over 196mm of rainfall, following which the Golf Course Road was inundated, with rainwater accumulation as high as 0.5 metres above the surface level at several points on the stretch.Last November, TERI School of Advanced Studies, in a hydrogeological study of the area, done at the behest of IAmGurgaon NGO, highlighted that cleaning of these creeks is the main measure for recharging groundwater table in the Aravallis and for checking waterlogging on the Golf Course Road. They had also recommended to the GMDA and MCG to avoid concretising the creeks in any manner, as it would hinder the rainwater from seeping underground.Ritu Rao, a PhD scholar at the TERI School of Advanced Studies, who specialises and works on urban water bodies, said that the clearing and cleaning of creeks is a vital move as it will help in groundwater recharge.“The four creeks are existing rainwater channels and hence, their revival is one of the important steps to avoid flooding in Gurugram and in recharging the groundwater table. It will significantly reduce the run-off rainwater flowing downstream. The creeks would serve as a catchment area for rainwater to seep underground while the excess would flow towards the Ghata Jheel, Badshahpur drain, and eventually, empty at the Najafgarh Jheel instead of flowing to other parts of the city and causing flooding,” said Rao, adding that the MCG should ensure that there is no further encroachment of the creeks and construction and demolition (C&D) waste is not dumped in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/creeks-in-aravallis-will-be-cleaned-to-prevent-waterlogging-on-golf-course-road-mcg-101623777667242.html

15-06-2021||Lucknow||Temple Trust members must resign amid allegations: Akhilesh||Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday demanded that members of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerath Kshetra Trust overseeing Ram temple’s construction should resign in the wake of the allegations the Trust faced over a land deal in Ayodhya.“After the (2019) Supreme Court judgment on Ayodhya, the entire country agreed that the Ram Temple of Ram Lalla (infant Ram) will come up there. And now...reports have surfaced that corruption has happened...first of all, all the Trust members must resign until the allegations are there. If the work is going on in the name of ...Ram... (if) the question mark has been put on those Trust members who have to do everything, then they should resign,” he told a TV news channel.Former Samajwadi Party MLA from Ayodhya Tej Narayan Pandey aka Pawan Pandey and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh had on Sunday accused the Trust of purchasing the land, which was bought for ₹2 crore just 10 minutes before, for ₹18.5 crore on March 18 this year. Yadav questioned chief minister Yogi Adityanath as to how the land prices changed so much within minutes. “If corruption can happen in the land for Ram Temple, where else it might not have happened,” he asked. The Trust on Monday said the land was purchased at rates lower than market prices while refuting the allegations of corruption and dismissing demands for a probe into the land deal.“Now, they (the Trust members and BJP leaders) are saying that the land was purchased according to the circle rate or market rate. In that case, I would like to ask them that there is a village Dharampur in Ayodhya from where many farmers came and met me complaining that the government was not offering them suitable prices in lieu of acquiring their land,” Akhilesh said.“Ayodhya airport has to come up there. The farmers are willing to sell their land at appropriate rates. I had asked the government to give them money six times the circle rate in lieu of their land. But the government, which is paying good rates to the farmers of a neighbouring village, is not giving similar prices to farmers of this (Dharampur) village. What kind of policy is this? No one wants to stop development,” he added.Akhilesh also asked what officers were doing when the prices of the land that the Trust purchased went so high within moments. “We are not the only ones who are putting a question mark on this (land deal), people are also questioning as to what was happening,” he said.Akhilesh hints at alliance with Shivpal’s partyLucknow: Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday hinted at the possibility of an alliance with his uncle Shivpal Yadav and his Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party-Lohia.Responding to his party’s resolve to contest the 2022 UP Assembly polls by allying only with the small parties and not tying up with any big parties, Akhilesh on the issue of Shivpal said, “Samajwadi Party will not field any candidate on Chacha’s (Shivpal is Akhilesh’s uncle) seat--Jaswant Nagar.”He added, “The time will tell if an alliance with his party (PSP-L) will happen and how.”Shivpal for last two years had been repeatedly saying that he was looking for an alliance with the SP.Akhilesh said that his Samajwadi Party along with small allies will win 350 seats in 2022 UP Assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/temple-trust-members-must-resign-amid-allegations-akhilesh-101623777246462.html

A top TMC leader said on condition of anonymity that the contract with I-PAC has been renewed till 2024. Kishor, he said, will play a different role from now on. “The contract is with I-PAC,” Kishor told HT. According to the new contract, I-PAC will help the TMC in the next state panchayat polls, the civic body elections, which are already overdue, and the Lok Sabha polls. The TMC leader said Mamata Banerjee plans to consolidate anti-BJP forces and contest polls in other states with a target to win elections as declared by her nephew and TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee on June 8. The young TMC Lok Sabha MP declared on that day that his party will set up units in other states with the sole aim to win assembly elections and face the BJP head-on. Although Abhishek Banerjee did not name any state, the senior TMC leader HT talked to, said, “We are exploring the possibility of contesting in some big states rather than eyeing the smaller ones first. It is too early to comment on these plans.”States that go to the polls in 2022 are Manipur, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat. The TMC has no presence in any of these states. Kishor was roped in by the TMC after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in which the BJP wrested 18 of the state’s 42 seats and created a record. The TMC’s tally in the Lok Sabha came down from 34 to 22. The situation changed in the recent assembly polls in which the TMC bagged 213 of the 294 seats while the BJP ended the race with 77 seats. Kishor’s role was acknowledged by the TMC leadership. Kishor also helped the DMK-Congress alliance win the Tamil Nadu elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/poll-strategist-prashant-kishor-s-company-renews-contract-with-tmc-till-2024-101623774666763.html

He also offered to join investigations at his current residence in Chandigarh.Since its constitution last month after the Punjab and Haryana high court quashed the report of a previous SIT, the new probe panel led by additional director general of police LK Yadav has held three rounds of questioning of police officers and politicians in the politically sensitive cases of police firing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/police-firing-sit-to-question-badal-on-june-22-101623774487024.html

Thinking of him to be an electrician, Hota let him in. Moments later Panda brandished a country-made gun at Hota and threatened to kill him and his family members.“The youth asked Hota to call his niece with whom he was in love. The girl’s family had apparently spurned his marriage proposal. When Hota said his niece had left for her workplace at Bhima Bhoi Medical College and Hospital, he demanded that the girl be called back immediately,” said Balangir Superintendent of Police, Nitin Kushalkar. The girl lived with Hota’s family.Hota ran into a room with his wife and two sons, locked it from inside and called up the police. A team from Balangir town police station and fire personnel reached the spot. Sub-divisional police officer Tophan Bag reached the spot requested Panda to let the family members go. The police also asked some of his friends to request him to release the hostages. A team of journalists was then sent in to negotiate with him. The youth, however, hurled abuses at them and threatened to kill himself if they tried to persuade him, officials said.When the ploy did not work, the police then called Panda’s brother and mother to convince him to release the family. While they were engaged in a conversation with him, a police team led by SP Nitin Kushalkar, wearing bullet-proof jackets, entered the first floor of the house from a backside window and brought Hota, his wife and sons with the help of a rope and ladder after nearly a five-hour-long operation.The youth was subsequently nabbed and taken to the police station for further interrogation. As per the officials, he fired few shots at the police too before he was nabbed.Police officials said the youth was in a relationship with the girl and had proposed marriage. He was upset as the girl’s family members had fixed her marriage with someone else.“The youth’s friends say he is a quiet, soft-spoken and well-behaved person. Maybe, he was mentally disturbed after hearing about the girl’s engagement,” said SDPO Bag.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-youth-tries-taking-family-hostage-over-spurned-marraige-offer-101623774308604.html
15-06-2021||Chandigarh||When life turned full cycle again during the lockdown||They say a real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out. True to this adage and not so long ago, one of my childhood friends came back to impart some activity to my lockdown-driven sedentary lifestyle, the bicycle. Images of last year’s lockdown were still fresh in the mind when the second Covid wave swept us into another round of lockdown. Though the situation is improving now, my loyal friend looks on hoping I will give it company as the gym reopens. I’ve silently given my word to it. Last year too, when the Covid cases started declining in November and December, it made us believe that we were slowly headed towards normalcy, including the quotidian gym sessions. Being ungrateful, as most of us are to old friends, hitting the gym made me forget the buddy who had kept me fit during the lockdown. The lockdown acted as a catalyst to rekindle my lost love for cycling as it certainly did for many others, going by the surge in the number of cyclists around. Childhood memories of buying a cycle came riding back when I bought a bike last year. I still remember how my uncle gifted me a bicycle on my 14th birthday and overnight I became the owner of two cycles. Euphoric and proud of my two possessions, I would take the older one to school and keep the new one to flaunt and race with neighbourhood peers. The fervour of a new bike, coupled with childhood memories, revved up my cycling sessions for a few miles every day. Riding through the town, I observed the changes around and cherished the places that had stood the test of time. I was overjoyed and started motivating others to take to cycling. A friend also bought a cycle and joined me on the morning rides. I started enjoying cycling so much that I even started going to work on it, drawing appreciation from many. But as things started improving by the year-end and places started reopening, I’m guilty of parking my bicycle in the storeroom and getting back to the gym. The cycle started gathering dust and its tyres were deflated. I would look at it indifferently. But when the second lockdown was imposed and the gyms were closed, my friend asked me if it’s time to get the cycle back on track. So, life came full circle for us and our bicycles as we started pedalling our way to health again. One day while riding through a deserted stretch, my friend reminded how its old friends who come to our rescue, while new ones head out for their own safety. This time, we have made amends towards our endearing friend; we have promised to keep our date with cycling even as gyms reopen. manpreetping@gmail.com The writer is a Jalandhar-based dentist||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/when-life-turned-full-cycle-again-during-the-lockdown-101623773826812.html

So I decided to switch over to other crops that could give more in return,” he said. “In 2006, I started experimental cultivation of makhana (fox nut) in a waterlogged area behind my house. The return was much more than what I had expected. Since then, I reduced the area of cultivation of paddy and jute and started cultivating makhana,” he said. Today, Alam grows makhana over 40 acres of land.Similarly, brothers Prakash Kumar Jha, Prabhat Kumar Jha, Pradeep Kumar Jha and Dilip Kumar Jha of Mirchaibari in Katihar jointly practise makhana farming over 25 acres of land. “Earlier, we used to give out our land on lease, but now we have started makhana cultivation ourselves due to the availability of better power supply,” they said.“Maize growing area has increased during the last two decades by replacing jute and paddy,” maize farmer Md Ibrahim of Shrinagar in Purnia said. However, he demanded a better price and smooth trading of maize. Meanwhile, there is some resentment among maize farmers over the price. “The government fixed MSP on maize at ₹1,870 per quintal, but we are compelled to sell our crops at ₹1,300 to ₹1,400 per quintal,” maize grower of Japharpur village of Purnia Sunil Kumar Jha said. He demanded that the procurement of maize should start at the panchayat level through PACS (primary agriculture credit societies), like paddy and wheat.In Seemanchal, maize and makhana have replaced paddy and jute as cash crops. Hari Mohan Mishra, deputy director of agriculture technology management agency (ATMA) at Purnia, said, “Makhana cultivation has sharply increased during the last few years and is still increasing. Farmers have started growing makhana on low-lying land, which used to be for paddy cultivation.” State’s industries minister Syed Shahnawaz Hussain said, “We are serious about setting up food processing units in Seemanchal. The region has emerged as a hub of maize and makhana and their processing units will not only benefit farmers but also boost local employment.” He said several entrepreneurs have come forward to set up processing units in Purnia and Katihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maize-makhana-replace-paddy-and-jute-as-cash-crops-in-seemanchal-101623773045973.html

NSUI district President Rose Tirkey issued an official order to this effect, expelling NSUI Jamshedpur workers Kamal Agrawal, Raj Mahato, Rahul Giri, Anand Singh, Prashant Kumar, Lav Kumar and Jayanto Pramanik.“These people promoted factionalism against NSUI district president and promoted a particular religion in NSUI’s official WhatsApp group. All these leaders are being expelled immediately from the NSUI for three years for their anti-party activities, social media posts against party lines organisational protocol, and promoting factionalism within the organisation,” Tirkey stated in the order.She said secularism was the foundation on which Congress and NSUI stands. “Congress and NSUI are not based or inclined to any particular religion, it’s not a party or organisation of any particular religion. There’’s no need and place for leaders resorting to such acts. This apart, they were continuously posting objectionable posts against district president on social media, leading to mental harassment. They have been resorting to anti-party activities. They were also promoting factionalism and accusing NSUI district leadership of arbitrarily forming a new team,” Tirkey’s order, copy of which is with the HT, read.However, one of the expelled persons Kamal Agrawal said he did not receive any such order. “I have not received the expulsion order as yet, but came to know about it from media.

We wished each other with Jai Shri Ram the way Sikhs say Wahe Guru,” he said.Meanwhile, BJP district general secretary Rakesh Singh termed the move as “anti-Hindu”. “This is promoting appeasement. Now, Congress has objection to Jai Shri Ram in Jharkhand after Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal. Congress’ student wing expelled its members for taking Lord Ram’s name in Lord Ram’s country.

The locals, who are protesting against the construction, were not allowed to gather at the site by security forces deputed by Ranchi administration, officials said. Directorate of Municipal Administration (DMA) director JV Narayan Rao said, “The work started hassle-free with no problem and no protest. Everything was peaceful.” The Centre recently held up funds for LHP--foundation of which was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 1 this year--due to delay in beginning of construction work. According to state officials, the work could not take place due to protest by locals, who were demanding shifting of the site, as they claimed it was the only playground for children. However, the Centre warned that it will not release the fund until satisfactory progress on the project was seen. It also asked the urban development department to begin the construction work within a week. Then, the department wrote to Ranchi administration last week for providing adequate security to initiate the project work. Meanwhile, work of soil testing, barricading and factory set-up also started at the site on Tuesday. “If everything goes as per plan, the work will now continue till it gets finished,” adding that the government project aims to provide dwelling units to the poor. The entire construction site turned into a fortress with deployment of heavy security forces on Tuesday morning. A section of the locals tried to protest but they were not allowed. Basti Bachao Sangharsh Samiti (BBSS) convener Mintu Paswan said, “The protestors were threatened not to gather at the site. As there was a weekly market in Hatia on Tuesday, majority of the protestors were out of home since morning.” Under the LHP, as many as 1,008 affordable houses will be constructed for the poor and middle-class people. The project will come up on 7.5 acres of land using innovating construction technologies named ‘NAVARITIH’ (new, affordable, validated, research innovation technologies for Indian housing) at an estimated cost of ₹133.99 crore. LHP will include on-site infrastructure development such as internal roads, pathways, common green area, boundary wall, water supply, sewerage and drainage system, rain water harvesting, solar lighting, external electrification and others. The carpet area per flat will be around 315 square feet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/amid-heavy-security-work-on-centre-s-light-house-project-begins-in-ranchi-101623772327180.html

The minister started his first day at Ranchi-based Doranda home by waking up around 5am on Tuesday and some light exercise. “My father is on a normal diet and he had his usual breakfast on Tuesday morning,” his son Akhilesh Mahto said. According to the minister’s son, Mahto is ready to resume office and waiting for direction from the chief minister’s office. The 54-year-old education minister tested positive for Covid-19 on September 28 last year and was admitted to state-run Rajendra Institute of Medical Science (RIMS), Ranchi. However, after his health deteriorated, he was airlifted to MGM Chennai on October 19 from Bhagwan Mahavir Medica Superspeciality Hospital. According to doctors, the infection damaged his lungs completely, due to which he underwent a lung transplant on November 11 last year. Only a few lung transplants on Covid-19 patients have been performed across the world, and the minister’s critical condition necessitated the procedure, officials said. The minister was discharged on February 9 this year. However, he stayed in Chennai with some family members for post-recovery care. Mahto was brought back on Monday to Jharkhand on a special chartered flight under observation of two doctors of RIMS by the state government. Chief minister Hemant Soren received him at Ranchi’s Birsa Munda Airport. Mahto said, “I would like to thank CM Soren who stood by me since the beginning.” He also thanked people and doctors both for helping him recover. “People’s blessing and doctors’ medicines gave me a second life,” Mahto said, adding “The second innings of my life will be dedicated to the service of people.” Sharing his experience from when he was under treatment, Mahto said, “I fought Covid-19 with full courage and defeated it. Doctors and staff at the Chennai hospital provided me a great service.” The education minister said he was now ready to take on the field. “Doctors have declared me fit and I am ready to extend my service to the people of Jharkhand,” he said. Mahto will now be staying at his Ranchi residence now. Chief minister Hemant Soren on Monday visited his residence to assess arrangements, including medical equipment. He directed to ensure all safety precautions at the residence. According to sources, Mahto’s entire treatment cost nearly ₹1 crore. However, there has been no official confirmation on the amount as yet. In a bid to provide hassle-free treatment to ministers outside the state, the Jharkhand cabinet in December last approved an amendment in the rules for ministers’ salary and allowances. The amendment was made following problems faced during shifting of the infected education minister to Chennai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-edu-minister-ready-to-resume-work-after-8-month-long-covid-battle-101623772325951.html

The idea was to inspire people to get vaccinated, officials said on Tuesday.The unique vaccination camp was held jointly by Chakradharpur unit of Marwari Yuva Manch (MYM) and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) at Devi Fuels in Chakradharpur. State women and child development and social security minister Joba Majhi inaugurated the camp in presence of the West Singhbhum deputy commissioner (DC) Ananya Mittal, Chakradharpur SDO Abhijit Sinha and SDPO Nathu Singh Meena on Monday.“We held this special vaccination drive at Devi Fuels in Chakradharpur in collaboration with IOC. A total of 240 persons were given coupons to avail one litre petrol for free after they got themselves vaccinated against Covid-19 at the camp. The idea was to inspire people for inoculation against the pandemic,” Nitesh Kumar Bagaria, secretary of MYM-Chakradharpur, said. As many as 134 persons have died of Covid-19 so far in West Singhbhum.Praising the organisers, Majhi said people should not pay heed to rumours about vaccination.Talks were also on with tribal village heads, panchayat mukhiyas, political leaders and intellectuals to convince people to get vaccinated, said Mittal.This was significant as West Singhbhum has been facing challenges in convincing tribal village residents to get vaccinated due to widespread rumours about the vaccine leading to “impotency”. Moreover, health workers were also attacked in few villages during vaccination drive, officials said. The DC also chaired a meeting with village heads in this regard in Bandgaon block of the district. “Vaccination coverage is very low at just 9% in Bandgaon block. The vaccination rate in West Singhbhum is 30% whereas 60% people in neighbouring East Singhbhum district have been vaccinated. The third wave of Covid-19 is expected in last week of July and more and more people need to get vaccinated before that. I urge people not to pay any heed to rumours about vaccination,” Mittal said.Meanwhile, the Chaibasa unit of Lions’ Club and Chaibasa Gurudwara jointly started a vaccination camp from Monday, where lucky draw coupons were given to people after getting vaccinated.

15-06-2021||Other||After LJP, buzz of a split headache for Congress||PATNAThe ruling Janata Dal (United), which had earlier made an abortive bid to split the Congress in 2017, is learnt to have launched a mission to win over at least two-thirds of the 19 Congress legislators to consolidate its position in the alliance government. JD(U) currently has 44 members in the current Assembly while its ally BJP has 74. This is the first time in their alliance history that chief minister Nitish Kumar’s party has fewer MLAs than BJP’s. One of the JD(U) ministers, who is said to be driving the poaching mission along with Munger MP Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan Singh, confided that 10 Congress legislators had agreed to defect so far. “We are waiting for the consent of at least three more MLAs to desert the Congress in order to escape the anti-defection law,” said the minister. Lalan Singh, who was spearheading the JD(U) effort in 2017 to split the Congress, is said to have played a pivotal role in engineering the recent coup in the Laok Janshakti Party (LJP). “He (Singh) would focus on Congress once the LJP thing settles,” said a senior JDU leader and former minister. Rajesh Rathore, chief spokesman of state Congress, said Nitish Kumar was desperate as his government has a majority of only five MLAs in the Assembly. “With RJD chief Lalu Prasad out of jail, Kumar is uncomfortable. He is already under tremendous pressure from the BJP,” he said. Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra, however, dismissed the JD(U) claim and said all legislators were firmly behind the party and its leadership under Rahul Gandhi. “Nitish Kumar, who has resorted to political adventurism during the pandemic to weaken his political rivals, will be disappointed yet again,” he said. Party insiders, however, said the claim by JD(U) leaders was not totally unfounded, especially due to absence of a strong leadership in the state. Congress veteran Kishore Kumar Jha said the party high command must resolve issues in the Bihar Congress as the state was crucial for power at the Centre. “The party has become weak over the past few decades as it relied heavily on the RJD, much to the discomfiture of the loyalists. Inordinate delay in state unit’s reconstitution and organisational restructuring up to the grassroots level are other reasons fanning unrest among the party cadres,” said Jha. A day ago, JD(U) president RCP Singh had parried a question about possible desertions in the Congress, saying the party was like a sinking ship and hence it might continue to suffer desertions as it has done in the past. Political analyst and former Patna University professor Nawal Kishore Chaudhary said, “Nitish Kumar does not have experience of working under pressure. He left the grand alliance once the RJD begun asserting in the matters of governance.

This was among the six decisions the cabinet at its meeting chaired by chief minister Nitish Kumar approved. Environment and forest minister Niraj Singh Bablu said the ban would come in effect after 180 days of the gazzete notification. “All industrial units and marketing installations would be asked to dispose of their product, mainly of made of thermocol, within the stipulated period and resort to eco-friendly alternatives.

The term of all elected functionaries of panchayat raj institutions (PRIs), like gram panchayat, zila parishad and gram kutcheries, ends Tuesday.Though the Opposition demanded continuing of the term of PRIs and a petition was also filed in the Patna High Court, the government came out with an alternative mechanism through an ordinance as there was no provision in the Act for extending the term. The court had sought responses from the Election Commission of India, State Election Commission, union law ministry and the state government, but did not grant any stay. The petitioners also did not press for any stay. The matter is again listed for hearing on July 15.Former additional solicitor general SD Sanjay said there would have been a vacuum in Bihar’s panchayat system after June 15, had the alternative mechanism not been formed. “ Article 243-E of the Constitution of India mandates that the maximum duration of a Panchayat is five years from the date appointed, and no longer. It is similar to the Article 172 of the Constitution which fixes the term of the State Legislature for five years and its term also cannot be extended,” he said.Sanjay said the State Legislature has powers under Article 243C of the Constitution to make provisions with respect to the composition of Panchayat. “The Bihar Panchayat Act, until now, has been silent on the aspect of contingencies and situations when elections could not be held before the expiry of its term of five years. As a result, the state government was under obligation to intervene and remedy the situation. As the Legislative Assembly is not in session, the Bihar Panchayat Raj (Amendment) Ordinance, 2021, was promulgated to enable a stop-gap arrangement. It will be operational from Wednesday,” he said.The state government has constituted an advisory committee in all the panchayats and appointed the erstwhile mukhiya of the Gram Panchayat as the chairman, Up-Mukhiya as vice-chairman, members as member and secretary as secretary of the committee. It has been mandated that all the powers exercisable under the Bihar Panchayat Raj Act will be exercised by the aforesaid office bearers of the advisory committee, which will act like a caretaker government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/term-of-panchayat-bodies-ends-new-system-kicks-in-today-101623771667151.html

However, minor works will take some time to complete to actual execution of the project. PMC initiated the 24x7 water supply project at the cost of ₹2,550 crore to solve the water problem of the city. It raised ₹200 crore through bonds and also levied water charges. It has set a deadline of five years to complete the project. It was approved in February 2018 and work started in December 2018. The PMC allotted work to L&T and Jain irrigation. However, the project was affected very badly in the first wave of Covid-19 as workers returned to their hometown. During the unlocking of the first wave, workers returned to work but, suddenly the second wave started in the month of March. PMC once again faced a workers’ shortage problem, but it was not so severe as compared to the first wave. Nandkumar Jagtap, superintendent engineer who is handling the project of 24x7 water supply project said, “The water supply department and drainage department took to replacing 40-year-old pipelines in the heart of the city area due to lockdown in the second wave. We took the decision to lay down a water pipeline network along with these works. It helped us a lot and we have completed a 25-kilometre network of laying main water pipelines in the heart of the city road like Laxmi road, Bajirao road and Tilak road. In the congested part of the main city, we have to lay down a total of 125 kilometres of pipeline for 24x7 water work. Of that, we have completed major work on the busiest roads of the city. Shivaji and Nehru road are working in the pipe in the next stage.” He further said, “Due to busy and narrow roads, it would have not been possible to complete during the normal situation. Now, secondary pipeline lay work remains in the by lanes which we will complete smoothly in the coming days.” Sushmita Shirke, superintending engineer, sewerage, maintenance and repair department said, “The water supply department laid down a 24x7 work water pipeline along with the drainage work. It saved time and duplication of road digging work. We replaced 40 years old China clay drainage lines from the heart of the city area. It happened due to the lockdown, otherwise, because of narrow roads and heavy traffic, it would have taken a lot of time and energy of the administration to replace it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-completes-crucial-part-of-laying-main-water-pipelines-in-heart-of-the-city-101623771065789.html

Hemant Rasane, PMC standing committee chief and local corporator who was approached by residents with complaints of no water supply said, “There was a problem with the water supply when, the old water pipeline was accidently damaged during the ongoing drainage pipeline laying work. The water lines in the peth areas are primarily still the old cement ones which have not been changed since 1970 and during the work on laying of drainage pipelines, a JCB accidently hit the old pipeline thus causing the water to shut off, but the office of the water supply department has assured us we will get full water supply from tomorrow.” Aniruddha Pawaskar, heading the water supply department of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) confirmed that there was a problem with the water supply to some of the peth areas. “During the work on the drainage pipeline, it seems that a JCB accidently damaged the water pipeline, hence people in peth areas were getting low pressure water supply, when we dug up the line, we saw that there were several leakages along the line, hence it took longer time to get these repaired. But I have assured the people that routine water supply will resume from tomorrow.” Jyoti Dawalbhakt who lives in Shukrawar peth never faced any problem with the water supply. “Last week, though we had very low pressure for water, and it was almost a trickle, we were lucky to get enough water to last for a day but my mother who lives in Shaniwar peth had trouble getting enough water. At least the authorities should inform us before turning off water,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/hampered-water-supply-restored-in-peth-areas-101623771005870.html

Rajgad (ruling fort) is situated in Pune district and was the capital of the Maratha empire under the rule of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj for almost 26 years, after which the capital was moved to the Raigad fort and was also one of the 12 forts that Shivaji Maharaj kept when he signed the Treaty of Purandar in 1665 with the Mughal general Jai Singh I. The fort is located 60 kms from Pune. The five Shivaji-era forts comprising Shivneri and Torna in Pune district along with Sindhudurg, Vijaydurg and Sudhagad have been chosen for conservation by the government. The Chief Minister’s Office recently added Rajgad fort which is currently under the control of Maharashtra State Archaeology Department. In October 2016, the central government had undertaken a similar initiative to maintain and develop five forts — Raigad, Rajgad, Sindhudurg, Panhala and Vijaydurg — and had appointed Rajya Sabha member Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati as brand ambassador for the project. Following the move, the Maharashtra State Tourism Department (MTDC) had planned to develop five heritage forts in Pune district as model monuments. The CM has mooted the idea of bringing all the forts under one single department for their beautification and conservation under the CMO office. According to heritage lovers, other important forts like Padmadurg or Kasa fort in Raigad, Paranda fort in Solapur, Arnala fort in Thane and other historical forts across the state must also be conserved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/cmo-adds-rajgad-to-its-list-of-five-forts-taken-up-for-conservation-101623768905633.html

He had said the yatra was being opened for residents of Rudraprayag, Chamoli and Uttarkashi, the three districts where the shrines are located, from Tuesday provided they have a Covid RT-PCR test report.On Tuesday, Subodh Uniyal explained the decision to defer the yatra to the hearing by the Uttarakhand high court. Also, hotels, resorts and shops are still going to be shut due to the extension of the Covid-19 curfew in the state till June 22., he said.“So, if pilgrims go there, what will they eat or where will they stay?” he asked, rhetorically. “Also, I was apprised that Char Dham Devasthanam Board needs more time to complete the preparations for the yatra. So due to these factors, we will now take a decision about opening the yatra on completion of preparations and lifting of the Covid curfew in the state.” The Devasthanam Board controls the management of 51 temples in Uttarakhand, including the famous four Himalayan temples also called ‘Chardham’.To be sure, the Uttarakhand high court has repeatedly expressed concern over allowing the Char Dham yatra. On June 9, the judges also expressed displeasure that the state’s tourism secretary Dilip Jawalkar hadn’t visited the shrines to assess the preparations needed before opening them to pilgrims in phases.As reported by HT, the probe into the fake Covid-19 tests was ordered after questions were raised about the low Covid positivity rate beginning April in Haridwar as compared to the rest of the state. Data The 10-week average test positivity rate in Haridwar was 4%, while the figure for the rest of Uttarakhand was 13.7%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-defers-char-dham-yatra-amid-storm-over-fake-covid-tests-during-kumbh-101623768669441.html

Demanding jobs, the ETT (elementary teacher training) and TET (teacher eligibility test) qualified teachers were marching towards the CM’s residence when police restricted their movement near YPS Chowk. The protestors clashed with police before blocking the Patiala-Sangrur road near Passiana village, where police dispersed them again. “We were holding a peaceful protest when police used force to remove us,” said union state president Deepak Kumar, adding that despite multiple assurances, the government has failed to provide them jobs in government schools. The unemployed TET-ETT teachers are demanding a notification for recruitment on all 12,000 vacant posts and an increase in the upper age limit to 42 years.Jobless youths to boycott Cong leadersIn the neighbouring Sangrur district, jobless youths under the banner of Unemployed Joint Front have given a call to boycott the ruling Congress during the upcoming state elections. Associated with various unemployed teachers, health workers and other unions, they had been protesting outside education minister Vijay Inder Singla’s residence in Sangrur for over five months.With the government failing to listen to their demands, they have installed banners outside their houses, seeking answers on the status of their jobs and unemployment allowances. They had also opposed Congress candidates in the last Lok Sabha elections while raising the slogan of “no employment, no vote”.Sukhwinder Singh Dhilwan, a senior leader of the front, said: “We have decided to boycott Congress ministers and leaders. All unemployed youths are installing banners seeking answers from Capt Amarinder Singh. We will not allow entry of Congress leaders in our houses during elections.”Such banners have been installed at Harigarh, Jagjitpura, Gumti, Thuliwal, Dhilwan, Bhattlan, Dirba and Bhawanigarh besides the district headquarters in Sangrur and Barnala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/unemployed-teachers-cane-charged-in-patiala-150-detained-101623768607019.html

15-06-2021||Pune||Pune mayor shown black flags for monsoon ill-preparedness||Pune: The residents of Bibwewadi, led by a corporator, showed black flags to mayor Muralidhar Mohol accusing the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) of its failure to address flood-related works for the past two years. Those staying along the nullahs and nearby residential societies have suffered damage to houses and property during the flash floods in the past. The mayor was also shown black flags when he visited Sahakarnagar, Pune cantonment, Kothrud, Kasba peth and Parvati areas to check monsoon preparedness works. Prashant Jagtap, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) city unit president who led the protests, termed the PMC administration as “anti-people and callous”. He said PMC has failed to carry out nullah-cleaning activity leaving residents at the mercy of monsoon fury. Anil Mohite, a resident, said, “We have not seen any nullah-cleaning and construction of fencing wall works being done during April and May. The PMC administration and elected representatives are least concerned about our lives.” Social worker Nitin Kadam from Parvati said, “Houses on the banks of Ambil Odha were badly affected due to rains on October 21 in 2019 and later also. PMC has been lax and citing Covid as an excuse.” The residents of Gururaj Housing Society and adjoining areas of Padmavati and Sahakarnagar faced a tough time as water breached Ambil Odha and entered into their society on Tuesday. The September 25-26 flash floods was the result of a wall collapse surrounding the Ambil Odha. Environmentalists and urban planning experts stated that key causes for the severe overnight deluge at Ambil Odha was due to reduction of natural water passageways and mismanagement of space around a stormwater drain in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-mayor-shown-black-flags-for-monsoon-illpreparedness-101623767825517.html

Those who worked for the ISF during elections will have to show their allegiance to the ruling party,” he further added.The ISF said that political leanings should not be a criteria in such matters. Bhangar MLA Naushad Siddiqui who emerged victorious by defeating the TMC in Bhangar said that elected representatives need to work for everyone despite their political leanings while criticising Hossain’s assertion.Incidents of political violence following the end of West Bengal elections has led to loss of lives and property in many parts of state, mainly between the TMC and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

15-06-2021||Patna||Was Chirag Paswan betrayed? Latest updates on crisis within LJP||Chirag Paswan, isolated in Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and removed from the post of national president of the LJP on Tuesday, suspended the five rebel Lok Sabha MPs who revolted and chose Pashupati Kumar Paras as their leader.Paras, Chirag Paswan's uncle and the younger brother of Ram Vilas Paswan, is believed to have led the coup against his nephew with the help from Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).A rift between the two came to light when Paras stood against Paswan's decision to break away from the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar election last year. While LJP ended up winning only one seat, it was responsible for cutting out on the vote share of Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal United (JDU).Rebels thrown outChirag Paswan suspended the five rebel MPs from his party a day after they replaced him as the party's parliamentary leader with Paras.A national executive meeting was held & decided to remove all the 5 MPs from the party: Raju Tiwari, LJP leader pic.twitter.com/Kyfre9zUT2LJP leader Raju Tiwari said that the five MPs were given notice to which they did not respond. They were suspended after a virtual meeting of the party's national executive was held. Paswan, who was later removed from the post of LJP national president, had taken over the reigns of the party after his father and LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan died in October last year.Sidelined, Chirag tried to meet uncle and salvage situationChirag Paswan went to meet Paras in New Delhi on Monday. However, according to news agency PTI, Paswan was only allowed inside his uncle's residence after waiting for some time in his car. Chirag Paswan's cousin and MP Prince Raj also lives at Paras's house. Neither Paras nor Prince was seen outside their residence as Paswan waited.Prince Raj is also one of the rebels who revolted against Paswan.Who are the rebels? Along with Pashupati Kumar Paras, Prince Raj, Chandan Singh, Veena Devi and Mehboob Ali Keshar revolted against Paswan. The sixth MP of the party is Paswan himself.“There are six MPs in our party. It was the desire of five MPs to save our party. So, I’ve not broken the party, I’ve saved it. Chirag Paswan is my nephew as well as the party's national president. I have no objection against him,” Paras said on Monday.Surajbhan Singh - the new working presidentAfter Chirag Paswan was removed from the top post, Surajbhan Singh was made the national working president. The 56-year-old LJP leader was also authorised to convene a meeting of party's national council within five days to elect its new national president.Is it fair to blame Nitish Kumar for LJP split?Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal United (JDU), an ally of the BJP-led NDA in the state, faced a setback in the 2019 elections when Chirag Paswan decided to break away from the alliance. While the LJP won only one seat out of the total 243, Paswan's decision resulted in a negative impact on JDU's vote share, which in turn resulted in its weak position in the NDA alliance.Following this, a few JDU leaders were reported to have gone behind the back of Paswan to approach LJP MPs and Paras and encourage them to oust their leader from the post of parliamentary party leader and party president.The BJP, however, has maintained a silence on the happenings so far. “What do we have to do with whatever is happening? It is an internal matter of the LJP.” said Bihar BJP president, Sanjay Jaiswal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/was-chirag-paswan-betrayed-latest-updates-on-crisis-within-ljp-101623760933111.html

The TTAG along with Goa Tourism need to work together to undo the negative publicity received by the State during the last two to three months which has affected the image of Goa as a safe and secure destination,” Nilesh Shah, president of the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG), said in a memorandum submitted to the chief minister.The TTAG is a body of industry representatives, its members called on Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant on Tuesday and suggested that as part of the brand rebuilding exercise, a negative Covid test or a vaccination certificate should be made mandatory for tourists entering Goa at least until October, while large events like music festivals should not be allowed until at least March next year.Among the measures suggested was deploying personnel who will strictly enforce the protocol at all borders, check posts, railway stations, airports, bus stands, etc who should be properly trained with strict penalties for any mistakes and negligence of duty.“Entry into Goa (at least) till October 2021 should be allowed based on a compulsory RT-PCR test or antibody test or full vaccination certification or be made to undergo rapid testing on payment at the border check post or railway or bus station. There should be no entry without the above measures,” the TTAG said.“No high capacity events such as Hunar Haat (exhibition), Sunburn (music festival), religious or entertainment should be allowed till March 2022. These events are super spreaders,” the TTAG said.“All tourism-related businesses should only take 50-75% of their actual carrying capacity for at least 6 months to ensure social distancing. The actual carrying capacity of each premise should be clearly displayed and the reduced capacity should be stated,” the TTAG said.The TTAG has asked the government to embark on a publicity campaign to let the message go out that the state is safe to visit -- but only after measures like quarantine centres, mechanisms to enforce protocols and adequate supply of vaccines, oxygen, beds, testing centres with quick results, etc are put in place.“We urge you, your office, the home department and the tourism department to please undertake the above measures at the earliest to ensure that the image of Goa is re-built and so that tourists and locals will both feel safe,” the TTAG said.Several ministers have weighed in on how and when Goa should reopen for tourism with some suggesting that only vaccinated tourists should be allowed to enter, while others have suggested that tourism should not be allowed until everybody in the state is completely vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/enforce-protocols-rebuild-image-goa-s-tourism-sector-tells-state-govt-101623766331038.html
15-06-2021||Chandigarh||Vaccination in Punjab: Teachers, students to get jabbed from June 21||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday directed the health authorities to start vaccination of teachers, non-teaching staff and students in the 18-45 age group at all schools and colleges from June 21 to enable educational institutes in the state to open safely. He also directed the department to ensure that all persons with co-morbidities as well as disabilities, government employees, judicial officers and lawyers are vaccinated on priority. “Staff in hospitality industry, parlours, service outlets, including shops, restaurants and gyms, should also be vaccinated at the earliest,” he said at the Covid review meeting. Expressing concern over the gender gap in vaccination, the CM directed the health experts to identify the reasons and rectify the situation. He also ordered ward-level and village-level campaigns in urban and rural areas that saw higher positivity or mortality rates in order to prioritise them for vaccination. Claiming that Punjab was perhaps the only state in the country to have put in place a vaccination strategy for the 18-45 age group that prioritises the poor and the vulnerable, he expressed happiness that almost 1 lakh co-morbid youth and 3.5 lakh young construction and other workers had been vaccinated for free by the state government. Health secretary Hussan Lal said the number of Covishield doses received by the state so far for the 18-45 age group stood at 5,86,000, of which 5,30,610 had been used, leaving a balance stock of 55,390. Of 1,50,850 Covaxin doses received, 66,040 have been utilised. Experts to study effectiveness of vaccineThe chief minister also directed the expert group headed by Dr Gagandeep Kang to start studying the effectiveness of vaccines in the context of the new variants of the coronavirus.“The month-wise whole genome sequencing has shown that in March, 95% of the problem was due to the UK variant. In April, the Delta variant started increasing, and became dominant, reaching nearly 90%, in May,” he said, adding, “It was a matter of concern that the Brazil variant (B1) had increased from 1% in April and now stood at 8%.”The CM underlined the need to get more samples analysed to have a clearer picture and formulate a proper strategy. The state’s adviser, Dr KK Talwar, said an expert group was being constituted to analyse the audit of patients who had been on ventilator during the second wave to provide learnings for the future. Dr Talwar is making efforts to arrange for genome sampling at Patiala’s Rajindra Hospital.Capt also ordered tracking of all black fungus (mucormycosis) cases, which currently stand at 441 in the state. Of these, 51 cases have already been cured and 308 are undergoing treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vaccination-in-punjab-teachers-students-to-get-jabbed-from-june-21-101623765486199.html

15-06-2021||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: Align sustainable devp goals with Pune’s civic challenges||A few days ago, NITI Aayog released the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) India Index and Dashboard 2020–21. It told us that Kerala is ranked first, and Maharashtra is among the top five states. India is ranked 120 out of 165 countries in an independent global report and index using the SDG framework, prepared by a team led by Jeffrey Sachs and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network. We have a lot to do!All United Nations’ member states adopted the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015. Developed through a global consultative process, these 17 goals and 169 related targets are to be achieved by 2030. The goals are: no poverty, zero hunger, good health and well-being, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth; industry, innovation and infrastructure; reduced inequalities; sustainable cities and communities; responsible consumption and production; climate action; life below water; life on land; peace, justice and strong institutions; and strengthening global partnerships for the goals.The goals are relevant not only at the country level, but for cities as well. How India’s cities develop is highly consequential for global sustainable development. Consider this: globally, 4.2 billion people live in cities, about 54% of the world population. Of these, 451 million are urban dwellers in India. So, over 10% of the world’s urban population lives in Indian cities. By contrast, the US is about 82% urban with 269 million urban dwellers of its total population of 327 million. If Indian cities taken together were to be considered a country, this “Indian city country” would be bigger than the US.If monitoring and measuring make us behave more sustainably, then Indian cities should prepare local SDG reports. The NITI Aayog report too refers to responsibilities at all levels of government. A couple of years ago, a mapping of municipal functions with the SDGs was done in a pilot initiative in Patiala. However, a formal framework has not yet been provided to cities by the central or state governments for how best to contribute to the SDGs with their municipal functions. It is admirable that since the 1990s, the Pune Municipal Corporation has been regularly publishing its annual Environment Status Report (ESR). It uses a framework of Drivers-Pressure-Status-Impact-Response and is a handy reference for the city’s performance on air quality, water, waste, and aspects such as the number of gardens and vehicular growth, etc. The ESR gives us the trends and status of environmental quality and is published around the end of July every year, so look out for it. A Pune SDG Report is perhaps now called for. The ESR framework provides the status, but the SDG framework also provides desired directions for change and has targets and indicators. Currently, when the ESR highlights that the city’s air and water are polluted, the municipal plans and budgets don’t necessarily incorporate corrective actions. The SDGs targets and indicators don’t all neatly match with municipal functions. Nor do all municipal functions directly fit in. But, that is ok. The important thing is to critically look at and deliberate upon the various indicators of sustainable development and check how well-aligned with sustainability needs, or not, are the city government’s policies and projects. Often, several targets are linked. For example, the SWaCH Cooperative has been working to improve the livelihood arrangements (SDG 1.4) and work conditions (SDG 8) of a highly vulnerable, predominantly female workforce (SDG 5), which helps reduce inequalities (SDG 10). SWaCH encourages doorstep collection of source-segregated waste (SDG 11), improves the retrieval of recyclables, thus enhancing sustainable production and consumption (SDG 12), and avoids waste-burning and consequent air pollution (SDG 11, SDG 3.9.1). By using a non-motorized collection system, SWaCH avoids carbon emissions and support climate action (SDG 13).Converting the SWaCH model to a contractor-driven model for corporate profits would likely reduce the overall SDG performance of the city. It’s up to us to use tools like SDG indices and frameworks to improve well-being, especially of those who are the poorest and most marginalised, and to make our footprint on the earth lighter. While governments should improve sustainability performance and monitoring systems, the public don’t have to wait for that to happen to do their bit. Individuals, communities, and CSR-supported partnerships can (and already do) think, learn, plan and act for sustainability. Let’s strengthen our own contribution and ask for the city government to do so too. Sanskriti Menon is senior programme director, Centre for Environment Education.

Despite the party’s efforts to put the matter to rest, talks about leadership change in the state keeps emerging. Some senior leaders of the BJP like Arun Singh, national general secretary CT Ravi and Union minister Prahlad Joshi have expressed their support to the chief minister BS Yediyurappa and have denied speculations about removing him from the post.“Yediyurappa is doing a good job as the CM, he is working hard along with Ministers and legislators, [and the] organisation is also functioning well.

If some has gone somewhere (referring to some legislators going to Delhi to meet high command), they have been given the right answers (by the high command) and sent back,” PTI quoted the chief minister as saying, earlier on May 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-bjp-in-charge-arun-singh-to-visit-state-on-june-16-party-core-committee-meeting-on-june-18-minister-ks-eshwarappa-101623754736054.html

This comes amid vaccine hesitancy among the tribals.Monday’s camp was jointly organised by the city unit of the Marwari Yuva Manch (MYM) and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC). State women and child development and social security minister Joba Majhi inaugurated the camp in the presence of the West Singhbhum administration officials.“We held this special vaccination drive in collaboration IOC. A total of 240 persons were given coupons for 1 litre free petrol after they got themselves vaccinated. The idea was to motivate people for inoculation,” Nitesh Kumar Bagaria, MYM-Chakradharpur, said on Tuesday. On the occasion, minister Joba Majhi said, “Every citizen must protect themselves against Covid-19 by getting vaccinated urgently. They should not pay any heed to rumours over vaccination.” Also Read | Jharkhand logs 151 fresh Covid-19 cases, one new deathSo far, West Singhbhum has seen 134 Covid fatalities while 5,086 deaths have been reported from the state.

Health workers have reportedly been attacked in a few villages when they went there to vaccinate people.Deputy commissioner Ananya Mittal said at a meeting with village heads at government school in Bandgaon block of the district, “Vaccination percentage is very low at just 9% in Bandgaon block. The vaccination rate in West Singhbhum is 30% whereas 60% people in neighbouring East Singhbhum district have been vaccinated already. I urge people not to pay any heed to rumours about vaccination.” Meanwhile, the Chaibasa unit of the Lions Club and Chaibasa Gurudwara jointly started a vaccination camp from Monday where lucky draw coupons are being given to the people after getting vaccinated.“This camp will run till June 20 where people are being vaccinated with the cooperation of the district administration. People will be given attractive gifts on the basis of the lucky coupon lottery,” Kunal Saraf, former president of Lions Club-Chaibasa, said, adding that the focus is on the people in the nearby slums.To be sure, while overall vaccine supplies may be there at the state level, individual vaccination centres may run out of stock on account of how the states manage their replenishments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/free-petrol-to-those-taking-covid-vaccine-in-jharkhand-city-101623754505196.html

Begun circle officer Rajendra Singh said a murder case has been registered against 19 persons including the 10 who have been arrested, and efforts are on to nab the rest.He said the arrested villagers have told police that they started chasing a pick-up van carrying oxens, believing hearsay that the cattle inside were being smuggled. A crowd of 20-25 people started beating the victims after the vehicle was apprehended.Though the post-mortem report is awaited, Singh said the deceased identified as Babu Bhil, son of Dhanna Bhil, received injuries on private parts. The other victim Pintu Bhil, son of Var Singh Bhil, is under treatment and recovering.The incident happened on the intervening night of June13-14, when the two were driving towards their village in Madhya Pradesh after purchasing three oxen from Begun town in Chittorgarh district. They were intercepted near Bilkhanda by a group of locals who were wielding sticks. Police said the purchase of oxen has been verified with the seller.Rajasthan was rocked by a mob lynching incident in 2017 when a 55-year-old dairy farmer named Pehlu Khan was beaten to death by a mob near Behror in Alwar district on the Jaipur-Delhi national highway. Khan was transporting cows to his hometown Nuh in Haryana after buying them at a cattle fair in Jaipur. The mob thrashed Khan and his son, accusing them of smuggling cattle even though he produced papers to prove that the consignment was legal. Khan died at a private hospital two days later.In 2019, the new Congress government led by Ashok Gehlot introduced an anti-mob lynching law in the form of the Rajasthan Protection from Lynching Bill, 2019. Under it, lynching offences were to be tried by a sessions’ court and be cognisable, non-bailable and non-compoundable.According to the new law, a person who commits an act of lynching will face rigorous life imprisonment and a fine of ₹1 lakh to ₹5 lakh. In case of grievous hurt, the punishment will be jail up to 10 years and a fine of ₹25,000 to ₹3 lakh, and for other injuries, the punishment is a jail term of up to seven years and a fine of ₹1 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-police-arrest-10-in-chittorgarh-lynching-case-101623752749656.html

But an over 100-year-old heritage building known locally as “quarantine” has been a popular spot at Malthaun in Madhya Pradesh’s Sagar district. Residents say the British colonialists constructed the building and it is known as “quarantine” as it was used for the treatment and isolation of Spanish Flu infected people.The 1918-19 Spanish flu pandemic was one of the worst in history and spread across the world. It is estimated to have affected about 500 million people, or one-third of the world’s population, and killed at least 50 million globally, according to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Rameshwar Prasad Tiwari, 87, a local resident, said his parents would tell him when Laal Bukhar (Spanish Flu) was spreading in the world, this building was used to isolate people and to provide treatment to the infected people. “When I used to share this story with my sons and grandsons, they used to say how can someone be locked in a building for treatment, But after Covid 19 struck, they started believing me.”DP Tiwari, a local schoolteacher, said they would play around the “quarantine” and elders would tell them how it was used to isolate cattle and people during the Spanish Flu pandemic. “For us, it was just a heritage building of the British era. Last year, we understood the importance of this place when Covid 19 started spreading in India and the state government started quarantine centres.”Officials said for two years during the Spanish Flu pandemic, the building was used for containing it.Ajay Dandotiya, a veterinary doctor, said Malthaun was an entry point to the erstwhile Central Province and Berar State. “It was constructed for cattle as merchants from Kashmir to Kanyakumari used to come with cattle and sheep for selling them here. But to stop the spread of foot and mouth, zoonotic, and other viral diseases, cattle used to be kept in isolation at this centre and merchants used to live in tents nearby for seven to 14 days.”Dandotiya said when the Spanish Flu broke, the building was used to isolate people, who would come from other states. “A team of doctors treated the people in the camps set up in the nearby ground. However, we do not have any documental proof of that. But we believe this strongly as locals have been sharing this story for decades.”Neelkamal Rajput, a former local body representative, said they realised the importance of this building after Covid. He added the building is now in ruins and they have requested the state government to restore it and develop it.Animal husbandry joint director RP Yadav said the building belongs to their department and was used as a veterinary clinic to vaccinate cattle till 1990. “Now, we have sent a proposal to start the process of restoration of this historically important building.”Sagar collector Deepak Singh said they will restore the building and develop it more to inform people that isolation is not new but an old age practise for preventing the spread of any infection in both animals and human beings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amid-pandemic-a-building-called-quarantine-in-mp-s-sagar-101623750829352.html

Offices were allowed to function till 4 pm during Unlock 1, which was announced last week on June 8 after 35-days long lockdown in the state.The lockdown was clamped on May 5 and was extended four times, the last being on June 2, to contain a record rise in Covid-19 infections in the state, which began in April and continued till May end, paralysing the healthcare system and resulting into deaths of hundreds of patients while the state struggled to augment number of beds, oxygen supply and essential medicines while containing black marketing of life saving drugs and equipment by unscrupulous elements.The CM further stated that all shops will now be allowed to operate till 6 pm on alternate days and the night curfew will now be in force between 8 pm and 5 am.

The city's authorities have said they would reimpose strict curbs if cases rise.Thousands died in the capital in May, as oxygen supplies all but vanished and families pleaded on social media over scarce hospital beds.People paid 20 times the usual price to secure ambulances and hearses, many died in parking lots, and morgues ran out of space."Delhi's top #mall saw a footfall of 19,000 people last weekend- as soon as it reopened. Have we gone totally mad?" Ambrish Mithal of Max HealthCare in New Delhi said on Twitter. "Wait for #Covid19 to explode again- and blame the government, hospitals, country."In the early hours of Tuesday, Delhi's underground rail network put out alerts on Twitter about peak traffic and longer waits, responding to angry commuters angry about long queues.After a strict five-week lockdown in Delhi, authorities have fully re-opened shops and malls, and allowed restaurants to have 50% seating. Suburban rail networks can run at 50% capacity, and offices have been partially reopened.Vaccinations have slowed, however; the city government said inoculation centres for people ages 18-44 would start shutting down on Tuesday, as doses were scarce."Delhi ought to have unlocked far more scientifically. We are inviting trouble!" Arvinder Singh Soin, a surgeon and leading liver transplant specialist, said on Twitter.Nationwide, India reported 60,471 new Covid-19 infections over the past 24 hours, the lowest number since March 31, data from the health ministry showed.The South Asian country's total Covid-19 caseload now stands at 29.57 million, the second-highest globally behind the United States.India added 2,726 deaths overnight, taking the overall tally to 377,031, data showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/as-delhi-unlocks-social-distancing-norms-defied-doctors-warn-of-covid-19-explosion-report-101623746431113.html

The renewal has apparently been denied over a pending case against her. Calling the application vague, the court said Ranaut was not vigilant enough to mention all details and that she also did not include the authorities as a party. The court allowed her to amend the application and posted the hearing in the matter on June 25.A bench of justices Prasanna Varale and justice Surendra Tavade asked Ranaut’s lawyer Rizwan Siddiquee for the refusal order. Siddiquee told the bench that the objection raised was not in writing as she was verbally asked to get orders from the high court regarding the quashing of the First Information Report (FIR) against her.The FIR was registered against Ranaut and her sister, Rangoli Chandel, in October 2020 on a magistrate’s order for allegedly creating communal disharmony through their statements and tweets. Siddiquee submitted that in her passport renewal application, Ranaut mentioned the case and hence the authorities directed her to get directions from the high court.The bench sought to know why the interim application did not specifically mention it was only for the renewal of Ranaut’s passport and had nothing to do with Chandel. When Siddiquee sought an earlier date of hearing, the bench observed it was only a film shoot and her schedule could be adjusted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-refuses-urgent-hearing-of-kangana-ranaut-s-plea-on-passport-renewal-101623748369069.html
15-06-2021||Chandigarh||SAD-BSP leaders booked for protest near Punjab CM’s farmhouse||Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal was on Tuesday booked along with at least 300 leaders and workers of his party and new alliance partner Bahujan Samaj Party for staging a protest near Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s farmhouse at Siswan on the outskirts of Chandigarh. Leading hundreds of party workers, Sukhbir was demanding the dismissal of state health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu and a Central Bureau of Investigation probe into alleged irregularities in the sale of vaccines and procurement of medical kits for Covid-19 patients, while asking the state government to come clean on the allegations of corruption.There were two barricades put up within a distance of 200 metres near the Siswan T-point, at least two kilometers from the CM’s farmhouse. The protesters led by former Akali minister Bikram Singh Majithia managed to break the first barricade, but police used force to stop them from crossing over the second barrier. BSP state president Jasvir Singh Garhi was hit by water cannon while trying to cross over the barricades. Sukhbir, Majithia and Garhi along with a number of SAD-BSP workers were detained when they were marching towards the second barricade. After staying at the Kurali police station under preventive detention, they were released on bail.“We have registered a case under Section 188 (disobedience to order) of the Indian Penal Code and provisions of the Disaster Management Act against all senior leaders of Akali Dal and BSP besides at least 300 workers of the two parties. We will proceed against them as per law,” said Mohali senior superintendent of police Satinder Singh. Earlier, too, Sukhbir and 225 other party leaders and workers were booked for violating Covid-19 norms on the CM’s orders, after they had gathered for a protest near the health minister’s house in Mohali.Corrupt Cong ministers will face action: Sukhbir “If a storm rises, Captain (Amarinder Singh) will be unable to stop it. There is a scam in vaccination drive; there is a scam in the disbursal of Fateh Kits; there is scam in scholarship for the SC community; and the land of farmers is also being acquired,” Sukhbir said ahead of getting detained. The SAD alleged that the price of Fateh Kits — medical kits containing medicines, consumables and oximeters that re given to Covid-19 patients — was jacked up repeatedly from ₹800 to ₹1,400 each as the state government invited one tender after another even as the first was valid for six months. The opposition party also claimed the government is involved in a vaccination scam, and sold vaccines to private hospitals at huge profit margins while allowing the latter to charge the beneficiaries steep prices. Addressing the protesters, Sukhbir made it clear that all Congress ministers who had indulged in corruption would be booked if the SAD-BSP alliance is voted to power in 2022. Condemning the CM for shielding corrupt ministers, he alleged: “Balbir Sidhu was responsible for the drug de-addiction tablet scam, PPE kit scam, vaccine scam and Fateh Kit scam; Sadhu Singh Dharamsot was responsible for SC scholarship scam; and Sukhjinder Randhawa had indulged in the seed scam.”Sukhbir alleged the chief minister had also extended patronage to sand and liquor mafia, which had looted the state with the loss in excise revenue alone being ₹6,500 crore besides illegal mining of sand worth hundreds of crores. The opposition party also demanded that land acquisition for national highways be done at market rates and displacement compensation be offered to the affected landowners, and the pending dues under the post-matric scholarship scheme for scheduled caste (SC) students be released at the earliest.The former deputy chief minister announced that if voted to power, the SAD-BSP government would give free education in government schools and SC students would be offered scholarships in engineering and medical colleges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/akali-dal-chief-sukhbir-badal-detained-during-protest-outside-punjab-cm-s-house-101623747889174.html

He, however, refused to elaborate on the alleged roles of the two.The duo were produced before the special court in Mumbai and have been remanded to NIA custody till June 21.On February 25, a Mahindra Scorpio was found abandoned near Antilia, the south Mumbai residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani, with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a threatening note addressed to Ambani family.A case was registered with Gamdevi police station in connection with the episode. Later, on March 5, Hiran, the owner of the SUV, was found dead in a creek near Mumbra, with six handkerchiefs stuffed in his mouth and his face covered by a scarf. Also Read | Man who said his cars were used in Mansukh Hiran case booked for forgeryA separate case was registered with the Mumbra police in connection with the murder of the auto spare parts dealer. The NIA, subsequently, took over both the cases and clubbed them for investigation purpose. The federal agency has so far arrested five persons in connection with the two cases, including three Mumbai police officers -- controversial police officer Sachin Vaze, Riyazuddin Kazi, Vaze’s colleague at the Criminal Intelligence Unit (CIU) of the Mumbai Police crime branch, and inspector Sunil Mane.It also arrested former police constable Vinayak More, a life convict in fake encounter killing of Lakhan Bhaiya, and cricket bookie Naresh Gor, both of whom allegedly helped Vaze to execute the suspected murder.Vaze was originally in charge of the investigation of the Antilia explosives scare case, but was removed after reports emerged of his links with Hiran. NIA took over the explosives case on March 8 and the murder case on March 24. Vaze was named the main accused in both and was arrested by NIA on March 13.To contain the damage, the Maharashtra government transferred then police commissioner Param Bir Singh. The senior IPS officer wrote to the chief minister, alleging that home minister Anil Deshmukh had instructed Vaze and some other Mumbai police officers to extort ₹100 crore from bars and restaurants, hookah parlours and when no action was forthcoming, he approached the courts.The Bombay high court eventually asked the CBI to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the matter, prompting Deshmukh’s resignation.

15-06-2021||Mumbai||Is Mumbai underreporting its Covid-19 casualties?||In Mumbai, 11,125 people died of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in 2020. However, as the number of non-Covid-19 deaths also increased significantly in 2020, which raises doubts whether Mumbai is underreporting deaths due to the viral infection.In 2019, the city reported 91,223 deaths, which went up to 112,603 in 2020 (a 23% increase), the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) data revealed.If we subtract Covid-19 deaths from 2020’s overall toll of 112,603, the city saw 101,478 non-Covid deaths in 2020, a significant spike from 2019 (91,223 deaths) and 2018 (88,858 deaths).This means that there was a 2% spike in non-Covid deaths from 2018 to 2019, and an 11.24% leap from 2019 to 2020. Also, in the first three months of 2021, between January and March, overall 23,114 deaths have been reported in the city. Of this, only 579 were recorded as Covid deaths, so there were 22,535 non-Covid deaths. The city’sofficial Covid-19 toll, from March 2020 up to March 31 this year, was 11,704. The city reported its first coronavirus case on March 11, 2020, and the first death due to it was on March 17 the same year.Also Read | India’s daily Covid-19 cases, deaths fall further to 60,471 and 2,726BMC officials maintain there is no underreporting of Covid-19 deaths. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC, said, “I will have to check the data and analyse it in order to comment on it. However, the situation was different in 2020, compared to 2019, as several citizens came to Mumbai for treatment as hospitals in the neighbouring cities were closed due to lockdown. Hence, these deaths also got registered in Mumbai. Another factor is also of people probably delaying their treatment due to Covid-19 fear.”Earlier, in May 2021, Leader of Opposition in the state, Devendra Fadnavis, alleged that the civic body was underreporting Covid-19 deaths. He said some Covid-19 fatalities were shown as deaths due to other reasons, thus suppressing the real toll of the viral infection.However, the BMC termed his allegations baseless. It issued a statement stating that Covid-19 testing and recording of deaths due to the infection were being done as per the criteria laid down by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). It added that it was committed towards “mission zero”, which aims to bring the Covid-19 situation under control step-by-step.Further, according to BMC’s data, a comparison of March 2021, when the city was witnessing a second wave, with that of the previous years, showed an increase of 5.59%. In March 2021, the city reported 7,554 deaths, compared to 7,154 in March 2020 and 7,155 in March 2019. However, all the data of 2020 provided by the BMC is provisional data.Meanwhile, overall, in 2020, the city’s progressive figures of Covid-19 stood at 294,067 cases, 11,125 deaths, meaning a death rate of 3.78%, and a recovery rate of 93.20% (274,072 recoveries).In the current context, the death rate, as of June 13, 2021, stands at 2.11%, with 15,183 deaths and 716,579 cases. Further, the recovery rate is 95.36% with 683,382 recoveries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/is-mumbai-underreporting-its-covid-19-casualties-101623730488180.html
15-06-2021||Patna||Maize, makhana replace paddy and jute as cash crops in Bihar’s Seemanchal||In Bihar’s Seemanchal, maize and fox nut (locally known as Makhana) have replaced paddy and jute as cash crops and resulted in better income for farmers. The state government says the change is encouraging businesses to set up food processing units in the area.Md Taimur Alam (67) of Chhatiya village in Purnia says he switched from growing paddy and jute to cultivating makhana in 2005. “These two crops were not bringing as much return as I had expected,’ he said, explaining the move.“In 2006, I started experimental cultivation of makhana in a waterlogged area behind my house. The return was much more than what I had expected. Since then, I reduced the area of cultivation of paddy and jute and started cultivating makhana. I now grow makhana over 40 acres of land,” he said, giving a glimpse of the transition over the years.Other farmers in the region, too, have made the switch. A family of four brothers in Katihar say they have been practising makhana farming over 25 acres of land for the past few years. “Earlier, we used to give out our land on lease, but now we have started makhana cultivation ourselves due to the availability of better power supply,” they said.40,000 to 50,000 metric tonne (MT) of Makhana is currently being produced on around 20,000 hectares of land in Seemanchal by around 15, 000 to 18,000 farmers. The crop fetches ₹40,000 to 50,000 per quintal and the trade volumes cross over ₹1,000 crores per year, according to agriculture department records. Darbhanga, Madhubani, Purnia, Katihar, Sitamarhi, Saharsa, Supaul and Kishanganj account for 90% of total makhana production in Bihar.Hari Mohan Mishra, deputy director of agriculture technology management agency (ATMA) at Purnia, said, “Makhana cultivation has sharply increased during the last few years and is still increasing. Farmers have started growing makhana on low-lying land, which used to be for paddy cultivation.”Similarly, around 1.5 lakh farmers are currently growing the other popular crop of maize on 2.25 lakh hectares of land in Seemanchal districts. It gives a yearly yield of around 50 -60 lakh MT fetching ₹1300 to ₹1500 per quintal and the trade volume crosses ₹4,000 crores yearly, according to official data.Md Ibrahim of Shrinagar in Purnia says the switch to maize cultivation from jute and paddy has generally been profitable for farmers. He, however, adds that the government needs to ensure that the farmers get better prices for maize by setting up smooth trading channels.Another maize farmer in Purnia, Sunil Kumar Jha, agrees. “The government fixed MSP on maize at ₹1,870 per quintal, but we are compelled to sell our crops at ₹1,300 to ₹1,400 per quintal.” He demanded that the procurement of maize should start at the panchayat level through PACS (primary agriculture credit societies), like it is done for paddy and wheat.Bihar industries minister Syed Shahnawaz Hussain said the government was “serious” about setting up food processing units in Seemanchal to create better earning opportunities for farmers. “We are serious about setting up food processing units in Seemanchal. The region has emerged as a hub of maize and makhana. It will boost demand for the produce, create local employment and help farmers get a steady income,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/maize-makhana-replace-paddy-and-jute-as-cash-crops-in-bihar-s-seemanchal-101623729828432.html

It said that these are far more important than the distance from work or affordability to decide where a homebuyer wants to live at a time when coronavirus disease is spreading.According to the report, Gurugram is overall the most suitable city to live from a Covid perspective as compared to Mumbai and Bengaluru. However, Western and Central suburbs in Mumbai and Mahadevapura zone in Bengaluru were identified as more suitable.As per the report, the Covid-19 pandemic exposed the shortcomings in medical infrastructure like never before. Both Mumbai and Bengaluru were poorly placed in this regard with just 1.3 and 0.30 Covid hospitals available, respectively, per 10,000 people. Gurugram outshone both with 2.5 hospitals per 10,000 people.The Index defined suitability in the city by population density, open area ratio and the number of hospitals. As per the report, localities in the East zone in Gurugram, like sectors 52-56, 58, 40-44, 30, 24-27, were found to be the most suitable for living as per the index.The Covid-suitability index for each city suggests that across all cities, suitability increased as people moved away from the city centres and older parts of the city towards more peripheral locations.The Index said though the density of Covid-19 cases in this zone was second only to the North, presence of maximum number of hospitals every 10,000 people, more than 40% open area and lowest population density made it the most suitable and hence livable from the Covid-19 perspective.As per the analysis, Mahadevapura, was the most suitable zone in Bengaluru. Some of the localities in the zone were Bellandur, Devasandra and Marathahalli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-most-suitable-city-to-live-in-covid-19-era-says-report-101623726586117.html

AIIMS Delhi has already completed the clinical trial for a single dose of Covaxin for children aged 12-18 age group. The recruitment of children for the trial of a single dose of Covaxin among those aged between 12-18 years started at the AIIMS in New Delhi on June 7 after India's drug regulator, Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), granted permission for conducting the Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of the vaccine.All you need to know about Covaxin trialsCovaxin, which has been developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), is being used on adults in India's ongoing Covid vaccination drive, which started from January 16 this year.Bharat Biotech has said that scientific standards and commitment of Covaxin are transparent, and the company has so far published nine research studies on its safety and efficacy.The vaccine for children aged 6-12 will be administered by the intramuscular route in two doses on day 0 and day 28. The trial will assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the Covid-19 vaccine in children, PTI reported.Once the recruitment of children from 6-12 years is done, AIIMS Delhi will begin trials for children between 2 and 6 years. The trials are taking place at 525 centres.The government last week cautioned that even though Covid-19 has not taken a serious shape among children till now, its impact can increase among them if there is a change in virus behaviour or epidemiology dynamics, and said preparations are being strengthened to deal with any such situation.A national expert group has been formed to review Covid-19 infections in children and approach the pandemic in a renewed way to strengthen the nation's preparedness, NITI Aayog member (health) VK Paul said.The Covaxin trial on children has already started at AIIMS Patna. Participants would be given the vaccine after their screening report comes.The trials have been flagged off in anticipation of a mutated variant of Covid-19, that could leave children vulnerable.A plea has been moved in the Delhi High Court seeking a stay on phase II/III clinical trials of Covaxin on 2-18-year-olds. Conducting the trial on healthy children would amount to "homicide", the petition has claimed and has sought criminal prosecution of the persons involved in such trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covaxin-trials-on-children-ages-6-12-from-today-all-you-need-to-know-101623721401444.html

The first wave, which peaked in September, 2020, saw 2,048,802 cases, along with 51,360 deaths.On Monday, the state recorded 8,129 new cases, along with 200 deaths.Also Read | Himachal Pradesh issues new Covid rules after tourists rush inAvinash Supe, chairman, state deaths audit committee, said various factors led to the high death rate in the past four months. “There were more Covid-19 cases in the second wave compared to the first wave, which was directly proportional to the death rate. In addition, we saw more deaths as the virus spread to rural areas, which had poor hospital infrastructure. Other reasons include shortage of oxygen as well as late reporting of the symptoms, which led to delayed treatment, contributing to a higher death rate,” he added.Dr Jeevan Jain, general physician from Lalbaug, who is credited with treating more than 15,000 Covid-19 patients, said, “The first wave was mild compared to the second one as we saw very few patients admitted to the hospital and a majority recovered in home quarantine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-2nd-covid-wave-added-over-61k-deaths-in-4-months-101623727488467.html

15-06-2021||Lucknow||Soon, learner’s driving license will be available online in UP||Acquiring a learner’s driving license is likely to become convenient in Uttar Pradesh from next month with the state transport department deciding to move the entire process, including submission of application, verification, conduct of test and printing of learner’s license, online. It is expected to save time applicants spend visiting the regional transport offices (RTOs) and make the process transparent while reducing footfall at RTOs.“Candidates will be required to submit their Aadhaar details online, after which we will cross-verify their credentials such as age, address, photo etc with the help of the Aadhaar database. Their application will be processed further, if the details are found to be correct,” he explained.Around three million learner’s licenses are issued in Uttar Pradesh every year and the new Aadhaar-authenticated system to award learning driving licenses is part of UP transport department’s recent initiative to move 17 similar services online, with an aim to achieve greater efficiency and reducing physical contact.Under the new system, candidates will have to upload all the necessary documents online and will be able to download the license after passing the test, which will also be conducted online.“We have asked the National Informatics Centre (NIC) to make necessary changes in the Sarthi software to make it possible for the RTOs to conduct online tests for issuing learner’s DLs,” said Dheeraj Sahu, Uttar Pradesh transport commissioner.Sahu said the department will also introduce a ‘first in, first out’ system to ensure applications are dealt with in a sequential manner with the staff having no discretion to favour anyone. He added that a random verification of credentials of applicants will also be done to check if any procedures have been bypassed.Other transport department services that are either completely online in Uttar Pradesh or under implementation, include renewal of DL, issuance of duplicate DL, certificate of registration (RC), duplicate RC, application for temporary registration of motor vehicles, endorsement of hire-purchase agreement and termination of hire-purchase agreement.“Making issuance of learner’s DL completely online was a bit of a complicated task as it required RTOs to conduct an objective-type written test for candidates. Now, the NIC is making software changes to make online tests possible in a transparent manner,” another official said, underlining the achievement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/soon-learner-s-driving-license-will-be-available-online-in-up-101623725928035.html

15-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s statements in top court ‘misleading’: Centre||Setting the stage for yet another face-off with the Delhi government, the Centre has termed as “misleading” the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government’s statement before the Supreme Court last week in which it said it has commenced implementing the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) scheme.The ONORC scheme helps beneficiaries, especially migrant workers to avail of subsidised food commodities anywhere in India and is currently operational in 24 states and eight Union territories. Apart from Delhi, the Centre has said, West Bengal, Assam and Chhattisgarh are yet to make the scheme functional.The Centre criticised the Delhi government for depriving scores of interstate migrants present in Delhi of their quota of subsidised foodgrains under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) in the absence of full implementation of ONORC. In Delhi, nearly 7.2 million people are eligible for subsidised food under various schemes.In written submissions filed before the top court on Monday, the Union government underlined that implementing the ONORC scheme only in one circle of Delhi with a handful of transactions doesn’t make it really functional. “The claim of GNCTD regarding launch of ONORC plan in NCT of Delhi is misleading, as they claim to have implemented it only in circle 63 Seemapuri. Only a handful of transactions conducted in (a) single circle with about 42 ePoS (electronic point of sale) machines cannot be considered as implementation of ONORC,” the Centre submitted in writing.Delhi government spokespersons refused to comment on the matter.The Centre said that unless the national portability transactions were rolled out formally in all the fair price shops of all circles of Delhi, in which more than 2,000 ePoS machines have been supplied and are waiting for operation, it could not be considered as implementation of the scheme.“It is pertinent to appreciate that a very large number of intestate migrants are present all across Delhi who do not have access to their NFSA foodgrains, being away from their own villages/hometowns, are not able to take the benefit of their quota of subsidised NFSA foodgrains in Delhi as there is no full implementation of ONORC and reporting of such transactions of NFSA/PMGKAY (Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana) foodgrains on the central portals/dashboards,” the Centre submitted.The Supreme Court is expected to pass further orders in this matter later this week.On Friday, the Delhi government, through its standing counsel Chirag M Shroff, informed a bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and MR Shah about making the national scheme functional as the court heard the suo motu case on “problems and miseries of the migrant workers”. Shroff refuted the statement of solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who represented the Union government, that Delhi was one of the four states yet to implement the scheme.The Delhi government’s assertion followed its affidavit in the Supreme Court that read: “Regarding efforts to be made to encourage migrant NFSA beneficiaries to use facilities of portability under ONORC, it is submitted that in Delhi, to begin with ONORC has been implemented in circle 63, Seemapuri, and from this facility, portability facility can be availed.”Last week, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to allow the AAP government’s doorstep delivery of ration scheme while saying that it was a waste of resources to have two schemes (ONORC and doorstep ration) trying to do the same thing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-statements-in-top-court-misleading-centre-101623714678685.html

Flying squads are travelling across the system to counsel and, if necessary, penalise passengers who are not following Covid guidelines,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC).“Standing passengers are also being de-boarded in accordance with the rules. Stations are being temporarily closed or entry is being regulated as well. These are attempts to regulate and control the flow of passengers for their safe travel,” he added.While distancing was maintained inside stations and trains, it led to long queues outside stations. In some stations around Dwarka, Kashmere Gate, Rajiv Chowk, Qutub Minar and GTB Nagar, the queues continued for a few kilometres during the peak rush hours in the morning and in the evening.According to DMRC’s official Twitter handle on Monday morning, the waiting time at the Dwarka Mor and Nawada stations on the Blue Line, connecting Dwarka Sector 21 and Noida Electronic City, was around 50 minutes.At least nine stations, including Dwarka Mor, Uttam Nagar East, Janakpuri East, Dwarka, Karol Bagh, Brigadier Hoshiar Singh, Govindpuri, Badarpur and Lajpat Nagar, were also closed intermittently to ensure that there was no crowding inside the network.These stations were shut for between 10 to 20 minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hourlong-waits-to-board-a-metro-101623714498191.html

15-06-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Paharganj reduced||The tables and chairs are gone. The cake counter is gone. The kitchen at the back is gone.One of Delhi’s quirkiest hang-outs has become history. Appetite German Bakery, in Paharganj, has closed permanently—the owner’s brother confirms. Not wishing to be named, he says the coronavirus pandemic is the reason behind the closure. The place was founded 30 years ago, he informs. It underwent two major renovations over its lifetime (the earlier wicker chairs were sorely missed).For many in the Capital, the backpackers’ district of Paharganj is a place to mingle around with eclectic post-hippie foreigners.Appetite was its archetypal hang-out, where you would try “baahar ki (from abroad)” dishes for cheap, and chat up with backpackers in the neighbouring tables. These exotic strangers, looking so free while away from their cultures and countries, would be reading Lonely Planets or playing guitars or writing in their notepad, or simply showing off their tattoos and piercings. Words like ‘Goa’, ‘Manali’, and ‘Benares’ would be overheard again and again, in French, German, Hebrew accents. The manager, Farid, would be sitting in a corner playing chess.Appetite had many dishes misspelled in the menu and the Today’s Special, hand-written on a white board, wouldn’t change for weeks. Whatever, the bakery counter was an eye-catcher with trays of almond cake, lemon iced cake, banana cake, chocolate banana cake, chocolate cake, and cheesecake. The fresh papaya juice was heavenly.

15-06-2021||Chandigarh||Cases of loneliness, elder abuse during lockdown on the rise in Chandigarh||The two lockdowns were a harrowing experience for senior citizens living in the tricity.On World Elder Abuse Awareness Day observed on June 15, many senior citizen bodies have reported that incidents of elder abuse went up during the pandemic and many citizens faced loneliness or/and were diagnosed with psychiatric issues.Out of the 11.3 lakh population of Chandigarh as per the 2011 census, there are 83,952 senior citizens in the city as per the 2019 Lok Sabha registered voters’ list with seniors forming 7.4% of the population.Gurnam Singh, a member of the Chandigarh Senior Citizens’ Association (CSCA) that coordinates with the UT administration regarding cases of elder abuse, said that the number of cases coming to him had increased compared to previous years. “Due to loss of livelihood and staying home alone, there are about 300 pending complaints with the UT deputy commissioner ever since March 2020. On my end, I counsel the parties whenever I receive calls like these,” he said, adding that a system must be put in place so that these complaints could be streamlined and resolved within a period of six months.The Modern Housing Complex Resident Welfare Association (RWA) had been running a special programme for seniors, providing food to those with Covid and those living alone. President of the RWA, Colonel (retd) Gursewak Singh, said, “Our volunteers would also talk to the seniors as they would get lonely. We also started hosting a webinar where we would talk to them and work on stress management.”Second Innings Association president RK Garg also said that more cases of senior abuse had come forward: “The first lockdown was harsh for the seniors since we were not allowed to go outside. This affected many who had to go for physiotherapy and other medical procedures. Many seniors were left at the mercy of their household help. In Sector 27, a maid refused to feed a senior and he couldn’t do anything about it. Later, he also fell in the house and had to be rushed to the hospital.”The situation has improved in the second wave as per Garg. “Those with children living outside have been reunited with them. The lockdown restrictions put up by the administration were more reasonable and we had learnt from the first wave.”In Mohali, too, seniors had a bad year. As per the president of the Mohali Senior Citizen Association, Swarn Chaudhary, loneliness has led to psychiatric problems for the seniors: “Not being allowed to go outside has affected many who have now developed psychiatric disorders. Neighbours are insensitive to our plight and there have been problems getting our pensions as well. Those with children and grandchildren settled abroad were the worst affected.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cases-of-loneliness-elder-abuse-during-lockdown-on-the-rise-in-chandigarh-101623701506222.html

Residents claim that the government is planning to construct the Ashiana flats by “destroying” the green area.Recently, the Sector-20 resident welfare association requested the chief administrator of Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) to save the green area and the developed park number 2008 in their sector. Others have met the Panchkula MLA as well.KK Jindal, president of the RWA, said that Sector 20 is known as a concrete jungle as it is the most thickly populated sector in Panchkula with a population of around 60,000. “But a 9.6 acre green or forest area consisting of over 3,000 medicinal and fruit trees helps maintain an ecological balance here. However, HSVP and CTP are busy planning destruction of the green belt and the adjoining park under the name of Ashiana Scheme,” he alleged.Construction of flats approved by HSVP: RTIThe RTI reply availed by the one of the residents of Sector 20 and shared by the RWA president mentions that “the parks have been merged into Ashiana Scheme approved by chief administrator of HSVP, Panchkula, on October 1, 2020”.Some residents have been raising the issue on social media as well, wherein they have shared pictures of the “destruction”. Akhil Goel, a resident, shared: “Once a thick forest and habitation of wild life, it is slowly being converted into a barren land. Trees are being cut in hundreds, daily transport vehicles can be seen in big numbers; shanties are being made.”Goel said: “If the government cannot plant trees, at least it must not axe them. They are destroying a beautiful, thick forest.”He added that there were already about 2,000 houses and flats for EWS in the sector. Currently roads and infrastructure is already insufficient to cope with vehicles of sector 20 , from adjoining peer Mashallah and The Dhakoli localities of Punjab. Jindal said that they were not against the rehabilitation of EWS, just against the cutting of trees. “We request you to preserve thousands of trees and plants in the 10-acre garden and adjoining park in this sector and maintain the context of the World Environment Day,” the president requested.However, when contacted, the chief administrator of HSVP, Ajit Balaji Joshi, said: “There is no such proposal yet.” When asked about the RTI, he said: “I don’t reply to these RTIs, but other officials do.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/save-our-green-belt-plead-sector-20-residents-in-panchkula-101623701266357.html

With this, GMSH’s ICU bed capacity will increase to 22. The decision to augment the capacity of ICU in GMSH-16 was taken during the peak of the second wave of Covid-19. “At the time it was realised that an eight-bed ICU facility is not adequate during such emergencies, and it was decided to expand it immediately,” said Dr Amandeep Kaur Kang, director, health services, UT. During the peak, the entire facility was dedicated to Covid patients. At the time, there was 100% bed occupancy in the hospital’s ICU. The city had successfully and quickly expanded oxygen beds as the second wave hit the city. The administration had roped in non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to create mini-Covid centres and mandated them to provide oxygen support on at least 80% of their total bed capacity.But the ventilator equipped ICU beds fell shortage as the number of critical patients increased. The city had to bear the load of critical patients from neighbouring states, even Delhi. The pandemic raged on in the first 15 days of May, leaving critical Covid-19 patients scrambling for intensive care beds in city hospitals. Even though the number of ICUs doubled in the last month and a half, the arrangements were not enough to cater to the increased demand. Existing space being used The work on the new ICU has started and the civil work, being done at a cost of ₹60 lakh, is likely to be completed within two weeks, said, UT chief engineer CB Ojha. The new facility is coming adjacent to the existing ICU facility and in place of the trauma recovery centre. “We have decided to use the existing space and upgrade it to an ICU facility. It is in preparation for the anticipated third Covid wave. It can even be used for non-Covid patients.” All beds in the new facility will be equipped with ventilators. The hospital has already received the ventilators. After the civic work is completed by the engineering department, these will be handed over to the hospital. “It will take another four to six weeks for the ICU to become fully operational. There is civil work going on at present. An ICU has specific requirements like regarding flooring. At present, we have time to upgrade the facility as patient load has decreased,” said Kang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-gmsh-s-new-icu-facility-with-14-beds-to-be-ready-by-next-week-101623700666420.html

Last year, PU had submitted its report to the HC in the matter. The recommendations of the panel, which was approved by PU’s syndicate in July last year, stated that the promotion policy framed by the varsity in 2007 will continue for the promotion of dental faculty. However, the report is yet to be approved by the PU senate, the varsity’s governing body.In September 2020, HC had asked PU to give representatives of dental faculty members a chance to air their grievances regarding the committee report, at the senate meeting. However, the meeting wasn’t held last year amid the pandemic, till the senate’s term ended on October 31.In the absence of the governing body, there is uncertainty about when the decision will be taken. PU has been functioning without the senate since November last year.In May 2019, as many as 37 faculty members had approached the HC arguing that PU has framed a promotion policy/career advancement scheme as per regulations of the University Grants Commission (UGC) for faculty of all other colleges. However, the benefit of the same is not being given to faculty of the dental institute, they said.What panel’s report statedThe report tabled at last year’s July 13 meeting of the PU syndicate recommended that the existing promotion policy framed in 2007 already has promotional avenues and should continue to be followed for promotion/appointment at the varsity’s dental college, subject to the availability of the post as per the statutory scheme applicable in Punjab.A faculty member, Ikreet Singh Bal, said, “In the absence of the governing body, the vice-chancellor is the sole authority at present and should look into our grievances. We are uncertain when the governing body will be constituted but our grievances should be heard.” Meanwhile, PU’s registrar Vikram Nayyar was not available for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/two-years-on-promotion-policy-of-panjab-university-dental-faculty-hangs-in-balance-101623700076020.html

In 2019, the number of children who had dropped out of schools and had never enrolled was much higher at 3,810 and 3,369 respectively.The maximum dropouts were found in the 14 to 18 age group with 2,269 such cases.In 11-14 bracket, 432 dropouts were identified while in 5 to 11, 459 dropouts were found. Out of the children who never enrolled in school, 2,722 are aged between 5 and 11, 258 are aged between 11 and 14 and 302 are aged between 14 and 18.Due to the pandemic-induced migration of families, the number of children in the 5 to 18 group also went down during the first Covid wave. In 2019, 1,72,982 students were identified in the survey while the number has gone down to 1,66,589 in 2020, reduced by 6,393.Speaking about this decrease, professor of Sociology at Panjab University, Rajesh Gill said, “This decrease of 6,000 children needs to be studied in detail. Mostly lower income families migrated during the first wave in 2020 and they are likely to have kids who weren’t studying in school. Otherwise a narrative for the success of the enrollment initiative by the education department and of online education is being built. The data needs to be studied in detail before jumping to conclusions.”In both categories, the number of male children has exceeded the number of female children. There are 1,726 boy dropouts compared to 1,434 girl dropouts. As many as 1,698 boys never enrolled in school as compared to 1,584 girls. Speaking about this, Chandigarh Commission for Protection of Child Rights (CCPCR) chairperson Harjinder Kaur said, “Over the years we have found that girls are more dedicated students. We are launching special programmes for boys since the education of both boys and girls is important.”The survey is conducted cluster-wise in which the city is divided into 20 clusters. Clusters which cover villages have higher number of children not studying in schools. The education department conducts special trainings to bring such students into the mainstream every year, however, when asked how these numbers went down this year, UT education secretary SS Gill remained unavailable for comments.UT department of social welfare, women and child development also keeps a check on such kids. Secretary, social welfare, Nitika Pawar said, “The department keeps a close watch on children living under difficult circumstances. These children are enrolled in schools and linked with social security schemes where allowances are given to children for their educational needs.” She added that the department has created a Covid relief fund as well to give a monthly stipend of ₹2,000 per child to children living under difficult circumstances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/child-mapping-survey-2020-number-of-out-of-school-children-in-chandigarh-goes-down-101623700009207.html

The Sena is expected to corner the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the issue in a bid to counter them on the Hindutva agenda.Singh had claimed that the trust’s general secretary Champat Rai had purchased land worth ₹2 crore at an inflated price of ₹18.5 crore for the temple, and was aided by the trust’s member Anil Mishra. Singh and Samajwadi Party leader Pawan Pandey have demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) into the land deal.Speaking to reporters on the issue, Raut said that all the members of the trust, set up for the construction of the Ram temple, were appointed on behalf of BJP. “Crores of rupees have been donated from across the world for the Ram temple of our faith. Even Shiv Sena, through [CM] Uddhav Thackeray, had donated ₹1 crore. If the sum collected for this work of faith is being misused then what use is the faith? With the suspicious land deal that has come to light, the temple trust must come forward and clarify on behalf of the government.

The elder son suffered major injuries and died late evening. The younger son ducked the bullet, but suffered minor injuries and was discharged from the hospital. The Rabale police arrested the accused, Bhagwan Patil, and also confiscated his revolver soon after the incident.

Yogesh Gawde, senior inspector of Rabale police station, said, “Patil had a troubled relationship with Vijay and Sujay for a long time. He would assault his wife and that led to frequent fights among them. On Monday, Vijay received a call from an insurance company, which was related to Patil’s car. He then called Patil to discuss it, but they got into a heated argument.” “Vijay along with Sujay came to their parents’ house around 6.30pm. The three got into a scuffle again.

15-06-2021||Mumbai||Covid second wave: 3.8mn new cases, 61K deaths in 4 months in Maharashtra||The second wave that started in Maharashtra on February 10 has so far led to 3,868,319 new Covid-19 cases and 61,336 deaths within four months, compared to the first wave from March 9, 2020 to February 9, 2021, which saw 2,048,802 cases, along with 51,360 deaths in approximately 11 months. Maharashtra recorded 8,129 new cases on Monday, along with 200 deaths. Avinash Supe, chairman, state deaths audit committee, said various factors led to high death rates in the past four months. “There were more Covid-19 cases in the second wave compared to the first wave, which was directly proportional to the death rate. In addition, we saw more deaths as the virus spread to rural areas, which had poor hospital infrastructure. Other reasons include shortage of oxygen as well as late reporting of the symptoms, which led to delayed treatment, contributing to higher death rate,” he added. Dr Jeevan Jain, general physician from Lalbaug, who is credited with treating more than 15,000 Covid-19 patients, said, “The first wave was mild compared to the second one as we saw very few patients admitted to the hospital and a majority got well through home quarantine,” said Dr Jain. “The virulence and potency of the Covid-19 mutant in the second wave was more lethal than the first one. We saw people suffering from high fever for seven to 10 days. In contrast, in the first wave, people got well within five days. Another reason for higher mortality rates was labs could not cope with the sheer number of patients and the results used to be delayed, directly delaying the treatment,” he added. Another factor which pushed up the deaths was that since May 1, Maharashtra has added almost 17,388 deaths from Covid-19 under the category of reconciliation deaths. “These are due to delayed reporting especially from the rural parts of the state which fail to upload the data in time on the centralised portal,” said Dr Supe. Mumbai on Monday recorded 530 new Covid-19 cases with 19 deaths, taking the total toll to 15,202. There are currently 18,205 active cases in Mumbai and the number of citizens who have contracted the virus till date stood at 716,190.

15-06-2021||Mumbai||Centre to give free Covid vaccine doses to all adults from June 21: BMC to double centres||Starting next week, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will double the number of vaccination centres across the city, anticipating a rise in demand for inoculation. The civic body’s move follows the Centre’s recent decision to provide free vaccination to everyone above 18 years of age from June 21. Currently, there are a total of 259 vaccination centres, which have a capacity to vaccinate over 31,000 people daily. With plans to expand vaccination centres to more than 500, the inoculation capacity will be pushed to more than 55,000 in Mumbai. Public health officials said increasing centres will also mean a tough competition to private hospitals, which are inoculating more beneficiaries than civic-run centres. “Since the start of the mass vaccination process in January, we have been continuously working on the logistics. We have the infrastructure to expand the total number of vaccination centres to over 500. We are hopeful that the arrangements will be completed before June 21,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC. Currently, BMC has over one lakh vaccine doses. Priority will be given to beneficiaries waiting for their second dose. In fact, healthcare and frontline workers can only come for the second dose. As of June 12, 3,722,261 people have been vaccinated with Covishield, of which 697,231 have been administered both doses. While a total of 294,777 individuals have been inoculated with Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, 115,575 have got both the shots. SUPPLY WORRY Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared that the Central government would procure and supply Covid-19 jabs to states for free to inoculate all above 18 years of age from June 21. Of the total availability of vaccine, 75% will be procured by the Centre, the remaining 25% will continue to be available for private hospitals. However, if sources from the public health department are to be believed, officials are still in talks with manufacturers, as a back-up plan in case they fall short of vials, like earlier instances. “Earlier, on several occasions, we had to face mass criticism due to unavailability of vials. We had to stop the vaccination programme at several centres. Even though the Centre has promised to supply the vials, we don’t want to close the door of communication with the manufacturers. We have to keep a backup in case, we don’t get an adequate number of vials,” said an official from the state health department. PRICE CAP There are a total 84 private vaccination centres in the city, which have the capacity to inoculate almost 67,000 people daily. Data shared by BMC shows that private hospitals are vaccinating more beneficiaries than civic and government-run centres. For instance, on June 12, private hospitals inoculated 58,629 people. On the same day, BMC vaccinated only 11,023. However, doctors said private vaccination may take a backseat due to the Centre’s new rule that private hospitals can’t charge more than ₹150 per dose as service charge, and it will be the responsibility of the state government to monitor its implementation. Private hospitals said that this would hamper the ongoing inoculation programmes at corporates and societies. “To arrange for vaccination in societies and corporate houses, we need to keep ambulances on stand-by and the arrangements are expensive. These cost more than ₹150 as service charge. Though we completely respect the decisions of the government, holding vaccination camps outside the hospital within the price cap would be problematic,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician, Bombay Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/centre-to-give-free-covid-vaccine-doses-to-all-adults-from-june-21-bmc-to-double-centres-101623699585486.html

BMC officials said the curb is because in case of any kind of adverse effect, it would be difficult to shift the person concerned to the hospital, which ideally needs to keep an ICU bed or other required facilities ready. Currently, private vaccination centres are set up at work places and housing societies. Further, the order also states that the memorandum of understanding must be signed between the private vaccination centre and workplace or housing society will to have details in it like number of medical staff stationed at the vaccination site and also ambulance in case of Adverse event following immunization (AEFI). Meanwhile, reiterating its earlier stance, the BMC in its circular has added political party hoardings, banners and posters are not allowed at any civic, state and private vaccination centres. This comes in the wake of several people from different political parties holding vaccination camps, in some cases, even facilitating it at large housing societies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-pvt-hospitals-from-outside-city-can-t-hold-covid-vaccination-camps-here-101623699525420.html

15-06-2021||Mumbai||Door-to-door vaccination not possible, Centre reiterates||Reiterating its stand that door-to-door vaccination was not possible, the Central government informed the Bombay high court (HC) that it was expected that the Maharashtra government and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) would follow the ‘near-to-home policy’ for vaccinating severely ill and bedridden persons. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocates Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari, seeking directions to the Centre, state and BMC to provide door-to-door vaccination for people over 75 years of age, the specially-abled and the bed-ridden. In response to a letter by BMC commissioner IS Chahal, the Centre, through additional solicitor general Anil Singh, submitted that as it was recommended by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC) and agreed upon by representatives of various states, the decision was akin to a national policy. When asked by the court whether it was incumbent on states to follow the policy, the Centre clarified the recommendations were advisory in nature and did not prohibit any states or corporations from implementing the door-to-door vaccination policy. After the HC was informed that the state was contemplating the door-to-door vaccination policy as health minister Rajesh Tope has announced it, the court asked the BMC whether it would comply to which the civic authority responded in the affirmative. The letter addressed to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) had expressed willingness of the civic body to conduct door-to-door vaccination for the needy provided the Centre gave it the go-ahead and issued guidelines. The response by Manohar Agnani, additional secretary, MoHFW, stated door-to-door vaccination could not be adopted at present stage due to Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) and cold-chain protocols. The MoHFW further stated that Near to Home Covid Vaccination Centres (NHCVC) for elderly and specially-abled persons could be set up in schools, old-age homes, sub-health centres and panchayat offices, among others. When questioned by the bench as to how some states and corporations had already started door-to-door vaccination, Singh said it was a fact as the national policy of near-to-home vaccination was advisory in nature. “We have clarified that national policy is for time-being and in future we will have some arrangement and issues raised by the petitioner will also be sorted out,” submitted Singh. Singh added the Centre had not prohibited the states namely Kerala, Orissa and Jammu and Kashmir that were carrying out door-to-door inoculation for the needy as health was a state subject. When Kapadia drew the attention of the bench to a news report wherein Tope had said that his department was working on allowing home vaccination for the bedridden and those who could not go to vaccination centres, the court asked the state advocate on the progress of the same. The advocate sought time to respond to the query. The bench then directed the authorities to respond and posted the hearing on June 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/doortodoor-vaccination-not-possible-centre-reiterates-101623699345419.html
15-06-2021||Mumbai||Covid, lockdown hit licensed tourist guides badly, many take up odd jobs||At times when India’s unemployment level has further increased due to the second wave of Covid-19, India’s 3,500 licensed tour guides are among the worst hit with many forced to take odd jobs over the past year and a half. With next to nil footfall of domestic and international tourists in the past year, guides like Nutan Kanade have seen a major drop in their earnings, and the situation is nowhere close to improving. The Mulund-based 45-year-old has been a guide for 17 years, introducing travellers to the wonders of Mumbai and its surrounding islands, including the centuries-old Elephanta Caves as well as weekend destinations like Nashik. Before the pandemic, her earnings would be ₹50,000 on an average. After the lockdown was announced last year, Kanade began to take online classes, but the earnings are severely affected. “I am a postgraduate in German, and I have started taking online classes to teach the German language. However, I am not even earning 10% of my original salary,” Kanade said. Few state governments have come forward to help guides. Kerala and Jammu and Kashmir extended financial support; Uttarakhand government announced a relief package of ₹29 crore for the tourism sector, which included ₹10,000 aid to registered tour and rafting guides. However, in Maharashtra – which saw 5,528,704 international tourists in 2019, for instance – guides have seen little respite. Jerroo Bharrucha, president of Tourist Guide Association of Mumbai said that a majority of the income comes from international travellers. “It is important to note that all tourists do not hire guides and for us no foreign tourists mean zero income. We work approximately four to six months and on an average earn ₹4 to 6 lakh annually depending on the tours we do.” There are 120 regional level guides (RLG) in Mumbai, 35 in Aurangabad and eight in Pune, Barucha said. Regional level guides are tourist guides licensed by the ministry of tourism. There are five regions: North, South, East, West and Central. West and Central include Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.“While tour operators bring first business, their rolling business is thanks to us, RLGs, who spend maximum time with the tourists.“We have paid our colleagues’ rents and even small sum of medical bills. Many of our guides have died throughout India due to the pandemic. With no work and money, we are going through a lot of stress,” she said. “A majority of the guides are facing severe financial crisis situations consequent to cancellation of all the tours and visits to the monuments,” Sanjay Sharma, president of Tourist Guides’ Federation of India (TGFI), said. “The $28 billion industry has been brought to a grinding halt at the peak of the tourist season. And we have been the worst hit, with no financial backing as we, the government of India approved licensed Guides, are neither paid employees by the Ministry of Tourism nor given any insurance cover or provident fund support to tide over such situations,” he said. TGFI, the national apex body of regional level guides approved and licensed by the Ministry of Tourism & Culture, with a combined strength of guides across India says that guides in their federation are historians, research scholars, trekkers, mountaineers, ornithologists, botanists, archaeologists and astronomers. “People don’t even know that the guide community exists. Moreover, we are a forgotten lot for the authorities,” Mogan Rodrigues, who has been working as licensed tour guide since 2004, said. Apart from the historical sites in the city, Rodrigues also hosted heritage walks, Bollywood tours and walkthroughs of the city’s temples, mosques and churches. “Our licenses are valid throughout western India including in Goa, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh. With no regular income coming in, one has cut down on expenses drastically. I am forced to survive on savings which are depleting. There is a complete indifference on the part of the government. We also do not have provident fund or any medical insurance facilities. Things are extremely tough for us and I have absolutely no idea when things would return to normal.” Rodrigues now makes East Indian food that he home delivers. “We are a family of four and my wife runs a salon, but due to the pandemic neither I am able to earn from my profession, nor is she. Thankfully for me, the word spread through social media, and it has proved to be fruitful. Today, I am earning around 25% of what I used to earn being a guide.” “The situation has been grim from the start of the pandemic. I had to sell off one of my properties to meet my daily needs. Currently, I am yet to pay my kids school fees from the amount, but I am worried as the situation for tourism and especially for the guides community is not expected for at least a year. I have a cancer patient in the family, and I have to take care of those expenses too. Our community needs the government’s immediate help,” Ajay Paliwal, a Delhi-based RLG said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-lockdown-hit-licensed-tourist-guides-badly-many-take-up-odd-jobs-101623699225460.html

Last September, the state legislature had passed an amendment allowing the Maharashtra Housing Area and Development Authority (Mhada) to redevelop or repair dilapidated and cessed buildings to protect the interest of the occupants of such structures.Both the Houses of the legislature had passed an amendment in the Mhada Act, 1976, empowering the authority take over the cessed buildings, with consent of 51% occupants, if the owners and housing societies fail to redevelop them within a year of notification. In two separate letters dated June 12, the Sena MP from south Mumbai said, “…this amendment will definitely protect the lives of the people who are residing in these dilapidated buildings. Nearly 16,000 buildings fall under the category of cess buildings in Mumbai. Some of these cess buildings, [some of] which are nearly 100 years old, are on the lands of MbPT (Mumbai Port Trust), NTC (National Textile Corporation), LIC (Life Insurance Corporation) and other organisations which neither repair nor redevelop them and do not allow even the government authorities such as Mhada to carry out the redevelopment.”Cessed buildings are old, tenanted properties that were built before 1969, for which residents are required to pay a cess to Mhada for maintenance. The city witnesses collapse of such dilapidated structures, especially during monsoon. The letter was written after a building in Malvani area killed 12 people, including eight children.Referring to the Malvani tragedy, Sawant said, “This proves how essential is the approval to the amendment of the Act and how the Act is important as the lives of citizens living in such structures are at stake.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/shiv-sena-mp-seeks-president-s-assent-on-law-to-revamp-mhada-buildings-101623698745377.html

The 93-year-old Akali patriarch didn’t specify his ailment.Badal offered to join investigations at his current residence at MLA flats in Chandigarh as soon as his health gets better. An official of the three-member SIT hinted that the panel members may approach Badal at his place of convenience. “We will take a decision on Tuesday,” he said.The SIT had summoned Badal, asking him to appear before it with records on Wednesday at a rest house in Mohali.Since its constitution last month after the Punjab and Haryana high court quashed the report of a previous SIT, the new probe panel led by additional director general of police (ADGP) LK Yadav, has held three rounds of questioning of a couple of police officials and politicians in two politically-sensitive cases of police firing on crowds protesting over the desecration of Guru Granth Sahib in 2015 when Badal was at the helm of the state.In his latest communication to the SIT, Badal underlined his intent and commitment to “fully cooperate with the law”, saying he had “complete faith in the judiciary”. Stating that he hoped that the new SIT, unlike the previous one, would conduct a fair investigation, Badal added that “the entire process of investigation already stands compromised because of political interference and vendetta”. The former CM said the very need for the present SIT had arisen out of the brazen politicisation of the case by the previous SIT, alleging that one of its members had tried to politicise the issue and subvert the entire investigation process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kotkapura-firing-badal-expresses-inability-to-join-probe-on-health-grounds-101623698566577.html
15-06-2021||Mumbai||You can get learners’ licence, vehicle registration online at Maharashtra||Those who wish to apply for learners’ licence do not have to go to a regional transport office (RTO) anymore as the Maharashtra transport department on Monday launched an online learners’ licence system. Aspirants wishing to apply for a learning licence can visit the road transport ministry’s Sarathi 4.0 website and take an online test using Aadhaar-based authentication. Besides this, chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray also launched an online vehicle registration system for vehicles across the state by the dealers. Dealers will be able to complete all formalities and payments of taxes online and there will be no need to bring the vehicle to RTO premises, said transport department officials.The move, according to CM, will not only be convenient for citizens, but also reduce the burden on around 200 government officials at RTOs. Every year, 1.5 million learning licences are issued, and 2 million vehicles are registered in the state, the transport department said.While inaugurating the two online systems, CM said that the transport department through this mechanism has put forward an ambitious step towards people’s welfare. “The system will not only help citizens avoid long queues [at RTOs] and save time and energy, but also about 200 government officials who have to deal with citizens queued up for driving licences,” he said. State transport minister Anil Parab called it a “revolutionary” move and said, “These are important steps taken during the corona times by ensuring the functioning of the department while providing online services. So far, 85 services of the department have been made available online for citizens.”CM also appealed to the state departments to adopt a new approach based on e-governance to make available facilities online in the future as well. He added that though the vehicles increase, the roads remain the same, the issue of parking needs to be addressed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/you-can-get-learners-licence-vehicle-registration-online-at-maharashtra-101623698446643.html

He, along with Yashpal Singh, were convicted by a trial court for murder, attempt to murder, dacoity and voluntarily causing hurt with dangerous weapons.Sherawat and Yashpal were accused of killing Hardev Singh and Avtar Singh in the Mahipalpur area of south Delhi during the riots that followed the assassination of then prime minister Indira Gandhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/delhi-hc-asks-for-status-medical-report-of-1984-riots-case-convict-101623698446053.html

The city received only 4mm of rainfall in the 24-hour period ending at 8.30am on Monday, and received no rainfall in the subsequent nine hours, as per data from the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) automatic weather station in Santacruz.Officials confirmed on Monday that dry weather is likely to continue in Mumbai for at least another three to four days, along with a slight increase in both daytime maximum and nighttime minimum temperatures. The daytime maximum temperature on Monday touched 33.6 degrees Celsius (a degree more than normal), up from 32.6 degrees Celsius recorded the day before.

15-06-2021||Mumbai||SSR case: CBI should come clear on its probe outcome, says Congress||A year after the much-talked-about investigation into the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput, the Congress has raised questions over the Central Bureau of Investigation’s (CBI) probe and demanded that the central agency come clear on its outcome.Congress general secretary Sachin Sawant on Monday said that 310 days after it took over the investigation, the central agency has not been able to throw light on outcome of the case. “When is the CBI going to make its probe report public in Rajput’s death case? The AIIMS (All India Institute Of Medical Science) had, around 210 days ago, clarified that it was a case of suicide and there was no poisoning involved. Is there any pressure from the political bosses on CBI to not reveal the outcome of the case,” he said.Sawant also alleged that Rajput’s death case was used by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to defame the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and gain political ground during the Bihar Assembly polls. The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) also did not take the investigation of the drug racket related to the death to logical end, he said.BJP leader Ram Kadam said that the central agency could not prove anything because the evidence was hushed up by the state police. “Before CBI took over the investigation, the state government destroyed key proofs in the room where the actor died by suicide. Maharashtra Police neither registered the complaint of Sushant’s father nor did it allow Patna Police to investigate in the state. For strange reasons, the state police stood by [actor] Rhea Chakraborty [against whom his family has lodged abetment to suicide case] and did not even investigate the [alleged] drug deals related to the case despite having clear proofs on WhatsApp chats. It was NCB which interrogated 35 people and arrested 20 of them,” he said. Chakraborty’s lawyer had earlier denied all allegations against his client. Meanwhile, the Congress has also questioned why former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh has not been summoned by the (National Investigation Agency) NIA in the Antilia explosives scare case.“It has been established now that the main accused in the Antilia case, former police officer Sachin Vaze, was directly reporting to Singh. The officers involved in the case were from Singh’s office. By not summoning Singh for investigation, the Centre is safeguarding the mastermind of the entire case,” Sawant said, adding that the central agencies have probed the allegations levelled by Singh without any proof, but the cases in which evidence are against him are not being investigated.Singh did not answer HT’s calls or messages seeking his response on Congress’ allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ssr-case-cbi-should-come-clear-on-its-probe-outcome-says-congress-101623698085463.html
15-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai varsity colleges reopen amid Covid-19, confusion||Several city colleges affiliated to the University of Mumbai (MU) reopened amid confusion on Monday. While colleges depended on an old MU circular stating that the academic year 2021-22 will begin on June 14 (Monday), a fresh circular confirming this and the fact that colleges will continue lectures online only came around 4pm on Monday, hours after colleges had already opened for the new year.“The university had released an academic calendar for the 2020-21 academic year towards the end of 2020 and in that it was clarified that the next academic year will commence from June 14. However, no one gave us any clarity on whether to conduct lectures online or not. We started assuming that lectures will be held virtually,” said Marie Fernandes, principal of St Andrew’s College, Bandra. By Monday afternoon, the university released a circular signed by the registrar, addressed to all affiliated colleges. “Lectures of undergraduate and postgraduate, except for first year (first part) will begin on the online platform after the completion of admissions process,” stated the circular. While clarity on online lectures has now come through, MU is yet to respond to queries about teacher and staff attendance in colleges. “We didn’t get any information in the previous circular. So we contacted the university officials and were told that MU itself is working on the 50%-attendance rule for the time being. So we have decided to follow the same rule and call the staff on a rotational basis,” said Anju Kapoor, principal of UPG College, Vile Parle. HT had previously reported how colleges were preparing for the 2021-22 academic year in advance, even though the varsity gave very little clarity on the reopening. From purchasing new online software to conducting lectures smoothly, to hiring new service providers and conducting exams online without errors, colleges wanted to be better prepared for the new year. “However, starting classes without the final go-ahead from the university is never a good idea. So we decided to hold off the commencement of lectures unless we heard from the authorities. Now that the circular has come through, we will reopen at the earliest,” said the principal of another suburban college on the condition of anonymity.For the past one year, students from across MU-affiliated colleges have been stuck to their computer screens for lectures. While everyone got used to the routine, many students found practical sessions difficult to understand through the online mode. “We would see several experiments being conducted on the screen, but unless one participates in a laboratory and understands the experiment, it’s very difficult to get the concept. Thankfully, our final-exam practicals were based on oral exams and not physical exams, so we could pass them,” said a third-year student of BSc (chemistry). She added that the college, on request from several students, had agreed to hold offline practical sessions in college in March, but had to call them off after Mumbai started recording an increasing numbers of Covid-19 cases. “Hopefully, this semester we will have a mix of online and offline classes because as third-year students we will need to be better prepared for the final exams,” she added.While most colleges depended entirely on conducting practical sessions online, some tried creative ways to allow better involvement of students. “As soon as our term practical sessions started, our department created a separate Google Classroom where practical material were posted either in PPT or doc forms, which were then explained during the lecture,” said Chitra Lahoti, a third-year student from the microbiology department of KC College, Churchgate. She added that the college made videos for every experiment such as protocol, precautions and results, and also managed to conduct practical sessions for some experiments.Final-year exams, along with the practical sessions, were also conducted online last academic year. “Two students were examined by one professor at a time. For each practical experiment, the problem statements were displayed on the screen and we were supposed to solve it at that moment and answer them. Our journal work was asked to be displayed on screen as well. Additionally, some set of multiple choice questions (MCQs) were also asked as part of the exam,” added Lahoti.This year, colleges are hoping for a hybrid teaching module to ensure that students do not miss out on important sessions. “Our hospitality students have been suffering from the past one year. But this year, we hope to make changes to include more physical sessions, with safety precautions in place, of course,” said Fernandes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-varsity-colleges-reopen-amid-covid-19-confusion-101623697965490.html

According to the district administration, the park timings have been changed as the park will now be open for visitors from 7am to 7pm and would remain closed on weekends like other establishments of the city owing to the weekend curfew. The arrival of monsoon in the city and overcast conditions turned the weather pleasant because of which there was a good presence of locals in the park. Although the opening timing of the park has been set as 7am, many morning walkers gave it a miss as a chunk of them do their routine walking between 5am to 6am. However, Monday witnessed many youngsters who arrived at the park for jogging. The park authorities said they were hoping for a higher turnout as the day progresses.“As we knew that the park would open from Monday, my entire family was ready for the day. However, many of our friends had to cancel their plans due to the rain but we did manage to come amidst the drizzle,” said Manisha Singh, an avid morning walker and a regular at the park. Earlier, the entire park was sanitised, and every visitor had to undergo a thermal scan before being allowed inside. The park authorities had decorated the premises to welcome visitors. Appeals to visitors urging them to follow social distancing and wearing facemasks were regularly made via the sound system all through the day. The guard at the main gate Abhimanyu Shukla said, “We have made all arrangements and are letting visitors enter only after ensuring that they are wearing the facemasks and making them undergo a thermal scan.” The president of the morning walkers’ association Kishore Varshney said, “It is important that we maintain our health and visiting the park for exercise is vital for that, which is why we are thankful to the administration for reopening the park. However, we demand that the opening time be shifted to 5am as it would suit most morning walkers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prayagraj-azad-park-welcomes-visitors-after-45-days-101623697727576.html

If the need arises, extra classes will be taken in the evening.”The technical education department on Monday sent a letter to the vice-chancellors of three technical universities- Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University (AKTU), Harcourt Butler Technical University (HBTU), Kanpur and MMMUT, Gorakhpur- directing them to conduct final semester examinations in online mode between July 15 to 22 and remaining semester exams between July 23 to 31 as recommended by a five-member committee formed by the department.The vice-chancellor of AKTU, Prof Vinay Kumar Pathak said, “We are all gearing up for conducting online exams for final year students.” He said, “I am very sure students will prepare well for the exam.”Students demand cancellation of examinationsMeanwhile, even before the exam schedule was announced by the university administration, a large number of students of AKTU jointly raised their voice, on Twitter, demanding the cancellation of examinations and promoting students to the next level. They asserted that appearing in the online test is next to impossible owing to the poor internet connectivity especially in the rural areas.Anshul Kumar, a student said, “There is a huge network problem at our place. I was unable to attend online classes properly. In these circumstances, it is nearly impossible to appear in the online examinations.”Priya Chaudhary’ tweet reads, “For solving the objective question paper, in-depth knowledge is a must. But in a short time, it is not possible. Hence it is unfair to conduct the examination in this situation.”Another student Ajay Singh is now demanding the university to return the examination fees. He said as there is no offline exam then the university should return their fee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/amid-demand-for-cancellation-aktu-final-year-exam-schedule-out-101623697605314.html

The assailants intercepted his path and fired shots at him. Victim’s brother Karambir said his brother was prime witness in his son Sahil’s murder case, who was stabbed to death outside Neki Ram College in Rohtak in 2018.“The accused had been mounting pressure on my brother not to appear in the court and make a compromise. We have asked police to provide security cover to our family as we have life threat from the accused,” he added.Demanding arrest of the assailants, the family and residents of Alipura village blocked the Jind-Patiala highway from 2.30pm to 5.30pm and lifted the blockade after police assured of arresting the assailants at the earliest.Uchana DSP Jitender Khatkar said the assailants had fired shots at Suresh from a close range and he had died on the spot.“The assailants pumped five bullets into the private school owner’s body and threatened other walkers to stay away. We have registered a case of murder, Section 34 of the IPC and Section 25 of the Arms Act against 11 persons on the victim’s brother’s complaint.

15-06-2021||Bangalore||₹1 lakh for K’taka families that lost earning member to virus||Bengaluru In a bid to help poor families who have lost an earning member due to Covid-19, chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Monday announced that the government has decided to provide ₹1 lakh compensation, one person per family. “Several working people have died due to Covid-19 that has caused distress to several families. Several such families have come to the streets. Keeping this in mind, we have taken a decision to give ₹1 lakh to those BPL (below poverty line) families if anyone has died due to Covid-19, one per family,” Yediyurappa said in Bengaluru on Monday.The decision to provide compensation comes over a year since the pandemic wreaked havoc in the southern state and other parts of the country, claiming thousands of lives and many more livelihoods.Yediyurappa said that the financial relief would cost the government around ₹250-300 crore and the number of possible beneficiaries would range between 25,000-30,000.The Congress, however, urged the government to consider deaths due to Covid as a natural disaster and announce a compensation of ₹5 lakh one person per family “@CMofKarnataka has announced ₹1,00,000 compensation to all those BPL families where at least one member has succumbed to #Covid19.I urge @CMofKarnataka to consider this as a national disaster and announce compensation of ₹5,00,000 as per disaster relief norms,” Siddaramaiah, former chief minister and leader of the opposition said in a post on Twitter on Monday.According to official government data, there have been 32,913 deaths due to Covid-19 in Karnataka since March last year. There are at least 21 more dead that the government lists in its daily bulletin as deaths due to non-Covid reasons. The state government has ordered for a death audit of Covid-19 but there has been little progress on the same so far, people aware of the developments said.The announcement made on Monday comes at a time when Yediyurappa is trying to salvage the Covid-19 health crisis, which he is accused of having sidestepped to prioritize politics.Yediyurappa said that this move to compensate poor families is likely to be the first such attempt anywhere in the country.The 78-year-old has been at the receiving end of sharp criticism from all quarters, including members from his own government and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) who have accused the chief minister of mishandling the health crisis in the southern state.Yediyurappa has so far announced ₹2,100 crore financial package during the first wave and around ₹1,750 crore in two parts during the second wave. The chief minister also held a meeting to check the state’s finances on Monday.Yediyurappa said that despite the hardships in funds, the state has announced compensation which he said meant that among the others, Karnataka’s financial situation is in much better shape.However, the financial assistance announced by Yediyurappa has come under criticism as activists, trade union, unorganised workers and opposition parties have called it “inadequate” which was unlikely to provide any relief.Though Yediyurappa has seen rising demands for his removal from within his own partymen, the chief minister is fortifying his chair ahead of the BJP’s general secretary’s visit, scheduled on Wednesday.Arun Singh, Rajya Sabha member and BJP’s national general secretary incharge of Karnataka, had earlier dismissed speculation when he said that Yediyurappa will continue as the chief minister, which had bolstered the 78-year-old.Legislators within the BJP have now formed sides for and against Yediyurappa, widening the growing differences within the saffron outfit and denting its chances of consolidating its powers ahead of the 2023 assembly elections in Karnataka.Arvind Bellad, a two-time BJP legislator has been camping in Delhi for the past three days and met senior leaders of the party in the nation’s capital ahead of Singh’s visit.Singh is expected to meet all legislators who have raised grievances against the chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/rs-1-lakh-for-k-taka-families-that-lost-earning-member-to-virus-101623696885318.html
15-06-2021||Bangalore||CM pulls up civic agencies for failing to finish pending road work during lockdown||Bengaluru: Even as Bengaluru went into a lockdown, the Karnataka government allowed civic works and the industries remain functional in a bid to ensure pending civic works in the city are completed during the period. However, a review meeting conducted by Karnataka chief minister last week revealed that most of the civic projects in the city are behind schedule. During the review meeting held on June 11, chief minister BS Yediyurappa pulled up the city civic body officials. “Though I have instructed the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to complete the 27 smart city projects by May 31 before the monsoon sets in, the works are incomplete, as evident from piles of mud and craters on both sides of the roads,” he said at a review meeting with civic officials. As the southwest monsoon has arrived and is set to intensify in the ensuing weeks, the chief minister sought a reply from BBMP commissioner Gaurav Gupta by when the pending works would be completed. “I have daily observed that the incomplete road works in the city’s central business district are a hindrance to the public and for VIP movement. They are a hurdle for the movement of people and vehicles,” he said. The smart city projects chief engineer, however, assured him that the works would be completed by June 30. The chief minister however said that he has given a priority list to the BBMP following his inspections in February, March. Expressing his disappointment over the slow progress of the projects, CM asked these projects to be completed within the deadline. Yediyurappa also reviewed the expansion of the metro rail network across the city and the suburban train service project, which have been delayed due to the lockdown. The second phase of the metro rail project is under construction to extend the service by 66 km at a cost of ₹33,070 crore. “As the metro service cannot become profitable only through fare collection, commercial spaces along its lines and stations should be utilised to generate income,” Yediyurappa told the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd officials. However, a BBMP official said that the lack of contract workers has delayed construction works. “Even though the government allowed the construction work to continue, as soon as the lockdown was announced several migrant workers left the city. There was a shortage of workers across the state, and this slowed down work. The numbers are slowly coming back now, and we hope to finish the work in time,” said the official who didn’t want to be named. Meanwhile, the Bengaluru police raised the matter of delay in construction works in the city with the chief minister. A senior officer said that since several industries are opening up in phase one of the unlock, the unfinished civic work will result in slow-moving of traffic. “In several areas, our officers had to worksites to get material removed from the road. But since a large portion of the road is occupied by this work, it is difficult to manage the traffic,” said a senior traffic police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/cm-pulls-up-civic-agencies-for-failing-to-finish-pending-road-work-during-lockdown-101623696827297.html
15-06-2021||Lucknow||Aggressive monsoon reaches UP, mid-June records excess rainfall||: Heavy rainfall on Monday across Uttar Pradesh caused by the arrival of monsoon resulted in101% excess rainfall in the state till mid-June, said state MeT department officials. The state recorded 47.9 mm rainfall between June 1 and June 14 which is more than double than the normal rainfall of 23.8 mm during the same period. Most of the rains were recorded in the last 72 hours with the arrival of Monsoon. “Uttar Pradesh recorded 12.6 mm rainfall on Monday which is 471% more than normal 2.2 mm expected. This shows that the Southwest monsoon has covered all parts of the state in a short duration contributing to the excess rainfall,” said JP Gupta, director, state MeT department. Forty of the 75 districts of Uttar Pradesh recorded rains in the last 24 hours. 17 districts received excess, five districts recorded normal rains and 13 districts received slightly deficient rainfall during the period. “All districts of Uttar Pradesh received rainfall between Saturday night and Monday evening. While majority of districts received excess rains, only a few districts of Bundelkhand and Agra region recorded less than normal rainfall,” said Gupta. As per IMD forecast, the state is expected to receive more rains in next 48 hours. “The rainfall will be scattered across the state. However, East and central UP districts will receive above average rainfall,” said Gupta. Considering this, the state government has put districts administration on alert advising them to take measures to prevent damage caused by heavy rains. In districts prone to flooding following rains, teams of district and state disaster management committees have been put on standby. While the arrival of monsoon resulted in problems of water logging in cities, they provided a welcome relief to farmers in the rural areas. The rains will benefit farmers by aiding them in Kharif cropping. Paddy is the major Kharif crop which is sown in Uttar Pradesh. Beside paddy the rain will also benefit sugarcane and maize farmers. The rains also provided relief form scorching temperature across the state with mercury plummeting over 8 to 10 degrees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/aggressive-monsoon-reaches-up-mid-june-records-excess-rainfall-101623696105213.html
15-06-2021||Chandigarh||SAD bets on BSP’s Dalit vote bank to boost poll prospects||In an alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Shiromani Akali Dal is betting on 2,500-10,000 votes that the Mayawati-led party used to get in the previous Punjab assembly polls as a game changer in the 2022 elections. In the 2017 assembly elections, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) contested on 111 seats and managed a vote share of 1.59%. Finding its utility, top leaders in the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) are hopeful that the newly stitched alliance will boost the party’s beleaguered poll prospects by consolidating the Dalit vote bank, which comprises one-third of the state electorate. Also Read: SAD lost core vote bank, even BSP alliance futile, says Dhindsa“In 2017, we lost at least 20 seats by a margin of less than 1,000 votes. In case we were in an alliance with the BSP, we could have been in a much stronger position,” said a SAD leader, who did not wish to be named.The tactical change comes after the party lost its traditional Panthic vote bank post sacrilege incidents in 2015, and also lost the peasantry support for backing the Centre’s contentious farm laws in 2020 even as it took a U-turn later.Having severed ties with its old ally Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the farm issue, the Akali Dal started attempts to touch base with the BSP to boost its poll prospects. Of the 20 seats given to the BSP as an alliance arrangement, 12 were with the BJP during its alliance with the SAD. In all, the saffron party used to contest on 23 seats and the SAD on the remaining 94 out of the total 117 assembly seats in the state. “In Punjab, the government can be formed with 35-40% vote share, and if it’s a triangular fight, even a lesser number of votes can turn political fortunes, provided the polls are contested intelligently,” said BSP’s Punjab president Jasvir Singh Garhi, hoping for a pro-coalition buildup when the state goes for the polls early next year. “Since our party came into existence 37 years ago in 1984, we have had aspirations to be part of the government in the state as our founder Kanshi Ram hails from here,” he said. Seats of BSP’s choice in SAD strongholds Most of the 20 seats given to the BSP are of its choice, even as the SAD performed well on them in 2017, said SAD general secretary Pawan Tinu, who represents the Adampur seat and was in the BSP in the late 1990s. Tinu said the Doaba region has 44% Dalit population (against 32% in the state), and out of the eight seats given to the BSP in this belt, three — Kartarpur, Jalandhar West and Phagwara — are reserved for scheduled caste candidates. Also read: Mayawati reacts to SAD-BSP alliance in Punjab, calls it a ‘historic step’“These seats are our party’s stronghold; still we agreed to hand them over to our new alliance partner to boost the morale of Bahujan Samaj. I have been in the BSP and understand their psyche. They vote en masse when they can see that the candidate will win; otherwise, the votes get divided,” said Tinu, hoping that the BSP will get a vote share of 16% as it got in the Lok Sabha polls of 1996 that it contested in alliance with the SAD and jointly won 11 out of 13 seats. The MLA said that other seats in the SAD’s stronghold, such as Anandpur Sahib, Chamkaur sahib, Mohali and Tanda, have also been allotted to the BSP. Sukhbir pacifies agitated party workers SAD president Sukhbir Badal on Monday met party leaders, workers and halqa in-charges of Nawanshahr, Payal, Bassi Pathana, Kartarpur and Tanda, which have been given to the BSP. As some questioned the logic of allotting seats to the BSP when it has failed to win on any of them in the past elections, Sukhbir and party secretary general Balwinder Singh Bhunder pacified them and told them to support the BSP nominees. Also Read: Jakhar terms SAD-BSP alliance opportunistic tie-upThe BJP used to contest on 12 seats given to the BSP — Sujanpur, Bhoa, Pathankot, Amritsar North, Amritsar Central, Phagwara, Jalandhar West, Jalandhar North, Dasuya, Hoshiarpur City, Anandpur Sahib and Ludhiana North — and the remaining eight — Kartarpur, Mohali, Tanda, Chamkaur Sahib, Bassi Pathana, Mehal Kalan, Nawanshahr and Payal — were with the SAD. These seats are spread across the state: BSP stronghold Doaba (8), Majha (5) and Malwa (7). Talks on with Left as well SAD secretary general Balwinder Singh confirmed that the party is also in talks with the left-wing parties CPI and CPI (M) for a pre-poll alliance. “We are in talks with both the parties and there are positive signals. We are hopeful of a positive result shortly,” he said. According to Bhunder, the Left has a strong support base in Sangrur, Barnala and Mansa, which needs to be channelised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-bets-on-bsp-s-dalit-vote-bank-to-boost-poll-prospects-101623695926309.html

However, Sharma allayed these apprehensions and said the exercise aimed at checking erosion of iconic ghats by balancing the water flow of the river.Sharma reiterated that there will be no change in the shape of Ganga. “It will remain the same,” he emphasized and added that experts had been expressing concern that the ghats were getting hollow due to the flow of the Ganga.“This hollowness is causing erosion at the ghats, and experts had suggested that this (erosion) could be prevented by developing a bypass channel to balancing the flow of the Ganga. This was done after testing by the technical experts of the irrigation department,” he said.The 5.3-kilometer-long bypass channel project is worth over ₹11 crore, officials said.The bypass channel is 45 meter wide and 6 meter deep. It has been designed in such a way that 25 percent water of the river water in over five-kilometer-long stretch will flow through it. “This will ease pressure on the ghats and will stop the erosion. The work on the project started in March and is likely to be completed in next couple of days,” Sharma said. Sharma said that Assi nullah (drain) won’t fall in river Ganga. “The wish of the people of Kashi will be fulfilled soon,” he said.The DM also inspected pumping station at Nagwa from where the sewage of Assi nullah will be sent to STP Ramna.During inspection, Sharma instructed the engineer of Essel Infra to complete the construction work of retaining wall in fifteen days to tap the drain. “With the completion of this work, the Ganga water in Varanasi will be really pure, which people were waiting for decades,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bypass-channel-won-t-affect-the-shape-of-the-river-kashi-dm-101623695925143.html

The function was to take place at the site of an old mosque that is being rebuilt, but it rained on Sunday. Consequently, the ceremony was shifted to the local gurdwara, and village sarpanch Pala Singh laid the foundation stone.“There are just five Muslim families in the village and we are trying to rebuild the mosque. As it started raining, we immediately contacted the gurdwara committee and it welcomed us. It is a fine example of love and brotherhood,” said Kanwar Khan, 33, a local.Also read: Sikh family donates ancestral land to build mosqueThe sarpanch said all village residents took part in the ceremony and made donations to construct the mosque. Even tea and jalebis were served. “There used to be a mosque in the village, which had collapsed many years ago. We all wanted to rebuild it at the same site. Though the Muslims are in a minority in the village, we all live like a family,” he said.Naib Shahi Imam Maulana Usman Rehmani Ludhianavi, a Muslim cleric, said: “This day will be written in golden letters in history. A true Sikh and a true Muslim will never harm anyone. Serving humanity and guarding the truth are actual teachings of our Gurus.”Last week, a Sikh family had donated its ancestral land to build a mosque at the centre of a village in Punjab’s Malerkotla district.

The figure crossed 3 lakh till June 13.“Of the 798 people who died due to Covid in Srinagar, 98% were not vaccinated. This goes to show that vaccination is a protection against complications and death,” the body stated.It said that of the 15,000 healthcare and 50,000 frontline government staff who received both doses of vaccine after February 2021, none developed Covid pneumonia and no one died or had any vaccine reaction.“If we compare it to last year, 15 health staff members died because of Covid. So, the effectiveness of vaccination, as a means of protection from the virus, is well established,” it said.MMU said the reluctance was “unreasonable” and needed to be shunned by one and all.“This is imperative so that normal life in terms of business, education, religion, travel that has been severely curtailed by the pandemic is resumed, and the population of the valley is well protected (and prepared) for a possible third wave,” it said.Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who is under house detention, urged the people to get vaccinated as soon as possible and follow the SOPs by wearing masks and maintaining social distance.“By the grace of almighty we will overcome this pandemic, be protected from it and resume our normal life activities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/religious-body-urges-srinagar-residents-to-get-covid-jabs-101623695745796.html

As the cases and deaths have now ebbed, the government has exempted travellers from carrying RT-PCR negative report to enter the state.Over the weekend, more than 1,200 vehicles entered at the interstate border at Parwanoo, officials said. Similarly, rush was witnessed at other state entry points, including Bilaspur, Mehatpur in Una and Kandwal barrier of Kangra district.The hotel occupancy in Shimla has risen to 30% from zero. “The year was terrible for the industry so far as we were unable to meet even capital expenses. We hope that the ‘unlock’ will revive the sector,” said Sanjay Sood, president of Shimla Hotel and Restaurateurs’ Association.However, tourist footfall was insignificant at the hill-stations of Dharmashala and Dalhousie on the first day of unlock. Vijay Inder Karan, a hotelier from Dharamshala, said they are hoping that the business will pick up in the coming days.Karan said tourists were keen to come to the hill-stations, but maximum queries are for homestays or secluded properties. Hotels have few online bookings or walk-ins, he said, suggesting that tourists should prefer places with better health infrastructure like Shimla and Kangra.Follow guidelines, say police The state police in a press statement advised the tourists to wear masks, practice social distancing and follow other Covid-related guidelines issued by the Himachal government. It said that first-time offenders will be fined ₹500 under sections 114 and 115 of the HP Police Act, 2007.Repeat offenders may be arrested, sent to court and may face up to eight days imprisonment or fine of ₹5,000 or both. “Therefore, all tourists are requested to kindly follow all Covid guidelines in letter and spirit during their stay in HP,” said police.Confusion at Mehatpur border To their dismay, tourists without Covid test reports were sent to home quarantine by the police at the Mehatpur border in Una district.The police personnel deployed at the checkpost said they were yet to receive fresh orders from the nodal officer concerned. “We are checking RT-PCR reports of the people coming to stay in Una district as we haven’t received orders against it,” said a cop on duty at Mehatpur.He said those who don’t have Covid-19 report or are not vaccinated are being sent to home quarantine.Rohtang Pass opens With Manali buzzing with tourists, the local administration has opened the Rohtang Pass.As per the arrangements, tourists will be allowed to visit Rohtang Pass with a permit. The offline permits, costing ₹550 each, can be obtained at Manali. However, online permits have not been started. A maximum 1,200 vehicles — 800 petrol and 400 diesel vehicles — will be allowed towards the pass per day.President of Manali Hotel Association Anoop Thakur welcomed the administration’s decision to open the Rohtang, a major tourist destination. He said it would help the ailing tourism industry get back on the track.Manali sub-divisional magistrate Raman Gharsangi said the administration has made complete arrangements at the Gulaba barrier. He said the tourists will have to comply with Covid guidelines and only local taxis will be allowed for Rohtang visit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tourists-breathe-life-into-hospitality-sector-as-himachal-unlocks-101623695627659.html

But till now, the police haven’t been able to locate the flat or its owner who had a case of extortion of against him in Gurugram. Police suspect the stolen items could be contraband as no one had reported the theft even though it had happened last year.“The mastermind of the theft, Gopal, who knew the house they were targeting is yet to be arrested. The robbers in custody are not aware of the exact details. The society is also unable to retrieve the flat details and share them with us. We are working on tracing the house,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Kumar Ranvijay Singh.Police identified the flat owner as a senior advocate who, along with his father, is outside the country. The family was not cooperating with the investigation, police had said.“There is a probability that Gopal may have planted a tenant in the house to gather information about the target after which the robbery was planned. We have a few leads that we are working on. Appropriate action will be taken soon,” said the official.The Noida police commissionerate has written letters to the income tax department and the enforcement directorate as well for an investigation in the matter of this being unreported income or black money.“Once we have details about the flat, we will share them as well with the respective agencies for further probe,” said DCP, Rajesh S.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/four-days-on-noida-police-yet-to-trace-flat-from-where-gold-biscuits-were-stolen-101623695445814.html
15-06-2021||Noida||Noida may have to wait longer for monsoon rain||Noida: The south-west monsoon which was likely to arrive by Tuesday — a fortnight ahead of its usual schedule in the region — has slowed down even as the weather department speculates its new tentative arrival date.Earlier, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had forecast that the south-west monsoon would hit the region by June 15. However, as rainfall activities in western Uttar Pradesh were delayed, the IMD speculated that there is a possibility that the monsoon is likely to get delayed by a few days.“The monsoon has slowed down between eastern and western Uttar Pradesh. Apart from a few isolated places in West UP there is no rainfall activity there. We are still speculating the new arrival date of the monsoon arrival in NCR. If there is some weather activity on Tuesday then we can confirm a date; it may delayed by three to four days,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.He added that the generally the monsoon, after traversing through Bihar, Eastern Uttar Pradesh, Western UP, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, enters the NCR via Punjab and Haryana.“This is a general trend and not a fixed route. This time, the east UP and Himalayan states of Uttrakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir, the northern part of Punjab, and Haryana had already received the monsoon. So it’s slowed between Eastern and Western UP. We will be in better position to forecast based on the activities of the next few days,” Srivastav added.As a ripple effect of the slowing progression of the monsoon, the mercury soared in several areas of the National Capital Region, including Noida. On Monday, the daytime temperature in Noida soared by three degrees Celsius (°C).According to the IMD, Noida saw a maximum and minimum temperature of 36.6°C and 25.7°C, respectively, on Monday against 33.9°C and 25.7°C a day earlier. At the Safdarjung observatory, considered an average for the NCR, the mercury was recorded at 38.6°C and 25.5°C.The Southwest monsoon hits the region late June, with 65cm (long period average) of rainfall expected between June 1 and September 30, considered normal for NCR (average based on old records). Last year, however, the region received 57.6 cm of rainfall which was about 88% of long period average (LPA). For the entire country, the IMD has forecast the southwest monsoon to be normal — 96 to 104% of LPA, which is 88cm.Last year, the monsoon arrived in NCR on June 25, which according to the IMD, was the first time in the past four years it came earlier than usual. Usually, monsoon rains arrives on June 29 in this part of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-may-have-to-wait-longer-for-monsoon-rain-101623695445184.html
15-06-2021||Pune||Unfinished gateway at Vetal Baba chowk makes commuting a nightmare for Pune residents||PUNE It is a daily nightmare for thousands of residents from Narhe, to commute past the main Vetal Baba chowk in the area. A gateway (Kaman) has been under construction for the last four months and the debris and construction material is now eating up valuable road space. With the monsoon officially here, vehicles have to use a path off the main road, with two-wheelers prone to skidding on water or crashing into potholes. “For the last four months this construction of the Kaman is going on at the main Vetal Baba chowk in Narhe, which comes under the Narhe gram panchayat. The work should have been completed within a couple of months. It has blocked the entire main road. Construction material and other debris needs to be removed immediately,” said Keshav Iyer, a resident of Narhe. Another resident, Priti Shintre said, “Last week, I slipped on the side road in the water. If the road under the Kaman is cleared, then vehicles can pass easily and there will be no traffic jams. Every day in the evening rush hours, there are long queues of vehicles just to pass Vetal Baba chowk.” Narhe is one of the villages which has merged into the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits, though the handover has not been finished yet. There are 10 small and big educational institutes in this area and over 100 residential housing projects. Most of the students live in private hostels and as paying guests, while many snack centres and hotels have come up to cater students. B R Gawade, gram sevak of the Narhe gram panchayat said, “The work is coming to an end now. It was started by a private firm in the memory of one of their family members who passed away. We will clear the road clear as soon as possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/unfinished-gateway-at-vetal-baba-chowk-makes-commuting-a-nightmare-for-narhe-residents-101623695265146.html

Owners and operators of the private classes, however, claim that parents are not willing to send their children for offline classes, due to a fear of Covid infection. Several discounts are currently on offer, especially for students appearing for CETs and for those in Class 11 and above. “We have started classes for students and initially we are urging parents to allow students to join the offline classes. Around 60 per cent of the parents are not willing to send their children to class. So it won’t be completely offline, we are going to have online classes as well. For class 10 students who are going to give the new CET exams for admission to Class 11, our classes will be free. But, till we get the syllabus of this CET exam, classes will not be started,” said Prof Kedar Takalkar, founder director of Takalkar Classes. Another private class owner, Prof Sandeep Bendre, said, “We take from Class 5 to Class 12 for all subjects. Students are already overburdened by online classes. It is good that private offline classes are allowed. We will call our students in batches on alternate days. Teachers will take the same topic and subject for two days for separate batches”Payal Khatri, a parent, said, “My daughter has gone to Class 9 this year and her school is going to start from June 15. Along with the online school classes, we are planning for her to join private coaching classes for science and mathematics. We won’t send her immediately for physical classes and risk infection. We will see after couple of months as per the Covid situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-parents-reluctant-to-send-children-for-offline-coaching-classes-101623695205284.html
15-06-2021||Delhi||60-yr-old woman raped, killed in east Delhi; 1 held||The disrobed body of a 62-year-old woman, with visible signs of sexual assault, her throat slit and multiple stab wounds to her chest, abdomen and legs, was found at her rented home in east Delhi’s Dallupura village near Mayur Vihar Phase-3 on Sunday afternoon, the police said. Later in the evening, the police arrested her 30-year-old neighbour, whom the police said was the last person seen entering and leaving the woman’s house in the CCTV footage.Police said during his interrogation, he admitted that he sexually assaulted the elderly woman and later killed her to protect himself. The arrested man reportedly told the police that he was drunk at the time of the crime.The woman was a vegetable vendor and lived with her 33-year-old son, who works as a security guard in a private company in Noida, and a 13-year-old grandson, the police said. Since the case also involved sexual assault, the names of the dead woman, her son and grandson, the arrested man as well as the exact locality where they live have been withheld to protect her identity, the police said.“Through technical investigation and inputs received from our informants and locals, we arrested the suspect within four to five hours of the crime. Prime facie, it appears to be a case of sexual assault and murder. The autopsy is being conducted. Further charges would be added as per the findings of the autopsy,” said deputy commissioner of police (east) Priyanka Kashyap.Police said the crime was reported to them around 2pm on Sunday, after the elderly woman’s son returned home after work, and found his mother’s body in their single room rented accommodation on the ground floor. He raised the alarm and a neighbour informed the police.Her son said a sickle was used to slit her throat while a knife was used to stab her. Both weapons were recovered from the scene of crime. “The body was on the bed and the door ajar; the water tap in the kitchen was running, and vegetables were burning in a pan when I returned home,” he said.“The woman’s throat was slit and there were 8-10 stab wounds to her chest and abdomen. The condition in which the body was found pointed to sexual assault. The body was later shifted to a government hospital mortuary for autopsy,” said a senior police officer, adding that a case of murder was registered and investigation was launched.During the investigation, the officer said statements of the woman’s son and grandson were recorded. Her son told the police that he left for work in the morning while she and the grandson went to sell vegetables from a shop in the neighbourhood. The woman’s grandson told the police that around noon, his grandmother left for home to cook lunch. Around 2pm, the woman’s son returned home and discovered her body, the police said.As there were no signs of a forced entry into the house, the police suspected the role of someone known to the woman. They inquired with locals and also scanned the CCTV cameras installed around the woman’s house. In one of the cameras, the suspect was seen entering the house around 1pm and leaving around 1.30pm, the police said.“The beat officers showed the suspect’s image to locals who identified him. The suspect was arrested and interrogated during which he admitted to the crime,” the officer quoted above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/elderly-woman-sexually-assaulted-and-stabbed-to-death-in-east-delhi-neighbour-arrested-101623694366346.html
15-06-2021||Delhi||Monsoon arrival to take ‘a few days’ more in Delhi||Delhi residents may have to wait a little longer before monsoon finally hits the national capital as its progress -- which was ahead of its typical schedule -- has slowed down over western Uttar Pradesh, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said in a fresh forecast on Monday.However, IMD said that parts of the city are expected to receive light, patchy rain on Tuesday, which might bring down the temperature by 1-2°C though it will increase the humidity levels.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that as opposed to the earlier forecast, which predicted rain from Tuesday, rainfall activity is yet to intensify in western UP. “We have received rain in eastern UP, but it is yet to cover western UP. This might delay the monsoon by a few days in Delhi. We are not committing on a date yet, but we are observing the progress,” Srivastava said.On Friday, IMD announced that monsoon will hit Delhi by June 15, almost 12-13 days ahead of schedule. Further, on Sunday, in a fresh update, Met officials announced that there was a possibility of further advancement of monsoon by around 48 hours, indicating that monsoon showers will start in the Capital from Tuesday.Senior IMD officials attributed this to the formation of a low-pressure area over the northern Bay of Bengal. According to Met officials, when a low-pressure area is formed on the onset of monsoon, it creates conducive conditions for its advancement.On Monday, the maximum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official marker of the city, was 38.6°C, a notch below what is considered normal for this time of the year. The minimum temperature here was 25.5°C, three degrees below normal.At the Palam observatory, the maximum temperature was 38.7°C, while the minimum temperature was 25.9°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/monsoon-progress-slowed-down-delayed-by-a-few-days-says-met-dept-101623694365202.html
15-06-2021||Delhi||Sisodia reviews two projects to develop govt schools as community schools||In order to track the progress and development of each student of Delhi government schools, to bring about “one-to-one mapping”, and to develop public schools as community schools, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Monday reviewed two key initiatives by the education department, a mentorship programme and the parent outreach programme.While the Youth For Education (YFE) programme is a voluntary initiative, wherein students pursuing their higher education, working professionals and entrepreneurs may mentor students in Delhi government schools, the Parent Outreach programme aims to build a network of school management committee (SMC) members and ”school mitras” to help other parents.As a part of its pilot phase, the YFE initiative had roped in around 4,000 mentors this March for giving career guidance to students of 46 schools in east and south-east Delhi. As a part of the second phase, the state education department plans to mobilise about two lakh mentors for around 5.5 lakh class 10 and 12 students of Delhi government schools with each mentor guiding about two to four students.Sisodia said the government had introduced these programmes in an effort to keep track of the over 16 lakh students enrolled in Delhi government schools. “When we look at how education is imparted in high-performing nations abroad, we see that the practice of one-to-one marking is used. Our Delhi government school teachers who visited Finland or Cambridge University also mentioned the same. One-to-one mapping of each child and understanding their individual profile were practices that our teachers commended but they expressed concerns regarding the scale in Delhi,” the education minister said on Monday.Pointing to the generation gap between children and parents, Sisodia said it was often difficult for children to find someone attuned to their interests and the best way to help them was to connect them with those who have graduated recently.The education minister also asked heads of schools to form an alumni group in schools and encourage “localised mentoring.”“A child might think (s)he wants to get into acting or music or become a police personnel, but our teachers don’t have the bandwidth for handholding every child. However, if we have mentors attached to these children, mentors would be able to talk and guide them, and help them get jobs. We made it happen with 600 students and mentors and they are quite happy. These mentors have become an emotional support for these children,” Sisodia said.As a part of the parent outreach programme, 560 SMC members have been trained so far along with 41 heads of schools on how to engage in different school activities and connect with the larger school community. Continuing its focus on involving parents in the education of their children, the state government will now work towards building a “supportive environment” and “network of parents”, the minister said.“The parent outreach programme has been designed with the idea to make changes in how communication takes place between schools, children and parents. The SMC parent network can be used for establishing a better connect by involving the parent community in school activities,” he said.Awadhesh Kumar Jha, head of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Sector-8 Rohini, said, “We had taken up both programmes during its pilot phase itself. The parent outreach programme particularly helped us in staying connected to several students during the pandemic. We had provided the school mitras with a list of contact numbers of students following which they reached out to students and their families and brought their problems, if any, to us. It helped us address student concerns. Similarly, connecting our students to those studying technical courses in higher education institutes has inspired our female students to dream bigger.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sisodia-reviews-progress-of-two-projects-to-develop-govt-schools-as-community-schools-101623694306378.html
15-06-2021||Delhi||Restaurants reopen with a mouthful of caution, footfall low at Delhi malls||Several people stepped out cautiously for outings at malls and restaurants across the city as dine-in services reopened after nearly two months on Monday.As part of the unlock process, all shops in malls were allowed to run from 10 am to 8 pm from Monday. Restaurants too were also allowed to open their doors for dine-in patrons, restricted to 50% seating capacity to ensure physical distancing, while salons and barber shops also catered to customers from Monday.While eateries at some of the popular malls in Saket and Vasant Kunj saw people eating out, footfall at other places remained thin. A mall located at Andrews Ganj wore a largely deserted look with only a handful of people visiting the premises for shopping.Among the visitors at a Saket mall were Pulkit Sehgal (31), a businessman, who had stepped out with his wife and toddler “for lunch after a long time”. “I decided to step out for an outing since malls are reopening fully for the first time. This also happens to be the first mall outing with my 19-month-old child,” said Sehgal. “We have started going out since we recovered from Covid a few months ago. We are banking on antibodies and have also received the first dose of the vaccine,” said Sehgal.Unnati Joshi (28), another visitor, said that she had came to the mall for a “long-pending lunch outing with family”. “After months of staying inside, we felt the need to get a breather. We are following the SOPs and Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said Joshi.Ajay Upadhyaya, the manager of Sattvik restaurant, Saket, said the restaurant had seen a good crowd on Monday. “We saw a good response. Until last week, we were offering only takeaway services. It’s good to see people back. If the government expands the timings, our business will bounce back to normal within a month,” said Upadhyaya.Sandeep Tanwar, general manager-operations at Andrea’s Eatery in Saket, said that the restaurant had seen nearly 50% occupancy on Monday, adding that he expected it to increase with the gradual reopening. “I think a slow and steady approach to reopening will work. We need to prioritise safety as well,” said Tanwar.Besides restaurants, there were many others who stepped out for retail therapy. Megha Kapoor (51), a visitor at Select Citywalk in Saket, said that she had come to buy essentials. “Compared to pre-lockdown months, the malls are largely deserted. I have been going out only to buying important things, not for pleasure or recreation. It’s too early to do it that,” said Kapoor.Shopkeepers at malls said that while the crowd was good for the first day of reopening, it might take some time for business to bounce back.“While people have started returning slowly, the footfall isn’t significant and it might take a while for it to return to normal. We can only wait and watch as there is uncertainty. Last time, we were hoping for business to bounce back but before that could happen, lockdown was imposed again,” said a vendor of a gadget kiosk at a South Delhi mall, who did not wish to be named.Gajendra, the manager of a food kiosk in a Saket mall, said that a majority of business was taking place through online orders now as “people are still stepping out cautiously“.Not all restaurants across the city reopened on Monday as they were making changes to adhere to new guidelines.SN Kaushal, senior manager of Kwality restaurant at Connaught Place, said that the restaurant had been shut for the past two months and would reopen in two-three days. “We are undertaking cleaning and sanitisation until then, besides ensuring that our staff members get vaccinated before they come back,” said Kaushal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/unlock-delhi-malls-restaurants-reopen-after-two-months-101623694307063.html
15-06-2021||Delhi||ASI-protected monuments and museums to reopen from June 16||The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) on Monday said all centrally protected monuments, sites, and museums across the country will reopen for visitors from June 16. In the wake of rising Covid-19 cases, the ASI closed all monuments and museums under its care on April 15.“Considering the prevailing situation, now, it has been decided that all centrally-protected monuments, sites, and museums (under ASI) shall be reopened from 16.06.2021 (Wednesday),” the central body said in an order on Monday. The opening, however, shall be in strict compliance with orders issued by state/district disaster management authorities, the order added.Delhi has over 70 monuments under ASI, including Red Fort, Humayun’s Tomb, Qutub’s Minar and Purana Qila.An ASI official, who did not wish to be named, said the order announcing reopening of the monuments should be read in conjunction with orders issued by the local administration. “From our end, the monuments are open. The rules of various district administrations will determine the reopening of heritage buildings in different cities,” said the official.Ratish Nanda, CEO of Aga Khan Trust for Culture India, said monuments and public parks are relatively safer spaces that can be reopened. “With the movement of people now being allowed in Delhi, it makes sense to open the safer spaces --- monuments and public parks. It is also important for the mental and physical well-being of Delhi citizens. It’s great that the ASI has pro-actively heeded a major demand of Delhi’s people. Hope parks are permitted to open immediately as well,” said Nanda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/asiprotected-monuments-and-museums-to-reopen-from-june-16-101623694305057.html
15-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi residents, docs say parks should reopen||Residents and experts have questioned the continued closure of public parks even as Delhi has moved a step closer to reopen completely after a lockdown was imposed on April 19 with the Capital slipping into its worst phase of Covid-19 pandemic.From Monday, the Delhi government has allowed malls, markets and restaurants to reopen, prompting questions as to why big parks were not being allowed with even experts suggesting that they were far safer than closed, indoor spaces with regard to the transmission of infection.Vedant Gidra, 15, a resident of Delhi’s Shalimar Bagh, has not visited a park since the pandemic struck last year. The Class 11 student said he used to spend hours playing outdoors in the park with friends before the pandemic. He said that the government could lift restrictions on the park since they were important for recreation. “Earlier, I used to spend a lot of time playing outdoors. The government should consider reopening the parks just like other places are open now. If not for the whole day, parks should be open to visitors during the morning and evening hours for walks and recreation,” said Gidra.Last month, the Union government’s principal scientific adviser K Vijay Raghavan’s office had issued a new set of guidelines to combat the pandemic. According to the document, titled “Stop the Transmission, Crush the Pandemic”, infection transmission risk is lower in outdoor areas, as virus particles get dispersed quickly.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital, said public parks should have been reopened much earlier. “Parks should have been reopened when the government first started easing restrictions. Rather, they shouldn’t have been closed in the first place. People visit parks for walks and exercise which is essential to remain fit,” said Kishore. He said the reopening of parks was also crucial for children who had been stuck at home for a very long time. “Children are fed up now. It is affecting their physical and mental development,” said Kishore.Dr Rahul Nagpal, director, Pediatric and Neonatology at Fortis Hospital Vasant Kunj, said if everything else was reopening, there was no reason as to why parks couldn’t be reopened. “We all know that the concentration of the virus cannot be so much outside as compared to what it is inside. In my personal opinion, I don’t see any reason for keeping the parks locked,” said Nagpal. He said parks could be reopened provided that people stuck to proper distancing and wear masks along with other Covid-appropriate habits.Resident welfare associations, however, demanded that parks should be opened at least in the morning and evening hours.Major (retd) Ranjit Singh, president of Defence Colony RWA, said keeping the parks closed does not make sense since people are already visiting malls and markets. “The timing can be fixed. People could be allowed to visit the parks during the morning and evening hours. Due to the heat, they are unlikely to visit during the day anyway,” said Singh.Sanjay Rana, president, Greater Kailash-II RWA, said parks offer a better scope for distancing than markets. “If the markets and malls are open, parks can be opened too. Some people have a habit of visiting parks daily. They find it difficult to cope up, if they can’t continue their routine. Parks at least have space for distancing,” said Rana.Reena Ramachandran, 80, a Saket resident, said she has stopped going for a morning walk since the lockdown was imposed. She said that while her daily routine had changed, she was taking precautions. “There might be some merit if the government has decided to keep parks closed till now. While I used to go for morning walk prior to the lockdown, I am avoiding public places,” said Ramachandran.Om Parkash, assistant information officer, New Delhi Municipal Council, said parks across the city were closed in line with DDMA orders. “Parks are closed as per the government directive. However, there are some parks that do not have gates where people could still be seen. Our employees also visit the parks for maintenance but they remain closed to the public,” said Parkash.A senior DDMA official said they will review the situation next week. “We have assessed the situation. We felt at this point it would be unsafe to open public parks. They may witness huge gatherings. We will assess the situation again next week,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/if-malls-can-open-why-not-parks-residents-question-continued-closure-of-parks-in-capital-101623694186444.html
15-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt approves single window process for setting up EV chargers||The Delhi government on Monday approved a single window process for hassle-free installation of electric vehicle chargers in private and semi-public spaces, the government said in a press statement.“Delhi will soon get an innovative, single-window process for installation of slow and fast EV chargers. The decision was taken at the charging infrastructure working group to empanel vendors through discoms for smooth roll-out of EV chargers in private and semi-public places,” said Jasmine Shah, vice-chairperson of Dialogue and Development Commission (DDC), a think tank of the Delhi government.“We received requests from many apartment societies, residents, welfare associations, mall owners, etc. evincing interest to install EV chargers but we did not know how to go about it. Today, the Delhi government has approved an innovative, single-window process for quick and efficient installation of EV chargers,” Shah said in a statement.“In line with the vision set by CM Arvind Kejriwal of making Delhi the EV capital of India, Delhi will soon be the only city in the world where anyone can get an EV charger installed, net of Delhi government subsidy,by making a single phone call or applying online. The single-window facility can be used for rapid installation of thousands of EV chargers at residential spaces like apartments and group housing societies, institutional buildings like hospitals and commercial spaces like malls and theatres,” the statement read.Delhi currently has around 9,000 registered electric vehicles, which include cars, two-wheelers and e-autorickshaws. Other than that, there are around 60,000 electric rickshaws operating in the city, government records showed. Also, there are currently 77 functional EV charging stations in the city.Last year, the Delhi government launched the EV policy which aims to ensure that in five years, 25% of all vehicles registered in national capital are e-vehicles. Declaring e-vehicles to be a part of the government’s long-term action plan to fight air pollution, the Delhi government had also launched a campaign, “Switch Delhi”, to get more and more people to switch over to electric vehicles from their current CNG or fossil fuel-based models.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-approves-single-window-process-for-setting-up-ev-chargers-101623694185736.html
15-06-2021||Delhi||Vendors heave a sigh of relief as weekly markets reopen in the Capital||Arvind Kumar meticulously arranged the products – plastic soap cases, shaving razors, small bathroom mirrors and combs of different size – in his makeshift shop as two government officials approached him and collected his swab samples for a Covid-19 test. Around 4pm, visitors started trickling in at the weekly bazaar in west Delhi’s Mundka which reopened on Monday.Weekly markets in the city were allowed to reopen, subject to a long list of conditions concerning location, space, capacity and random Covid-19 tests of vendors and customers, after eight weeks on Monday, according to the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) directions to scale down lockdown restrictions.“The last two months were difficult. Without any work, I had to go back to my village. I returned with my family last week and started visiting the labour chowk looking for daily wage work. But I hardly managed to get any. It is a relief that the government has allowed the weekly markets to open. We can open our shops again,” said Kumar.Yusuf Khan, a vendor at a weekly market in northeast Delhi’s Gokalpuri, said: “It is a major relief. Last year, the government had allowed weekly markets to resume functioning only after months of lockdown. This time we have been allowed to resume business in eight weeks. We will ensure that all regulations are strictly followed.”Among the restrictions are limiting opening of weekly markets to just one per day per week in each zone. “Only one authorised weekly market (upto the limit of 50% of the allowed vendors at a normal time) per day per zone… shall be allowed subject to the strict compliance of SOP and all instructions/ guidelines issued by government of India/ government of Delhi from time to time,” said the DDMA order.“No weekly market shall be allowed to function on roadsides. The weekly markets can be allowed to function at nearby suitable public and school grounds, where SOP/guidelines of DDMA can be strictly implemented. No unauthorised weekly market shall be allowed to function… RT-PCR/rapid antigen tests of vendors/customers of weekly markets shall be conducted on random basis by the district magistrate concerned regularly,” the DDMA order added.While Delhi has a total 12 municipal zones, indicating that only a maximum of 84 weekly markets will be allowed to open this week, as per Brijesh Goyal, president of the chamber of trade and industry, the Capital has around 2,700 weekly bazaars which collectively engage around 400,000 people in different roles -- vendors, suppliers, and labourers, among others.Weekly market associations, however, expressed confidence that restrictions will ease in the coming weeks. “It (the DDMA order) has come as a major relief. This week, only few big weekly markets are likely to receive permission to open under the given rules. But, we hope, in the coming weeks, the rules are further relaxed and more weekly markets are allowed to open. Vendors are in deep distress and they will strictly adhere to all Covid-19 regulations,” said Sanjay Kumar, a vendor and member of town vending committee in charge of a weekly market in the Yamuna embankment area in east Delhi.Dhanik Chand, vendor and member of town vending committee in charge of a weekly market in Mandawali locality, echoed similar opinions. “We hope more markets are allowed to open in the coming weeks even if under stricter enforcement,” he said.Delhi government officials said that weekly markets have been allowed to open on a “trial basis”. “The one market per day per municipal zone rule is likely to be further relaxed in few weeks if Covid-19 cases stay under control,” said a DDMA official.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s announcement on Sunday regarding the re-opening of weekly markets came as a major relief for tens of thousands of people who are associated with these markets scattered across the city, which specially cater to lower-income and middle-income group people, offering products ranging from soaps and utensils to toys and garments. Delhi has around 2,700 weekly bazaars which collectively engage around 400,000 people in different roles – vendors, suppliers, labourers, etc -- said Brijesh Goyal, president of chamber of trade and industry.In east Delhi’s Gandhi Nagar wholesale market, Akashdeep Balli pulled out a stack of neatly folded jeans from a shelf in his stall as a few eager customers asked him about the possibility of a stock clearance rebates. As Balli wholeheartedly agreed, his neighbouring stall owner barged in promising higher discounts in light of “a lockdown” which, he said, can be imposed “any time due another surge in Covid-19 cases in Delhi in the coming weeks”.The fear of a potential fifth wave is palpable, even though the government allowing shops in markets in the city to operate seven days of the week has come as a major relief, as against last week’s relaxation which allowed only 50% of shops to operate in a day.Devraj Baweja, general secretary of the confederation of Sadar Bazar traders’ association, said: “Traders have faced huge losses due to the pandemic. The market will take time to recover. We pray that another lockdown does not happen. We have to make sure that we strictly follow all safety measures.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vendors-heave-a-sigh-of-relief-as-weekly-markets-reopen-in-the-capital-101623694125106.html
15-06-2021||Chandigarh||SAD lost core vote bank, even BSP alliance futile: Parminder Dhindsa||Former Punjab finance minister Parminder Singh Dhindsa said on Monday that Shiromani Akali Dal has lost its traditional vote bank and even workers of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), with which it has forged an alliance, will not vote for it in the 2022 state assembly elections. “The SAD always took decisions against the interests of its core voters, including farmers and Panth. Even the BSP cadre will not vote in its favour as they are not happy with this opportunistic alliance,” said Dhindsa, who represents Lehra assembly segment and is a leader of the newly floated SAD (Sanyukt). Also Read: SAD bets on BSP’s Dalit vote bank to boost poll prospectsDhindsa said that though the Badal faction claims to represent the SAD, there is “nothing like Akalis” in their policies. “We will give Punjab the real Akali Dal,” he said. His father and Rajya Sabha member Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa floated SAD (Sanyukt) along with Ranjit Singh Brahmpura last month after the dissolution of SAD (Democratic) and SAD (Taksali). The senior Dhindsa is its president.To escalate party activities, Parminder Dhindsa kicked off a greenery drive by planting saplings at Mastuana Sahib, around 10 kilometers from Sangrur, on Monday, and announced that its youth cadre will run the drive across the state for one month in the memory of farmers who died during protests against the three contentious agriculture laws.Dhindsa said the party is still in talks with like-minded parties, even as Sukhpal Singh Khaira moved to the ruling Congress from the Aam Aadmi Party and the BSP forged an alliance with the SAD.“All avenues are always open in politics. We may go in alliance with anyone except Badals, Bharatiya Janata Party and Congress,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-lost-core-vote-bank-even-bsp-alliance-futile-parminder-dhindsa-101623676484900.html
15-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi aspires to become a 24*7 city. But it needs to ramp up infra and safety||The area around Jama Masjid in the Walled City transforms into a vibrant space after sunset during Ramzan with shops, eateries and street vendors open till the wee hours of the morning.“It is not just local residents, people from different parts of the city come here during Ramzan. It is a major tourist attraction, as people get to experience a completely different side of the city,” said Abu Sufiyan, a resident of old Delhi and founder of Purani Dilli Walo Ki Baatein (a cultural platform).Sufiyan said that even on regular days, the narrow lanes are bustling with activities as street vendors set up their food stalls after market hours. “People come with their families till late at night,” said Sufiyan.While there is a demand for night time activities, especially from a tourism point of view, the national Capital has very little to offer to those who want to enjoy and experience the city at night.Also Read | Delhi Metro to continue with 50% capacity, standing travel bannedFor years, ice-cream vendors at Rajpath, India Gate, a restaurant at Nizamuddin railway station and few roadside eateries have been some of the options for late night outings for the public at large, as most markets close by 9.30-10pm.The rationale of night economies Keeping pace with changing times, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has for the first time proposed a major change in the draft Master Plan of Delhi-2041 to promote night time economies and nightlife in the national Capital.This is in sync with the Delhi government’s decision last year to allow only high-tech and service industries in Delhi’s new industrial areas. The decision was aimed at reducing pollution levels in the city in the long run. The Union housing and urban affairs ministry issued a notification on October 29 last year in which the definition of industries was changed.A DDA official, who did not wish to be named, said, “The new developments will bring about a change in the way the city operates right now. World over, cities are moving today becoming 24-hour cities and this is a step in that direction.”Hitesh Vaidya, director National Institute of Urban Affairs (which has helped DDA in preparing the vision document), said, “Cities should consciously support night-time economies and active nightlife. This has several potential positives. It will support numerous economies that can thrive at night, for instance, cultural activities, certain industries, logistics, etc. thereby helping to stagger work timings and reduce congestion on roads. This will also substantially increase productive use of city resources by utilising city infrastructure throughout the day, resulting in higher economic output.”MPD-2041, the blueprint of city’s development in the next two decades, proposes development of nightlife circuits around cultural precincts, heritage areas, central business districts etc to provide the city a “vibrant nightlife”. It proposes for restaurants and commercial establishments to remain open 24x7. DDA officials said that this is a step towards making Delhi a “24-hour city”, just like London, Paris, New York, Amsterdam, among others.A second DDA official said that several states have started implementing the Model Shops and Establishments (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Services) Act, 2016, thereby allowing shops to open 24x7. “Indore, Mumbai, Ahmedabad are some of the cities where shops are allowed to open 24x7. Most cities world over are moving towards the 24-hour concept. It is about time Delhi, being the national Capital, also moves towards becoming a 24-hour city,” said a DDA official.The infra deficit While urban development experts and civil society members welcome the move, they say that a major infrastructure overhaul is required to achieve this. From transportation to safety, all aspects have to be relooked at to ensure people’s convenience.Arunava Dasgupta, head of the department, urban design, School of Planning and Architecture, said that to make Delhi a 24x7 city, the focus should be to first take strategic measures and provide the infrastructure to make the city liveable and convenient for people to perform their daily, necessary activities during the daytime and then extend those qualities into the night.Dasgupta said, “Nightlife of a city is an add-on quality. It can happen or be promoted if the daytime needs related to transportation, safety, livelihood, etc have been taken care of efficiently and equitably. The most important thing is to have a robust infrastructure before we plan for a 24x7 city. Also, while every part of the city cannot have an active night environment, every corner of the city needs to be safe, barrier free and accessible for all.”To ensure that the provision gets implemented, experts say there are a few things which must be kept in mind.Public safetySafety of people, especially women, experts say, is the biggest concern. Kalpana Viswanath, co-founder and CEO of Safetipin, said, “It is an interesting idea and would be great to explore the city at night. But there is a need to address issues related to women’s security. Well-lit streets, proper public infrastructure such as toilets, good public transportation facility, quick emergency response and provisions to encourage women vendors and others to work at night are essential to ensure women feel safe at night. Addressing the gender dynamics should be at the centre of planning provisions for a 24-hour city.”Citing the example of Bangkok’s flea markets, Viswanath said that there are so many women who work in these night markets. Street vendors, especially women vendors, are essential to address the safety-related issues.Activating frontages of buildings, creating public spaces and redesigning streets, experts say, are measures which can address the safety issue to a large extent. The draft MPD-2041 mentions these urban design concepts to have more eyes on the streets, said the first DDA official quoted above.Good public transport systemA good public transport system during night time is critical for the success of this concept. London, New York, Seoul, Barcelona, Tokyo are some cities where public transport is available 24x7.The draft plan proposes that low-frequency Metro and bus services should be available at night time.Amit Bhatt, director transport, WRI India, “For a city to have a vibrant nightlife, well-planned public spaces are essential apart from a good public transportation system. There is a need to have such commercial activities on the frontages which can work 24x7. There is a need for landuse regulation to change provisions to achieve this.”Nightlife around heritage assets; need for a cultural calendarThe draft master plan talks about developing nightlife circuits around cultural precincts, heritage areas. Promoting tourism, cultural activities can help in developing these circuits.Vaidya, the director of National Institute of Urban Affairs said, “A city’s nightlife can provide interesting options for citizens to participate in recreational, cultural and creative activities after standard work hours. Cities like Paris have experimented with ideas like ‘Nuit Blanche’ literally meaning white night, which takes the form of a festival where the city explodes with cultural activity.”But not all areas can be developed at nightlife hubs. Urban designer AGK Menon said, “In Shahjahanabad, the concept of night life during Ramzans exists. It has to be encouraged and part of the cultural circuits. When we talk about promoting nightlife, the policy document has to be clear on what it means. It will depend on the policy decisions taken in this regard. It is not an easy decision to make. We will have to see the details of it.”Ratish Nanda, CEO of Aga Khan Trust for Culture, said, “Potential for creative economies creating wealth for people of Delhi and improving the quality of life in our city is unimaginable. Illumination of monuments, access for longer hours, cultural events - music, theatre, food - at some of our little-known heritage sites would be an attraction not only for tourists but also Delhi’s own people.”He added, “The enabling environment that the master plan aims to create should be extended to abolishing of the licenses required for cultural events when these are held at select venues and allowing greater private sector initiative.”Pedestrian-friendly and accessible nightlife circuitsSufiyan said that there is a huge demand for night time activities, especially in the Walled City. But due to the present norms, not much can be done. “Shahjahanabad is a major tourist attraction. There is a need to make the area more pedestrian-friendly, upgrade sanitation service, limit the number of e-rickshaws, provide street furniture etc,” said Sufiyan.Another case in point in Connaught Place. The heritage market sees a very high footfall, especially during the winter season due to its location, cultural events planned at the Central Park, large number of restaurants etc. But the heritage market starts closing down from 8.30-9 pm onwards. Only restaurants operate till 1pm. The market, many say, has the potential to become a vibrant place at night.Manpreet Singh, the owner of Zen restaurant in Connaught Place and the treasurer of NRAI, “The idea to promote nightlife in the city is fantastic. We should keep pace with changing times. There are so many cities which are 24x7. There is a growing demand for recreational spaces, eateries to open till late. Though it can’t be done in all the areas, especially markets which are located in residential areas or abutting it, it can easily be done in CP, which is surrounded by offices.But the market association says that before promoting nightlife, basic infrastructure has to be put in place. Atul Bhargava, president of New Delhi Traders Association of CP, said, “there is a lot which needs to be done first to make the market safe and accessible. The street vendors encroach upon public space. We have to first ensure the safety of people. Before the 24x7 concept, let’s see if the idea is sustainable or not.”The nightlife concept will help the informal sector as well, said Arbind Singh, national coordinator, National Association of Street Vendors of India (NASVI). “World over cities flea markets, especially at night, are extremely popular. It is one place where you can experience their culture, food etc. A similar concept if promoted in Delhi will not only help the vendors earn their livelihood, it will attach a new dimension to the city’s cultural experience,” said SinghA new authority Bhatt said that for the success of this concept, there is a need for a commission or a regulatory body to look into the night time economic aspect and plan for the nightlife circuit just like in London. London has a Night Time Commission and a “night czar” to look into all aspects of the night time economy and ensure community involvement in it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-aspires-to-become-a-24-7-city-but-it-needs-to-ramp-up-infra-and-safety-101623655963584.html

15-06-2021||World||US nominee for East Asia affairs vows closer Taiwan ties but no new framework||The nominee to be the top US diplomat for East Asia promised Tuesday that President Joe Biden would keep building relations with Taiwan, but balked at backing an overhaul of delicate arrangements on the issue with China.Daniel Kritenbrink, a career diplomat tapped to be the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, told his Senate confirmation hearing that the relationship with Taiwan was "stronger than it's ever been" since 1979, when Washington switched recognition to Beijing."It's also incumbent upon us to further develop our robust relationship with Taiwan in every sector," Kritenbrink said in response to questions from senators who advocated more US support for the island democracy.Beijing claims Taiwan and has been ramping up pressure, including with a record 28 aircraft incursions reported Tuesday, months after it clamped down on freedoms in Hong Kong.The tensions have fueled calls by some US analysts and lawmakers to shed a longstanding policy of "strategic ambiguity" -- not specifying how the United States would respond to a military conflict on the Taiwan Strait -- in favor of an explicit, robust promise of defending the self-governing island.Asked if he supported a change, Kritenbrink said that existing US policy including the agreement only to recognize Beijing has "ensured cross-strait stability and Taiwan's security for these many decades.""As the threat from the PRC grows, as Beijing's aggressive and bullying behavior vis-a-vis Taiwan grows, I think that our response has to be calibrated as well," he said, referring to the People's Republic of China."But I am confident that the framework that we have, and meeting those obligations in the Taiwan Relations Act, gives us the tools to do so."The Taiwan Relations Act, passed by Congress when the United States shifted recognition, requires the United States to provide Taipei with weapons for its self-defense.Biden has moved ahead with former president Donald Trump's more outspoken approach on Taiwan, including pushing for its inclusion in international bodies.The Biden administration said Thursday it was resuming trade talks with Taiwan that had been on hiatus since Barack Obama's administration.The Senate last week separately passed a major package on investment in innovation whose provisions include lifting a ban on displays of Taiwan's flag and the wearing of Taiwanese uniforms during meetings in Washington.Kritenbrink, who appeared likely to be confirmed, is a career diplomat who speaks Chinese and Japanese.In his latest position, as ambassador to Vietnam, he became an unlikely internet sensation by releasing his own rap video for the Tet holiday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-nominee-for-east-asia-affairs-vows-closer-taiwan-ties-but-no-new-framework-101623777363224.html
15-06-2021||World||Gunman kills 2, then self at Alabama fire hydrant factory||A worker killed two people and wounded two more at an Alabama fire hydrant factory early Tuesday before killing himself, police said.The shootings — which happened at about 2:30 a.m. at a Mueller Co. plant in Albertville — add to a slew of homicides around the country, and weren't even the worst of the morning. Several hours later, gunfire in Chicago claimed twice as many victims.In the Alabama case, a manhunt ended when the shooter's body was found inside a car in Guntersville, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) away from the factory, shortly after daybreak. Multiple weapons were found inside the vehicle, Albertville Police Chief Jamie Smith said at a news conference.Smith said the suspect appears to have died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. What prompted him to kill and maim his coworkers wasn't immediately clear, the chief said. He called the shooting “completely unprovoked.”The chief identified the dead men as Michael Lee Dobbins and David Horton, and the shooter as Andreas Horton. He said they were not related, and had "no ties other than co-workers."Cody Windsor, a Mueller employee who was at home at the time, told the AP that he knew both Hortons, but also didn't know what might have prompted the shootings.Windsor said friends working the overnight shift told him the shooting happened in a part of the plant where fire hydrants and pipes are painted, and that an announcement about an active shooter was made over a PA system at the factory, which occupies several buildings over a large area near a railroad track, with fire hydrants stored on racks outside.Windsor said he and David Horton, a foundry helper who could do most any job in the plant, were buddies at work and often hung out together during breaks, he said. “We’d sit in our cars and listen to music,” he said. “Andy” Horton, Windsor said, was quiet and recently went through the death of his mother.“We work together and we bond together. We’re here as much as we are at home,” said Windsor. From now on, he said, he might be nervous “that somebody is going to walk in the door and shoot you.”Ann Walters told Al.com that Dobbins was her grandson, and that he had been working at the factory for nearly a year, saving up to buy a home and a car. “He was a perfect gentleman, everybody will tell you. He was good to everybody and put his family first,” she said.The chief read a statement from the company, which said “Mueller Water Products is shocked and deeply saddened by the horrific tragedy.”“Our entire focus is on the health and well being of our colleagues and we are committed to providing help and support to their families,” the company statement said.Mueller Co., based in Cleveland, Tennessee, is a subsidiary of Atlanta-based Mueller Water Products Inc., which calls itself a leading maker of water distribution and measurement products in North America. More than 400 people work at the plant in Albertville, giving the city in northwest Alabama its nickname of “Fire Hydrant Capital of the World.”The growing gun violence nationwide has police and criminal justice experts concerned. Within hours of the Alabama gunfire Tuesday, four women were killed and four other people were wounded in a pre-dawn shooting at a home in Chicago, police said. The toll from this past weekend included two people killed and at least 30 others wounded in mass shootings in Chicago, the Texas capital of Austin, and Savannah, Georgia.Law officers had hoped that last year's spike in homicides would subside as the nation emerges from coronavirus restrictions, but they remain higher than they were in pre-pandemic times.“There was a hope this might simply be a statistical blip that would start to come down,” said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum. “That hasn’t happened. And that’s what really makes chiefs worry that we may be entering a new period where we will see a reversal of 20 years of declines in these crimes.”Albertville is a tight-knit community, and its people will come together to support the victims' families, city spokeswoman Robin Lathan said.“Everyone is absolutely heartbroken and devastated,” she said. “The Mueller Company is part of the lifeblood of who we are in the city of Albertville. It’s just a devastating blow.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gunman-kills-2-then-self-at-alabama-fire-hydrant-factory-101623777721601.html

And now's not the time to let our guard down. Please get vaccinated as soon as possible."The massive vaccination campaign has been pushed by US health authorities since the authorization of the first vaccines in December, and peaked in April, with up to more than four million shots a day.But the pace has slowed rapidly since then, and unvaccinated people still remain vulnerable to the disease.Just over 52 percent of the US population, or 174 million people, have already received at least one dose of one of the three vaccines authorized in the country, according to health officials.Biden has set a goal of 70 percent of adults to have received at least one shot by the national holiday of July 4, but the program may fall short of that goal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-deaths-cross-600-000-mark-johns-hopkins-101623776824315.html

Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday that 70% of adults in New York have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, a threshold he said the state would celebrate by easing many of its remaining social distancing rules and shooting off fireworks.“What does 70% mean? It means that we can now return to life as we know it,” Cuomo told an invitation-only crowd at the World Trade Center in Manhattan.Effective immediately, he said, the state is lifting rules that had limited the size of gatherings and required some types of businesses to follow cleaning protocols or take people's temperatures or screen them for recent Covid-19 symptoms.Businesses will no longer have to follow social distancing rules, or limit how many people they can allow inside based on keeping people 6 feet (2 meters) apart.Some rules will remain: New Yorkers, for now, will continue to have to wear masks in schools, subways, large venues, homeless shelters, hospitals, nursing homes, jails and prisons.Cuomo, a Democrat, said there would be fireworks displays around the state to celebrate.It's unclear how many more people have to get vaccinated to reach herd immunity, which is when enough people have immunity that the virus has trouble spreading.It's unclear what that threshold is for the coronavirus, though many experts say it’s 70% or higher. Just half of all 20 million residents in New York are fully vaccinated, according to federal data as of Monday.Over the past seven days, New York has been averaging around 450 new coronavirus cases a day, the lowest level since the pandemic began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-lifts-more-covid-19-rules-as-it-hits-vaccination-mark-101623776384839.html

He was executed on Tuesday in Dammam, a statement from the Ministry of Interior said.Saudi authorities said last year that they would stop sentencing to death people who committed crimes while minors, who would instead serve up to 10 years in juvenile detention, and would apply this retroactively.However, the March 2020 royal decree was never reported by state media nor published in the official gazette as would be normal practice. The state-backed Human Rights Commission told Reuters in February that the ban only applied to a lesser category of offence under Islamic law known as "ta'zeer."Darwish was convicted for "ta'zeer" offences.In his charge sheet, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, Darwish was accused of "participating in armed rebellion," "seeking to disturb security by rioting" and "sowing discord", among others.The evidence cited included a picture "offensive to the security forces", a signed confession and his participation in more than ten "riot" gatherings in 2011 and 2012.But the documents don't specify the exact months of the alleged offences, and rights groups say Darwish was 17 at the time of his alleged participation in many of the protests. His case should have been reviewed under the reformed law, they say.Anti-death penalty charity Reprieve and Amnesty International said his confession was obtained under duress and that he recanted his confession, which he said was obtained through torture, in court.The Saudi Arabian government media office did not immediately reply to a request for comment.Reprieve said Darwish's family received no advance notice and only found out he had been executed by reading the news online."How can they execute a boy because of a photograph on his phone?," his family said in a statement. "Since his arrest, we have known nothing but pain. It is a living death for the whole family."Human rights groups and western lawmakers have repeatedly raised concerns about the implementation of the reforms.Earlier this month, a group of British MPs urged Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to ask for a commutation of Darwish's sentence on a visit to Riyadh, in a letter seen by Reuters.In a statement following Raab's visit and meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the UK foreign office said Raab had raised human rights concerns "notably around justice reform".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-executes-man-for-offences-rights-groups-say-he-committed-as-minor-101623775470193.html
15-06-2021||World||Did Trump want FBI to probe if satellites manipulated votes? Here’s what new emails suggest||The new emails from the US department of justice (DOJ) and White House officials show how then-President Donald Trump’s allies pressured Jeffrey Rosen, then-deputy attorney general, to consider baseless allegations of voter fraud and at the same time elevated him to lead the DOJ. Minutes after Trump’s staff started sending emails with phoney voter fraud information to Rosen, the Republican leader announced that the No. 2 at the DOJ would serve as acting attorney general, according to the new documents disclosed by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.On Tuesday, Carolyn B. Maloney, the chairperson of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, released new documents showing Trump’s efforts to pressure the DOJ to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. The documents obtained by the committee show that in December 2020 and early January 2021, Trump, his chief of staff, and outside allies repeatedly put pressure on senior DOJ officials to advance unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud, “with the apparent goal of keeping President Trump in power despite losing the 2020 election.”“These documents show that President Trump tried to corrupt our nation’s chief law enforcement agency in a brazen attempt to overturn an election that he lost,” Maloney said in a statement.On December 29, 2020, Trump’s White House assistant emailed Rosen, then-principal associate deputy attorney general Richard Donoghue, and acting solicitor general Jeffrey Wall, attaching a draft legal brief to file in the Supreme Court. The draft complaint demanded that the Supreme Court “declare that the Electoral College votes cast” in six states that Trump lost “cannot be counted,” requesting the Court to order a “special election” for the outgoing president in those states.Also Read | US Justice dept opens probe into Trump's seizures of Democrats, journalists dataEmails further confirm that Trump met with Rosen, then-assistant attorney general Jeffrey Clark, and other DOJ officials on December 31, 2020, and January 3, 2021. During these meetings, Trump reportedly pressured them to challenge the results of the 2020 presidential election, according to the committee. The documents have substantiated recent reports that Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows pressured DOJ officials to investigate conspiracy theories.Meadows emailed Rosen a translation of a document from an individual in Italy claiming to have “direct knowledge” of a plot by which American electoral data was changed in Italian facilities “in coordination with senior US intelligence officials (CIA)” and loaded onto “military satellites.” The individual claimed that the true data, as well as sources within the conservative wing of the Italian secret service, confirmed that Trump was “clearly the winner” of the 2020 presidential election.Meadows sent Rosen a YouTube link referencing the Italy conspiracy. Rosen forwarded the email to Donoghue, who responded: “Pure insanity.”Rosen then explained to Donoghue that he was asked to have the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) meet a person who, he learnt, was working with Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani. But the DOJ official refused the request.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pure-insanity-trump-allies-wanted-to-know-if-satellites-manipulated-votes-101623772579142.html

Taiwan has frequently complained about repeated Chinese incursions, which has increased in the past few months.Beijing has become more assertive on the reunification of Taiwan with China under “one country, two systems”, which has threatened Taiwan’s claim of sovereignty. While the self-ruled island republic considers itself as sovereign, China claims Taiwan as Beijing’s territory under its one-China policy.According to Taiwan’s ministry of defence, the Chinese incursion involved 14 J-16 and six J-11 fighters, as well as four H-6 bombers, which can carry nuclear weapons, and anti-submarine, electronic warfare and early warning aircraft. The latest incursion is the largest since the defence ministry began regularly reporting PLA activities in Taiwan's ADIZ last year. The previous record was of 25 aircraft reported on April 12.The ministry said that air patrol troops were dispatched to respond to the incursion and warn away the Chinese aircraft. Radio warnings issued and air defence missile systems deployed to monitor the activity, the ministry added.Also Read | China warns Japan after its PM refers to Taiwan as a ‘country’In the past, China has described such missions as necessary to protect the country's sovereignty and to deal with "collusion" between Taiwan and the United States. On the other hand, the West is wary of China’s growing economic clout and expansionist behaviour in the region. The United States, which like most countries has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, has watched with alarm the stepped-up tensions with Beijing.The Group of Seven richest democracies on Sunday issued a joint communique underscoring the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and encouraged the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues. They also raised serious concerns over the situation in the East and South China Seas, strongly opposing any unilateral attempts to change the status quo and increase tensions, which was dismissed by China as “slander”.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-reports-largest-incursion-yet-by-chinese-air-force-101623768328115.html

But this could change everything," said Precious, 38, who did not wish to give her full name.She had spent the night digging, with her teenage son and baby daughter.The boy clutched a transparent crystal the size of a ping pong ball."They are not tired, we are looking for money," Precious exclaimed.Dreaming of 'Dubai' Rumour has it that the Cullinan, which weighed over 3,000 carats uncut, was lying only a few metres below ground and dug up with a pocketknife.The rough stone yielded nine major diamonds used to adorn the British crown jewels, as well as almost 100 minor brilliants.Johannesburg resident Thulani Manyathi, 36, travelled to KwaHlathi from the impoverished township of Alexandra with his four young daughters."We are going to live in Dubai. I want a house with double storage, this is going to change our life," Manyathi told AFP, fingering a cluster of stones in his pocket."No school today," he added. "We are digging for diamonds."There is talk of "foreigners" buying the stones for a few hundred rands in the nearby town of Ladysmith.But experts say it is highly unlikely the stones will turn out to be valuable."These are not diamonds, people here are just wasting their time," said 18-year-old Bhekumuzi Luvuno, skeptically inspecting one of the stones he unearthed overnight.Authorities over the weekend asked diggers to leave the area, citing coronavirus restrictions, but to no avail.The government on Tuesday sent a team of geological and mining experts to the area, now pckmarked with holes, to collect stones for analysis.Police cars are monitoring the area to keep the crowds in check.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mystery-stones-spark-diamond-rush-in-poor-south-african-region-101623766673712.html

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Monday said that about 2,300 passengers refused to comply with the federal facemask mandate.In May, US authorities lifted the mask mandate for fully vaccinated individuals following a recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), however, they are still required to wear a mask on planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation. Masks are also required in US transportation hubs such as airports and stations.The FAA has proposed civil penalties ranging from $7,500 to $15,500 against four airline passengers for violating in-flight guidelines and federal regulations. According to the FAA, the passengers allegedly interfered with flight attendants who instructed them to obey cabin crew instructions and various federal regulations.Also Read | US aviation administration tells airlines to use extreme caution when flying over BelarusOne of these four passengers reported by airlines inserted her finger into her nose in response to a flight attendant’s direction to wear her mask, the FAA said. She allegedly yelled, used profanity and refused to read a warning note that a flight attendant issued to her. As a result, the captain had to divert the Cancun-bound flight to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The FAA has proposed a $10,500 fine against the JetBlue Airlines passenger.The FAA alleges that a passenger onboard an Alaska Airlines flight from Boise, Idaho, to Los Angeles, California, smoked an e-cigarette in the aeroplane lavatory, which activated the lavatory smoke detector system. The passenger walked through the cabin without a face mask over his mouth and nose and repeatedly ignored flight attendants’ instructions to wear his facemask properly.Following its policy, the FAA has not identified individuals against whom it has proposed civil penalties. The passengers have 30 days after receiving the FAA’s enforcement letter to respond to the agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3000-unruly-us-air-travellers-reported-in-2021-faa-proposes-penalty-101623764513261.html

15-06-2021||World||Domestic workers hit worse in Covid, lost far more jobs than others: UN||The pandemic has taken a harsh toll on domestic workers who have lost far more jobs than others despite a decade-old international pact guaranteeing their rights, the UN said Tuesday.In a fresh report, the International Labour Organization warned that working conditions for many of the world's 75.6 million domestic workers had not improved since the adoption in 2011 of a convention entitling them to the same protections as other workers.And the situation has been made worse by the Covid-19 pandemic, which hit domestic workers -- the majority of whom are women -- far harder than those in most other professions.Also read | UN says Covid-19 pandemic created an 'unparalleled' employment crisisWith eight out of 10 domestic workers globally working in the informal sector, many had no labour or social protections to fall back upon when the crisis hit."The impact on domestic workers was very much stronger than it was on other parts of the workforce, so that meant that these workers lost their jobs in greater numbers or saw their hours of work reduced to a greater extent than other parts of the workforce," ILO chief Guy Ryder told reporters."The crisis has highlighted the urgent need to formalise domestic work to ensure their access to decent work," he said.At the height of the crisis, job losses among domestic workers ranged from five to 20 percent in most European countries, while the losses were between 25 and 50 percent in the Americas, the report showed.Job losses among other employees were less than 15 percent in most countries.'Deeper human impact'Since many domestic workers are migrants who rely on their employment for the right to remain in the country they live in, and many are live-in employees, a loss of employment could also mean a loss of their residency permit and lodgings.Also read: UN stands ready to step up support to India, says Guterres on Covid outbreak"Behind the aggregated numbers, I think there is a deeper human impact which accentuates even more the suffering involved in the labour market impact of the Covid-19 pandemic," Ryder said.More than three quarters of all domestic workers are women, and the vast majority are employed in two regions: the Asia-Pacific region which is home to about half of the world's domestic workers, and another quarter found in the Americas.There has been some progress since the adoption of the Domestic Workers Convention, now ratified by 32 countries, with the number of domestic workers who are wholly excluded from the scope of labour laws and regulations cut by 16 percentage points in 10 years.But the ILO report showed that a full 36 percent of domestic workers remain wholly excluded from such laws, most of them in the Asia-Pacific region and in the Arab states.The UN agency cautioned though that even where domestic workers have been included in labour and social protection laws, "implementation remains a significant issue."The report showed that fewer than one in five domestic workers, just 18.8 percent, enjoy effective employment-related social protection coverage."It is more and more important that we redouble our efforts to ensure that the workforce concerned has access to decent work as much as any others," Ryder said."It should not be an invisible workforce, it should not be an undervalued workforce, it should not be an unrecognised workforce."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/domestic-workers-hit-worse-in-covid-lost-far-more-jobs-than-others-un-101623758498168.html

It wasn't immediately clear what condition the three patients were in.Oman health officials warned earlier this week that the sultanate faces an acute shortage of beds amid the spread of highly transmissible virus variants, a lagging vaccine rollout and relaxed movement restrictions.The fungal condition became a growing cause of concern during India’s devastating coronavirus surge. Other countries, including Egypt, have reported scattered cases in recent months as infections spiked. Black fungus existed in India before the virus wave, but it stoked fears as it took hold in thousands of infected or recently recovered Covid-19 patients.Mucormycosis is caused by exposure to mucor mold, which is commonly found in soil, air and even in the nose and mucus of humans. It spreads through the respiratory tract and erodes facial structures. Sometimes, doctors have to surgically remove the eye to stop the infection from reaching the brain.The fungal infection preys on patients with weakened immune systems and underlying conditions, particularly diabetes, as well as overuse of certain over-the-counter coronavirus medication, like steroids. Uncontrolled blood sugar can put immunocompromised people at a higher risk of contracting the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fungal-infection-detected-in-covid-19-patients-in-oman-101623758514153.html

During an interview with Fox News, Yeonmi Park, who graduated from Columbia University, drew parallels between the so-called 'cancel culture' in US universities and Kim Jong Un’s regime, saying she couldn’t believe she was sitting “in North Korea's classroom or in America's classroom.”Yeonmi claimed that North Korean children are instructed to equate the term and persona of "American" with "bastard", and memories of that society came flooding back when she enrolled at Columbia University in New York City's Morningside Heights. She further claimed that the professors at Columbia blamed the United States for the problems in Africa and Asia, which she “couldn’t believe.”"Literally every professor was saying the problems that we have in today's world is because of White men [and] how they colonised Africa [and] Asia, that's how they mess up everything and they are the ones who needs to be blamed -- and I couldn't believe it,” Yeonmi told Fox News.Also Read | Once ‘deeply-moved’ by K-Pop, North Korea’s Kim Jong Un calls it ‘vicious cancer’The North Korean escapee said she found a lot of similarities between America, a democracy, and North Korea, a country under totalitarian dictatorship, including “anti-Western sentiment, collective guilt and suffocating political correctness.” Expressing shock and confusion on issues surrounding gender and language, Yeonmi said that every class asked students to announce their preferred pronouns."English is my third language.

How the heck do I incorporate that into my sentences?" she asked rhetorically."Even North Korea is not this nuts. North Korea was pretty crazy, but not this crazy," she added.The 27-year-old Columbia graduate said that after being sold into sex slavery and placed on Kim Jong Un’s “killing list”, she escaped North Korea and presumed she was in a free society in the United States. "My enemy used to be Kim Jong Un: I have been on Kim Jong Un's killing list of people for many years because I spoke out, and my original family got punished but now ironically enough, so many Marxists and Communists and Maoists and Leninists are now are sending me death threats," she claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/even-north-korea-not-this-nuts-defector-after-graduating-from-us-university-101623751367106.html
15-06-2021||World||After NATO, Biden turns to EU for renewal of transatlantic ties||U.S. President Joe Biden will seek to end one front in a Trump-era trade war when he meets European Union leaders on Tuesday by agreeing a truce in a transatlantic dispute over aircraft subsidies that has dragged on for 17 years.At the summit with EU institution leaders in Brussels, Biden is aiming for a reset in ties after four years under predecessor Donald Trump, who imposed tariffs on the EU and promoted Britain's departure from the bloc.Biden and the EU side are set to remove tariffs on $11.5 billion of goods from EU wine to U.S. tobacco and spirits for five years. The tariffs were imposed on a tit-for-tat basis over mutual frustration over state subsidies for U.S. planemaker Boeing and European rival Airbus."I am very positive that we will find an agreement on the Airbus-Boeing issue today in conversation with our American friends," European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told a news conference. Biden will meet von der Leyen and the EU's chairman Charles Michel, who represents EU governments.Biden told NATO leaders "America is back" at a news conference in Brussels late on Monday. He is seeking European support to defend Western liberal democracies in the face of a more assertive Russia and China's military and economic rise."We're facing a once in a century global health crisis," Biden said, while adding "Russia and China are both seeking to drive a wedge in our transatlantic solidarity."Also Read | NATO declares China is a ‘security challenge’According to an EU-U.S. draft final summit statement seen by Reuters, Washington and Brussels will commit to ending another row over punitive tariffs related to steel and aluminium.U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai discussed the aircraft dispute in her first face-to-face meeting with EU counterpart Valdis Dombrovskis on Monday ahead of Tuesday's U.S.-EU summit. The pair are due to speak on Tuesday afternoon.Freezing the trade conflicts would give both sides more time to focus on broader agendas such as concerns over China's state-driven economic model, diplomats said.The EU-U.S. summit starts at around midday Central European Time. Biden and U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken earlier met with Belgian King Philippe, Prime Minister Alexander De Croo and Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmes. On Wednesday, he meets Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva.The summit draft statement to be released at the end of the meeting said they had "a chance and a responsibility to help people make a living and keep them safe, fight climate change, and stand up for democracy and human rights".There are no firm new transatlantic pledges on climate in the draft summit statement, however, and both sides will steer clear of setting a date to stop burning coal.The EU and the United States are the world's top trading powers, along with China, but Trump sought to sideline the EU.After scotching a free-trade agreement with the EU, the Trump administration focused on shrinking a growing U.S. deficit in goods trade. Biden, however, sees the EU as an ally in promoting free trade, as well as in fighting climate change and ending the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-nato-biden-turns-to-eu-for-renewal-of-transatlantic-ties-101623749654345.html
15-06-2021||World||China urges NATO to stop exaggerating 'China threat theory'||China's mission to the European Union urged NATO on Tuesday to stop exaggerating the "China threat theory" after the group's leaders warned that the country presented "systemic challenges".NATO leaders on Monday had taken a forceful stance towards Beijing in a communique at United States President Joe Biden's first summit with the alliance."China's stated ambitions and assertive behaviour present systemic challenges to the rules-based international order and to areas relevant to alliance security," NATO leaders had said.The new US president has urged his fellow NATO leaders to stand up to China's authoritarianism and growing military might, a change of focus for an alliance created to defend Europe from the Soviet Union during the Cold War.The NATO statement "slandered" China's peaceful development, misjudged the international situation, and indicated a "Cold War mentality," China said in a response posted on the mission's website.China is always committed to peaceful development, it added."We will not pose a 'systemic challenge' to anyone, but if anyone wants to pose a 'systemic challenge' to us, we will not remain indifferent."In Beijing, a spokesman for the foreign ministry, Zhao Lijian, said the United States and Europe had "different interests," and that some European countries "will not tie themselves to the anti-China war chariot of the United States".G7 nations meeting in Britain over the weekend scolded China over human rights in its Xinjiang region, called for Hong Kong to keep a high degree of autonomy and demanded a full investigation of the origins of the coronavirus in China.China's embassy in London said it was resolutely opposed to mentions of Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan, which it said distorted the facts and exposed the "sinister intentions of a few countries such as the United States."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-urges-nato-to-stop-exaggerating-china-threat-theory-101623748854139.html
15-06-2021||World||'Won't cooperate in probe over anti-drugs deaths': Philippine president Duterte||Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte will never cooperate with a possible International Criminal Court investigation into the thousands of killings under his anti-drugs crackdown, his spokesman said Tuesday, calling an international inquiry insulting to the country’s justice system.But human rights activists welcomed the possible investigation as a long-awaited step toward justice and accountability. A leading Duterte critic, jailed opposition Sen. Leila de Lima, said the Philippine leader may now be harboring fears of “being dragged in chains to the Hague” to be tried as “an enemy of mankind.”Outgoing ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said Monday that a preliminary examination found reason to believe crimes against humanity had been committed during Duterte's crackdown on drugs between July 1, 2016, and March 16, 2019.The dates cover the period between when Duterte launched his police-enforced crackdown shortly after winning a six-year presidential term and when he withdrew the Philippines from the court. Critics said at the time he was trying to avoid accountability.More than 6,000 mostly poor drug suspects have been killed, according to government pronouncements, but human rights groups say the death toll is considerably higher and should include many unsolved killings by motorcycle-riding gunmen who may have been deployed by police.Duterte has denied condoning extrajudicial killings of drug suspects although he has openly threatened suspects with death and has ordered police to shoot suspects who dangerously resist arrest.Bensouda said she has sought authorization to open a formal investigation. The court's judges have 120 days to decide on her request.Duterte’s spokesman, Harry Roque, blasted Bensouda’s move as “legally erroneous,” saying the ICC, as an international court of last resort, could only intervene if a country’s judiciary and prosecutorial system fail to work and investigate domestic crimes. Roque cited many pending murder and other cases involving the government’s campaign against illegal drugs which were being tried by Philippine courts.“It’s an insult to all Filipinos for a foreigner like Bensouda and fellow Filipinos to say that our legal institution in the Philippines are not working and not dispensing justice,” Roque told a news conference. “How dare you say that the Philippine legal system is not working.”Roque said political “enemies” of Duterte and his administration filed the complaints before the ICC, adding “we will never cooperate because we are no longer a member.”Bensouda, however, stressed the court has jurisdiction over crimes alleged while the Philippines was still a member of the court.Rights activists welcomed Bensouda’s conclusion. Amnesty International said her announcement “is a much-awaited step in putting murderous incitement by President Duterte and his administration to an end.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wont-cooperate-in-probe-over-anti-drugs-deaths-philippine-president-duterte-101623744918730.html
15-06-2021||World||India to expedite Amazon, Flipkart antitrust probe as tech focus intensifies: Report||India's antitrust watchdog plans to expedite a restarted probe into allegations of anti-competitive behaviour at Amazon.com Inc and Walmart Inc's Flipkart, as it intensifies scrutiny of big-tech firms, two people close to the matter said.The comments come as major US technology firms including Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc are at loggerheads with the government over issues such as data privacy bills and policies some industry executives have called protectionist.The Competition Commission of India (CCI) initiated a probe in January last year on the basis of a complaint alleging Amazon and Flipkart promoted select sellers on their e-commerce platforms and that deep discounts stifled competition.The companies have denied wrongdoing.Near-immediate legal challenges from the pair stalled the probe for over a year until a court last week allowed it to resume, having dismissed arguments that the CCI lacked evidence.Though Amazon and Flipkart are likely to appeal, the CCI plans to demand information from them related to the allegations "as quickly as possible", said one of the people, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.The investigation "will be expedited", the person said. Such investigations in India typically take months to complete.Amazon declined to comment. Flipkart and the CCI did not respond to requests for comment.PriorityThe CCI is speeding up all cases involving big technology firms, including by deploying additional officers for some cases and working to more stringent internal deadlines, said the two people, who are familiar with the watchdog's thinking."Cases involving digital firms are getting a priority at CCI as they can have significant impact on the economy and Indian startups," said one of the people.Last year, the CCI began reviewing allegations of Google abusing the position of its Android operating system in the smart TV market, and is likely to soon order a comprehensive antitrust investigation, the people said.Google declined to comment.Such a probe would be the third against Google, with the Alphabet Inc unit already battling cases relating to Android as well as its payment app.The CCI is also investigating practices at MakeMyTrip Ltd and privacy policy changes at Facebook's WhatsApp.Preferential treatmentThe probe into Amazon and Flipkart is restarting at a time when both are battling accusations from offline retailers that their complex business structures allow them to circumvent foreign investment rules for e-commerce.In February, a Reuters investigation based on Amazon documents showed the e-tailer for years gave preferential treatment to a small group of sellers on its Indian platform. While arguing to restart the probe, the CCI told a court in Karnataka state that the Reuters report corroborated evidence. Amazon, which has said it "does not give preferential treatment to any seller", told the court it disagreed with the Reuters report.The antitrust body will examine the Reuters report and could use it as part of its investigation, one of the people said."The CCI's plan to move faster on such cases is in line with other antitrust regulators globally that are investigating digital markets like e-commerce and online search, which are dynamic and evolving fast," said an Indian antitrust lawyer who represents tech firms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-to-expedite-amazon-flipkart-antitrust-probe-as-tech-focus-intensifies-report-101623741982448.html
15-06-2021||World||Canada: Indian-origin ex-minister ‘sorry’ for backing proposed anti-Muslim bill||A former Canadian minister of Indian origin has publicly apologised for having supported in the past a proposed bill that would have banned Muslim women in the country from wearing the niqab, a face-covering veil, while taking their citizenship oath.Conservative Party MP Tim Uppal, a Sikh, was the minister of state for multiculturalism in the government of then PM Stephen Harper in 2015 when he had backed the controversial bill.His apology has come at a time when terror charges have been slapped on Nathaniel Veltman, a 20-year-old who had mowed down four members of a Muslim family in the city of Hamilton in Ontario on June 6 in an act of Islamophobia. Uppal is currently an MP from Edmonton Mill Woods.Uppal’s mea culpa has come following the attack. In a Facebook post, he said he was the spokesperson for the proposed bill in 2015, but after his party was defeated in that year’s general election by the Justin Trudeau-led Liberals, he spoke with Canadians outside the “partisan political bubble” and realised “how this ban and other campaign announcements during the 2015 election alienated Muslim Canadians and contributed to the growing problem of Islamaphobia”.He posted, “When it came to these policies, I should have used my seat at the table to push against divisiveness that promoted the notion of the other. I regret not being a stronger voice and sincerely apologise for my role.”Referring to the Hamilton attack, he said it has been “a devastating week for many. We are mourning as a nation for a family that was so brutally attacked and destroyed by a terrorist”.The apology came as a federal prosecutor imposed terror charges on Veltman, who drove his truck over the family when they had been out for an evening walk. The charges were upgraded on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-indian-origin-ex-minister-sorry-for-backing-proposed-anti-muslim-bill-101623739488611.html
15-06-2021||World||US out, Taliban ride on violence, situation critical in Afghanistan||May 2021 was a bloody month in Afghanistan with the strife torn country getting more volatile and politically unstable. Taking advantage of the commencement of the final drawdown of the US-led international forces, the ultra-conservative Sunni Taliban have intensified its efforts to capture more areas with its ties with Al-Qaeda intact and the so-called Islamic State Khorasan Province acting in harmony with the Islamist forces.The disruptive role of Pakistani deep state is adding fuel to the fire with Islamabad continuing its support to Taliban’s terror tactics. The peace process has failed to deliver any positive outcomes and has little or no hope of doing so in future. The chaos and uncertainty in Afghanistan is likely to worsen further and also impact regional peace in the Indian sub-continent as the terror factories will go full steam after September 2021 after the American and international troops leave the country. This will bring an end to two decades of peace-keeping efforts in the region.By September 11, 2,500 troops of the United States will be completely out of Afghanistan and around 7,000 non-US forces from mainly NATO countries - along with Australia, New Zealand and Georgia - are also planning to leave by that date.Since the announcement of the withdrawal of US forces, violence has been rising and efforts to broker a peace settlement between the Afghan government and insurgent Taliban have slowed.The rise in violenceThere has been an over two-and-half fold increase in terrorism-linked fatalities in the country in May in comparison to April, 2021. According to government figures, 4,375 such deaths have been reported in Afghanistan as compared to 1,645 in April. This was the highest fatality count recorded in a month since March, 2020.The security forces too suffered a three-fold surge in fatalities - from 388 in April to 1,134 in May.The Afghan national defence and security forces, which will take over the efforts to maintain peace in the country after international forces are gone, have suffered disruptions in supply of essentials like ration, shortage of ammunition and witnessed 26 of their bases surrendered to the Taliban last month.The coordinated attacks, which have increased in the last few months, have caused a high number of casualties and led to displacement of more than 1,000 families from Ghazni, Helmand and Zabul provinces. The continued Taliban attacks also pose serious threats to five provincial capitals: Pul-e-Khumri (Baghlan); Kunduz city (Kunduz); Kandahar city (Kandahar); Lashkargah (Helmand); and Tjrinkot (Uruzgan).At least 80 people were killed and more than 160 injured in the attack near the Sayed Ul-Shuhada High School in Kabul on May 8. The attack took place as students started to make their way home.Support to TalibanIn the beginning of May, Afghan National Security Adviser Hamdullah Mohib hinted that Al-Qaeda was playing a key role in keeping the Taliban’s war machine active in Afghanistan. He also said that both Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State-Khorasan Province were carrying out their activities in harmony with the Taliban.A week later, First Vice President Amrullah Saleh asserted that the Taliban continued to operate ‘shoulder-to-shoulder’ with Al-Qaeda. Saleh highlighted the elimination of Al-Qaeda elements by Afghan National Defence and security forces to prove his point.Pakistan continues to play the gameWhat has been a cause of concern for the Afghan government is the support the terrorists are getting from neighbour Pakistan. One of the provincial governors raised the issue of the presence of Pakistani nationals fighting alongside Taliban militants.Underlining that the Taliban received weapons and ammunition supplies from Pakistan, Afghan National Security Adviser Hamdullah Mohib termed the outfit as a "slave of the ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence)".In an interview on May 15, Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani reiterated that Pakistan was supporting the Taliban. But Pakistan's Foreign Office described it as an "irresponsible statement" and a "baseless allegation".In a statement, Pakistani Army Chief of Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa reiterated to President Ghani last month that "a peaceful Afghanistan means a peaceful region in general and a peaceful Pakistan in particular"."We will always support 'Afghan led-Afghan owned' Peace Process based on mutual consensus of all stakeholders," the statement said.Expediting the peace processPresident Ashraf Ghani said last month that he has been pushing the formation of an all-party 'Supreme State Council' to carry forward the peace process as well as the resistance to the Taliban. Ghani has met a number of leaders on the structure and composition of the council but it has not been constituted yet.The council was supposed to be formed last year. The efforts have now been expedited, and local reports in Afghanistan say that an 18-member list has been prepared for the Supreme Council.Against the backdrop of a spurt in violence in the Northern Provinces of Takhar, Baghlan and Daykundi, Tajik leader Ahmad Massoud (son of former mujahideen leader Ahmad Shah Massoud) stated in Kabul on May 5, that if the Taliban continued to seek a military solution, the Afghan mujahideen groups would be prepared for a confrontation with the outfit. Massoud also underscored that, given the foreign troop withdrawal, the Taliban had no justification for war.Hazara leader Mohammad Karim Khalili, anticipating a deterioration of the security situation in the Hazarajat area (Bamyan, Daykundi, Ghor, Uruzgan and Wardak Provinces), was making efforts to prepare resistance militias against the Taliban. With the resistance to Taliban rising in erstwhile Northern Alliance areas, Afghanistan seems headed for another round of bloody civil strife with innocents the only victims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-out-taliban-rides-on-violence-situation-critical-in-afghanistan-101623737176287.html
15-06-2021||World||Covid-19 origin: China's top virologist Shi Zhengli denies lab leak theory||Shi Zhengli, the top bat coronavirus researcher at Wuhan Institute of Virology, has defended her institute amid calls for a probe into the origin of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), including a hypothesis that it was leaked from a WIV lab. She said there is no evidence and lamented the filth being poured "on an innocent scientist".“How on earth can I offer up evidence for something where there is no evidence?” she told the New York Times in rare comment to the media on the issue. “I don’t know how the world has come to this, constantly pouring filth on an innocent scientist,” she further wrote in her response sent through a text message.In a March 2020 article in Scientific American, Shi said that the genetic code of the virus that causes Covid-19 doesn’t match any of her lab’s samples. She also told the World Health Organization (WHO) team, which visited China to find out the cause of the origin of Covid-19, that all staff had tested negative for Covid-19 antibodies.US President Joe Biden last month ordered intelligence agencies to investigate the origin of the pandemic, including the lab leak theory.The leak hypothesis had been floated earlier during the global outbreak, including by Biden's predecessor Donald Trump, but was widely dismissed as a conspiracy theory.But it has gained increasing traction recently, fueled by reports that three researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology became sick in 2019 after visiting a bat cave in the southwestern Chinese province of Yunnan.But Shi said in a research paper published in November last year that the workers' pneumonia-like symptoms were caused by a fungal infection. Shi and her team also said in research published that they had retested 13 serum samples from four of the patients and found no sign they had been infected with Sars-CoV-2.The Wuhan Institute of Virology houses a lab with a biosafety rating of "P4" - the highest possible - which is determined by the level of danger and resulting security measures posed by the pathogens studied there. P4-level pathogens include those that cause diseases such as Ebola.The P4 lab is Asia's first and was built at a cost of $42 million, opening in 2018.The institute studies some of the world's most dangerous diseases and previously conducted extensive investigations into the links between bats and disease outbreaks in China.Its scientists helped shed light on the Covid-19 pathogen in the early days of the outbreak in Wuhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-origin-china-s-top-virologist-shi-zhengli-denies-lab-leak-theory-101623733575573.html

15-06-2021||World||Joe Biden promises to lay down 'red lines' to Russia's Vladimir Putin||US President Joe Biden said Monday he would lay down "red lines" to his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin at their upcoming meeting, after rallying NATO allies to face up to challenges from Moscow and Beijing.Speaking after his first NATO summit since being elected, Biden insisted: "I'm not looking for conflict with Russia, but that we will respond if Russia continues its harmful activities."Biden also called Putin "tough" and "a worthy adversary" ahead of their hotly anticipated meeting in Geneva on Wednesday.The warning to the Kremlin leader came as Biden pressed to renew Washington's transatlantic ties with allies after years of tensions under his predecessor Donald Trump.At Biden's urging, NATO leaders agreed to work together against the "systemic challenges" posed by China's aggressive policies as the alliance fleshed out its nascent approach to Beijing.China's increasingly assertive actions in building a nuclear arsenal as well as space and cyber warfare capabilities threatens the international order, they said in a statement.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the allies would seek to cooperate with China on global issues like climate change, as European capitals wanted.But, in a nod to Washington's growing concern, he warned: "China's growing influence and international policies present challenges to Alliance security.""Leaders agreed that we need to address such challenges together as an alliance, and that we need to engage with China to defend our security interests," he said.In the summit communique, the leaders told Russia that there would be no quick return to "business as usual".Russia's military build-up and provocative behaviour on NATO's eastern frontier "increasingly threaten the security of the Euro-Atlantic area and contribute to instability along NATO borders and beyond".'Right balance'On China, Biden is picking up from where Trump left off by getting NATO to start paying attention to Beijing.But European allies have been wary that an increase of focus on China could distract NATO from its major priority -- Russia.German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted that alliance members should not "overestimate" the dangers posed from Beijing."We have to find the right balance," she said. "China is a rival on many issues, but at the same time it is also a partner on many issues."French President Emmanuel Macron insisted that NATO should not spread itself too thin and "skew" the relationship with China."NATO is a military organisation, the subject of our relationship with China is not only military," he said, stressing NATO's north Atlantic focus.AfghanistanLooming large in the background for the summit was also the scramble to complete NATO's hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan after Biden surprised partners by ordering US troops home by September 11.Biden discussed with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan an offer from Ankara to keep troops in the country to secure Kabul airport -- provided the US gave support.Erdogan announced no firm deal on the issue -- or any progress on the thorny dispute over Turkey's purchase of Russia's S-400 missile system.But Erdogan insisted that he had held "fruitful and sincere" talks with his US counterpart.The final NATO summit statement did not mention Turkey's role at the airport, but did stress that the alliance would continue to pay to keep the facility open.Much of the summit Monday was dedicated to trying to forge a way forward by greenlighting a 2030 reform plan to revitalise an alliance that Macron warned in 2019 was undergoing "brain death".Allies endorsed a new cyber defence policy to tackle rising threats and agreed for the first time that an attack in space could trigger the Article 5 collective defence clause.They also committed to increasing the alliance's budget and spending more on "common funding" -- but details remained sparse after opposition to increased spending led by France.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-promises-to-lay-down-red-lines-to-russia-s-vladimir-putin-101623709822394.html
15-06-2021||World||Vehicle plows into Minnesota protesters, killing 1: Police||A woman was killed and three other people were injured when a vehicle drove into demonstrators during a protest in the Minneapolis neighborhood where a Black man was fatally shot this month during his attempted arrest by members of a federal task force, police said Monday.The crash happened at about 11:40 pm Sunday in Minneapolis' Uptown neighborhood. Witnesses said the driver of an SUV struck a parked car, tossing it into the crowd of demonstrators. Police spokesman John Elder did not confirm that account, and said authorities are still investigating.Police said protesters pulled the driver from his vehicle and witnesses told police that demonstrators began striking him. The driver was taken into custody and was being treated for injuries at a hospital. Authorities have not released his name or the names of the three people who were injured.The brother of the woman who died identified her as Deona M Knajdek. Garrett Knajdek told the Star Tribune his sister would have celebrated her 32nd birthday on Wednesday. He said she had 11- and 13-year-old daughters, and was actively involved in issues surrounding social justice.“She constantly (was) sacrificing herself for everyone around her,” he said, “no matter the cost, obviously.”Police said the driver’s motive was not immediately known, but that a preliminary investigation indicated drugs or alcohol may have been a contributing factor. A 35-year-old St. Paul man was booked into the Hennepin County Jail early Monday on suspicion of criminal vehicular homicide, driving after a license was canceled and providing false information to police. The man, who hasn't been formally charged, has multiple convictions for driving while impaired, according to online court records.A witness told Minnesota Public Radio that the SUV was going very fast and appeared to accelerate as it got closer to demonstrators who had blocked off a street. D.J. Hooker said the driver struck a car parked across one of the traffic lanes, sending that car flying.“There was one line of barriers and then a second barrier, and he sped up. He sped up. He went even faster as he approached us. You could hear it ... start going even faster as he got close to us,” Hooker said. He told Minnesota Public Radio News, “the car went through the air and it hit a young woman.”Another witness, Brett Williams, said Knajdek was thrown into a stop light.Her mother, Deb Kenney, asked for prayers for the driver's family.“The emotion we need to have right now is we need to be grateful that Deona was here and she shared it all with us,” Kenney said, according to KARE-11. “She wouldn’t want us to be angry at that man. She would have let it go in a minute, and said, what could we have done for him? What would have made a difference for him?”She added: "She was here on her own accord, she chose to do this. She wanted to make that impact.”Kenney said she hopes people don’t stop protesting because of her daughter's death, but she said demonstrators should make sure they are staying safe.Other injuries and deaths have been reported involving vehicles at protests across the U.S. as people have increasingly taken to streets to press their grievances. In Minneapolis, marching onto freeways has become a common tactic in recent years. Last year, a semitrailer rolled into a crowd marching on a closed Minneapolis freeway following George Floyd's death. No one was seriously injured.In response to such protests, Republican politicians in several states, including Oklahoma, Florida and Iowa, have sought legal immunity for drivers who hit protesters.There had been ongoing protests in Uptown, about 2 1/2 miles (4 kilometers) south of downtown, since the June 3 shooting of Winston Boogie Smith Jr., a 32-year-old father of three, by members of a federal U.S. Marshals Service task force. The Uptown area includes a mix of trendy restaurants, shops and theaters popular with the city’s younger professionals, many of whom live in apartments and condominiums in the area.The city of Minneapolis has been on edge since Floyd’s death under an officer’s knee and the more recent fatal police shooting of another Black man, Daunte Wright, in a nearby suburb.Smith was killed earlier this month. According to authorities, members of the U.S. Marshals Fugitive Task Force were trying to arrest Smith on a warrant for allegedly being a felon in possession of a gun. The Marshals Service said in a statement that Smith, who was in a parked vehicle, didn’t comply with law enforcement and “produced a handgun resulting in task force members firing upon the subject.” State investigators said evidence showed he fired the gun from inside his vehicle.Smith died at the scene.

15-06-2021||World||UK delays lockdown easing by a month||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson delayed his plans to lift Covid-19 lockdown restrictions by a month on Monday, warning that the more infectious Delta variant meant if he did nothing thousands more people might die.Under the final stage of a plan outlined by Johnson in February, he had hoped to lift most social restrictions on June 21, meaning pubs, restaurants, nightclubs and other hospitality venues could fully reopen. That much-anticipated step was pushed back to July 19.“I think it is sensible to wait just a little longer,” Johnson told a news conference. “As things stand, and on the evidence that I can see right now. I’m confident that we will not need more than four weeks.”S Africa rejects 2mn jabsSouth Africa’s vaccine roll-out has been hit by further delays as it will have to discard at least 2 million Johnson & Johnson shots produced in the country.The vaccines were found by the US Food and Drug Administration to be unsuitable for use due to possible contamination of their ingredients at a Baltimore plant. South Africa was expecting to use them to inoculate its health care workers and people aged 60 and older.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-delays-lockdown-easing-by-a-month-101623706649997.html
15-06-2021||World||NATO declares China is a ‘security challenge’||NATO leaders targeted China in a strongly worded warning on Monday, declaring the nation poses a constant security challenge, is trying to undermine world order and is working on nuclear missile development at a worrisome pace.In a summit statement, the leaders said that China’s goals and “assertive behaviour present systemic challenges to the rules-based international order and to areas relevant to alliance security”. The warning to China comes as US President Joe Biden has stepped up his effort to rally allies to speak in a more unified voice about China’s human rights record, its trade practices and its military’s assertive behaviour that has unnerved US allies in the Pacific.While the 30 heads of state and government avoided calling China a rival, they expressed concern about what they said were its “coercive policies”, the opaque ways it is modernising its armed forces and its use of disinformation.China takes a dig at G7, labels its role ‘sinister’China denounced a joint statement by the G7 leaders that rebuked Beijing as a gross interference in the country’s internal affairs.China’s embassy in London said it was dissatisfied and opposed to mentions of Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan that distorted the facts and exposed the “sinister intentions of a few countries such as the US”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nato-declares-china-is-a-security-challenge-101623706332615.html
15-06-2021||World||Covid-19 virus quicker than vaccines, warns WHO as G7 vows to share doses||The WHO warned Monday that Covid-19 was moving faster than the vaccines, and said the G7's vow to share a billion doses with poorer nations was simply not enough.Global health leaders also warned the pledge was too little, too late, with more than 11 billion shots needed.Faced with outrage over disparities in jab access, the Group of Seven industrialised powers pledged during a weekend summit in Britain to take their total dose donations to more than one billion, up from 130 million promised in February."I welcome the announcement that G7 countries will donate 870 million (new) vaccine doses, primarily through Covax," World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told journalists."This is a big help, but we need more, and we need them faster. Right now, the virus is moving faster than the global distribution of vaccines."More than 10 thousand people are dying every day... these communities need vaccines, and they need them now, not next year."While people in many wealthy nations are enjoying a return to a sense of normalcy thanks to high vaccination rates, the shots remain scarce in less well-off parts of the world.In terms of doses administered, the imbalance between the G7 and low-income countries, as defined by the World Bank, is 73 to one.Many of the donated G7 doses will be filtered through Covax, a global body charged with ensuring equitable vaccine distribution.Run by the WHO, the Gavi vaccine alliance and CEPI, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, it has to date shipped more than 87 million vaccine doses to 131 countries -- far fewer than anticipated.70% targetThe WHO wants at least 70 percent of the world's population vaccinated by the next G7 meeting in Germany next year."To do that, we need 11 billion doses. The G7 and G20 can make this happen," said Tedros.Medical charity Doctors Without Borders questioned how sincere the G7 was in pursuing vaccine equity."We need to see more clarity around the actual number of doses donated, and exactly how long it's going to take to translate their pledges into real impact and access," the medical charity's Hu Yuanqiong told AFP.As well as dose sharing, the G7 anti-pandemic battle plan includes commitments to avert future pandemics -- slashing the time taken to develop and licence vaccines to under 100 days, reinforcing global surveillance and strengthening the WHO.But observers voiced scepticism at their willingness to follow through on the last point especially."I will believe (that) point when the contributions to WHO are increased," tweeted Ilona Kickbusch, founding director and chair of the Global Health Centre in Geneva.$16 billion call Others stressed the need to quickly resolve the issue of Covid vaccine patent protections, to boost production.Full-fledged negotiations towards a possible suspension of intellectual property protections for Covid vaccines, as well as other medical tools needed to battle the pandemic, have just begun at the World Trade Organization after months of contentious debate.G7 leaders "say they want to vaccinate the world by the end of next year, but their actions show they care more about protecting the monopolies and patents of pharmaceutical giants," lamented Max Lawson, Oxfam's head of inequity policy.Human Rights Watch agreed."Focusing on vaccines and making charitable donations are not enough," Aruna Kashyap, Human Rights Watch's senior counsel for business and human rights, told AFP."The G7's failure to unequivocally support a temporary waiver of global intellectual property rules is deadly status quo."WHO and partners also highlighted the desperate need for funds to overcome the pandemic.More than $16 billion (13.2 billion euros) is still needed this year to fully fund efforts to speed up production and access to Covid-19 diagnostics, treatments and vaccines against Covid.That figure represents less that one percent of annual global defence expenditure, the WHO's emergencies director Michael Ryan pointed out."Surely we can afford one percent of that to save lives and bring this pandemic to an end."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-virus-quicker-than-vaccines-warns-who-as-g7-vows-to-share-doses-101623695635330.html
15-06-2021||World||Lot of work remains to be done to tackle land degradation: Modi at UN meet||Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday reiterated the need for the world to come together to combat land degradation as a “collective responsibility” as it threatens the very foundations the societies and economies are built on and called for more actions saying, “a lot of work lies ahead of us”.Virtually delivering a keynote address at a high-level meeting at the United Nations on land degradation and drought, Modi went on to detail steps and measures India is taking at home to address the situation and helping other developing nations in the spirit of South-South cooperation.“It is mankind’s collective responsibility to reverse the damage to land caused by human activity,” the prime minister said, in his capacity as the president of the 14th Session of the Conference of Parties of United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).If left unchecked, land degradation “will erode the very foundation of our societies, economies, food security, health, safety and quality of life,” he said further, and added that the world must “reduce the tremendous pressure on land and its resources. Clearly, a lot of work lies ahead of us”.The United Nations has estimated that one-fifth of Earth’s land area - which is more than 2 billion hectares - is degraded, including more than half of all agricultural land. And 12 million hectares of land is lost to desertification, land degradation and drought each year. In all, nearly, 95% of calories from food come from soil, yet top soil erosion has accelerated by tenfold due to human activity. The world loses 24 billion tons of fertile soil annually due to dry-land degradation, with significant negative impacts on food production and economic activity.The high-level dialogue launched on Monday will assess progress made in this fight against land degradation and propose a way forward at the end of the UN Decade for Deserts and the Fight against Desertification, and the start of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.Prime Minister Modi reiterated India’s commitment to the cause linking it to the “importance (India gives) to land and (considers) the sacred earth as our Mother”.Modi said India has taken the lead to highlight land degradation issues at international forums and pointed to the “Delhi Declaration” of 2019, which had called for “better access and stewardship over land” and emphasise gender-sensitive transformative projects.Over the last 10 years, India has added around three million hectares of forest cover, which, he said, enhanced the cumulative forest cover to almost one-fourth of the country’s total area, he said, adding, “We are on track to achieve our national commitment of land degradation neutrality.”India is also working to restore 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030, which would help create an additional carbon sink - natural assets that absorb carbon dioxide - of 2.5 to 3 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. “We believe that restoration of land can start a cycle for good soil health, increased land productivity, food security and improved livelihoods,” the prime minister said, and went on to speak of “novel” efforts under way in the Banni region in the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat, which is marked by degraded land and lack of rain. India is restoring land there by developing grasslands.Modi then turned to assistance India is providing to others to deal with land degradation, which, he said, poses a special challenge to the developing world. “In the spirit of South-South cooperation, India is assisting fellow developing countries to develop land restoration strategies,” he added. India is setting up a centre of excellence “to promote a scientific approach towards land degradation issues”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lot-of-work-remains-to-be-done-to-tackle-land-degradation-modi-at-un-meet-101623695206528.html

15-06-2021||India||Interim compliance officer named: Twitter||Microblogging platform Twitter on Tuesday said that it has retained a chief compliance officer, ending a continuing stalemate with the government over the new social media and intermediary guidelines.“We are keeping the MeitY apprised of the progress at every step of the process,” a Twitter spokesperson said. “An interim Chief Compliance Officer has been retained and details will be shared with the ministry directly soon. Twitter continues to make every effort to comply with the new guidelines.”The chief compliance officer will be liable for penal action under the new guidelines in case of violation or failure to follow the rules.On June 7, HT first reported that the microblogging platform had conveyed to the government that it was “committed to complying with the new rules”, even as it raised concerns regarding the safety of its employees in the country and intimidation by the police. The social media company sought a week from the ministry to comply with the key clauses of the new guidelines after the ministry issued it an ultimatum earlier this month. The government said Twitter would have to face “unintended consequences” that can involve it losing its legal protection from criminal liability for user content if it does not comply with the new rules for digital content.The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, was notified in February, with all clauses of it coming into force on May 25. These guidelines require digital companies, such as Twitter, WhatsApp, and Facebook, to change how they regulate content, appoint nodal officers for compliance and grievance redressal, and adopt features such as traceability of messages and voluntary user verification.There have been several instances of confrontation between the United States-based company and the government of India, particularly around the government’s content takedown orders and Twitter’s actions against prominent people linked to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for violation of its terms of use.Against this backdrop, the new IT rules hardened the stand-off last month, with the microblogging website earlier asking for three months to comply, raising concerns over the “core elements” of the norms, and flagging potential threats to the safety of its employees after a visit by the Delhi Police the same month.Twitter becomes the latest social media firm to convey to the ministry that it has met the requirements, with Google, WhatsApp and Facebook already sharing the details of the officers with the government. The new rules have been contested by several parties, including WhatsApp which has argued that the traceability provision mandated in the guidelines would violate end to end encryption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-appoints-chief-compliance-officer-in-effort-to-comply-with-the-new-guidelines-101623781387288.html

Shah also nudged government agencies to publicise mobile applications related to weather forecasting such as Umang, Rain Alarm and Damini that have been developed by the Indian Meteorological Department. Damini app, for instance, tracks movement of thunderstorms and sends out alerts three hours ahead of lightning strikes.In recent years, lightning has been identified as the single most killer in the country as compared to all other natural disasters. It kills an average of 2,000 to 2,500 people annually, according to a note on the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology’s website.Shah also directed officials to formulate standard operating procedures (SOPs) immediately to broadcast IMD warnings on lightning strikes to the public via TV, FM Radio, SMS and other mediums, the government statement said.At the meeting, Shah also reviewed the long-term measures for formulation of a comprehensive and overarching policy to mitigate the perennial flood problems of the country. He asked the Jal Shakti ministry to work out a mechanism for desilting large dams, which will help in increasing dam storage capacity and flood control. The IMD and the Central Water Commission should use state-of-the-art technology and satellite data for more accurate weather and flood predictions, Shah said, according to the statement.He also directed the National Disaster Response Force NDRF) to immediately hold meetings with the heads of the SDRF in flood prone states. A large area in India is prone to flood in which Ganga and the Brahmaputra are main flood basins and Assam, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal are most flood prone states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-reviews-preparedness-to-deal-with-floods-issues-directions-101623780367067.html

The National AEFI committed on Tuesday released a report where it said that a sexagenarian man died due to anaphylaxis, which means a severe allergic reaction, following vaccination. The beneficiary had received the Covishield jab.“This is the first death linked to Covid-19 vaccination due to anaphylaxis. It re-emphasises the need to wait for 30 minutes at the inoculation centre after receiving the jab. Most anaphylactic reactions occur during this period and prompt treatment prevents deaths,” Dr NK Arora, advisor to the National AEFI committee was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.The health ministry also said that the death rate is 0.0002% out of the 235 million doses administered so far, highlighting that the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the risks.The national AEFI committee report also said that there were 2.7 deaths per million vaccine doses administered and 4.8 hospitalisations per million vaccine doses administered as per data recorded till the first week of April.“The safety parameters of vaccines approved in our country are very good. When 23.5 crore doses were given then AEFI leading to deaths was as low as 0.0002% which comes to 488 deaths but these deaths are not because of vaccination,” health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said.“There can be multiple factors and detailed analysis will be conducted by district and state level officials and then a conclusion will be reached on whether death was due to vaccine or due to any underlying comorbidities or other conditions,” the health ministry said.The ministry said that reports which showed at least 488 deaths between January 16 and June 7 following vaccination were linked to post-Covid complications, were based on ‘incomplete data’ and ‘limited understanding’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-tells-why-waiting-for-30-mins-post-vaccination-at-inoculation-centre-needed-101623777645708.html
15-06-2021||India||HC asks Karnataka govt to formulate guidelines, prevent police from leaking info to media||The Karnataka High Court (HC) on Tuesday directed the state government to respond with more comprehensive guidelines to ensure police personnel do not leak information to the media before the conclusion of investigations, HT has learnt.The state government has been given four weeks to prepare the guidelines, said a person aware of the developments.“The petitioner advocate also argued on the point that there has been no cases or details of information given about the action taken by the police against leak of such information,” the person cited above said.A division bench of Chief Justice of Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj heard the matter which also involves a plea by the petitioner to prevent the publishing and broadcasting of indecent and obscene material on TV news channels platforms.The state government filed its objections by submitting circulars issued to police personnel from 2008 with respect to the non-disclosure of information to the media when the case is in sub judice.The court added that these guidelines were not sufficient as they have to have stringent action to be taken against any such incident.The person cited above said that with respect to the aspect of defining programme code, submission was made that the media content should be regulated in news channels.To which the court said that these channels may also have a presence on platforms like YouTube where the news could be viewed.“The petitioner advocate put forth an argument that the cable TV act has no regulating mechanism and has no teeth. Thereby there is a need for regulating the content in the media,” the person said.The petition, filed by a retired bank employee and union activist H Nagabhushan Rao, also sought the police not to leak such video clips and other incriminating material to the digital media, Hindustan Times reported on April 12.“It is described as sex scandal of several political leaders, religious leaders and other celebrities. Though the programme is shown as news, it is shown as if it is an A-rated movie with sound effects graphics and repetitive dialogue delivery in thematic sound effects. While telecasting the news the sex video tapes are exhibited in a different form, sometimes as blurred photographs and sometimes with or without editing or without censoring,” the petition stated.The plea came a month after the alleged sex-for-job scandal that rocked the Karnataka government. It involved then cabinet minister Ramesh Jarkiholi. A social activist filed a complaint on behalf of the victim along with a video and audio recording which was played on loop by TV news channels.The HC is expected to hear the case again on June 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-asks-karnataka-govt-to-formulate-guidelines-prevent-police-from-leaking-info-to-media-101623778267132.html

However, three of the 14 " core members" of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), the Centre's advisory body, said the gap was doubled without the agreement of the scientific group, that the government said recommended the increased gap, according to a Reuters report.Announcing the decision to increase the gap between the two doses from six to eight weeks to 12-16 weeks, the government said it was recommended by NTAGI, based on real-life evidence mainly from the United Kingdom. But the NTAGI members refuted the claim and said the body did not have enough data to make the recommendation, reported Reuters.Also read| India missed early alarm, let deadly coronavirus variant spread: Health expertsThe former director of the National Institute of Epidemiology said, reported Reuters, the advisory body had backed increasing the interval to 8-12 weeks, which was the gap advised by the World Health Organisation (WHO). But the body did not have the data to extend the interval beyond 12 weeks, Gupte added, reported Reuters."Eight to 12 weeks is something we all accepted, 12 to 16 weeks is something the government has come out with," Reuters quoted him as saying. "This may be alright, may not be. We have no information on that," he added.The government's decision to increase the interval between the doses came at a time when the country was facing a huge paucity of Covid-19 vaccine doses in comparison to demand and surging infections.It had later denied that the interval increase was not to address vaccine shortage but was a "scientific decision."Gupte's colleague Mathew Varghese also said that the recommendation was only for 8-12 weeks.

15-06-2021||India||EPFO extends deadline for mandatory UAN-Aadhaar linking to September 1||The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) on Tuesday extended the deadline for mandatory Aadhaar-linking with universal account number (UAN) of individual subscribers by three months from June 1 to September 1, 2021. The extension was ordered on the request of the government in view of the second wave of Covid pandemic, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.The decision has been taken after several representations to Union labour minister Santosh Gangwar about the inconvenience faced by EPF subscribers at the time of pandemic, they said requesting anonymity. Issuing a circular regarding extension of the deadline on June 15, EPFO said: “Further, all the employers may be advised by concerned field offices to be ready for implementation after the period of deferment.” HT has reviewed a copy of the circular.Hindustan Times on June 10 reported that the two social security arms under the Labour ministry took different views on making Aadhaar mandatory to meet one of the clauses of the Code on Social Security (CoSS).While the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) decided against denying benefits to insured persons for want of Aadhaar, EPFO went ahead to make Aadhaar-linking mandatory from June 1, citing a law which was yet-to-be fully operational. This made it impossible for employers to deposit provident fund contributions of lakhs of employees who hadn’t linked their accounts to the 12-digit identity number.EPFO, with more than 220 million accounts and a corpus of ₹12 lakh crore, is one of the world’s largest social security organisations.The labour ministry on May 5 specifically clarified that the government has only notified the particular clause – “Section 142” of the Code on Social Security and as other provisions of the Code were pending, Aadhaar should not be made mandatory at this stage.“At present, only Section 142 of CoSS is notified, which aims to create the National Database for unorganised workers (NDUW) and not to create any inconvenience to members of ESIC or EPFO,” one of the officials said.On May 5, Gangwar said Section 142 was notified “only for collection of data of workers including migrant workers. No benefit will be denied to workers for want of Aadhaar”.Saraswathi Kasturirangan, partner at consultancy firm Deloitte India said: “Effective 1 September 2021, employers will not be able to remit PF for cases where such linking is not done... Employers need to use this extended time to make sure that suitable communication is sent to employees advising them of the consequences of non-linking, and provide guidance on how the linking can be completed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/epfo-extends-deadline-for-mandatory-uan-aadhaar-linking-to-september-1-101623776707176.html

The vaccine's clinical trials are in an advanced stage of completion in India, it added."What we are learning from the available data is that this vaccine is very safe and it is highly effective but what makes this vaccine relevant for today is the fact that this vaccine will be produced in India by Serum Institute," NITI Aayog member V K Paul said at a press conference.The Serum Institute of India (SII) also produces Covishield, one of the first Covid-19 vaccines to be available in the country.Preparatory work for the production of Novavax has been done by the SII, Paul said, adding that they are also conducting a bridging trial which is in advanced stages of completion."I am also hoping that they will also start trials on children, which is of a special interest to all of us. The pace of vaccination should see a renewed energy from next week onward when we will realign our efforts, that of the state and effective scale up at the ground level.

The police had then claimed to have identified the suspects but there wasn’t convinced if the two cousins had been murdered or died by suicide.After meeting the family, Himanta Biswa Kumar said he had asked the police to probe both angles. “If its murder, the accused should be arrested and handed appropriate punishment. And if it’s a case of suicide, the probe should be on what led the sisters to commit the act,” he said on Sunday.Assam police chief Bhaskarjyoti on Tuesday said the girls were killed.“The accused involved in rape and murder are Muzamil Sheikh (20), Farizul Rehman (22) and Nasibul Sheikh (19). We have been able to establish their direct involvement in the crime,” he added.The DGP said the police have started the process of retrieving data deleted from the mobile phones of the accused. Citing initial investigations, the chief minister on Sunday said the victims probably knew the accused and may have been in touch with them before the crime. Mahanta said the police were yet to receive the autopsy report of the two girls. The viscera of the girls has been preserved for tests and DNA fingerprinting of evidence collected from the accused and victims would be done.“We did a recreation of the crime scene on Tuesday during which independent witnesses, magistrate and forensic experts were present. I am sure that the medical reports will match our findings,” Mahanta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-teens-found-hanging-from-tree-were-raped-then-murdered-7-arrested-cops-101623774066818.html

Everyone is now saying that demand for coal may come down after some time. So this is the right time for us to completely fully extract the available coal in the country so that we will be able to bring more capital into an investment, develop backward regions and establish good industries and ensure that the country is progressing on the right track," PTI quoted coal additional secretary M Nagaraju as saying.Also read: Coal India declares dividend of ₹3.5 as Q4 profits drops marginallyThe statement by Nagaraju on increased coal extraction comes as the debate on climate change grows with an assumption that the demand of coal may go down after some time.Coal reserves, he noted, are situated in the most backward regions with a high poverty rate. So, the development of these mining blocks will provide the poor people residing in these areas with opportunities for upliftment, PTI quoted Nagaraju as saying during the second stakeholders' consultation on the second tranche of the auction of coal mines for commercial mining. the stakeholders' consultation was organized by industry body Ficci."This year there was a decline in imports of non-coking coal. But coking coal continues to be on a steady rise," he added as India still imports a substantial amount of coal, he said, both coking and non-coking leading to increased spending of foreign exchange.The government has offered 67 coal mines for sale in the second tranche of auction of mines for commercial mining. This is the highest number of mines on offer in a tranche after the beginning of the auction regime in 2014, he said as per the PTI report||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/its-right-time-to-completely-extract-coal-for-development-says-centre-101623769360641.html

The Government had issued a notice to Twitter giving it one last chance to "immediately" comply with the new IT rules and warned that failure to adhere to the norms will lead to the platform losing exemption from liability under the IT Act. Following this, Twitter had assured the Indian government last week that it is in advanced stages of finalising the appointment of chief compliance officer as required under the new IT rules, and that it will submit additional details within a week. A Twitter spokesperson on Tuesday said the company continues to make every effort to comply with the new guidelines, and is keeping the IT Ministry apprised of progress at every step of the process. An interim Chief Compliance Officer has been retained and details will be shared with the Ministry directly soon, the spokesperson added. The move by Twitter assumes significance as the microblogging platform has been facing heat over delay in complying with the IT rules that mandate large digital platforms to undertake greater due diligence, and make them more accountable and responsible for the content that is hosted. As per the rules, significant social media intermediaries -- those with over 50 lakh users -- are required to appoint a grievance officer, a nodal officer and a chief compliance officer. These personnel have to be residents in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-appoints-interim-chief-compliance-officer-for-india-to-share-details-with-it-ministry-soon-101623771572386.html

15-06-2021||India||SC ends proceedings against 2 Italian marines after 9 yrs of twists and turns||After nine years of twists and turns, the Supreme Court on Tuesday put an end to all legal proceedings in India against the Italian marines who killed two Indian fishermen off the coast of Kerala in 2012.The bench of justices Indira Banerjee and MR Shah gave quietus to civil and criminal proceedings pending against the two marines after noting that compensation of ₹10 crore for the families of the victims “can be said to be a reasonable amount of compensation” and “in the interest of heirs of the deceased”.“We are of the view that this is a fit case to close all the proceedings in India including criminal proceedings in exercise of powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India,” the bench recorded in its 11-page order while ending proceedings against the two marines, Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone.The top court said that the compensation money shall be transferred to the Kerala high court, which will monitor its disbursement to the victim families. The families of the two deceased fishermen have agreed to a compensation of ₹4 crore each in addition to the ₹2 crore already paid by the Italian government. The injured owner of the boat also consented to receiving damages of ₹2 crore.Citing the May 2020 order of the international arbitral tribunal that both India and Italy accepted, the court added that the Republic of Italy shall resume its criminal investigation into the fishermen’s shooting incident of 2012. “It is further directed that the Union of India, Republic of Italy and the State of Kerala shall cooperate with each other in pursuit of that investigation,” said the bench.After Tuesday’s order, civil proceedings pending before the Supreme Court and the Kerala high court as well as a criminal murder case pending before a special court in Delhi shall come to an end.The peaceful burial has followed an intense legal and diplomatic row that began on February 15, 2012 when the marines aboard Italian Vessel MV Enrica Lexie shot dead Valentine, 44, and Ajeesh Pink, 20, who were while fishing off the coast of Kerala. The Kollam police registered a murder case against the marines and arrested the duo on February 19.While the marines and Italy challenged the jurisdiction of the Kerala police by filing a writ petition before the high court in February, the families of the slain fishermen and the injured boat owner filed an admiralty suit before the high court demanding compensation. A separate petition was also filed by Enrica Lexie before the high court seeking permission to continue the voyage with other crew members.In April 2012, the Italian government paid a compensation of ₹1 crore each for the deceased fishermen and ₹17 lakh for the boat owner in an out-of-court settlement. But the petition by Lexie was dismissed by a division bench of the high court compelling the shipping company to move the Supreme Court. On May 2, the Supreme Court allowed the vessel to sail away with all 24 crew members, subject to certain terms and conditions.To be sure, the criminal case continued against the marines and, on May 18, 2012, the Kollam police filed a charge sheet against the two, charging them with murder and attempt to murder. The writ petition filed by the marines along with their government failed before the high court which on May 29, 2012, affirmed the jurisdiction by the Kerala and the concerned circle inspector of police at Kollam.The marines and the Italian government then rushed to the Supreme Court, seeking protection under the United Nation Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The Italian government asserted that India and Italy, having signed and ratified the 1982 treaty, must settle the dispute concerning the incident in question, in terms of the binding dispute resolution mechanism provided under the UNCLOS.The Italian government also claimed sovereign immunity for its marines but, by a judgment in January 2013, the Supreme Court dismissed this contention and upheld India’s criminal jurisdiction over the marines. At the same time, the court clarified that Kerala had no jurisdiction to investigate into the incident since the incident had taken place over the Contiguous Zone that was in exclusive jurisdiction of the Union government.While the proceedings were then shifted to a special court in Delhi and the probe was handed over to the National Investigation Agency, the top court gave liberty to the Italian government to raise issues of UNCLOS at appropriate forum.Then came a phase of diplomatic tension when the marines, who were allowed by the top court in February 2013 to go to Italy for a brief period to vote in the general elections, did not come back, and Italy went back on its undertaking. As the court fumed over breach of undertaking by Italian ambassador Daniele Mincini, the Indian government restrained Mincini from leaving the country. Following diplomatic pressures, Italy returned the marines to India.In September 2014, Latorre sought permission to go back to Italy for medical treatment, and the court allowed it on humanitarian grounds. The initial period of four months was later extended from time to time.In July 2015, Italy took the case to International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, an independent judicial body under the UNCLOS, which asked both India and Italy to suspend all court proceedings and referred the matter to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, an intergovernmental organisation based in The Hague in Netherlands.On a joint request by both the governments, the Supreme Court suspended all proceedings against the marines by an order in August 2015.In May 2016, the apex court allowed the second marine, Girone, to leave for Italy. In September that year, the Centre told the Supreme Court it had no objection if the marines were allowed to remain in Italy until the arbitration proceedings before the tribunal were over, following which the court permitted their stay at home.In May 2020, the tribunal ruled that the marines enjoyed immunity since they were exercising official functions in their capacity as Italian state officials when the incident occurred. It, therefore, ordered India to stop criminal proceedings against them. At the same time, the tribunal held that Italy violated India’s right to navigation by firing at the fishing boat and said that the country would have to compensate India for loss of life and damage to property.On July 3, 2020, the Centre moved the top court, saying it had accepted the PCA’s ruling and wanted the proceedings to be closed. When the plea was taken up by the court in August 2020, it clarified that the proceedings could be closed only after the families of the victims were heard and given “adequate” compensation.Again, in April this year, the Supreme Court reiterated that the compensation money must be deposited in the registry of the court and the victims should agree to it before the proceedings could be ended. Last week, the court was informed that compensation of ₹10 crore for the families of the victims has been deposited. It had then reserved the order that was delivered on Tuesday, ending all proceedings in India against the marines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-ends-proceedings-against-2-italian-marines-after-7-yrs-of-twists-and-turns-101623770226603.html

It said Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genetics Consortium (INSACOG) has helped in the detection of Covid-19 Variants of Concern (VOC) in real time, which was also shared with the relevant states. The present turnaround time for VOCs is only 10 to 15 days.In addition to the existing 10 laboratories, 18 more labs have also been approved for incorporation in the INSACOG network, the government said on enhancing the number and capacity of genome sequencing.Also read| Covid-19 vaccination: 'All deaths following inoculation cannot be linked to it'The Centre clarified that a sampling strategy is developed based on the country's objectives, scientific principles and World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines.Accordingly, in view of rising Covid-19 cases, the existing capacity of RGSLs and timely detection of the VOCs including other variants, the strategy was revised to “Sentinel Surveillance” on April 12, the government said.The strategy was also endorsed by the WHO, the government claimed. Under the present Sentinel surveillance strategy, states have identified five labs and five tertiary hospitals each as sentinel sites for sending samples to designated RGLS. Each of the sites sends 15 samples routinely for WGS to the designated labs."In addition to the sentinel surveillance, an additional event-based surveillance for special/unusual events like large clusters, unusual clinical presentation, vaccine breakthrough, suspected reinfections etc to detect, investigate and respond to these was also approved," the Union ministry of health and family affairs informed. This is in line with the revised objectives of INSACOG.INSACOG is a forum established under the ministry on December 25 to study and monitor genome sequencing and virus variation of circulating strains of Covid-19 in India.Initially, sampling was done to identify international travellers who could be carriers of new strains and to find out if the variants are already present in the population.Also read | Online registration or appointment booking not mandatory to get Covid shot: GovtA two-pronged strategy was adopted later, as per which, international passengers arriving from selected countries and their contacts were targeted for genome sequencing and community-based sampling of 5% of the RTPCR positive cases from each state was done."It is important to note that the 5% norm was selected based on the then daily new case load (10,000-15,000 per day) and the sequencing capacity of the RGSLs at that time," the government explained.The government said both these objectives were achieved when it was conclusively established that international passengers were carrying the mutant strains and their transmission has also been established in the community (UK variant) in a few states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/insacog-helped-detect-covid-variants-of-concern-data-shared-with-states-uts-govt-101623759224765.html
15-06-2021||India||From leadership aspirations to losing LJP, how Chirag Paswan got outmaneuvered||On November 23, 2020, soon after the Bihar Assembly election verdict, Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) chief Chirag Paswan had put up a brave front despite being relegated to just one seat. He derived consolation in achieving his aim of reducing the Janata Dal (United) to a poor third, which many political analysts felt was done at the behest of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).While the BJP denied that it had anything to do with Paswan quitting the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the state while remaining with NDA at the Centre, and chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar and Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi sharing dais at public meetings, the murmurs did not go away.Chirag Paswan’s attacks on Kumar kept getting more pointed as the election progressed. He seemed to be on a mission to dislodge Kumar, the man his father, the late Ram Vilas Paswan, had helped install as CM 15 years earlier by dislodging the 15-year Rashtriya Janata Dal rule in 2005. Chirag Paswan wanted to play a decisive role post election, but the outcome left him with little leverage — at either the Centre or in the state.Yet, he found solace in the fact that despite its near wipeout, LJP had gathered enough votes to upset JD-U’s calculations.The JD(U) push, the BJP silence That was over six months ago. And that is indeed a long time in politics, as Chirag Paswan learnt this week. Nitish Kumar waited, and has now extracted his political revenge. The JD-U has played an active role in pulling the rug from under Chirag Paswan’s feet by engineering his ouster as both parliamentary party leader and party president.The BJP has maintained a silence on the happenings so far. “What do we have to do with whatever is happening? It is an internal matter of the LJP.” said Bihar BJP president, Sanjay Jaiswal.While Chirag Paswan has won support from other quarters such as the RJD and the Congress, the BJP’s role has drawn attention. He had openly asserted during the assembly elections that he had picture of Narendra Modi in his heart and that he would like a BJP-LJP government to be installed in the state. Top Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh functionaries and BJP leaders joined his party just ahead of election, leading to speculation about a tacit understanding, though, to be sure, the BJP suspended the rebels promptly.Also Read | The fracture in LJP will impact Bihar’s politicsHowever, the way LJP split from within, and the fact that Chirag Paswan’s uncle, Pashupati Kumar Paras, got instant approval from the Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla for the change in the leadership of the parliamentary party has fuelled speculations that the young leader may have lost the plot in the face of political needs and compulsions of the JD-U and BJP combined.The BJP, despite emerging larger than the JD-U in the elections, has reconciled itself to Nitish Kumar’s leadership in the state. The CM has also been wary of his partner, and expanded his own party’s base by copying Upendra Kushwaha’s formation and the lone sitting LJP MLA in the state assembly.Political analyst NK Choudhary said that the BJP could not afford to antagonise or lose Nitish Kumar at this stage when it is itself faced with stiff challenges from various quarters. “In politics, political requirements govern decision. The basic premise is self-interest and power politics. The BJP may not like to lose Chirag Paswan, but it has been left with no choice. It can’t choose him over Nitish Kumar. Nitish Kumar is a master craftsman when it comes to politics and he has created a situation in which BJP can only play safe at a time when it has bigger challenges in big states and attempts by a new emerging third front to corner BJP in 2024.” he added.The future of PaswanDespite the assembly defeat, Chirag Paswan was positive — till this Monday. Soon after the results, he had said, “LJP has done well. We were at second place at many places, while at some places we lost by less than 2,000 to 3,000 votes. This gives us the platform to fight 2025 elections with full force. The circumstances in which we had to fight election are hidden from none. I got to know on October 7 which seats JD-U was contesting from, while the next day, my father passed away. We did not have enough time to strategise, yet we got higher vote share than earlier. We would have been happy to win more seats for a BJP-LJP government, but that could not happen.” But the assessment no longer holds, given the fragmentation in the party.In the 2005 October assembly elections, the LJP under late Ram Vilas Paswan had contested 204 seats, but could win just 10. Yet, it was content for having played its part in bringing down the RJD regime and also got the rewards. Chirag Paswan, however, finds himself alienated from all sides, even from the ones he seemed to bank on and work for.Also Read | In Karnataka, the BJP’s BSY dilemmaFormer director of AN Sinha Institute of Spcial Studies, DM Diwakar, said the episode had given a lifetime lesson to Chirag Paswan, which could either galvanise him to throw his hat in the largely vacant Dalit politics with greater maturity or to demoralise him. “His father was acceptable in all parties. He could get along with all and read the political situation right and that is why Laluji (Lalu Prasad) called him mausam vaigyanik. (Weather scientist). Nobody was ever unhappy with him. But Chirag alienated his own and allowed his adversaries to cash in on his weakness.”Diwakar said that BJP used Chirag Paswan, and his inexperience blurred his vision. “Now, he will have to start afresh without the protective cover of his father. This is different from Tejaswhi Yadav, who has had both his father to guide him and his father’s aides to work with. Whether Chirag Paswan can bounce back like his father did consistently, only time will tell,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-leadership-aspirations-to-losing-ljp-how-chirag-paswan-got-outmanoeuvred-101623762425514.html

He wrote the violence “ill augurs” for democracy.The letter came a day after Suvendu Adhikari, the Leader of the Opposition, and 50 other Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators, met Dhankhar and lodged a complaint on post-poll violence.The ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) hit out, saying the letter was part of a ploy of the BJP-ruled Centre to disturb peace in the state. “We have urged multiple times to give us a list of victims. There were some incidents when law and order were under the ECI [Election Commission of India). But even since Mamata Banerjee was sworn in, the situation has become peaceful. We have never seen the Governor’s tweets when the Centre does not send Covid-19 vaccines, medicines and oxygen,” said Kunal Ghosh, TMC spokesperson.Dhankhar has had an acrimonious relationship with the TMC government.Dilip Ghosh, the state BJP chief, said Dhankhar always speaks on behalf of the people who have been victimised. “Citizens of the state are asking the same questions today... Why is the chief minister silent on the post-poll violence?” In May, Dhankhar visited some of the areas where post-poll violence allegedly broke out. He even went to Assam to meet some of the people who allegedly left the state.In his letter, Dhankhar asked Banerjee to take all steps to restore law and order and provide the much-needed succour to the suffering people and to hold police and administration accountable in an exemplary manner for “partisan stance and failure in containing violence”.In May, the Centre sent an inter-ministerial team to take stock of the alleged post-poll violence in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-witnessed-worst-post-poll-violence-since-independence-dhankhar-101623761405657.html

International Haj has been cancelled. Hence it has been decided by the Haj Committee of India that all the applications for Haj-202l stands cancelled,” the circular said.The Haj and Umrah Ministry of Saudi Arabia on June 12 said that it will only allow 60,000 fully vaccinated residents between the ages 18 and 65 to attend Haj 1442. It had also highlighted that the pilgrims should not suffer from any chronic disease. “In light of what the entire world is witnessing with the Covid-19 pandemic and the emergence of new variants, the relevant authorities have continued to monitor the global health situation.

And, of course, the two-month old tiger cub didn’t have a name then. Some forest officials thought the weak cub would not survive, but that didn’t stop them and a team of veterinarians from caring for the small big cat. Three doctors, three forest officials, and a physiotherapist were dedicated to her. They named her Mangala after the Mangala Devi Kannagi Temple.near which she was found. Mangala survived. She is now eight months old, weighs around 30 kg, almost par for the course for a young tigress of that age. And forest officials are preparing to teach her lessons to survive in the wild.For starters, they have fenced off a part of the forest near her enclosure and release small prey to get her used to the idea of hunting.“We have limited her human interactions...and she is learning her wild lessons fast. This is the first time in south India we are rewilding a tiger cub,” said KR Anoop, field director of the Periyar Tiger Reserve, which is spread across 777 square kilometres of Kerala’s Idukki and Pathanamthitta districts.But rewilding is a cumbersome exercise and includes protecting or reintroducing key predators and species. The most high-profile experiment to rewild tigers was in Madhya Pradesh, where two tiger cubs were found abandoned in the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve in 2017. They were one and a half months old. The two cubs, however, did not become used to the idea of killing their prey and were eventually shifted to Bhopal’s zoological park in 2020.In Maharashtra, attempts to rewild cubs have not succeeded. The cub of tigress Avni, who was hunted down in November 2018, was not able to survive in the wild and had to be sent to a zoo. In Pench, a male cub had to be sent to a zoo as he was not able to survive in the wilderness. However, Malini, a tigress, adapted to the wild easily after being kept in an enclosure for several months.Much before her, a hand-reared orphaned cub were successfully re-introduced in the Panna Tiger Reserve in 2010 and it mated with a tigress from Bandhavgarh a year later, reviving the tiger population in the Madhya Pradesh reserve that had lost all tigers in 2008. R Sreenivasa Murthy, former director of Panna Tiger Reserve, said they had to monitor the movement of the fully grown cub to see how he was adapting to the wild. “Initially, we had to help him to catch prey but as there were not any tigers in the wild and there was enough prey, he adapted well,” he said.“It (rewilding) is an uphill task,” said Anish Andheria, president, Wildlife Conservation Trust. “Either the tiger re-introduced in the wild can get hammered by another tiger or can starve. Success of re-wilding depends on many factors.”The first is that there should not be any human imprinting when the young tiger is in an enclosure as even a remotely habituated animal can end up in villages, and into trouble, he said. The second is the ability to bring down different types of prey species in undulating terrain without getting injured. The third and the biggest hurdle is the ability to fight with other tigers in the wild, he said.“It is difficult to teach a tiger how to fight with another tiger in the wild in an enclosure,” Andheria said. “Female tigers have a much higher probability of surviving a rewilding experiment than males. On the positive side, in Madhya Pradesh, six hand-raised tigresses have been re-wilded in the last three years. It is important to note that they had all been released in areas that had very few wild tigers. Release of hand-raised tigers in high-density tiger habitats will be fraught with dangers”, he added.Manu Sathyan, assistant field director of the Periyar reserve forest, said they have started with roosters and rabbits for Mangala.“She has started showing her wild instincts. We will slowly increase the size of the prey,” Sathyan said.The forest officials have set up high-resolution cameras around her enclosure to track her. They say Mangala could be released in the wild, after fitting her with a radio collar, before she turns two. Maybe, when she is 18 months old, said one forest official, who asked not to be named. By the time they are 18 months old, most tiger cubs are capable of hunting by themselves, although many stay with their mother till they turn two-and-a-half. A female tiger becomes sexually mature by the time she is three.But those are all well in Mangala’s future. For now, she has to hunt, and become the apex predator she is. According to standard rewilding procedures, a cub has to make at least 50 kills before being released in the wild.According to the 2018 big cat census, Periyar Tiger Reserve is home to 26 tigers. India has 2,967 tigers, about 70% of the global tiger population.Wildlife expert Dr PS Esa said that rewildling of tigers is a time-consuming and laborious process. “In India, elephants and rhinos were rewilded successfully. Big cats, it is difficult because their hunting territory is vast and usually mothers are the best trainers of their offspring,” Esa said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/abandoned-tiger-cub-in-periyar-reserve-learns-to-hunt-starts-with-roosters-101623761047773.html
15-06-2021||India||In Karnataka, the BJP’s BSY dilemma||Karnataka’s chief minister (CM) BS Yediyurappa and his son, BY Vijayendra, have been making trips to Lingayat mathas (mutt) or monasteries, meeting pontiffs, in what is widely seen as an effort to rally the support of a community that has largely sided with the 78-year-old leader.With key Lingayat leaders making politically charged statements in favour of the CM, speculation is rife that the 78-year-old is trying to consolidate the support base that has so far considered him the “uncrowned” political leader of the community. This, in turn, has also spawned speculation about why the CM has felt the need to rally his base at this particular time — and whether his position is indeed under threat. The main pontiff of Bekkina Kal Matha, Mallikarjun Murugharajendra Swami, on Saturday, said that people should not talk of a leadership change in Karnataka.“No one should talk of a change in leadership which will be a bigger disaster for Karnataka than the Covid-19 pandemic,” the seer said, with Yediyurappa by his side.The rise of YediyurappaIn 2008, BS Yediyurappa led the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to power in Karnataka — the first time the party, conventionally seen as a north Indian outfit, attained electoral and political success in any south Indian state. It was also the product of a long personal and political struggle, which started in 1983 when Yediyurappa first entered the legislative assembly.HD Kumaraswamy of the Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) had broken the alliance with the BJP after nearly two years in power since 2006. He was accused of denying Yediyurappa his turn in becoming CM, which was said to be a part of an earlier agreement between the two parties. Lingayats, believed to be the single largest caste group in Karnataka, saw the denial of the chief ministership to Yediyurappa as an “injustice” to the community.Also Read | Karnataka BJP in-charge Arun Singh to visit state on June 16: MinisterBut while he did make it to power, Yediyurappa’s term since 2008 was riddled with allegations of corruption, infighting, and the surfacing of the illegal iron-ore scam, allegedly masterminded by Gali Janardhana Reddy, who herded legislators to a resort, seeking the removal of Yediyurappa.But the party’s central leadership at the time was weak, compared to what is in place today with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and JP Nadda helming affairs. The party leadership allowed Yediyurappa to step down but still retain control of the government and party by getting a replacement of his choice. Not once but twice — the first time with DV Sadananda Gowda, who was then replaced with Jagadish Shettar.However, Yediyurappa’s difficulties with BJP had become insurmountable from his perspective. He left the party to form the Karnataka Janata Party (KJP) in 2012, reducing the BJP from its tally of 110 out of the 224 seats in 2008 to a mere 40 seats in 2013.“In 2011, when Yediyurappa resigned (from the post of chief minister) there was no one like (Narendra) Modi, our party was not in power at the Centre, our party was not as strong as it is now. We had power only in four states. That time, Yediyurappa was 100 times stronger than he is today but even then the central party got him to resign. Now, times have changed,” said a senior national leader of the BJP, requesting not to be named.The TINA factor for the BJP While it was with Modi’s rise that Yediyurappa returned to the party, the past few years have seen murmurs of a rift between Delhi and Bengaluru as far as the BJP is concerned. Yediyurappa was said to be more keen in staking claim to form the government when BJP did not have the numbers, and then engaging in a strong political offensive to win over defectors. But his political strength in the state was such that the BJP leadership did not want to upset the equations, and was happy to have another state in their kitty. To do so, however, the party had to make a rare compromise — allowing a 75+ leader to occupy executive office, when all other such leaders have been asked to make way for the next generation. Also Read | Himachal BJP’s three-day review meet begins todayThe tensions haven’t subsided through — particularly with regard to the CM’s tenure, appointments, and the political future of his family. While a segment of the BJP leadership, according to party insiders, believes that it can replace Yediyurappa, the party remains wary of a backlash from both the CM and his support base. Unlike the bloodless transition of power in Uttarakhand, Karnataka has been firmly in the control of local chieftains such as Yediyurappa or even Siddaramaiah of the Congress who have firmly resisted any possible interference by their respective central leadership. Former prime minister HD Deve Gowda has played a key role on more than one occasion, negotiating and oscillating between the two national parties, successfully accommodating his son Kumaraswamy as CM twice despite a proportionally lower number of seats compared to the other two.Analysts said that the BJP also does not have an acceptable replacement and is well aware of the damage the 78-year-old can cause if he is removed in haste.Some of Yediyurappa’s demands, people aware of the developments said, was to allow him to complete his term till 2023 at least and accommodate his son, BY Vijayendra.“When the time is right, he (Vijayendra) might also be considered based on his abilities. But not on account of his father. He has already enjoyed all bonuses the party has extended to Yediyurappa,” the BJP national leader cited above said.The BJP, which stormed to power at the Centre in 2014, specifically targeted the Congress for its “dynastic politics”. Yediyurappa is not the only leader who has propped up his family in the BJP, but in Karnataka, his family’s involvement is conspicuous. Another of his sons, BY Raghavendra, is the Member of Parliament from Shivamogga, the CM’s home district. Also Read | ‘Not defections but violence will weaken BJP unit in West Bengal’But the central leadership’s diktats haven’t worked in Yediyurappa’s case. Unlike its strategy in other states, including Uttar Pradesh in 2017, the BJP did announce Yediyurappa as its chief ministerial candidate exactly a year before the 2018 elections. The recent rumblings within the party and government have barely dented Yediyurappa’s confidence that he is the rightful and only claimant to the job.The intra-organisational rift “For the next two years, I will be CM and will focus more on development works for the state,” Yediyurappa said last week, exuding confidence.One of his known detractors is BL Santosh, the national general secretary (organisation), who has so far been unable to replace Yediyurappa but has kept a close eye on Karnataka, people aware of the developments said.A Bengaluru-based political analyst said that any direct effort by Santosh would lead to the regrouping of the Lingayat support base that, at the moment, appears disenchanted with Yediyurappa. “The community stood by him all these years despite knowing he was corrupt. But there is resentment towards his other activities,” said a BJP legislator, requesting anonymity. Any drastic move could however change social equations. The mishandling of the Covid-19 crisis has added to the CM’s challenges, and plays to the advantage of his detractors both within the party and in the Opposition. But the Congress is mired in its own share of infighting between state Congress president DK Shivakumar and legislature party leader Siddaramaiah.Political analysts said that Yediyurappa has, over the years, become this popular and powerful on account of his caste-based politics and coalition-building abilities, which few others in his party can claim.“At the moment, the Lingayat support base to the BJP is routed through Yediyurappa,” A Narayana, political analyst and faculty at the Azim Premji University said. He added the BJP may have no reason to retain Yediyurappa but will not be able to remove him either, unless the CM does not give his consent and is not party to the larger plan.“He has an ability to get people to do what he wants,” said one Bengaluru-based analyst, requesting not to be named.The analyst also added that those calling for Yediyurappa’s removal are also well aware that the power they enjoy is because of the latter’s almost single-handed effort.In an interview with ThePrint, Vijayendra once said that BJP and Yediyurappa are synonymous. And this is probably the biggest challenge for the party as it navigates its troubled relationship with its own CM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-karnataka-the-bjp-s-bsy-dilemma-101623760985574.html

These reports, according to the ministry, were based on "incomplete and limited understanding" of the process."There have been some media reports suggesting an increase in the cases of severe AEFI which have also resulted in ‘succumbing of patients’ post vaccination. As per the media reports, 488 deaths following vaccination are linked to post-Covid complications during 16th Jan 2021 and 7th June 2021 period where the total vaccination coverage was 23.5 crore," the ministry said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAdverse Event Following Immunisation (AEFI) is when any untoward medical occurrence that follows immunisation, but it does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the usage of the vaccine.Deaths or other serious conditions following vaccination are to be investigated at the district level, the ministry said, adding that the state government and the Centre will assess if the causality is linked to the vaccination. "Therefore, any death or hospitalisation following vaccination cannot be automatically assumed to be due to vaccination unless investigated by the AEFI Committees at the district, state and national level and attributed to the Vaccination," the ministry said."Healthcare workers, doctors and vaccine recipients have been always encouraged by the government of India as well as state governments to report all deaths, hospitalisations and events resulting in disability as well as any minor and adverse events following immunization at any point of time after vaccination," it added.Issuing a clarification on the data, the ministry said that the reports were not accurate.The percentage of deaths being reported after vaccination in India is 0.0002% of 23.5 crore doses administered, the ministry said, adding that this was within the expected death rates in a population. "In a population, deaths occur at a certain rate.

I consider Sachin Pilot as leader and Ashok Gehlot is above him. He (Gehlot) is the chief minister, and all have to consider him as the leader. Even Pilot has to consider him as the leader,” said Bhanwar Lal Sharma.The statement came amid calls from the Pilot camp for fulfilling promises made to the former deputy chief minister, who led the rebellion against Gehlot last year.Pilot is believed to have been in touch with Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who played an important role in resolving the political crisis when he rebelled. There have also been demands for Cabinet expansion and political appointments for Pilot’s loyalists. Pilot last week expressed his displeasure over the lack of action even as a committee was formed last year to address the issues he raised against Gehlot. HT has reported the central leadership of the Congress was trying to work out a cabinet reshuffle in Rajasthan.Also Read | As Sachin Pilot camps in Delhi, his loyalists continue attack on GehlotIn July last year, Pilot and his supporters left Jaipur to camp in Haryana’s Manesar, threatening the stability of the Gehlot government. Pilot was removed as the state Congress chief. It was only when the Gandhis intervened and set up a committee under Ajay Maken that he returned to the fold.Sharma said he went to Manesar as his works were not getting done. “But now promises made are fulfilled. All the demands are fulfilled in this budget.” He said nine cabinet berths are vacant and there are 25 aspirants.“Who should be taken, whether the MLAs, who came from BSP (Bahujan Samaj Party), Independents or those with Pilot... Gehlot will take this decision...” Sharma referred to the panel formed to resolve issues raised by the Pilot camp and added committees are formed to pacify people. “What is the fate of these committees? Everybody knows this. If justice is not done for a long time, then the matter is put in cold storage. One of the members of the panel has passed away.”Sharma said Pilot will not defect to the Bharatiya Janata Party. “The resentment issue is being exaggerated...Pilot himself has not said anything to date... This impasse will end soon.” He rejected allegations of phone tapping.Sharma is the third lawmaker from the Pilot faction, who has supported and praised Gehlot.Separately, Sandeep Kumar Yadav, who defected from the BSP and joined the Congress in 2019, said the Pilot camp is repeatedly talking about the workers and their share in the government. “But it was because of them that the government was in crisis last year. The government was saved only because we six and other independents were standing by the government.” He accused the Pilot camp of threatening the stability of the government last year. “The Congress high command should not listen to them. Those who saved the government should be rewarded and honoured.”There was no immediate repose from Pilot or his other loyalists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pilot-camp-mla-calls-gehlot-his-leader-says-everyone-must-accept-his-leadership-101623759845351.html

The meeting was held at party MP and newly-elected LJP parliamentary party leader and Paswan’s uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras’s residence in New Delhi. In a parallel meeting held at Paswan’s residence, the five rebel MPs were removed from the party. “A national executive meeting was held where the decision [to remove all the five MPs from the party] was taken,” party leader Raju Tiwari said. “There is a process of doing things in a party. This [the rebellion] is betrayal,” he said. Late on Monday evening, the Lok Sabha secretariat issued a notification recognising Paras as the leader of the LJP parliamentary party. This came a day after five of the six party MPs informed Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla that they had unanimously elected Paras as LJP’s parliamentary party leader.

Sources close to Paras said that the national council meeting, likely to take place in Patna, may make the MP the national president by amending the party’s constitution which favours one man one post. Meanwhile, after failing to meet his uncle Paras and cousin and Samastipur MP Prince Raj on Monday, Paswan reportedly left a letter behind, offering a compromise by making his mother Reena Paswan the national president. On Tuesday, he tweeted that he tried his best to keep the party together, sharing a letter he wrote to Pashupati Paras on March 29 this year where he urged his uncle to take responsibility of keeping the party united like his late father Ram Vilas Paswan. He also likened the party to a mother who should not be betrayed.Paswan assumed charge of LJP after his father died weeks before the Bihar elections last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ljp-working-committee-removes-chirag-paswan-as-party-chief-101623759065574.html

15-06-2021||India||Odisha villagers oppose Nalco’s new red mud pond fearing impact on farmland||A village in Odisha’s Koraput district is opposing aluminium maker Nalco’s plan to build a new red mud pond, alleging the toxic waste would render their fields unsuitable for agriculture while causing diseases.Since last week, more than 600 tribals, Dalits and members of Other Backward Castes (OBCs) in Dengajaniguda village under Dasamantpur block of Koraput district have been preventing the revenue officials from identifying land near their village for construction of Nalco’s second red mud pond. Red mud, also known as bauxite residue, is an industrial waste generated during the processing of bauxite into alumina (the Bayer process) and is composed of various oxide compounds, including iron oxides which give it the red colour. The disposal and utilisation of red mud have been traditionally hindered due to its extreme alkalinity (pH about 10.5–13.5).Villagers led by Bansi Bisoyi said the existing red mud pond of the alumina refinery, situated about two kms from the village, has already led to several health problems. “Our tubewells spew red water and it is leading to several skin problems among villagers. The doctors are not able to detect the ailments. Water seeping from the first red mud pond has destroyed our farmland, natural streams, nullahs and has affected many people. We are forced to collect water from nearby streams,” alleged Bisoyi. Another villager Tuni Muduli alleged leaching of chemicals from the existing red mud pond has rendered farmlands unsuitable for cultivation.Bisoyi said as the proposed red mud pond is just about 200 metres away from their village, it would further imperil their life. “We have been suffering for more than a decade due to the existing red mud pond that was started in 1986. Imagine what would happen when the new one comes up very close to our homes. We would not let it happen,” said Bisoyi. The proposed red mud pond at Damanjodi block is located on the border of Dasmantpur and Damanjodi.Officials said local tehsildar Ajay Tirkey, accompanied by revenue inspectors, supervisors and a platoon of police force were not allowed to do a survey of the area last week. “The villagers asked us to return and didn’t listen. We had to come back,” said an official of the Koraput administration.Pinki Bisoyi, another villager, said they have not gained anything from Nalco’s alumina refinery, which came up in 80’s in Damanjodi. “As there is no high school, our children are unable to study beyond class 5. There is no employment for our youths,” she alleged.However, Nalco’s group general manager (refinery) Bhimsen Pradhan said the villagers’ allegations are not true. “Contrary to what the villagers allege, there is no leaching of chemicals from the existing red mud pond. For the new red mud pond, we are giving an extra layer of protection,” he said.Local politicians, meanwhile, have lent their support to the popular protest. “Nothing should be done at the expense of the health and lives of people. Nalco has not kept its promise in the past and so local people are wary of the company’s promises,” said Bharatiya Janata Party BJP leader Bhrugu Buxipatra.“It is injustice towards people from villages near Damanjodi who were affected due to Nalco’s mines and plant,” said Koraput district’s Biju Janata Dal (BJD) president Ishwar Chandra Panigrahi. Koraput MLA and district planning board chairman Raghuram Padal urged Nalco authorities to conduct a baseline socio-economic survey to ascertain the condition of people affected by the company’s plant and mines.In July 2019, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) hauled up Nalco for exceeding its limit on daily discharge of red mud and red mud pond effluent. “The daily discharge of red mud and red mud pond effluent from the refinery was consistently higher than the corresponding limits specified by the Odisha State Pollution Control Board during the period from 2012-13 to 2016-17,” CAG report said, noting that Nalco discharged 6,723 tonnes of effluent daily, against the 6,087 tonnes limit set by the board. Similarly, on red mud pond effluent, the limit was set for 5,200 kilolitres per day but Nalco recorded 5,425 kilolitres discharge per day.“The company cannot change or alter either the quality or quantity of the rate of discharge without the previous approval of OSPCB,” the report said, recommending legal action under various laws.Incorporated in 1981 as a public sector enterprise of the central government, Nalco runs Asia’s largest integrated aluminium complex in Damanjodi. However, Nalco’s operations have been criticised for severe social, economic, cultural and environmental impacts, including displacement and inadequate compensation for rehabilitation.In the late 80’s, Nalco acquired over 250 acres of land from 9 families of Dengajaniguda for a pittance. Over the last 4 decades, the 9 families have split up and become more than 100 due to separation and marriages in the families. As the new families did not gain anything from the rehabilitation package declared decades ago, there is considerable resentment.A 2018 research into development, dispossession and impoverishment in villages displaced by Nalco, done by B K Srinivas and Jayanta Kumar, professors from Koraput’s Central University of Odisha, found that the living condition of the displaced people had turned worse over the years. “There is a lack of employment other than manual labour. Villages lacked civic amenities while children were deprived of schooling. Most of the displaced people lived in semi-pucca houses and their source of drinking water continued to be either open wells, hand pumps or pond water,” the study found.Activist Prafulla Samantra said most of the affected villages had lost fertile agricultural land. “Damanjodi has the highest number of displaced families where agricultural land was alienated. In several villages where land was acquired, people were not given any alternate livelihood. Besides, compensation for land was given only to those farmers who had pattas, and several adivasi and Dalit families who did not posses pattas never received compensation and lost their only source of livelihood,” alleged Samantra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-villagers-oppose-nalco-s-new-red-mud-pond-fearing-impact-on-farmland-101623757205316.html

The report released to mark the World Elder Abuse Awareness Day titled “The Silent Tormentor: Covid 19 & the Elderly” is based on a six-city survey of over 3,500 people. It found Covid-19 has led to an increased financial dependency among the elderly amid decreasing income among their caregivers. The report has highlighted the increased elderly abuse and how many old-age homes were struggling to stay afloat. It said the elderly people living in the household settings, mostly with their families, wanted someone to just be with them or to just call them to talk. “This when, over 58% of them had family members who were working or studying from home during the pandemic. Even after being in such close proximity to family, many said that they feel trapped and frustrated even in family settings,” the report said.Almost 40% of the respondents were financially dependent on others and most of them belonged to the age group of 80-89 years. Many respondents said they did not get the required assistance mostly because their caretakers either lost jobs or faced pay cuts.Also Read | For those with dementia, Covid’s impact has been brutalMost of the elderly surveyed complained of abuse. Though many were verbally abused by their home-restricted family members, 23% of them were even slapped or beaten. Nearly half of these abused people said the main abusers were their sons and while in a quarter of responses, it was daughters-in-law. Less than 15% said that daughters have been abusive towards them.Some of the major challenges that caregivers said they faced dealing with their elderly parents or grandparents during the pandemic were giving their medicines on time, taking care of their special food requirements, budgeting for their expenses. Many even said it was highly difficult to handle their mood swings.Half of the old-age homes that HelpAge surveyed faced scarcity of funds during the pandemic. As many as 37% of them said there were no isolation or quarantine rooms created in their old age homes. In these old-age homes, almost a quarter of the people surveyed said they were abused during the pandemic.The respondents were misinformed about vaccination with many claiming to be completely immune after getting vaccinated. Over 20% were not even aware of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.For almost 30% of the elderly people infected at these old age homes, no one from their families approached them to take their care.Rohit Prasad, CEO of HelpAge India, said while the elderly people have always been identified as the most vulnerable, there is an increased risk of abuse due to growing dependency. “While battling health issues, they (elderly) are also dealing with the loss of loved ones, and struggling at multiple levels,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/growing-abuse-dependency-and-loneliness-how-covid-is-affecting-india-s-elderly-101623756125165.html

He had taken over the reigns of the party after his father and LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan died in October last year.Suraj Bhan Singh was made the national working president and was authorised to convene a meeting of party's national council within five days to elect its new national president.According to party officials familiar with the matter, the meeting to elect the party's next leader is likely to be held in Patna and chances are that Paswan's uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras will be made the next national president.As the news of Chirag Paswan being removed from the party's top post broke, his supporters smeared black ink on the posters of the five rebel LJP MLAs outside the party's office in Patna, news agency ANI reported.Bihar: Supporters of Chirag Paswan smear black ink on the posters of 5 LJP MPs including Pashupati Kumar Paras outside the party's office in Patna pic.twitter.com/J3K6KAhhXPThe development comes after five of the six LJP Lok Sabha MPs revolted and chose Paras as their leader on Saturday. Speaker Om Birla later cleared the proposal.On Monday, Paswan attempted reconciliation, but in vain, as the rebels rejected his proposal of giving the post of national party president to his mother, if not him.Paras, the younger brother of Ram Vilas Paswan, was at odds with his nephew's decision to break away from the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar election last year. While LJP did not ended up winning only one seat, it was responsible for cutting out on the vote share of Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal United (JDU).“There are 6 MPs in our party. It was the desire of 5 MPs to save our party. So, I’ve not broken the party, I’ve saved it. Chirag Paswan is my nephew as well as the party's national president. I have no objection against him,” Paras said on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chirag-paswan-removed-from-the-post-of-national-president-of-ljp-101623755044048.html

An undisclosed number of Chinese troops were also killed in the first such clash between Indian and Chinese troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in over five decades.“Having patiently waited for the government to come clean and inform the nation about the circumstances in which the unprecedented incident happened and reassure the people that the sacrifice of our brave jawans was not in vain, the Congress Party reiterates its concern that no clarity is yet available and the Prime Minister’s last word on the subject a year ago was that no transgression had occurred,” said Gandhi in a statement.Also Read | ‘Rahul Gandhi must answer’: Minister on fuel price hikes in Congress statesShe added the Congress has repeatedly sought information on the episode and details on what progress has been made to return to the status quo ante along the LAC.

In such a scenario, the weighted average price of Covaxin for all supplies realised by Bharat Biotech is less than ₹ 250 / dose. Going forward, ~75% of the capacity will be supplied to state and Central governments with only 25% going to private hospitals,” read the company statement.At least 40 million doses of Covaxin have been supplied to date, as per the company, and product development activities towards the development of vaccines against newer variants is also underway at their facilities.It also said that since the supply price of their vaccine to the Government of India ₹ 150 / dose, it is a non-competitive price and clearly not sustainable in the long run. Hence, a higher price in private markets is required to offset part of the costs.Currently, Covaxin is being sold to state governments at ₹400 per dose and at ₹1,200 per dose to private hospitals and institutions, which is significantly higher.“This is purely due to fundamental business reasons, ranging from low procurement volumes, high distribution costs and retail margins among few others…,” it said, and urged the government to allow them to maintain differential pricing for the government and private sector.The company has so far invested at least ₹ 500 crore at risk from its own resources for product development, clinical trials and setting up of manufacturing facilities for Covaxin. The support from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) was with respect to provision of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, animal studies, virus characterisation, test kits and partial funding for clinical trial sites. In return for this valuable support, Bharat Biotech will pay royalties to ICMR and the National Institute of Virology (NIV), based on product sales.According to people familiar with the matter, it is about 5% of the product sales.HT has reached out to the health ministry and this copy will be updated once it responds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-sought-indemnity-from-centre-for-any-covaxin-adverse-events-bharat-biotech-101623753112477.html

Covishiled was priced at ₹300 per dose, while Covaxin charged ₹400 per dose from the states.

This pushed the total number of tally to 17,02,937 and fatality count to 21,858, respectively.As many as 1,116 Covid-19 patients were discharged from the hospitals in 24 hours, taking the total number of recoveries to 16,72,968, Monday's bulletin said.A government spokesman said a special vaccination campaign for administering Covid vaccines to street vendors, rickshaw, e-rickshaw, tempo and auto drivers has been started in the state from Monday.These sections come in contact with a large number of people and therefore the government has decided to start a special vaccination campaign for them, the spokesman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-further-relaxes-covid-19-restrictions-malls-and-restaurants-allowed-to-open-101623750972144.html

The state’s daily caseload now is around the same as when the second wave of Covid-19 began in India in April, raising hopes that lockdown restrictions could be relaxed in around half of its 30 districts.In the last 24 hours, Odisha reported 3,405 new cases, a drop of nearly 20% from the 4,339 new cases that it reported a day before that. The test positivity rate (TPR) which was 6.33% on Monday, reduced to 5.99% on Tuesday.The current phase of lockdown is scheduled to end on the morning of June 17, but the health department officials said it may continue in many coastal and interior districts where the total positivity rate and bed occupancy are still high. The districts of Khurda, Cuttack, Jajpur, Balasore and Mayurbhanj are recording at least 2,500 active cases each, with Khurda leading the pack, while 16 districts are recording a TPR of over 5% since mid-May. Khurda too leads the pack of districts with high TPR at 13.4%.Also Read | Adhere to Covid-19 protocols as restrictions are eased: Rahul Gandhi“The government will review unlock measures only after assessing the present pandemic situation in the state,” said director of medical education and training Dr CBK Mohanty. “But even if the lockdown is lifted, night curfew may continue. People have to stay alert and follow all Covid-19-appropriate behaviour to avoid lockdowns in the future.”As per the government’s assessment, the situation in districts Ganjam, Gajapati, Deogarh, Nuapada, Balangir, Bargarh, Jharsuguda, Kandhamal and Sambalpur is well under control. “As per the data of last seven days, the TPR is below 5% in these districts and the number of active cases as well as patients in hospitals have drastically come down,” said a health department official. For example, in Jharsuguda district, the weekly TPR in the district has seen a sharp drop to 1.84% in the week ending June 14 from over 12% in the week ending on June 9. However, as per WHO’s recommended rate (one positive result for 10 administered tests), the epidemiological parameters may not favour lockdown relaxations in districts such as Sambalpur, Balangir, Kalahandi, Kandhamal, Baragarh and Sonepur, which have higher rates. So weekend shutdown would continue in nearly 20 districts, according to a senior health department official.Officials said the districts of Bhadrak, Jajpur, Balasore, Khordha, Cuttack, Kendrapada, Puri and Angul will not see any relaxations in lockdown, except for opening up the window of essential business hours by nearly 2 hours as the TPR is high in these districts. To bring the situation under further control, the government is planning to extend the weekend shutdown till June 30. Non-essential shops in 16 districtsKhurda, Cuttack, Jajpur, Balasore, Bhadrak, Kendrapara, Puri, Nayagarh, Boudh, Jagatsinghpur, Mayurbhanj, Rayagada, Koraput, Keonjhar, Dhenkanal, Angul and Deogarh - may be allowed to open till 1pm and 5pm-8pm.While gyms and swimming pools are likely to remain closed till June 30, there is no news on when educational institutes would reopen.“As there is a threat to children in the anticipated third wave of Covid-19, the government is readying all infrastructure to deal with the situation. Only after reviewing the situation in the coming days, will chief minister Naveen Patnaik take an appropriate decision on reopening of schools,” said state school and mass education minister Sameer Dash. He said the government does not think it wise to reopen schools without vaccinating children above the age of 6 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-covid-19-cases-reduce-in-odisha-ease-of-restrictions-in-the-offing-101623750409053.html

The bench of justices Indira Banerjee and MR Shah took a dim view of the fact that Zaidi’s bail had to be cancelled in January 2020, after a Superintendent of Police (SP) stated before the Central Bureau of Information (CBI) court that she was being pressurised by him in an attempt to influence the trial. “If you can try to influence an IPS rank officer, what will happen to other ordinary witnesses in the case? We cannot lose sight of this fact against you,” said the bench, as it refused to grant bail to Zaidi. Also Read | SC closes cases against Italian marines accused of killing fishermen off KeralaZaidi, a 1994-batch Himachal Pradesh Cadre IPS officer, is lodged in Chandigarh’s Burail Jail at present. He is facing a trial at the Chandigarh CBI court for the alleged custodial death of a man accused of participating in the gang rape and murder of a minor girl at Kotkhai, Himachal Pradesh, in 2017. In July 2017, following the directions of the Himachal Pradesh high court, the case was transferred to the CBI. The CBI booked nine policemen, including Zaidi, and filed the chargesheet. However, in November 2018, the accused moved the Supreme Court, seeking a transfer of the case from Shimla to any other state for the trial. In April 2019, the top court transferred the custodial death case to the Chandigarh CBI court from Shimla. It also granted bail to Zaidi on the condition that he would not try to influence witnesses or tamper with the evidence. But in January 2020, SP Soumya Sambasivan, who was a witness for the prosecution in the case, showed up before the trial court, contending Zaidi was trying to pressurise her to change her statement and to depose in his favour. Subsequently, the CBI court cancelled his bail. Later, Zaidi sought interim bail citing the Covid-19 outbreak, but the Chandigarh CBI court and the high court of Punjab and Haryana dismissed his plea, prompting him to approach the Supreme Court for the bail. The caseOn July 4, 2017, a minor girl went missing after school hours from Haliala forest at Kotkhai. Her naked body was found in the forest on July 6 and the post-mortem report confirmed rape. An FIR was registered at Kotkhai PS, and a special investigation team (SIT) was formed to probe the rape and murder. Zaidi was made to head the SIT. The SIT, on July 13, 2017, arrested one Suraj Singh, along with four others, for allegedly committing the crime. However, on the night of July 18, Singh died in custody after allegedly being tortured by the SIT. In less than a week, the high court handed over the investigation to the CBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/custodial-death-case-sc-dismisses-bail-plea-of-suspended-himachal-top-cop-101623749509056.html

An editorial in the Sena’s mouthpiece Saamana on Tuesday said the work on the temple should be “transparent and honest” as it is a matter of “national pride”.Former Samajwadi Party lawmaker Tej Narayan Pandey and Aam Aadmi Party Parliament member Sanjay Singh have alleged that on March 18 a plot sold for ₹2 crore by two people was bought by the Trust overseeing the temple’s construction for ₹18.5 crore 10 minutes later.The Trust on Monday said the land was purchased at rates lower than market prices while refuting the allegations of corruption and dismissing demands for a probe into the land deal.Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Monday said the allegations and the evidence brought forward are “shocking”. He asked Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat, the Trust, and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath to clarify their position on the allegations.Also Watch | Ram Temple: Congress’ 3 questions to PM Modi on alleged Ayodhya land deal fraud“The construction of the Ram temple and the procedure behind it must remain transparent and honest.

Whether this is true or not must be clarified at the earliest. The work on the Ram temple is a matter of national pride... if there is a blot of scam then Prime Minister Modi and RSS chief Bhagwat will have to intervene,” the editorial said.Bharatiya Janata Party leader Atul Bhatkhalkar slammed the Sena and accused Maharashtra’s ruling party of hurting the Hindu sentiments. He added Shiv Sena should seek the return of ₹1 crore it has contributed to the trust. “People have made donations to the temple with faith and the money is accounted for. If Shiv Sena does not have faith, it should demand the return of ₹1 crore,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ayodhya-land-deal-shiv-sena-seeks-pm-s-intervention-101623747529061.html

Sharma said there are times when people have to suppress their desires. The cabinet expansion has been put on hold after medical advise to the chief minister who is in post-Covid recovery stage."Nothing is going to happen for the next two months because CM is not meeting people in-person. I also wanted to become CM but sometimes we've to suppress our desires," Sharma said while interacting with reporters on Tuesday, as reported by news agency ANI.Also Read: As Sachin Pilot camps in Delhi, his loyalists continue attack on Gehlot"There is a proverb - 'Ek Anar, Sau Bimar' (something that's in short supply and high demand). But in this case, there are 25 'bimar' (aspirants). How many would get it (ministerial berths)?" he asked.The politician was at the centre of the storm that brewed in the ruling party in Rajasthan last year, siding with Sachin Pilot-led rebel camp. Sharma was suspended from the Congress party, but came back when the political crisis was resolved by the Congress top brass with a promise to accommodate Pilot loyalists in the government.Sharma reiterated on Monday that he is with the Congress and "Sachin Pilot and CM Ashok Gehlot are my leaders"."Pilot Sahab never demanded any post for himself. He has clarified that he will not join BJP. I believe some junior leaders have occupied some big posts, which is going to hurt the party. Senior-most leaders must be given due respect," he also said.On Monday, the Officer on Special Duty (OSD) of Ashok Gehlot informed that doctors have advised the chief minister to avoid one-on-one meeting."In view of the post-Covid repercussions, as a precautionary measure on the advice of doctors, the Chief Minister is not able to meet people in person. All meetings and interactions are being done through video conference and video calls only. The doctors have said that for a month or two, he should hold meetings with the video conference only. Department meetings and review meetings are also being held through video conferencing," said OSD Lokesh Sharma.At present, Rajasthan has 21 ministers, including the chief minister. The state with 200 assembly constituencies can appoint a maximum of 30 ministers. Last year's patch-up between Gehlot and Pilot factions happened after assurances from the Congress' central leadership that the rebels who followed the latter will be suitably accommodated.But last week, Pilot told Hindustan Times that the Congress high command had failed to deliver on the promises that were made to him when he along with 18 legislators returned to the party after a month-long drama.The high command, however, signalled to Pilot that it has initiated the process of reshuffling and that the process will be completed soon.After Jitin Prasada, a close aide of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi shifted to its political rival - Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday, speculation is on about more leaders following his suit, including Congress leader Sachin Pilot, who is currently in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-much-awaited-rajasthan-cabinet-reshuffle-a-message-from-congress-leader-101623745218063.html

What happens if deadline is missed?||The government has announced that the last day to link the Permanent Account Number (PAN) card with the Aadhaar number is June 30, 2021. Failing to link the two would result in the PAN card becoming “inoperative” and a penalty of ₹1,000 would also be levied.Earlier, the government had set the deadline as March 31 to link the two documents after extending it multiple times.

15-06-2021||India||Where the G7 summit failed||The much-awaited G7 communique from Carbis Bay is long on rhetoric and short on substance.The communique itself runs into 70 paragraphs, covering, as it were, the three Cs: Covid-19, climate and of course, China. For good measure, it also provides important clues into the thinking of G7 countries on issues such as trade, democracy, human rights, multilateralism and post-Covid-19 global economic recovery.On Covid-19, G7 is right to focus on vaccinating the world. After all, it is now conventional wisdom that no one is safe until everyone is safe. The trouble is that even assuming that all G7 countries, India and China can eventually take care of themselves (itself a tall order), at least three billion people in the rest of the world remain to be vaccinated. By providing for a paltry one billion vaccine doses over the next year, G7 has effectively indicated that even by the end of 2022, not everyone on this planet will be vaccinated.Also Read | Covid-19 virus quicker than vaccines, warns WHO as G7 vows to share dosesMore importantly, G7 ignores the three immediate actions recommended by the Report of the Independent Panel on Pandemic Preparedness and Response led by Helen Clark and Ellen Sirleaf, published in May 2021. The three actions included one billion vaccine doses by September 2021 and two billion doses by end of 2022; waiving intellectual property rights (IPR) if voluntary action does not occur quickly; and lastly, committing 60% of the $19 billion required for Access to Covid-19 Tools (Act) Accelerator in 2021 for vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics and strengthening of health systems. G7 falls short significantly on all three counts.On climate, the question before the Cornwall Summit was not whether G7 countries would commit to net zero emissions by 2050. That was the basic minimum that they were expected to do, and which they have done. The real question related to climate finance — how will the world’s richest countries meet their Paris Accord commitment of $100 billion every year to finance the energy transition of developing and least developed countries? Here again, the communique comes up with the vaguest of language, referring to increasing and improving climate finance to 2025 and reaffirming the developed country’s goal to mobilise $100 billion.China gets one full paragraph by way of attention. While saying they wish to cooperate with China on issues such as climate, G7 countries call on it to respect human rights in Xinjiang and autonomy for Hong Kong. Taiwan gets a mention, perhaps for the first time, with G7 countries underscoring the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. This is certain to roil the Chinese.G7, it must be said, has made a valiant attempt to counter the Belt Road Initiative with its own Build Back Better for the World (B3W) plan that aims to orient development finance towards resilient infrastructure, health systems, digital solutions and advancing gender equality and education. But the proof of the pudding is in the eating. On the issue of gender equality, a target has been set for getting 40 million more girls into education with funding of $2.75 billion for the Global Partnership for Education. This is welcome.The biggest signal for China is perhaps the “Open Societies Statement” signed by G7 and guest countries comprising India, South Korea, Australia and South Africa. The statement spells out the unconditional commitment of these countries to human rights for all, both online and offline, democracy, social inclusion, gender equality, freedom of expression and rule of law. At a time when there has been backsliding on these issues worldwide, including in the guest countries, this is a welcome move and is perhaps the best sign that democracies can unite on the basis of these universal values. China may pretend not to care about this, but you can be sure it will be concerned.How should India read the G7 Summit?First, PM Narendra Modi’s statement that India is a natural ally of G7, with an emphasis on its civilisational commitment to democracy, freedom of thought and liberty, will be welcomed by India’s friends all over the world. It is no secret that an impression, rightly or wrongly, has gained currency internationally that there has been some backsliding on these metrics in India. The PM’s statement should put these doubts about India’s commitment to rest.Second, on climate finance, India has a mountain to climb. India will come under pressure at the COP 26 meeting in Glasgow to commit to net-zero emissions by 2050. Not just this, the communique appears to endorse the idea of “carbon leakage” and hence gives implicit approval to European Union’s idea of carbon border tax. This is particularly unwelcome for India.Finally, the communique harps on “fair trade” much more than it does on “free trade”. Fair trade, by definition, stresses labour and environmental standards and the communique says as much. How these will be implemented without resort to protectionism remains to be seen. Similarly, G7 also endorses plurilateral initiatives at the World Trade Organization, something India hitherto has studiously avoided. Things will come to a head at the 12th Ministerial Conference of the WTO in December.Mohan Kumar is a retired diplomat, chairman of RIS, and dean and professor at Jindal Global UniversityThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/where-the-g7-summit-failed-101623744950296.html

It is really unfortunate that those who are supposed to safeguard the rights of the children are exploiting them,” said Benudhar Senapati, director of Childline NGO, which was involved in the rescue.As per Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000, employing children under the age of 14-years is a crime and therefore a case has been filed under the act.

The ambulance carrying the woman started its journey at 6.30am and is expected to cover the distance in eight hours instead of the usual 10-11 hours.Four police vehicles escorted the ambulance up to the Meghalaya border. The Meghalaya police are to offer the same support before it re-enters Kamrup (Metropolitan) in Assam en route to Guwahati. Officials said this was the longest green corridor being provided for a medical emergency in the northeast.The patient, Era Choudhury, was admitted to a Silchar hospital on May 25 and suffers from pneumonia. She is also diabetic and has a history of hypertension, said Dr Amit Kalowar, who was treating her.“Considering her condition, the woman’s family decided to shift the patient from Silchar to Guwahati after consulting some senior doctors,” he said.Also Read | Assam students approach SC seeking cancellation of Class 10, 12 board examsEra Choudhury’s son, Soumen, who requested the district administration for the green corridor, said doctors told them she was not fit to fly and hence they were taking her to Guwahati by road.Cachar police superintendent Vaibhav Chandrakant Nimbalkar said he has spoken to his counterparts in Meghalaya and requested them to facilitate the smooth passage of the ambulance. “Our team has escorted the ambulance and cleared the roads till the Meghalaya border. From there, the officials of the neighbouring state are coordinating. After crossing Meghalaya, they will reach Kamrup Metropolitan district.”This is the third green corridor provided by Cachar administration within a month, and the fourth overall.Last year, a 33-year-old man was airlifted from Silchar to Kolkata after testing positive for Covid-19, but he was declared dead on arrival there.This month a 68-year-old man with post-Covid complications was moved to Silchar airport through a green corridor but an air ambulance could not fly him due to his condition. The patient was taken back to the Silchar hospital, and he died within an hour. Another patient was airlifted from Silchar to Guwahati on June 5 and a green corridor was provided for that as well.A green corridor for a medical emergency was created for the first time in Assam in 2017 to shift a critically ill four-month-old boy to the Guwahati airport. An air ambulance then flew the boy and his parents to New Delhi for advanced treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/longest-green-corridor-in-n-e-created-to-shift-patient-from-silchar-to-guwahati-101623741888911.html
15-06-2021||India||PLA de-escalation at Gogra area stuck a year after bloody Galwan skirmish||One year after Lt Colonel B Santosh Babu and 19 other braves of Indian Army lost their lives in brutal fisticuffs with aggressive People’s Liberation Army (PLA) at patrolling point 14 in Galwan River Valley, the situation in East Ladakh remains in tenterhooks with the Chinese army delaying the agreed de-escalation process in East Ladakh.Although the official figure of Chinese casualty in the Galwan skirmish will never be made public by Beijing, the Cabinet Committee on Security ministers of the Narendra Modi government are clear that the PLA numbers were much than the Indian toll.According to top Indian military and intelligence officials, while the PLA has withdrawn its military infrastructure from Pangong Tso finger area to nearby headquarters at Rudog, the PLA military posture on patrolling point 15 A and 17 A or what is called Gogra-Hot Springs remains the same with the Chinese not restoring April 2020 status quo ante around Kong Ka La area. Besides this, the 2013 Depsang Bulge legacy issue is still to be addressed with the PLA blocking Indian patrols to patrolling points 10 to 13 in the area south of Daulet Beg Oldi sector.The matters stand further complicated with the PLA inducting another division strength formation from Xinjiang area for the annual military exercises that start around April and end around June every year. The ground exercises are coordinated with air defence war games and this time the Chinese air force flew J-11 and J-17 fighters to test their reaction capabilities. “While the PLA have still deployed more than two divisions along with artillery, armour and rocket support elements since the May 2020 transgression, the Indian Army is watching whether the additional division inducted for exercises goes back to its bases in Xinjiang post June,” said a government analyst.A Cabinet minister confirmed to Hindustan Times that the situation in East Ladakh continues to be tense but under control with the fear that any accident akin to Galwan skirmish could lead to horizontal flare-up between the two deployed armies. “The Chinese have still not agreed to dates to the 12th round of military talks to defuse the Gogra-Hot Springs situation as they want the issue to be settled locally. The forces are deployed on both sides and the PLA is rapidly building military infrastructure behind the Line of Actual Control (LAC) from Karakoram Pass in Ladakh to Kibuthoo in Arunachal Pradesh. Situation can go south any moment and hence we have to be prepared,” he said.Senior analyst believe that the Xi Jinping regime may time the Gogra-Hot Springs resolution with the 13th BRICS summit, hosted by India later this year and feel the PLA posture will remain the same till Beijing celebrates 100 years of Chinese Communist Party (CCP next month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pla-de-escalation-at-gogra-area-stuck-an-year-after-bloody-galwan-skirmish-101623741024081.html

Being rescued to safety. Though [the leopard’s] identity will be ascertained scientifically. Advisories may still be followed. Cats are still out there. Results of tinkering with their habitats," Budgam deputy commissioner Shabaz Mirza tweeted on Tuesday morning.The leopard dragged the four-year-old girl away on June 3, when she was playing on the lawn of her house at Ompora village. Her mutilated body was recovered in the forest nursery about one kilometre from her house the next day.According to official records, 196 people have been killed and 2,325 injured since 2011 in attacks by wild animals in Jammu and Kashmir. Kashmir has accounted for 118 deaths and 1,877 injuries, while 78 deaths and 448 injuries have been recorded in the Jammu region.Forest officials said two leopards have recently been trapped but more than four are still roaming in the area, where the last incident took place. Local residents and politicians blamed the wildlife department saying it ignored their complaints about the increased citing of the animal in the area, leading to the incident.“...Incidents involving the same wild animal occurred multiple times in the recent months in areas as close to [the] DC’s (District Collector) office. People then were lucky, but this time this innocent little soul had to pay with her life,” former minister and MLA Ruhullah Medhi said after the girl’s deathPeople in the district fear similar attacks and since the last few days, the wildlife department has received numerous calls claiming leopards were spotted in the area. The past many years have seen a rise in the incidents of man animal conflicts.

This follows a government decision in January this year to buy these minor millets from farmers and tribals of the state. The procurement will be done through Chhattisgarh State Minor Forest Produce Association (SMFPA) and the produce will be sold under the brand name of Chhattisgarh Herbals. The SMFPA has already signed a memorandum of understanding with the Indian Institute of Millets Research for better processing of Kodo-Kutki. Also Read | Chhattisgarh farmer’s suicide note alleges injustice by revenue officer“Villagers living near the forests grow Kodo-Kutki and Ragi...earlier, they weren’t getting a good price for their produce so the government decided to step in. We will now take the help of IIMR which specialises in millet production and processing technology,” said Sanjay Shukla, managing director, SMFPA. Millets are also cultivated in lands with low fertility, mountainous terrain, tribal and even rain-fed areas in states such as Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Telangana, apart from Chhattisgarh. It is a kharif crop and is sown in July.According to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, millets are drought-tolerant and resistant to climate change. They are suitable for small growers as their cultivation requires lesser water than that of rice and wheat. In December 2020, the Chhattisgarh government decided to procure seven other forest produce at minimum support price from the tribals: Kusmi seed, Reetha fruit (dry), Shikakai, Satavar roots, Kaju Guthli, Malkangani seeds, and Mahul leaves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-to-process-sell-millets-procured-from-tribals-101623738168676.html

He left a suicide note accusing the local revenue officials of injustice, resulting in encroachment of his land. A magisterial probe has been ordered into the incident and the accused Patwari and Tehsildar have been suspended and sent on a punishment posting respectively.“The suicide note said his land was encroached upon and it named three people, including a tehsildar. Initial probe has found that he had taken a loan from a moneylender and was being pressured over repayment,” a Kharora police station official said.Raipur superintendent of police Ajay Yadav said the farmer allegedly consumed poison at his home in Morena village on June 12 and was found dead on Monday. He added that the tehsildar’s role will be investigated.District collector Saurabh Kumar said the farmer’ death was related to his land dispute with the village Kotwar—a government messenger deputed in villages.“In May 2020, the issue was taken to the revenue court. In tehsildar’s court... the farmer was found guilty of encroaching on Kotwar’s land. The tehsildar passed an order for demarcation last year in May itself. However, fifteen days ago, Kotwar again accused the farmer of encroachment. This time, however, no revenue officials were involved,” said the collector.He said the deceased farmer never filed a review petition against the 2020 demarcation ruling by the tehsildar, however, the administration has attached him to the district headquarters to ensure a fair probe into the case.“The patwari who was tasked with [the] demarcation has been suspended and the additional collector has been put in-charge of the inquiry,” Kumar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-farmer-s-suicide-note-alleges-injustice-by-revenue-officer-101623737748607.html

15-06-2021||India||Over 900 Central government employees died from March to May||Over 900 Central government employees died from March to May, up from the 600 during the same period last year, officials aware of the matter said. The deaths coincided with the second Covid-19 second wave which overwhelmed the country. It was unclear whether all these deaths were because of the pandemic.An official said in nearly all of the Central ministries, at least 20-30% of the people were affected by the pandemic. In April, the Department of Personnel and Training (DOPT) was one of the worst-hit by Covid-19 with nearly 80 officials testing positive for the disease. The ministry of information technology was forced to ask most of its officials to work from home for two weeks as many of them contracted the disease.Officials said nearly 50% of the agriculture ministry staff contracted Covid-19. G Narayana Raju, the secretary of the legislative department, ministry of law and justice, was among those who died of Covid-19 in May. Dayawanti Srivastava, Sanjay Kumar Srivastava, and Pushpavant Sharma from the Indian Information Service also succumbed to the disease.Also Read | India’s daily Covid-19 cases, deaths fall further to 60,471 and 2726According to a second official, 73 people working at the Central Secretariat died of Covid-19. “There is a lot of congestion in certain sections... if one person gets the infection, it travels very quickly,” the official said. “The officials try to maintain social distancing and wear masks but even then, many have contracted the virus. Overcrowding is a major reason for the spread of this highly communicable disease.”The official added people across departments also realised the urgency of the work, which prompted them to attend office. “Even I contracted Covid, but the work is such that we must attend office,” the official said. “There are nearly 150 officials associated with the Central Secretariat who are still positive. Moreover, it is not just us, but even our family members who have suffered because of this.”The government has introduced a scheme to ensure the immediate release of pensions to the families of the employees who have died due to the pandemic.The second official said that considering the toll the pandemic has taken, the government should consider more compassionate appointments (of family members in case of untimely deaths) to support those who have suffered. “At present, compassionate appointments stand at 5%. The government should consider expanding this.”On Monday, the DoPT asked officials of the rank of undersecretary and above to attend office on all working days. Officials below the rank will continue to work at 50% staff strength, with staggered timings in place.The department reversed its order from the third week of April, wherein the government reintroduced staggered timings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-900-central-government-employees-died-from-march-to-may-101623733548600.html

15-06-2021||India||After Punjab, Rajasthan, trouble brews for Congress in Kerala||The Congress, which has been busy tackling discontent in its Punjab and Rajasthan units, now faces a similar situation in Kerala, where a section of senior leaders is upset at being sidelined and ignored, people aware of the matter said.The discontent within the party surfaced in the southern state after it removed its Kerala unit chief M Ramachandran and the Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala as it failed to return to power. The Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Democratic Front swept back to power in Kerala last month.Leaders in the Chennithala camp alleged that he did not get an “honourable exit” and an appointment to meet Congress chief Sonia Gandhi. They say he was not even consulted before the names of the new state unit chief and the opposition leader were announced.Also Read | Gujarat Congress leader Hardik Patel denies reports on joining AAPA Chennithala loyalist said that he deserved an honourable exit. “The Congress president or Rahul Gandhi could have called him for a meeting to explain the situation and why it was necessary to bring fresh faces. Instead, the changes were made without consulting him or former CM (chief minister) Oommen Chandy,” the leader said, requesting anonymity.The leader claimed most of the lawmakers wanted Chennithala to continue. But another leader said that was not the case. “Most of the young MLAs (members of legislative assembly) and the MPs (members of Parliament) of the party suggested changes. Tariq Anwar, the Congress’ in charge of the state, held an extensive discussion with MLAs, MPs, and leaders in the organisation.”VD Satheesan is the new opposition leader while K Sudhakaran has been named as the new Kerala Congress chief.Kerala observers in the Congress maintain Chennithala, 65, still has a lot to offer to the party but they were not certain how a senior leader like him would be accommodated. The post of the opposition United Democratic Front convenor is currently vacant. But K Muraleedharan, son of former chief minister K Karunakaran, is seen as the frontrunner for the post.Congress leaders maintain the crisis in Kerala is not as big as it is in poll-bound Punjab or Rajasthan. But they admit that if Chennithala, who is a prominent leader, is not placated, the factionalism in the Kerala unit might deepen further. Earlier this year, PC Chacko, a Congress leader in Kerala, left the party alleging factionalism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-punjab-rajasthan-trouble-brews-for-congress-in-kerala-101623731388301.html
15-06-2021||India||‘Not defections but violence will weaken BJP unit in West Bengal’||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is concerned over the impact of the post-poll violence against its workers on its organisational strength but sees no threat to its growing clout in West Bengal by the return of former Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders to the state’s ruling party, functionaries aware of the matter said.The BJP, which won 77 seats with a vote share of about 38% in the assembly elections held in March and April, has emerged as the main opposition in the state. The Congress and the Left parties failed to secure even a single seat in the 294-seat assembly.On Friday, the BJP’s national vice president Mukul Roy, without sending his resignation to the party high command, switched back to the TMC. There is speculation that some other leaders, who joined the BJP, could also return to the TMC. Last month, Sonali Guha, who also defected to the BJP in the run-up to the polls, regretted her decision and indicated that she wants to return to TMC.Is the BJP geared for facing defections?A state leader, who did not wish to be named, said the party unit has been in “disarray” even before the elections began. “There were differences in the unit about the state leadership. There were many people who have been with the BJP for years withstanding pressure and violence, but they were overlooked when about 20 odd TMC turncoats were given tickets to contest. That demoralised the cadre. These defections are bad for the party’s image,” the leader said.Also Read | TMC urges Lok Sabha Speaker to disqualify turncoat MPs including Sisir AdhikariWhile some leaders admit that the desertions are bad optics, especially since the BJP has emerged as a strong contender in the state, they say that the threat to the party does not come from defections.“Roy or any other leaders leaving will not impact the party. In West Bengal politics an individual is not above the party. Here the party symbol matters more than the perception of a person. Politics here has been between binaries, earlier it was the Left against the TMC, now it is the TMC against the BJP,” said Samik Bhattacharya, the chief spokesperson for the BJP in the state.Though the central leadership of the BJP has not officially commented on the defections, particularly by Roy, who was given a position in the national team, a second functionary said some defections could be a result of pressure.“Roy has some 60 plus cases filed against him. A Member of Parliament, Arjun Singh, has about 90 cases filed against him. So, it is possible that some of the former TMC leaders are returning because of fear of excesses by the TMC,” said the leader.The desertions have underscored the need for better coordination in the state unit and between the central leadership and the state unit, said a third leader. “There was never a doubt that Roy’s role was overstated. A section of leaders had conveyed to Delhi the concern that the central leadership was banking too much on turncoats and unable to address the concerns of the workers. However, no action was taken. Now we have a bigger problem to address, the continued violence against the workers,” the third functionary said.Some leaders, including Tathagata Roy, also stoked a controversy by referring to Roy and other TMC turncoats as “Trojan Horses”. The statement was condemned by Rajya Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta. “It is wrong to view everyone who joined BJP in Bengal after May 2019 as Trojan horses. Many new entrants participated in the election with sincerity. They must not be made to feel unwelcome. Politics is not a game of exclusion; it involves adding support & creating new leaders. As for those who see a political party as a vehicle of personal gratification alone, the door is always open to explore other options,” Dasgupta tweeted.Violence will weaken the partyThe BJP attributes the continued violence against its workers to the party’s growing heft in the state. It is also concerned that the violence will instil fear in the cadres as well as those who sympathise with the BJP.“The fact that the TMC resorted to violence after it won the elections with a huge mandate shows it sees the BJP as a threat. What is really hurting the party is not anyone leaving, but this violence against the workers,” said Shishir Bajoria, state executive member of the BJP.Also Read | ‘Where are your 25 MLAs?,’ TMC MP Banerjee asks BJP’s Suvendu AdhikariThe continued attacks against the cadres were also flagged by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological fount of the BJP. An RSS functionary said the fear of being attacked can have an adverse impact on Sangh’s work. “After many years, the Sangh’s presence has increased on the ground through shakhas (branches) and meetings. If these attacks continue then those who attend these meetings will also fear being targeted,” the functionary said.RSS shakhas have gone up from 875 in 2014 to about 1,200 in 2019.All eyes on the CentreThe state BJP unit, which claims that the police have not taken action against the perpetrators of violence, is now resting its hope on the Union government.“In the last three years, we have seen 138 causalities. Between May 2, when the results were declared, and May 5, when the TMC government was sworn in, we lost 10 workers, and since May 5 till date have lost 29 workers. There is an absolute violation of laws. BJP workers are not being given vaccines, thousands of them are unable to return home. There is a perception among people that only the Centre can now bring about a change and end this cycle of violence,” said Bhattacharya.TMC leader Tapas Roy rejected the BJP’s allegation of widespread violence in West Bengal and said there was no such thing. “The BJP is trying to disturb the peace as it not being able to digest the humiliating defeat. Even suicides are being tagged as political violence. In many cases, it was the BJP’s internal fighting. There were some incidents soon after the poll results were declared but at that time the law and order were under the jurisdiction of the ECI [Election Commission of India].”Roy maintained there has been no widespread violence after Mamata Banerjee took over as the chief minister on May 5. “The chief minister has directed the police to take strong actions against any such incidents.”Prof Abdul Matin of the Jadavpur University said the defections will not adversely impact the BJP if the party focuses on building its organisation. “It is true that there is widespread violence against the opposition parties across the state and it is the responsibility of the TMC to take care of this. This violence can be attributed to the binary era of politics in the state which is TMC versus BJP. As for TMC turncoats returning to the party, it will send a bad signal to the workers in rural Bengal. The defections will increase internal factionalism in the TMC,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-defections-but-violence-will-weaken-bjp-unit-in-west-bengal-101623730788525.html
15-06-2021||India||As Delta wreaks havoc, five questions answered about the new Covid variant||The delta variant of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has led to renewed concerns across the world getting ready to ease the restrictions. The variant is highly transmissible, and currently makes up 6% of all cases in the US.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday announced a four-week delay in the final stage of easing lockdown restrictions in England - set for June 21 - due to the Delta variant. Dubbed "Freedom Day", the last and fourth stage of the lockdown roadmap has now moved to July 19.The Delta variant was first reported in India and later declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a 'variant of concern'.So how has the variant affected the fight against Covid-19 across the world? And are vaccines effective against it? Here are a few questions answered:Why the world is concerned about the Delta variant?First detected in India, the Delta variant of Covid-19 is 60% more transmissible than the Alpha variant, which was first detected in United Kingdom’s Kent. The estimates for doubling rate (time taken for the number of infections to double) of infection for the Delta is also relatively high, with doubling time ranging from 4.5 days to 11.5 days.The Delta variant is said to be the reason behind the surge during the second wave of the pandemic.Are vaccines showing any efficacy against the Delta variant?Absolutely. A new analysis by Public Health England (PHE) showed on Monday that Covid-19 vaccines made by Pfizer and AstraZeneca offer high protection of more than 90% against hospitalisation from the Delta coronavirus variant. Last week, researchers at Pune’s Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV) Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin is also effective in neutralising the Delta and Beta variants of Sars-CoV-2.However, a study conducted by Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) said last week that the Delta variant can infect vaccinated people, though the infection does not become severe.Has the Delta variant mutated further?The scientists in India have said that they have found a mutated variant of the predominant B.1.617.2, which is wreaking havoc across the world. Called 'AY.1' or 'Delta plus', the new variant is resistant to the monoclonal antibody cocktail treatment for Covid-19 recently authorised in India.Vinod Scaria, clinician and scientist at Delhi’s CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), said on Twitter on Monday that the new mutation is characterised by the acquisition of K417N mutation. It in the spike protein of Sars-CoV-2, which helps the virus enter and infect the human cells, he added.According to Public Health England, 63 genomes of Delta variant with the new K417N mutation have been identified so far on the global science initiative GISAID. However, in India, its incidence is still low.How crucial is vaccination now?Considering the rapid mutation of the original Sars-CoV-2 virus, which led to the spread of the coronavirus disease, it is very important now to get yourself vaccinated. The second wave of the pandemic, led by the Delta variant, showed how rapidly the infection was spreading. It also caused a high number of fatalities.A number of pharmaceutical companies have said that their vaccines are effective against the Delta variant. So, it is always advisable to take a shot of vaccine in order to create a large immunity pool.Is an increased gap in dosage interval a cause of concern?A few media reports have claimed that it would be better to shorten the gap between two doses of Covishield vaccine, in light of the variants in circulation. But on Monday, Dr V K Paul, member (Health) at Niti Aayog, said there is a need to balance such concerns.He said at a press conference that there is no need to panic. "We must remember that when we increased the gap, we had to consider the risk posed by the virus to those who have received only one dose. But the counterpoint was that more people will then be able to get the first dose, thereby giving a reasonable degree of immunity to more people."He appealed to the public to respect the decision taken by National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), a body of globally renowned experts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-delta-wreaks-havoc-5-questions-answered-about-the-new-coronavirus-variant-101623729090121.html

15-06-2021||India||Monsoon progress over rest of NW India to slow down||After advancing into most parts of the country, including many parts of northwest India, monsoon is likely to slow down, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Monday.Monsoon has so far advanced into the entire peninsular India; east central; east and northeast India and some parts of northwest India. It progressed very quickly over most parts of the country in the span of only ten days mainly due to active monsoon circulations and formation of a low-pressure area over Bay of Bengal.“However, due to approaching mid-latitude westerlies winds further progress of monsoon over remaining parts of northwest India is likely to be slow. The progress of monsoon is being monitored continuously and further updates will be provided on a daily basis,” IMD said on Monday.The northern limit of monsoon (NLM) is passing through Diu, Surat, Nandurbar , Bhopal, Nowgong, Hamirpur, Barabanki, Bareilly, Saharanpur, Ambala and Amritsar. Monsoon has not arrived over Delhi yet.“A westerly system is approaching which will slowdown the progress of monsoon. It will both weaken the easterly winds, crucial for monsoon rains and curb the coverage of easterlies in northwest India, especially in north Haryana and north Punjab region. After two more days, the easterlies may be able to reach up to certain parts of Uttar Pradesh. We are constantly monitoring the conditions, if the parameters are met, monsoon may make onset over Delhi in the next 2-3 days,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at national weather forecasting centre, IMD.Also Read | IMD predicts rainfall in Punjab and Haryana, issues alerts for KeralaMany parts of northwest India recorded “large excess” (60% or more above normal) rains between June 1 and June 13. Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi recorded 134%, 219% and 44% above normal rain; Punjab 180% and Uttar Pradesh 64%; Uttarakhand recorded 29% excess rain.“Early in the month we recorded good rains over northwest India due to a western disturbance and later, due to the development of a low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal. Safdarjung station, for example, in Delhi recorded 88% excess rain. But now, monsoon has not covered the entire west Uttar Pradesh. Entire west and east UP have to be covered before monsoon moves to Delhi-NCR. There is a trough (low pressure area) in the westerlies which may bring thundershowers but that won’t be monsoon rain. There is a slowing down of the monsoon flow presently,” explained Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.The low pressure area which formed over Bay of Bengal is now over south Jharkhand and neighbourhood. It is likely to move west-northwestwards. A trough (area of low pressure) is running from west Rajasthan to northeast Bay of Bengal in lower tropospheric levels and another trough runs from eastcentral Arabian Sea to south Konkan in mid tropospheric levels. An off shore trough at mean sea level is running from south Maharashtra coast to north Kerala coast. Under the influence of these systems, widespread rainfall with isolated thunderstorm and lightning are likely over most parts of east, central and northeast India during the next 4-5 days. Isolated extremely heavy (over 20 cm) is likely over Bihar on June 15. Heavy to very heavy rain, thunderstorm and lightning is very likely over Konkan, Goa, Karnataka and Kerala and Mahe.Scattered rain is likely over most parts of NW India during the next three days and then, there is likely to be a decrease in rainfall in all parts of NW India except east Uttar Pradesh. Moderate to severe thunderstorms accompanied by frequent cloud to ground lightning and strong gusty winds are likely over Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Bihar on June 14 and 15; over Punjab and Haryana on June 15. This may cause injuries leading to casualties to people and animals staying outdoors, IMD warned. Monsoon is normally expected to cover all parts of the country, except a small part of Rajasthan, by July 5. It advanced to most parts of Madhya Pradesh, the entire Chhattisgarh, Odisha, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Bihar, most parts of east Uttar Pradesh and some parts of west Uttar Pradesh, entire Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan, Muzaffarabad and some parts of north Haryana, Chandigarh and north Punjab on Sunday.India receives about 70% of its annual rainfall during the four-month season that is crucial for the country’s farm-dependent economy and for rice, soybeans, and cotton cultivation. A normal monsoon this year will significantly help the agriculture sector. Good rains have been a prime reason for the farm sector’s resilience for two years despite the pandemic. India has over 150 million farmers and nearly half of Indians are dependent on a farm-based income. As much as 60% of India’s net-sown area does not have access to irrigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-progress-over-rest-of-nw-india-to-slow-down-101623727068421.html

15-06-2021||India||Assam students approach SC seeking cancellation of Class 10, 12 board exams||A group of students from Assam have petitioned the Supreme Court on Monday to cancel state board examinations for Class 10 and 12 to ensure equality with CBSE and other boards that have cancelled examinations. They have also challenged the state government’s criteria for holding examinations as flawed. “Classification sought to be made in present case between CBSE (Central Board Of Secondary Education), CISE (Council for Indian School Certificate Examination) and other state board students on one hand and the students of Assam SEBA (Secondary Education Board of Assam) and AHSEC (Assam Higher Secondary Education Council) on the other hand are prima facie irrational, unreasonable and is bad in law on the ground of violation of the basic feature of our Constitution, namely the principles of equality enshrined under Article 14,” the application said.Several states have announced cancellation of board examinations following CBSE’s lead to protect students from coronavirus infections. CBSE and other education boards have said they will come up with an alternate mechanism to rate students’ performances. However, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the state will conduct board examinations in mid-July if the Covid-19 positivity rate in the state drops below 2% by July 1.“The questions papers are likely to be multiple-choice ones, allowing students to score good marks. The exams will be held following Covid-19 protocol provided the positivity rate drops below 2%. If it is above that, we will ask schools to evaluate the students,” he said last week.The students, who seek to join other petitions on the same issue filed earlier in the Supreme Court, have also questioned the state government’s logic and said that the positivity rate on July 1 might have no relevance on the date when the exams are proposed to be conducted.“Positivity rate data is very dynamic in nature which has the potential to increase or decrease exponentially within the span of less than 24 hours,” the application filed through advocate Manu Jetley stated.Test positivity rate refers to percentage of tested samples that turn out to be positive it indicates the spread of the infection in a region.Two independent health experts refused to comment on the issue saying the matter was sub judice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-students-approach-sc-seeking-cancellation-of-class-10-and-class-12-board-exams-101623722988358.html
15-06-2021||India||Sero survey in Haryana from today. What you need to know||Haryana will start the state’s third round of sero survey on Tuesday to determine the prevalence of coronavirus antibodies in people, including children aged 6 years and above. “It will help us plan and strengthen our paediatric services, including the establishment and upscale of intensive care units. The study will flag susceptible populations and areas in the state and help us channelise and prioritise the vaccination drive in these areas,” Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary (health), said last week. Arora said the study will also help determine the effect and efficacy of vaccination. The senior official said the third round of the sero survey was being conducted is to identify the impact of the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic on the community. The seroprevalence in the first round, which was conducted in August, was found to be 8%. It increased to 14.8% in October.Also read | Sero survey will help in building strategy on Covid vaccination: ExpertsHere’s what you need to know about sero survey:How is it done?Blood samples are taken from randomly selected people as part of the sero survey to study the scale of undetected infections. Blood samples in a sero survey are tested for the presence of IgG (Immunoglobulin G) antibodies that determine a past infection due to the virus. Sero surveys are important to determine whether a disease has entered the community transmission stage.Also read | Past Covid infection does not fully protect people against re-infection: StudyA serological survey includes IgG Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) test. It estimates the proportion of the population exposed to Sars-Cov-2 infection. The IgG test is not useful for detecting acute infections but it indicates episodes of infections that has happened in the past. The test is approved by ICMR for its high sensitivity and specificity.What did past sero surveys in India say?The earlier sero surveys suggested that a significant size of the population was still susceptible to catching the viral infection, and India was far from achieving herd immunity. The first one was designed as a cross-sectional survey of adults aged 18 years or more from 21 states, where the districts were categorised into four strata according to the reported Covid-19 cases per million population.Also read | More antibodies in women to fight Covid-19: BMC sero surveyThe first sero survey conducted in May last year found the infection rate to be 0.73% nationally. Nearly one in 15 (6.6%) people above the age of 10 were found to be exposed to the virus till August 2020 in the second one. Conducted between December 17, 2020, and January 8, 2021, the third sero survey found 21.4% of those aged 10 and above infected with the virus.In the second and third rounds, all other parameters were the same except for the age bracket — samples were taken from people aged 10 and above.When will the fourth national sero survey start?The Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR’s) fourth round of sero survey to detect the prevalence of Sars-CoV-2 , the virus that causes coronavirus disease (Covid-19), will begin this month in 70 districts in 21 states. Blood samples will also be collected from health care workers in district hospitals of these districts.States, where the samples will collected for sero survey, include Andhra Pradesh (Krishna, SPSR Nellore, Vizianagram), Assam (Udalguri, Kamrup Metropolitan, Karbianglong), Bihar (Muzaffarpur, Purnia, Begusarai, Madhubani, Buxar, Arwal), Chhattisgarh (Bijapur, Kabirdham, Surguja), Gujarat (Mahisagar, Narmada, Sabar Kantha), Jharkhand (Latehar, Pakur, Simdega), Karnataka (Bengaluru urban, Chitradurga, Kalaburagi), Kerala (Palakkad, Ernakulam, Thrissur), Madhya Pradesh (Dewas, Ujjain, Gwalior), Maharashtra (Beed, Nanded, Parbhani, Jalgaon, Ahmednagar, Sangli), Odisha (Rayagada, Ganjam, Koraput), Punjab (Gurdaspur, Jalandhar), Haryana (Kurukshetra), Rajasthan (Dausa, Jalore, Rajsamand), Tamil Nadu (Tiruvannamalai, Coimbatore, Chennai), Telangana (Kamareddy, Jangaon, Nalgonda), and Uttar Pradesh (Amroha).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sero-survey-in-haryana-from-today-what-you-need-to-know-101623720473765.html

Check full list here||The Indian Railways has decided to resume several long-distance trains, which were shut down in April as the deadly second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) reached its peak. The decision has been prompted by a steady downward trajectory of daily Covid-19 cases across the country.

Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing Facebook, also informed the high court that keeping in mind the grievance raised by the petitioner, the copies of the petition shall not be distributed to any unrelated third party.The controversy pertains to highly “obnoxious and objectionable” posts put up by a user on Instagram, as submitted to the court by petitioner Aditya Singh Deshwal. The petitioner also argued that the said content showed abusive language written about Hindu deities, along with their ”vulgar” representation through cartoons and graphics. He also sought directions to Instagram to preserve all details associated with the concerned account so that these could be presented before the court to expose the identity of those behind these “objectionable” posts.Deshwal, represented by senior advocate G Tushar Rao and lawyer Ayush Saxena, further sought the removal of the content from the photo and video sharing platform at the earliest.Earlier, Manish Singh, a Delhi resident and member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), filed a complaint with the Delhi Police over the posts, accusing Instagram of “hurting the sentiments” of the Hindus. In his complaint, Singh stated that the GIF was made with the “sole intention of inciting the followers of the Hindu community and, in the process, promote disharmony, hatred and enmity.”Also Read: BJP leader files complaint against Instagram for Shiva sticker with mobile and wineUrging the Delhi Police to file a case against Instagram CEO and others under sections 153A and 295A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), Singh threatened to protest outside Instagram’s office if the content is not withdrawn and no apology is tendered.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/removed-objectionable-posts-on-hindu-deities-instagram-tells-delhi-high-court-101623716550966.html
15-06-2021||India||World Elder Abuse Awareness Day 2021: History, aim and theme||World Elder Abuse Awareness Day is dedicated to highlighting the issue of elder abuse. This day came into existence in June 2006 when a request was established to declare June 15 a special day for elders. But it was the year 2011 when the World Elder Abuse Awareness Day was officially recognized by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).History of World Elder Abuse Awareness DayThe day was established after the UNGA officially acknowledged it in its resolution 66/127 in December 2011. This proposition came into the picture after the International Network for the Prevention of Elder Abuse (INPEA) requested to first establish the commemoration in June 2006.Aim of World Elder Abuse Awareness DayThe principal goal of World Elder Abuse Awareness Day is to provide our communities around the world with an opportunity to get a better knowledge of the abuse and neglect of older people. This is a global social issue that not only affects the health of older people but also diminishes their rights.Theme for World Elder Abuse Awareness Day 2021This year’s theme for World Elder Abuse Awareness Day is 'Access to Justice'. It serves as a reminder of the importance to fully address the needs of older persons who may seek recourse.The United Nations says that older persons, who have experienced situations of violence, abuse and neglect, often face multiple barriers in accessing judicial remedies such as issues of accessibility, affordability, reasonable accommodation, excessive delays and backlogs in judicial processes, the impact of digitalisation, cultural norms, gender bias, discrimination, and entrenched ageism in policy, norms and practices.Access to Justice impacts older persons’ ability to fully exercise all their human rights including the right to health, adequate social protection and to live in dignity. The preservation or restoration of dignity and respect for older persons is crucial in such situations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-elder-abuse-awareness-day-2021-history-aim-and-theme-101623714557515.html
15-06-2021||India||VHP defends Ram temple trust, says oppn misleading people||The VHP has rejected the allegations of corruption against the Ram temple trust in the purchase of land in Ayodhya and warned of defamation suits against those trying to mislead people ahead of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. "The construction of Ram Temple is authentic and transparent. Attempts to malign this divine movement are unfortunate. It appears that this misinformation campaign is being done by selfish motives. The political parties are trying to politicize the matter but it is related to faith," Vishwa Hindu Parishad's international working president Alok Kumar told news agency ANI.Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Tej Narayan Pandey and Aam Aadmi Party's Sanjay Singh on Sunday accused the Ram temple trust of corruption in a land deal and sought a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the matter. "The piece of land was earlier purchased for ₹2 crore by Ravi Mohan Tiwari and Sultan Ansari. Ten minutes later, the trust bought the land for ₹18.5 crore on March 18," Pandey said at a press conference.Also read | Ram temple trust's Champat Rai responds to scam chargesPandey also claimed that ₹17 crore was sent to the bank account of Ravi Mohan Tiwari and Sultan Ansari through RTGS mode of payment and demanded a probe into the RTGS money transfer.Vishwa Hindu Parishad's Alok Kumar said the land deal was a "transparent agreement". "We have suggested the trust file defamation case against the persons leveling false allegations against Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust. Uttar Pradesh assembly polls are round the corner that is why they are misleading the people with lies," he said.Also watch | Ram temple: 'Oppn parties misleading people ahead of UP polls': VHP's Alok KumarAlok Kumar, according to ANI, said on Monday that the land was in the name of Kusum Pathak, its original owner. She signed an agreement with Sultan Ansari and Ravi Mohan Tripathi a few years ago and agreed to sell the land for ₹2 crore, which was the market rate of the land at the time, Kumar said.Kumar also said that buying and selling of the land are being done on the basis of mutual dialogue and consent. "Kusum Pathak was ready to sell it but she could not sell it because she had already entered into a deal. Meanwhile, both Sultan Ansari and Ravi Mohan Tripathi were also willing to sell it, but they couldn't take that decision without the consent of Kusum and moreover, they didn't have any agreement to sell it," he said.Also read | Shiv Sena's Raut demands clarification on Ram temple land purchase in Ayodhya"But this deal was not possible without the consent of these four including Harish Pathak," he added.The VHP leader said the price of land has gone up following the Ram Mandir verdict and the state government's announcement of the temple's construction. "The trust has found that the circle rate has lost its relevance. The present rate of the land in question is ₹18.5 crore," he added.Asserting that there are no irregularities in the deal, he informed that all the money transactions have been done in cash, so there is no question of money laundering.The Ram temple trust, created by the government after the Supreme Court’s landmark November 2019 verdict, has also refuted the allegations of corruption and dismissed demands of a probe. It said that land for the Ram temple in Ayodhya was purchased at rates lower than current market prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vhp-defends-ram-temple-trust-says-oppn-misleading-people-101623715551518.html
15-06-2021||India||Pre-board scores, class 10, 11 marks may factor in CBSE class 12 evaluation formula||Students of Class 12, for whom the school-leaving exam was cancelled due to Covid-19, will likely have their results compiled taking into account their performance in three past examinations: the finals of Class 10 and 11, and their Class 12 pre-board tests. The final scores will be based on a 30-30-40 split, with the latest pre-board test accounting for 40% of the weight in the final tally, and the other two equally contributing to the remaining share.This formula will apply to the theory component of the exam, which can be 70% or 80% of the total score, while the rest is based on their perofrmance in practicals as usual. Practical exams had been held for most before the second wave of the pandemic took hold and forced schools to be closed.The 13-member committee constituted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) to fix the criteria to evaluate Class 12 students did not submit its report as per schedule on Monday, said officials at both CBSE and ministry of education. The panel may take a few more days to finalise the details.The Union government on June 1 cancelled the Class 12 exams in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and said CBSE would come up with “well-defined objective criteria” in a timebound manner to assess the students. On June 3, the Supreme Court gave CBSE two weeks to come up with an evaluation formula. Following that, the Board on June 4 formed the 13-member committee that was to submit its report in 10 days, on June 14.The matter is likely to be heard on Thursday.A member of the committee explained the rationale behind the consensus about expanding the performance parameters to evaluate the students. “The panel has consulted centrally-run schools, including Navodaya Vidyalayas and the principals of other CBSE-affiliated schools, and observed that the entire academic year of this batch of Class 12 was held online and there was so much uncertainty. Classes were not held in a normal situation and assessment did not happen completely,” the member said on condition of anonymity.The panel, therefore, found it unwise to assess students just on the basis of Class 12 performance. “In a crisis like this, it is important to go by the students’ performance in normal situations. Therefore, considering Class 10 performance is crucial. It is the most credible data available since it was conducted by the CBSE at examination centres and evaluated externally. Similarly, Class 11 exams of this batch in 2020 were also completed before the declaration of the lockdown. All these exams were held in a defined condition,” the member added.The committee is in favour of giving more weightage to Class 12 pre-boards. “Overall, everyone is in favour of giving equal weightage to Class 10 and 11 performances (30% and 30%) and 40% to Class 12 pre-board marks. Some members still favour giving more weightage to Class 10 than Class 11,” the member said, adding that a consensus on this hasn’t been reached so a few more days will be needed to compile the report.Some school principals expressed reservations about the plan to consider Class 10 and 11 marks. Tania Joshi, principal of the Indian School, New Delhi, said, “There are so many students who prepare for competitive exams and participate in co-curricular activities in Class 11 and don’t take the exams very seriously. Then there are students who couldn’t perform well in Class 10 and opted for humanities in Classes 11 and 12. It will be unfair with them,” Joshi said.However, educationist Meeta Sengupta said it could be the best possible criteria in the present scenario. “No formula will be perfect, but this one is close. It includes both a range of performances and opportunities,” she said.Another official familiar with the development also confirmed to HT that three components might be considered for theory marks that vary from subject to subject. While most of the subjects have 70-mark theory papers, some have 80. The remaining practical marks will be provided by the respective schools. Those who could not complete these exams have now been asked by CBSE to complete them in online mode.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/class-10-pre-board-scores-may-factor-in-cbse-class-12-formula-101623714880864.html

15-06-2021||India||How can India prepare for the third wave||The second wave of Covid-19 infections in India peaked on May 9, 2021. The sevenday moving average of daily cases has now come down to 85,807 from the peak of 391,819. The fact that India faced a severe second wave of infections, which overwhelmed the health infrastructure, has underlined the importance of preparing well for the third wave. Of course, the pace of vaccinations will matter the most in determining whether or not there is a nationwide third wave. Vaccinations apart, here are four things that must be done to reduce the impact of a possible third wave of Covid-19 infections.1. Testing facilities need to be expandedTesting in time and isolating infected patients is the key to containment of Covid-19 infections. Whether or not people get tested in time depends on access to testing facilities. A symptomatic person is more likely to get a test done if the testing centre is one kilometre away from their house than if it is located at a distance of 20 kilometres. Paid and free tests (at government facilities) are also likely to make a difference, especially for the poor.Data from the Covid-19 Sample Collection Management System of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) shows that testing facilities are extremely skewed in states such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The data shows that, as of June 12, the median number sample collection centres (including mobile units) in districts in states such as Karnataka and Gujarat was 90 and 68. This number was just two in states such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. It needs to be kept in mind that these are median values and therefore half the districts will have a lower number of sample collection centres.Thirty-one out of the 735 districts in the country listed on the portal have no sample collection centre; 99 have just one. Clearly, this needs to change, if the pandemic has to be monitored better.2. People, especially the poor, need to be encouraged to seekmedical adviceTo be sure, expanding testing centres will take care of only part of the problem. The 2017-18 survey on health consumption by the National Statistical Office (NSO) shows why. In India, whether or not people seek medical advice when they feel sick is linked to their economic status. The poorest 20% of people, as per Monthly Per Capita Consumption Expenditure (MPCE), are almost three times more likely to not seek medical advice than the richest 20%, the report shows. Lack of health facilities in proximity and affordability are bigger reasons for not seeking medical advice among the poor than the rich. The biggest reason for not taking medical advice across classes is the ailment not being considered serious.Given the fact that Covid-19 begins with common symptoms such as fever and cold, a behavioural change is required when it comes to suspected patients seeking early testing and treatment.3. Acknowledge the financial burden of Covid-19 hospital admissionsThere is no real measure of the financial burden of health expenditure due to Covid-19 infections. The NSO survey can be used to estimate what this health spending shock could have done to household finances. According to it, in 81% of cases where hospitalisation was required (excluding childbirth), the expenditure was met by family income or savings; 11% of such cases were financed with borrowing; 3.5% of these were met with contributions from friends and relatives; and 0.4% required sale of physical assets.To be sure, the average hospitalisation spending in the NSO survey was .22,380 per case. For cases within the top 10% bracket of spending, including spending of .50,550 or more, reliance on borrowing, contribution by friends and relatives and sale of physical assets increased significantly. An average Covid-19 hospitalisation case is likely to cost much more than ₹50,000.A 2016 Mint analysis of the Household Survey on India’s Citizen Environment & Consumer Economy (ICE 360° survey) by Pramit Bhattacharya gave an idea about the potential impact of health shocks on household finances. The survey showed that 3% of households in the top quintile (richest 20%) faced a health shock that wiped out more than a fifth of their annual income. The comparative figure for the bottom quintile (poorest 20%) was more than double at 6.8% of households. These numbers are likely to have increased manifold during the pandemic.4. Expanding health insurance coverwill helpOver three-fourth of hospitalisation cases in India involved individuals who were not covered by health insurance, according to the 2017-18 NSO survey. Access to health insurance is correlated to incomes, and the share of hospitalisation cases not covered by any kind of insurance increases from 68% among the richest 20% to 85.5% among the poorest 20%. Even in cases where health insurance existed, it did not cover the cost of the entire treatment.NSO survey shows that on average, health insurance was paid for only 10.2% of the medical expenditure and 9.1% of total expenditure (which includes cost of transporting patient as well as the cost of food, lodging, transport, etc., for the household) in cases that required hospitalisation.To be sure, the survey was conducted before the roll-out of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana (PM-JAY) which aims to cover 107.4 million households or 500 million beneficiaries under health insurance, so the insurance coverage numbers could be underestimated. The PM-JAY website says that there have been 18.6 million hospital admissions under the scheme since its launch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-to-prepare-for-the-third-wave-101623710031453.html
15-06-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||How many dead are there, really?That’s actually the first line of a column I wrote on May 2, putting forth a model for calculating a range for the number of deaths India has seen from Covid-19, but more on that anon. The question is worth repeating because of recent work by data journalist Rukmini S in Dainik Bhaskar and Scroll on excess deaths per million using death data from the states of Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. This data isn’t publicly available, and not all states share it (in fact, most do not). According to the data, Madhya Pradesh under-reported deaths between January 1 and May 31 by a factor of 42, Andhra Pradesh by a factor of 34, and Tamil Nadu by a factor of eight. The number has been arrived at by comparing historical and current data.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageThese death numbers have been put together by the states themselves, and usually, when such data is revised, it is only upwards. Sure, death reporting has always been patchy across India, although it has improved over the years – but it is unlikely to have suddenly seen a radical improvement in a year that actually made such reporting even more difficult. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some states keen to show their ability in managing the pandemic have under-reported deaths by simply ascribing them to other causes – pneumonia and typhoid are both beneficiaries, I am told – an approach that involves the use of all-cause deaths to calculate deaths has emerged, around the world, as the best way to capture the actual toll of the pandemic. It’s an approach that has been used to good effect by data investigators in other countries. This is actually different from the reconciliation of death numbers carried out in recent weeks by states such as Maharashtra and Bihar, which, as the term suggests, is more of an exercise in factoring in backlogs, updating records, and (in Bihar’s case) accounting for deaths outside the public hospital system.The reports on the excess deaths in Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, new research, and the fact that health systems in at least some parts of the country were completely (or partially) overwhelmed during the second wave together suggest that it makes sense to revisit some of the assumptions of the May 2 column.In that column, I accounted for the fact that the number of actual infections could be 10-15 times the reported number. But recent research by scientists at Public Health England has shown that the Delta variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus that was first sequenced in India (B.1.617.2 is how it is otherwise known) is around 64% more infective than the original Wuhan virus. And a study by Delhi’s Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology shows that Delhi’s second wave (in April and May) was caused by the Delta variant. It’s entirely possible – we do not sequence enough viral genomes to say for sure – that all of India’s was.That could well mean that the actual infections, at least in those two months, may have been even higher – perhaps (and this is a straight mathematical extrapolation that may not be accurate) 16-24 times the reported number.Finally, there’s enough reporting to show that India’s Covid-19 fatalities in April and May increased on account of inadequate access to hospitals, medicines, or oxygen. The deaths were also inflated by the emergence of mucor. In the May 3 column, I assumed a range for the infection fatality rate (proportion of those dying to those infected), 0.115% to 0.23% (the upper bound was based on work carried out by Stanford’s John PA Ioannidis across 51 regions, and by Middlesex University’s Murad Banaji, for Mumbai; the lower bound was to factor in advances in Covid-19 treatment since the start of the pandemic). It is entirely possible that in April and May, the infection fatality rate in India may have been higher. How high is anybody’s guess, but the math of its impact is clear – a higher infection fatality rate on an elevated infected base (on account of a more infectious variant) is certain to cause a spike in deaths.Over the weekend, the Indian government responded to an article in The Economist (without naming the publication) that said India’s reported death toll was “a small fraction of the real figure” saying there was no way there were “five to seven times excess deaths”. As Rukmini S’s analysis shows, at least in a few states, and for a few months, it was that and more. We need a nationwide comparison of deaths from all causes in 2020 and thus far in 2021 with the historical average.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101623701072163.html
15-06-2021||India||KCR hands out cars worth ₹9.6 crore to bureaucrats||A day after the Telangana government handed out luxury cars, bought for approximately ₹9.6 crore, to 32 additional collectors with an aim to help them “carry out developmental works”, the opposition hit out at the move and accused it of financial profligacy during a pandemic when the state is in high debt.The vehicles were handed over to the additional collectors after chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao reviewed the developmental works in urban and rural areas at his camp office at Pragati Bhavan in Hyderabad, an official spokesman from the chief minister’s office (CMO) said. At Sunday’s meeting, KCR said the government will extend all facilities to the additional collectors. “In every district collectorate, additional collectors will be provided a room adjacent to the collector and enjoy the same protocol of the collector,” the chief minister said.“The vehicles, each costing [the state] around ₹30 lakh, were procured by the Telangana State Road Transport Authority on the instructions of the chief minister. The vehicles will help the additional collectors in extensive tours of the villages as part of their duty,” an official in the transport department familiar with the development, said. The opposition parties said the chief minister was busy “appeasing” the bureaucrats when the state was reeling under a financial crisis due to Covid-19 pandemic. All India Congress Committee official spokesman Dasoju Sravan called it an “irresponsible” decision and claimed that the state’s debt had crossed ₹4 lakh crore. “These officials already have... their official cars for the last one year. Where is the need to give them the new cars...in this hour of crisis?” Sravan questioned.According to the Telangana budget for 2021-22, the total outstanding public debt of the state is ₹2,86,804.64 crore. State transport minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar did not take calls. Sravan alleged that the state government was struggling to increase the number of beds for treatment of Covid-19 patients in government hospitals, and didn’t have money to buy buses for public transport or even to clear the pending bills of contractors. The state is under Covid-19 lockdown till June19. At present, the state has 20,461 active cases and recorded 1,862 deaths since March 1 this year. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesman K Krishna Sagar Rao said it was a “criminal splurge” of public money. “This decision to buy ultra-luxury vehicles for additional collectors is horrendous and unthinkable in the current public health situation. We feel this money could have been used to expand beds or provide free treatment to the poor,” Rao said. The Telangana government introduced the post of additional collectors into the bureaucratic structure of the state in February 2020 positioning it as an administrative reform and part of an overhaul of the revenue department. Additional collectors, mostly drawn from Group-I officers, were appointed in each district (except Hyderabad), and were exclusively meant for taking care of developmental projects in rural areas. However, two additional collectors, one each for local bodies and revenue matters, were appointed in 10 districts. Political analyst Suresh Dharur said KCR’s move was likely to send a wrong message. “It is not that the officials are going to the villages by bicycles. They must be having vehicles. Why should the government spend nearly ₹10 crore on buying them luxury cars at this stage? This is nothing but fiscal irresponsibility,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kcrhands-out-cars-worth-9-6-crore-to-bureaucrats-101623697246507.html
15-06-2021||India||Lakshadweep residents observe ‘black day’ to protest administrator Patel’s visit to island||Thiruvananthapuram: Residents of Lakshadweep observed a black day to protest against the week-long visit of administrator Praful Khoda Patel who arrived in the archipelago on Monday.The Save Lakshadweep Forum, a body of all political parties, urged people to mark the day by hoisting black flags, and wearing black dress and masks to express their anger against the draft Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation (LDAR) 2021, which it believes would destroy the culture and tradition of the island. They also raised placards seeking the recall of the administrator and roll back of the new rules. The Save Lakshadweep Forum said it will continue its protest till its demands are met. “We observed a black day to protest against Patel’s visit. Despite mounting protests, he is in a denial mode and continues to antagonise people. We are ready to call off the protests if he hears us properly and withdraws some of the controversial decisions,” forum convenor UCK Thangal said, adding that the forum will adopt different modes of protest in the coming days if the administrator ignores their demands. In a recent interview to an English magazine, Patel had said that the troubles in the island were incited by a section of people with vested interests from Kerala. He said in the last seven decades, the island had failed to develop unlike the rest of the country. Patel added that the Centre had announced a number of steps to improve the infrastructure of the island - ₹1,200 crore was earmarked for an underwater optical fibre cable, Kavaratti would be developed as a smart city and Agatti airport runway would be widened for wide-bodied aircraft to land.For over a month, residents of the archipelago have been protesting against the three draft regulations brought in by the administrator over fears that it will affect the unique culture and tradition of the island. Last Monday, the residents in the island had observed a hunger strike from morning to evening as a mark of protest. Two weeks ago, the Kerala assembly had passed a resolution seeking the recall of the administrator. Aisha Sultana moves HC for bailMeanwhile, filmmaker and model Aisha Sultana moved the Kerala high court, seeking anticipatory bail in a sedition case filed against her by Lakshadweep Police. Police had registered the case, among other charges, against her two days ago after she allegedly called Patel a bio-weapon launched by the Union government during a TV discussion recently. The case, which was filed on the basis of a complaint by Lakshadweep BJP chief C Abdul Khadar Haji, was registered under Section 124 (A) of the Indian Penal Code among other sections by Kavaratti police.In his complaint, Haji cited a recent debate on ‘Media One’, a Malayalam news channel, in which Sultana reportedly called the new administrator a bio-weapon. He said her words were in bad taste and intended to create hatred and aversion in the minds of people. In her bail plea, Sultana, who is now staying in Kochi, said she feared her arrest if she returned to the island. The high court is expected to take up her plea on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakshadweep-residents-observe-black-day-to-protest-administrator-patel-s-visit-to-island-101623697185368.html
15-06-2021||India||Former Telangana minister joins BJP, vows to expand party’s base||Hyderabad: Former Telangana health minister Eatala Rajender Monday joined the Bharatiya Janata Party after being sacked from the state cabinet by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on May 1 following the allegations of land grabbing. Rajender was formally given the primary membership of the BJP by the union minister of steel Dharmendra Pradhan in New Delhi. BJP’s in-charge of Telangana affairs, Tarun Chugh, union minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy and other party leaders from the state were present on the occasion. Along with Rajender, former Telangana Rashtra Samithi parliament member Ramesh Rathod, former TRS lawmaker Enugu Ravinder Reddy, former Karimnagar Zilla Parishad chairperson Thula Uma, trade union leader P Ashwathama Reddy and a few Osmania University student leaders joined the BJP. Rajender, a prominent OBC leader representing the Huzurabad assembly constituency in northern Telangana, resigned from the TRS on June 4 and from the assembly membership on Saturday. His resignation from the assembly was accepted, and the vacancy for the Huzurabad seat was notified immediately. Welcoming the former minister into the BJP, the Union steel minister said Rajender’s entry would further strengthen the party in Telangana. “After Karnataka, Telangana will soon become a stronghold of the BJP in the South,” Pradhan said. Expressing thanks to the BJP leadership, Rajender said he would make all-out efforts to expand the footprints of the BJP across Telangana and the rest of South India. In the coming days, there would be an exodus of more leaders from the TRS into the BJP, he said. Originally from the Leftist background, Rajender was an active leader of Progressive Democratic Students Union (PDSU), a student wing of the CPI (Marxist-Leninist) New Democracy, a splinter group of the Naxalites, in the early 1980s. In 2003, he joined the TRS, founded by K Chandrasekhar Rao, and took an active role in the separate Telangana movement. He became the legislator for the first time in 2004 from the Kamalapur assembly constituency in Karimnagar district and represented it twice before the constituency changed to Huzurabad. He continued to represent the same till the 2018 elections. When KCR was a parliament member, Rajender was made the floor leader of the TRS in the state assembly. He was the first finance minister of the Telangana state when formed in 2014. In the second term, he was given the medical and health portfolio, which he held till he was sacked recently. “My DNA is secular. My agenda now is neither right nor left. My only agenda is to get the Telangana rid of the dictatorial and feudal rule of KCR,” Rajender said after quitting the assembly membership.Meanwhile, senior TRS leader and state civil supplies minister Gangula Kamalakar said Rajender defection to the BJP would hardly impact the TRS. “The TRS is strong in Huzurabad, and it is going to win the by-election hands down. We shall develop the constituency 100 times more than what Rajender had done all these years,” Kamalakar, who is looking after the party affairs in the constituency, said. It was unfortunate that Rajender had chosen to criticise KCR, who had given him a political life, the minister added. Senior journalist and political analyst Sangem Ramakrishna said there might not be an immediate impact of Rajender’s exit on the TRS, which is strongly placed in the Telangana. “However, in the long run, he might be a rallying point for the disgruntled elements in the TRS and also the OBC groups in the state. It would strengthen the BJP in northern Telangana,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-telangana-minister-joins-bjp-vows-to-expand-party-s-base-101623697065258.html
15-06-2021||India||Tamil Nadu woman broke barriers, strived to give her children a better life||Most of 52-year-old R Selvarani’s life was spent working in her office cubicle and taking care of her son and daughter in a sleepy Tamil Nadu town. Her only dream was to give her children a better life than what she had.Born in Madurai as the eldest of three siblings, Selvarani, after her wedding, moved to Achipatti town, a hamlet of about 10,000 people sandwiched between Pollachi and Coimbatore in western Tamil Nadu.The couple came from modest means and Selvarani and her husband, Ramanujam, worked hard. After their second child, Praveen Kumar, was born in 1999, Ramanujam could spend only 18 days with the family before he left for Sharjah, where he worked as a construction worker laying tar on roads. “Since then, my mother has run this family,” said her daughter R Sinduja, 25.Selvarani, who is only a high school graduate, worked as a bookkeeper for a private company. “My father would send his salary, but she took care of everything else. I’ve never seen her rest or take leave. Every day she worked in office, and she worked at home,” said Sinduja.Sinduja, who has a master’s in business studies, is supposed to get married in November and her brother Praveen has just completed his undergraduate studies. “Life is blank. Days aren’t making sense anymore,” she said.Ramanujam suffered a paralytic attack two years ago and can only run errands at the construction company. He returned to India after Selvarani died on May 7 and the family is still in shock.It started as a fever for Selvarani in late April. Her nephew Jaiganesh Balakrishnan took her to a doctor who prescribed medicines saying that it seemed like a normal fever. Balakrishnan wanted to rule out Covid-19 so he took Selvarani for a CT scan but the scan results showed that she had 20% lung infection.He immediately took her to a government hospital which also insisted it was mild. “They told us to take an RT-PCR test and if it was negative, they told us that she may have already overcome the infection,” said Balakrishnan. The report came back negative. “We were so relieved,” recalled Balakrishnan.But worse was yet to come.Late night on May 1, Selvarani started to struggle to breathe. “I remember the date because the next day was the election results,” says Balakrishnan. He called his friend who is an ambulance driver and at 1am they started driving around with Selvarani on oxygen.They drove to every hospital in Pollachi but there was no bed available. The ambulance driver and Balakrishnan began ringing hospitals in Coimbatore but were told none were vacant. With no other option available, they drove to Coimbatore to check in person if oxygen supported beds were available. Some private hospital staff arrived, checked her oxygen levels that was 88 with support.“But after checking, they would say no bed is available,” he said. The ESI hospital finally informed them that the Coimbatore government hospital (GH) had 25 new beds with oxygen support. At the time, the second wave of Covid was ravaging Tamil Nadu, which was posting around 20,000 cases and more than 150 deaths every day in the first week of May.Six hours after they had left home, they got Selvarani admitted. But the ward was newly constructed and oxygen supply wasn’t fully connected, so she was shifted to another ward.Balakrishnan went back to Pollachi but when he spoke to her later in the evening, Selvarani complained that she wasn’t given food and medicines.Balakrishnan tried to find her a bed in a private hospital and when he went to pick her up the next morning, he found Selvarani surrounded by three corpses in adjacent beds.“She told me they had died the previous night, but no one took away their bodies. She spent an entire night next to people in distress who died in front of her. It really scared her.”Her condition kept worsening. In the private hospital, she often pulled away her oxygen mask and screamed, and had to be put on a ventilator. “It was unusual. I think she was traumatised,” said Balakrishnan.He lamented that early diagnosis could have saved her life. The family suspects Selvarani was infected at work where one of her three co-workers was sick. “They didn’t inform her that it was Covid-19. People think if they’re infected, it’s criminal so they hide it,” he said.Despite Tamil Nadu’s markedly superior health infrastructure, the surge in infections overwhelmed hospitals in the hinterlands, especially in smaller cities and of cases there have been a disproportionate number of high deaths in villages and smaller districts.For her family, Selvarani was a feminist though she may have not known the word. “My mother was never dependent on anyone,” said Sinduja. “She was very bold. She pampered me but she also taught me to get a job and be independent.”The family said many women in the city looked up to Selvarani. “She worked all her life to help bring up her family, her children have graduated, one of them got married. But she is gone,” said Balakrishnan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-woman-broke-barriers-strived-to-give-her-children-a-better-life-101623697005333.html
15-06-2021||India||‘Misleading’: Bengal counters plea for CBI probe in post-poll violence||Most deaths during the post-poll violence in West Bengal took place when the model code of conduct was in place and the state police was under the control of the Election Commission, the West Bengal government has told the Supreme Court, countering petitions that accused the state police of not doing enough to curb the violence after the Trinamool Congress returned to power and sought a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation.“The instant writ petition reeks of political motivation by adopting a misleading narrative and shows that the state administration is complicit with the wrong-doers in the alleged incidents of violence,” the affidavit by Nirmalya Ghoshal, additional secretary of West Bengal’s home department said.Ghoshal said 16 people were killed in violence in two days (May 2-3), five people in the next two days (May 3-5), and one person was killed in the next five days (May 5-9).“From the declaration of WB Assembly Election Results on May 2, 2021 till May 3, 2021, the law and order machinery including both Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) and the State Police was under the superintendence of the Election Commission of India (ECI) and the model code of conduct (MCC) remained in force till May 3 and thus, the ECI was in charge of the law and order situation in the State till the MCC was lifted.”Soon after MCC was lifted and the new government under chief minister Mamata Banerjee took oath on May 5, “the incidents of violence had reduced drastically and the law and order situation was brought to normality.”The state was responding to two petitions demanding an independent agency or Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the killing of party workers belonging to the rival Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) allegedly by persons belonging to the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) party.The petitions alleged total inaction by the state police and administration, prompting the judges to seek responses from the state government as well as National Human Rights Commission, National Commission for Women, National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, National Commission for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and National Commission for Backward Classes.A bench of Justices Indira Banerjee and MR Shah will consider the affidavits filed by the parties when it takes up the matter on Tuesday.The Supreme Court is hearing two petitions including one filed by social activist Arun Mukherjee and four others to seek compensation and rehabilitation of persons displaced due to violence. This petition also accused inaction by police to register complaints of victims and demanded a probe into the incidents.The second petition was filed by family members of two BJP workers, Abhijit Sarkar and Haran Adhikari, killed during the violence.Two applications for intervention have also been filed in support of the petitions by a 60-year-old woman and a minor who alleged rape by Trinamool Congress supporters. The woman alleged that five people barged into her house on May 4-5 night, raped her in front of her six-year-old grandson, and left with all her valuables and property title documents. In the other application, the minor belonging to Scheduled Caste was gang-raped by four men on May 9. Later, her family was threatened not to pursue the case by persons linked to a local TMC leader. Both applicants have demanded transfer of probe to SIT since they don’t trust the police investigation.The West Bengal government has called the petitions “politically motivated” and “misleading” as it concealed the fact that issues raised by them significantly overlapped with proceedings pending before a five-judge bench of the Calcutta high court. The high court had formed a three-member committee to examine the issues of persons displaced due to violence and ordered all complaints by victims to be forwarded to the Director General of Police in the state. As an interim measure, the state government announced compensation of ₹2 lakh for families of the deceased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/misleading-bengal-counters-plea-for-cbi-probe-in-post-poll-violence-101623696886040.html
15-06-2021||India||AIADMK gives Panneerselvam dy leader post, expels 16 Sasikala supporters||Chennai: Former chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami and his deputy, O Panneerselvam, the two top leaders of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), on Monday came together to block expelled interim general secretary VK Sasikala from trying to regain control of the party and expelled 16 party members including three leaders for their proximity to her.O Panneerselvam was also appointed as deputy leader of the AIADMK legislature party, said a statement issued by the party after the three-hour-long meeting convened at the party headquarters in Chennai. Panneerselvam’s supporter, P H Manoj Panidan, was elected as deputy secretary while Palaniswami’s supporters and former ministers, SP Velumani, Kadambur C Raju and K P Anbalagan, were appointed as whip, treasurer and secretary respectively.Monday’s appointments were a sharp contrast to the tussle between Palaniswami and Panneerselvam, the AIADMK’s dual leadership, which resurfaced after the previous two meetings of the legislature party. Last week, the chill in their relationship also reflected on the streets of Tamil Nadu when their supporters fought a poster war.But on Monday, they spoke in one voice in a four-page resolution that threatened to expel anyone who associates with VK Sasikala. A party spokesperson V Pughazhendhi, former MP VK Chinnasamy and former MLA M Anandan were among the 16 who were expelled.The AIADMK’s effort to shield the party from Sasikala comes against the backdrop of her attempts to reach out to party workers sympathetic to her and release audio tapes of her conversation that has workers pleading with her to assume a leadership role.The resolution called the audio clips ‘drama’ and reiterated that the “party will never destroy itself for the desires of one family”. They recalled that Sasikala who had decided to ‘step away’ from politics before the assembly elections wanted to return because the AIADMK alliance won 75 of the 234 assembly seats, with the AIADMK alone securing 66 seats. That better-than-expected performance has been credited to the former CM’s track record. Palaniswami earlier tried to counter her campaign, telling reporters that she hadn’t been speaking with AIADMK workers but members of the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam, the party floated by her nephew TTV Dhinakaran. But subsequent audio clips released by Sasikala’s team started mentioning the details of the party workers with whom she was speaking. “They don’t understand that it is the cadre who decides the leader of this party,” she said.Sasikala was a friend and constant companion of former AIADMK supremo and CM, the late J Jayalalithaa. She was also, at one time, Palaniswami’s mentor, and made sure he became chief minister after Jayalalithaa’s death, once it became clear that she herself would go to jail after being found guilty in a disproportionate assets case. Palaniswami, however, made his peace with Panneerselvam, the other person in the running for the top post, and expelled Sasikala from the party. She was released from jail after completing her sentence earlier this year. She has since tried to re-enter the party. “The dual leadership (of Palaniswami and Panneerselvam) will continue, if not, the party will break,” said political analyst Raveendran Duraisamy. “They will set aside their egos and move forward together which will benefit both of them. If Sasikala wants and if she has public support she can be her own leader but the AIADMK and party symbol is in the hands of EPS and OPS. They will not let go.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmk-gives-panneerselvam-dy-leader-post-expels-16-sasikala-supporters-101623696826711.html
15-06-2021||India||17 Lingayat mathas back BSY as CM amid leadership row||Bengaluru: Amid voices of leadership change in Karnataka, at least 17 mathas or monasteries of the Lingayat community in Tumakuru, about 70 km from Bengaluru, on Monday rallied behind chief minister BS Yediyurappa, extending their support to the leader from the community to retain his position for at least the next two years. In a statement released on Monday, All Karnataka Sri Veerashaiva Lingayat Mathadipathis Forum said Yediyurappa is a respectable senior of the community and has carried his duties well as chief minister. The forum, comprising at least 17 mathas in the district, said any statement against Yediyurappa would be an insult not just to the chief minister but to the entire community. The statement, in Kannada, said Yediyurappa’s role was important in winning a high number of seats for the party. “In such circumstances, the All Karnataka Sri Veerashaiva Lingayat Mathadipathis Forum condemns any unnecessary creation of problems for Yediyurappa and backs him to complete his complete term,” the statement said. Yediyurappa has been on shaky grounds ever since he took the top chair in 2019 after helping engineer the collapse of the HD Kumaraswamy-led coalition government. There has been a concerted effort within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), seeking the ouster of the 78-year-old. Arun Singh, BJP’s national general secretary in-charge of Karnataka, is scheduled to arrive in Bengaluru on Wednesday in a bid to calm tempers in the state. The chief minister and his son, BY Vijayendra, have made several visits to mathas, which people aware of the developments, said was to mobilise support in favour of Yediyurappa, who has enjoyed the backing of Lingayats for the better part of the last decade. On Yediyurappa turning 80 in two years, the forum said that former Tamil Nadu chief minister late MK Karunanidhi was active in politics despite being on a wheelchair for almost 15 years. It also cited example of former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda, saying he is still active and “can put any youngster to shame”. The forum said Yediyurappa was healthy, and it was not right to create any confusion in the minds of the people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/17-lingayat-mathas-back-bsy-as-cm-amid-leadership-row-101623696766542.html
15-06-2021||India||Actor Sanchari Vijay declared brain dead||Bengaluru: National award-winning Kannada actor Sanchari Vijay, who sustained serious head injuries in a road accident, was declared brain dead at a private hospital in Bengaluru on Monday, doctors attending the actor said. The 38-year-old actor’s motorcycle skidded on Saturday night, resulting in him sustaining serious head injuries. He was admitted in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Apollo Hospital in Bengaluru. A statement from the hospital said he was on life support in the neurology ICU. “Neurologically he is deeply unconscious and is showing signs of brain failure. The family had come forward and consented to organ donation keeping in view the current irreversible brain damage. We will follow the guidelines as per organ donation protocol,” read the hospital’s statement. Chief minister BS Yediyurappa said he was deeply pained to know about it and expressed his sorrow. Fellow Kannada actor Sudeep took to Twitter on Monday afternoon to express his condolences. “Very, very disheartening to accept that Sanchari Vijay breathed his last.” Sudeep, who had met Vijay before the lockdown, added, “Met him a couple of times just before this lockdown... All excited about his next film that’s due for release. Very sad. Deepest condolences to his family and friends. RIP.” According to police, Vijay, a resident of Vajarahalli on Bannerghatta Road, and his friend Naveen had gone out to buy medicines and were returning to the latter’s residence when the two-wheeler skidded and hit an electric pole. Around 11.45 pm, Naveen, who was riding the motorcycle, and Vijay were heading from the former’s house to a medical shop to buy medicines. They had dinner at Naveen’s residence at L&T South City and the accident took place a few metres away. Vijay made his debut with the film ‘Rangappa Hogbitna’ in 2011. He has appeared in a slew of Kannada films including ‘Dasavala’, ‘Harivu’, ‘Oggarane’, ‘Killing Veerappan’, ‘Varthamana’ and ‘Sipaayi’ among others. He rose to fame with the film ‘Naanu Avanalla Avalu’, for which he won the National Award in 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/actor-sanchari-vijay-declared-brain-dead-101623696705266.html
15-06-2021||India||AAP will contest all seats in 2022 Gujarat polls, says Kejriwal||Aam Aadmi Party supremo and Delhi chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, on Monday said his party will contest all 182 seats in Gujarat in the 2022 Assembly elections.“The AAP will contest each and every seat in the 2022 Gujarat Assembly elections... We will emerge as alternative to BJP in Gujarat. BJP and Congress are two sides of the same coin and I hear that the Opposition party is in the BJP’s pockets,” said Kejriwal, who was on a one-day visit to Ahmedabad to inaugurate the AAP’s state headquarters.“Gujarat is suffering because of this friendship and alliance between the BJP and the Congress. The BJP ruled this state for the last 27 years. I heard people saying that Congress is in the pocket of the BJP. Both the BJP and Congress are the same. This must stop,” he added.After his media briefing, Kejriwal formally inaugurated the AAP’s office also located on Ashram Road.This was Kejriwal’s second visit to Gujarat this year. He last visited Surat in February, after the AAP’s encouraging performance in the city’s municipal corporation elections. In its debut performance, the AAP emerged as the main opposition to the BJP in the city, winning 27 seats in the 120-member Surat Municipal Corporation and leaving the Congress with zero seats.Asked if their campaign would be based on the Delhi model, he said, “Every state has its own problems and aspirations and so Gujarat will have a Gujarat model.”Earlier in the day, former head of a Gujarati news channel, Isudan Gadhvi, joined the AAP in the presence of Kejriwal.Hitting back at the AAP, state BJP spokesperson Yamal Vyas said, “Through the last six elections, we have restricted the Congress to 50 to 60 seats and haven’t allowed them to grow. We don’t need anybody, BJP is a strong force in Gujarat.”“Several parties earlier have contested on all 182 seats but have miserably failed, including those started by Shankersinh Vaghela, Keshubhai Patel or others. Vaghela’s party won 4 seats in 1998. So, let AAP also contest,” he added.Political analyst Hari Desai said the party was new to Gujarat politics. “AAP will, at best, serve the purpose of queering the pitch for the Congress on some seats where it may be doing well against the BJP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aap-will-contest-all-seats-in-2022-gujarat-polls-says-kejriwal-101623696645870.html
15-06-2021||India||Traffic snarls return to halt Bengaluru as curbs ease||The infamous traffic snarls, which are almost synonymous with Bengaluru, returned to haunt the city on Monday morning as the lockdown restrictions imposed in the wake of rising Covid-19 cases were relaxed after more than a month. In Old Airport Road, which connects central Bengaluru to the IT corridors of Whiltefield and Outer Ring Road, long traffic jams were seen as vehicles returned on the roads after over a month. Similar traffic jams and crowds were witnessed in other parts of Bengaluru, including KR Puram, Indiranagar and Basavanagudi, among other places. Chief minister BS Yediyurappa-led state government has eased lockdown curbs in Bengaluru and 18 other districts in the state on account of a decline in new infections. The new guidelines came into force at 6 am on Monday. As restrictions were lifted, the city saw an influx of people returning from other parts of the state. City authorities expressed concerns over the surge in people returning to Bengaluru from various parts of the state. While the number of cases in Bengaluru has come down, the influx to the city could result in another spike in Covid-19 cases, said Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials. “One of the reasons why the lockdown guidelines have not been lifted in some districts is because the positivity rate there is high. People from these districts are allowed to come to the city. Even though the regulations allow only emergency travel, there is hardly any checking. Police are allowing people to come through without any checks at the city borders,” said a senior BBMP official, requesting anonymity. The BBMP official added that strict restrictions on intra-city travel should continue till the positivity rate across the state comes down. However, many people return to the city since they have been allowed to work. “I run a cement shop and I came to the city after the government gave the permission,” said Mohammad Abdullah, a native of Chikkamagaluru. Bengaluru city police commissioner Kamal Pant on Monday issued prohibitory orders across the city, restricting more than four persons to assemble in public spaces. Police said there were some practical difficulties in the implementation. “The situation on the streets has changed. The government has allowed garment factories, construction activities, private companies and others to operate. This means there is a large number of people on the road. The garment factories account for around one million workers. It is not possible to check every vehicle on the road when the volume is high and these industries need to restart work,” Pant said. He added that even on the main highways leading to the city, there was a large movement of people from different districts. “Once again, the numbers are high here. We are conducting as many checks as possible but in some cases, where there is a pile-up, we have to allow traffic. It is the government’s decision to open these industries and these workers are critical for it,” he added. Bengaluru recorded 1,470 new Covid-19 infections on Monday, according to the state health department. The city also witnessed 2,409 recoveries that brought down the active caseload to 85,044. The positivity rate in Bengaluru declined to 3.11%, according to BBMP. A total of 12 deaths were reported in Bengaluru, which took the toll to 15,319, state data showed. “Our ability to stay focused and disciplined will ensure cases do not rise again. Stay safe. Get tested if you experience any Covid symptoms. Avoid public gatherings. Follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. Take the vaccine when it’s your turn,” Gaurav Gupta, BBMP commissioner tweeted. Bengaluru is home to several multinational companies and its economy and employment opportunities attract people from across the state and various parts of the country. A significant portion of Bengaluru’s workforce comprises migrant workers, employed in various sectors. The state government has announced that restrictions in 11 out of the 30 districts in the state, where test positivity rate remained high, will continue till at least June 21. The state government has decided to go in for a phase-wise lifting of curbs to restrict the sudden rush of people coming out of their homes and adding to the risk all over again. Karnataka recorded 6,385 new Covid-19 infections with the positivity rate of 4.56% on Monday. There were 15,409 recoveries in the state, which brought down the active caseload to 172,141, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department on Monday. A total of 120 more deaths were reported on Monday, taking the toll to 33,033, data showed. The Karnataka government has extended the timings of shops dealing in groceries, meat, vegetables, milk and other essential commodities from 6 am to 2 pm. Timings of liquor shops have also been extended till 2 pm. Earlier, they were allowed to operate from 6 am to 10am. However, night curfew from 7pm to 5 am and weekend curfew will continue in the state till June 21. The government said it will review the Covid-19 situation around June 21 and take appropriate decisions on further relaxations, if any. Industries and other production facilities have been allowed to operate with 50% strength while garment units have been restricted to 30%, according to the new guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/traffic-snarls-return-to-halt-bengaluru-as-curbs-ease-101623696645318.html
15-06-2021||India||Collective duty to fight land degradation: PM at UN meeting||Washington: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday reiterated the need for the world to come together to combat land degradation as a “collective responsibility” as it threatens the very foundations that societies and economies are built on, and called for more actions saying “a lot of work lies ahead of us”.Delivering a keynote address at a high-level meeting at the United Nations on land degradation and drought, Modi went on to detail steps and measures India is taking at home to address the situations and helping other developing nations in the spirit of South-South Cooperation.“It is mankind’s collective responsibility to reverse the damage to land caused by human activity,” the Prime Minister said during his virtual address in his capacity as president of the 14th Session of the Conference of Parties of United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).If left unchecked, land degradation “will erode the very foundations of our societies, economies, food security, health, safety and quality of life,” he said, and added that the world must “reduce the tremendous pressure on land and its resources. Clearly, a lot of work lies ahead of us.”The United Nations has estimated that one-fifth of Earth’s land area – which is more than 2 billion hectares – is degraded, including more than half of all agricultural land. And 12 million hectares of land is lost to desertification, land degradation and drought each year. In all, nearly 95% of calories from food come from soil, yet topsoil erosion has accelerated tenfold due to human activity. The world loses 24 billion tons of fertile soil annually due to dry-land degradation, with significant negative impacts on food production and economic activity.The high-level dialogue launched on Monday will assess progress made in this fight against land degradation and propose a way forward at the end of the UN Decade for Deserts and the Fight against Desertification, and the start of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.Modi reiterated Indian commitment to the cause linking it to the “importance [India gives] to land and [considers] the sacred earth as our mother”. Modi said India has taken the lead to highlight land degradation issues at international forums, and pointed to the “Delhi Declaration” of 2019, which called for “better access and stewardship over land” and emphasised gender-sensitive transformative projects.Over the last 10 years, India has added around three million hectares of forest cover, which, he said, enhanced the cumulative forest cover to almost one-fourth of the country’s total area. “We are on track to achieve our national commitment of land degradation neutrality,” he added.India is also working to restore 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030, which would help create an additional carbon sink — natural assets that absorb carbon dioxide — of 2.5 to 3 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.“We believe that restoration of land can start a cycle for good soil health, increased land productivity, food security and improved livelihoods,” the Prime Minister said, and went on to speak of “novel” efforts under way in the Banni region in the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat, which is marked by degraded land and lack of rain. India is restoring land there by developing grasslands.Modi then turned to the assistance India is providing to others to deal with land degradation, which, he said, poses a special challenge to the developing world. “In the spirit of South-South Cooperation, India is assisting fellow developing countries to develop land restoration strategies,” he said. India is setting up a centre of excellence “to promote a scientific approach towards land degradation issues”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/collective-duty-to-fight-land-degradation-pm-at-un-meeting-101623696585320.html
15-06-2021||India||Govt’s review of side effects confirms 1 death after vaccine dose||Three people from among the millions who received Covid-19 vaccines between February 5 and March 31 developed anaphylaxis due to the vaccine, and one of them died, according to a government review of serious side effects that could be linked to the coronavirus vaccines.The findings represent the first time a fatality has been linked to the vaccines, and strengthen the trend that these are rare: the three cases were among close to 60 million doses that were given during this period. In all, 28 people died after getting a dose during this period but most appeared not to have been linked, while the cause could not be determined in at least 9 of them.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverage“This is the first death where causality has been established, with vaccine resulting in an anaphylaxis reaction. But if you look at the overall numbers (crores of doses administered), and there is only this small number that got a severe reaction. There were 31 cases that were investigated and one death was due to vaccine, and among anaphylaxis cases, only two were found to be product-related. Most anaphylaxis reactions are managed,” said Dr NK Arora, chairperson, national AEFI committee.Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction.The person who succumbed due to anaphylaxis was a 68-year-old man who received his shot on March 8, 2021, shows the report accessed by HT.The other two cases formally declared as vaccine product related reaction (anaphylaxis) were that of a 21-year-old woman, and a 22-year-old man who received their shots on January 19 and 16 respectively. Both recuperated after treatment in a hospital.This analysis was in a set that was approved for causal investigation by the national AEFI committee between February 5 and March 31. HT’s data showed there were 59.1 million doses given during this period.“Of the 31 causally assessed cases, 18 were classified as having inconsistent causal association to vaccination (coincidental - not linked to vaccination), 7 were classified as indeterminate, 3 cases were found to be vaccine-product related, 1 was anxiety-related reaction, and 2 cases were found to be unclassifiable,” said the committee report.Also Read | What to do after Covid-19 vaccination if you have allergies? Govt repliesA special group has been formed to conduct causality assessment of AEFIs following COVID-19 vaccination. The results of causality assessment done by this special group are discussed in the National AEFI Committee meeting for final approval.As per data in the first week of April 2021, the reporting rate is 2.7 deaths per million doses administered and 4.8 hospitalisations per million vaccine doses administered.The committee in its report explains that vaccine product-related reactions are expected reactions that can be attributed to vaccination based on current scientific evidence, and examples of such reactions are allergic reactions and anaphylaxis.Indeterminate reactions are those that occurred soon after vaccination but for which there is no definitive evidence or clinical trial data. Further observations, analysis and studies are required to establish a causal link in such cases.Unclassifiable events are events that have been investigated but there is not enough evidence for assigning a diagnosis due to missing crucial information. When this relevant information becomes available, the case may be reconsidered for causality assessment.And coincidental events are events that are reported following immunisation but for which a clear cause other than vaccination is found on investigation.“Mere reporting of deaths and hospitalisations as serious adverse events does not automatically imply that the events were caused due to vaccines. Only properly conducted investigations and causality assessments can help in understanding if any causal relationship exists between the event and the vaccine. For causality assessments, priority has been given to death cases,” say experts in the report.Among 18 coincidental cases not linked to vaccination were cases of stroke, heart attack, septic shock and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Among seven deaths classified as indeterminate were cases of intracranial bleeding, acute myocardial infarction with pulmonary edema, cerebral artery ischemic infarct, sudden cardiac death, and a case of haemorrhagic venous infarct with severe thrombocytopenia.The two unclassifiable reactions were the deaths of a 55-year-old man, and a 43-year-old man. A 26-year-old man who was classified as ‘immunisation anxiety related reaction’ was hospitalised due to syncope (temporary loss of consciousness).Experts say it is important to get accurate information about vaccine related mortality through proper investigation.“The investigation needs to be skillfully done even though our competency to investigate vaccine caused mortality scientifically is very inadequate. As a nation we don’t care for accurate information but it is crucial to get to the cause,” said Dr Jacob John, former head, department of virology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govts-review-of-side-effects-confirms-1-death-after-vaccine-dose-101623696525780.html
15-06-2021||India||Vatican has rejected third appeal against eviction, says Kerala nun||Sister Lucy Kalappura, the Catholic nun who was expelled from the Franciscan Clarist Congregation (FCC) in 2019 and who had spoken up against rape-accused bishop Franco Mulakkal, said on Monday that a canon court in Vatican has turned down her third appeal against her expulsion.Kalappura, 55, said she received a fresh communiqué from the Vatican on Saturday in this regard following which the Mother Superior of the FCC, Sister Ann Joseph, sent a fresh notice to her to vacate her room in the convent, which she has continued to occupy after a local court in Wayanad stayed her eviction from there in 2019. Even the Kerala high court granted her protection that year.“The letter is in Latin, but the covering letter spells out the decision. Details will be available only after the letter is translated fully. But it is dated 2020,” Kalappura said in a telephone call from Manathawady in Wayanad.But it isn’t just the date that’s old — even the signature on it is from last year and there are signs that the original stamps on it were removed, the nun said, adding that it has created doubt in her mind about its veracity. “It seems the letter was fabricated to smoke me out of the convent. I fear it is part of a conspiracy by FCC superiors,” Kalappura alleged.When contacted, a spokesperson of the FCC refused to comment on the issue.According to an internal church communication, Apostalica Signatura, the apex judicial authority in the Catholic Church, rejected the nun’s third appeal against dismissing her from the century-old Congregation. “The appeal of Lucy Kalappura is rejected by Apostalica Signatura and the dismissal is confirmed,” a communication in the Congregation said.A church spokesperson confirmed to PTI that the one more appeal filed by the nun had been rejected by Vatican.But in the covering letter, Mother Superior Sister Ann Joseph said there was no legal remedy available to Sister Kalappura now to challenge her dismissal. “You have availed all three levels possible in the Catholic legal system. You no longer have the right and duty to wear the religious habit of the FCC hereafter and (have to) vacate the convent,” the letter read.Kalappura said she will continue her fight against “corrupt practices” in the church and lamented things not reaching the Pope. “The recent revision of church laws regarding the abuse of minors, vulnerable adults, committing fraud or the ordaining of women gave us much hope. But it seems the papal head is not getting a clear picture,” the nun said, adding that she will continue her fight.The Vatican had rejected her previous two pleas. During the hearing of a plea filed by her in a court in Wayanad last year, FCC authorities claimed “discipline of the convent was affected due to her continued presence”.Kalappura was expelled by the church for “serious indiscipline and flouting orders of superiors” but the nun claimed that she was victimised for supporting the agitation for the arrest of the deposed bishop of Jalandhar, Franco Mullakkal, who was accused of sexual assault by another nun in 2018. When his arrest was delayed, five nuns, all friends of the survivor, carried out a fast in Kochi demanding his arrest in which Kalappura had also participated.Later, she wrote an autobiography, ‘Karthavinte Namathil’ (In the name of Christ), which ruffled many feathers in the church. In the book she alleged that sexual abuse and assaults take place in convents and seminaries frequently and cited many incidents. She also alleged that there were at least four attempts of sexual assault on her during her life as a nun.Kalappura has previously run into trouble with the church for drawing her salary on her own (she was a high school teacher) and bought a car in her name. Catholic clergy are not allowed to own private property and their salaries go straight to church accounts.Save our Sisters (SOS), a Christian reformist body formed in the wake of the protest against the bishop, has pledged support to Sister Kalappura. “We will extend legal aid to her. It is sad that the church authorities are taking revenge on her,” said SOS convenor Shyju Antony.FCC is a Catholic order that traces its roots back to Saint Francis of Assisi in the 13th century.With PTI inputs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vatican-has-rejected-third-appeal-against-eviction-says-kerala-nun-101623696525232.html
15-06-2021||India||Recovering economy faces inflation threat||Retail inflation rose to 6.3% in May from 4.23% in April, propelled by an increase in both food and core inflation, going beyond the Reserve Bank of India’s upper comfort level of 6% for the first time since November, and suggesting that the incipient recovery in the economy may run into some headwinds. Experts say that inflation could continue to remain a challenge through the rest of the year. Wholesale inflation, meanwhile, rose to 12.94%,the highest in at least nine years, from 10.49%in April, partly on account of a low base (last May), but also because of higher fuel prices.The inflation data, released on Monday, comes even as the bruising second wave of Covid-19 ebbs in India, and the so-called unlock process with respect to movement and activities continues. The Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI) jumped to 76 in the week ending June 13 from 67.9 the previous week. This is the highest week-on-week improvement in NIBRI since February 9, 2020. A NIBRI of 100 indicates pre-pandemic level of business activities.The faster-than-expected inflationary surge, primarily driven by fuel prices and increase in prices of important food items such as edible oil and pulses, has the potential to squeeze both household and business incomes. The impact could be particularly severe on the poor, who are already in distress. That the inflation metrics are high is worrying experts because demand remains low. As demand rises, inflation may, too, and RBI may find itself in a quandary in choosing between keeping growth going or reining in inflation.For the government, the numbers pose both an economic and a political challenge.“CPI inflation is 6.3%. Do you want to know why? Fuel and power inflation is at 37.61%. Thanks to PM Modi raising petrol and diesel prices every day. Food inflation is at 6.3%... Pulses inflation is at 9.39%. Edible oil inflation is at 30%. These are high marks for competent economic management,” Congress leader and former finance minister P Chidambaram said.“A food-fuel driven inflationary spike will burden the poor disproportionately and squeeze their purchasing power. This is bound to have an adverse effect on aggregate demand, pricing power of sellers and therefore growth,” said Himanshu, an associate professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University. “Because cost of cultivation will rise sharply compared to the official projections which were made in March 2021, Minimum Support Prices will lose their remunerative cushion, generating headwinds for rural demand,” he added.While the magnitude of jump in both retail and wholesale prices has an element of surprise, the trend was expected. Petrol-diesel prices were kept frozen during the state election cycle in March-April. They have been increasing continuously since May because of rising crude prices and the reluctance of the Centre and the state to cut levies that account for almost 61% of the price of petrol and 54% of that of diesel (in Delhi).But crude is not the only primary commodity to have experienced a price surge. The Bloomberg Commodity Index, where energy related items have a weight of only 30%, increased from its January 4 value of 78.63 to 94.5 on June 14.The food component of CPI -- it has a weight of 39% in the overall CPI basket -- grew 5% in May, a sharp jump from its April value of 1.96%. The food component of WPI grew at 8% in May. What is remarkable about the latest surge in the food component of CPI is that this is happening despite a contraction in cereal and vegetable prices, which have a weight of 40% in the CPI food basket. The main driver of food prices are edible oils, with the oil and fat index growing at 30.8% in May 2021. Edible oil prices have been growing at double digits for 14 consecutive months. But even core inflation, which does not include food and fuel, rose 6.57% in the month, the highest in almost seven years.While part of the WPI spike is the base effect -- it contracted by 3.4% in May 2020, in a month when everything was locked down -- at 132.7, the 2021 number is higher than even May 2019 value of the index (121.6).And primary commodities aren’t exclusively to blame. The manufactured goods component of WPI, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the WPI basket, grew at an all-time high of 10.8% in May. “Elevated prices in the manufacturing segment are indicative of strengthening pricing power of manufacturers,” Madan Sabnavis, the chief economist at CARE Ratings, said in a note.An analysis of the results of 1,481 companies that made a net profit of ₹1.8 lakh crore in the quarter ending March 2021, by Mahesh Vyas, managing director of Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), echoes that sentiment: “Profits have increased entirely because of an increase in profit margins. This is true although March 2021 was the first quarter when the top-line was distinctly higher than its year-ago level after six quarters.Total income of the 1,481 listed companies in the March 2021 quarter was 14.5% higher than it was a year ago. Yet, this barely contributed 0.2% to the increase in profits. Growth in profits came from the huge jump in profit margin,” he said in the analysis published on the CMIE website.But that may not last.According to a Boston Consultancy Group (BCG) survey, summary findings of which were available at the CMIE website, “58% of consumers think their income in the next six months will be lower than pre-Covid levels. Similarly, 51% consumers expect their spends over the next six months to be lower as compared to 40% in the last round of the survey.”It added: “This decline in income sentiment is steepest among the less affluent income groups and those in small towns.”Put otherwise, the latest inflationary numbers could cloud the optimistic outlook around economic recovery as lockdown restrictions are removed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/recovering-economy-faces-inflation-threat-101623695866360.html
15-06-2021||India||Mehul Choksi was not allowed to renounce citizenship: India to Dominica court||India has informed the high court of justice in Dominica that Mehul Choksi, wanted in a bank fraud on the state-owned Punjab National Bank worth thousands of crores, was informed in March 2019 that the ministry of home affairs (MHA) had rejected his renunciation of Indian citizenship, and that he did not challenge this refusal.The argument, cited in a government affidavit filed last week , revolves around one issue that will determine whether or not the court decides to send him to India -- his citizenship. Choksi became a citizen of Antigua & Barbuda in 2016, but that country has been trying to revoke his citizenship (the matter is in the courts).Citing various legal deficiencies in Choksi’s declaration renouncing his citizenship, the government affidavit said the fact that Choksi never made this request “in person” but sent it directly to the Indian high commission in Georgetown, Guyana, is in contradiction with the rules under the Citizenship Act, 1955. Nor did Choksi present his request in the prescribed format, it added. Finally, section 8 of India’s Citizenship Act says a person ceases to be a citizen of India only after registration of his/her declaration by the prescribed authority, which is the home ministry in this case, the affidavit said.That India would use this line of argument before the Dominican court was first reported by HT on May 30.HT has reviewed the affidavit, filed by the ministry of external affairs consular officer Azad Singh, which seeks to “declare Choksi as an Indian citizen” and “deport him to India”.Choksi, 62, went missing from Antigua on May 23 but his family and lawyers have alleged he was abducted and taken to Dominica. Dominica has charged him with illegal entry. The magistrate’s court in Roseau on Monday adjourned the hearing to June 25. .HT reported on Saturday that the Indian government filed two affidavits in the Dominican court detailing serious fraud charges against Choksi and proof that he continues to be an Indian citizen. In the other affidavit, filed by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) deputy inspector general Sharda Raut, said Choksi was the main beneficiary of the fraud on Punjab National Bank and had not co-operated in the investigation, which revealed he laundered the money through a web of shell companies.Choksi submitted an application to the Indian mission in Georgetown, Guyana, on December 14, 2018, renouncing his Indian citizenship after acquiring Antigua & Barbuda’s citizenship on November 16, 2017.“After his application was submitted, the matter was examined at different levels within the government of India. On January 29, 2019, the ministry of home affairs found various deficiencies in the declaration provided, and also noted that Choksi was an economic offender, and thus advised the consular officer in the Indian mission in Georgetown to consider rejection of his declaration of renunciation,” the affidavit said.A communication to this effect was sent to Choksi on March 15, 2019.Citing Rule 23 of the Citizenship Act, the affidavit said, “declaration should be made in prescribed form XXII” for renunciation of citizenship and acknowledgement “should be issued in form XXIII”, which was not done. In fact, it was never acknowledged by the concerned officer as it was sent through post.“Mehul Choksi has not brought proceedings in India to challenge this rejection. Therefore, he continues to be a citizen of India under the provisions of the Citizenship Act, 1955,” the affidavit stated.Ministry of external affairs (MEA) has also contested the argument of Choksi’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal, who has stated that “a person automatically ceases to be citizen in India if he acquires citizenship of another country, according to section 9 of the Citizenship Act”.The government’s argument is that Choksi obtained Antigua’s citizenship “fraudulently”, a concern already raised with the island’s government; hence the claim under section 9 cannot be maintained.Terming Choksi’s claim erroneous, the affidavit added: “It is pertinent to mention here that authority to determine citizenship of another country – whether when or how citizenship was acquired – is Central government under rule 40 of the Citizenship Rules of 2009.”Choksi’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal said, “Firstly, in bail proceedings the question for determination is not citizenship. So this affidavit is uncalled for. Moreover, as per section 9, subsection 1 of the Citizenship Act, Mr Mehul Choksi is not a citizen of India and the reliance in the affidavit on various rules is fractured understanding of law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/choksi-was-not-allowed-to-renounce-citizenship-india-to-dominica-court-101623695805764.html
15-06-2021||India||Immunity lasts at least a year after infection, gets stronger after jab: Study||Antibodies and immune memory among people who contract Covid-19 remains stable up from six months to a year, and they get even better protection when vaccinated, according to a study published on Monday, which also found the body’s defences to have evolved over time to offer protection from mutations.The findings, from researchers led by a team from Rockefeller University and Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, were published in Nature as an accelerated article on Monday, and offer among the first concrete clues that immunity to the Sars-Cov-2 may be long-lasting.The researchers followed up with 63 people who were infected with Covid-19 1.3 months, 6 months and 12 months after they got infected. Of these, 26 (41%) received one dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or the Moderna vaccine.“In the absence of vaccination, antibody reactivity to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Sars-Cov-2, neutralising activity and the number of RBD-specific memory B cells remain relatively stable from 6 to 12 months,” said the paper.It added that in the case of those who got the vaccine, all components “of the humoral response” – or the antibodies that bind to and neutralise the virus – increased and even neutralised variants of concern (VOC) in a manner that was similar or better than how people fought off the original virus that first emerged from Wuhan in 2020.The study‘s findings could provide important clues about the future of the pandemic and, partly, answer one of the crucial questions that have been asked since the pandemic began: How long will immunity last? The answer seems to be 12 months.Experts who reviewed the study and spoke to HT said the findings were promising.“It is incredibly promising that immune response lasts for 12 months with natural infection. Also the immune response becomes significantly stronger after immunisation. This study shows that natural infection will lead to long lasting, at least over one year, population immunity and prevent huge surges of infections in future waves,” said Manoj Jain, infectious disease doctor and epidemiologist at Emory University, Atlanta.Jain said while the protective response against the mutant variants for 12 months was encouraging, particularly positive was the “boost in the immune response against the variants after the vaccine”.“However, the Nature study did not look at neutralising response again the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant which was the predominant one in India during the second wave. While we need laboratory and clinical trials on protection against each of the virus mutations, the present study is great news that our natural immunity and the vaccines are protective against many of the variants,” he added.The Nature study also reported several other crucial findings: persistent long-term symptoms appeared to reduce in people 12 months after their infection, when compared to six months. “Only 14% of the individuals reported persistent long-term symptoms after 12 months, reduced from 44% at the six-month time point,” the authors said.The authors also note that of the four variants they tested – Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1) and Eta (B.1.525), the lower neutralising activity was seen with Gamma, the variant seen first in South Africa.The researchers also found that the 12-month follow-up confirms a finding they saw at the six-month mark: the body’s adaptive immunity keeps evolving to better understand the Sars-CoV-2.In concluding, they noted that this “remarkable evolution” and the robust enhancement of immune response after vaccination suggests “that convalescent individuals who are vaccinated should enjoy high levels of protection against emerging variants without a need to modify existing vaccines.”“If memory responses evolve in a similar manner in naive individuals that receive vaccines, additional appropriately timed boosting with available vaccines should lead to protective immunity against circulating variants,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/immunity-lasts-at-least-a-year-after-infection-gets-stronger-after-jab-study-101623695805196.html
15-06-2021||India||5 LJP MPs rebel against Chirag, choose his uncle as leader in LS||Five of six Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) lawmakers in Lok Sabha replaced party chief Chirag Paswan with his uncle and Hajipur MP Pashupati Kumar Paras as the leader of the parliamentary party on Monday, after a late-night rebellion by senior leaders roiled the regional party and touched off a political storm in Bihar.In a letter to Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla on Monday, the five MPs said Paras was unanimously elected at the LJP parliamentary board meeting on Sunday at 6pm in Delhi. Khagaria MP Mehboob Ali Kesar was named deputy leader and Nawada MP Chandan Singh chief whip.“This is a decision taken out of compulsion. We were feeling suffocated,” said Paras, brother of late Union minister and LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan, who died last year. Late on Monday evening, the Lok Sabha secretariat issued a notification recognising Paras as the leader of the LJP parliamentary party.Paras underlined that the LJP will remain in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and praised Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, indicating that the party that was earlier bitterly opposed to the Janata Dal (United) might pursue a new direction under him. “There are six MPs in our party. It was the desire of five MPs to save our party. I have not broken party but saved it,” he said.Paras added that he bore no ill will towards his nephew and dismissed speculation that the party will break or merge with JD(U). LJP leaders aware of developments said Paras was likely to be formally made the party’s national president soon.The political change of guard was followed by dramatic scenes in Delhi as Paswan drove to meet Paras at his Rajendra Prasad Road residence but was left waiting outside the main gate for 15 minutes. Paswan , who is recuperating from Covid, drove himself with a cannula inserted in his hand clearly visible. He reached the residence at 11.45am and met Paras’s wife, said a person aware of developments.He left after an hour and 40 minutes, added the person, without speaking to the press. “He has been taken aback by the family feud that has threatened his hold over the party,” said a person close to the38-year-old Jamui MP.The surprise rebellion is an attempt to end the LJP’s alienation within the NDA -- where it is not invited to alliance meetings due to objections by the Janata Dal (United) – and comes amid speculation that Paras or his nephew, Samastipur MP Prince Raj, could be given a cabinet berth in Delhi.Paswan assumed charge of LJP after his father died weeks before the Bihar elections last year. But relations between Paras and Paswan nosedived when LJP decided to contest against the BJP-JD(U) alliance and Paswan targeted Kumar of misgovernance and corruption. During the campaign, Paras praised Kumar but was forced to retract his comment.LJP took in many JD(U) rebels and damaged Kumar’s party in at least 30 seats, almost costing the NDA a victory and resulting in the JD(U) posting its worst result and emerging as a junior partner to BJP. LJP also performed poorly, winning just one seat – its worst performance.In April, the lone party MLA, Raj Kumar Singh, joined the JD(U).Paras said some leaders inducted in the party in the run up to the Bihar polls were primarily responsible for the bad choices made. “99% of party leaders and cadres wanted to be in the NDA…however, influenced by some, it was decided to contest the election independently and everybody knows the humiliation the party suffered. It was a wrong decision,” he added.The rebellion is also aimed at ending the LJP’s isolation within the NDA, where the party is not called for meetings due to objections by the JD(U).Paras heaped lavish praise on Kumar. “He is a vikas purush (man of development). Bihar has developed under his regime, and we will support him in this endeavour,” he added.NDA leaders in Bihar said on condition of anonymity that 200 LJP leaders joined the JD(U) after the assembly polls and before his rebellion, Paras met JD(U) MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh, a close associate of Kumar. Singh, assembly deputy speaker Maheswar Hazari and member of legislative council Sanjay Singh met the five LJP MPs on Monday.“It is a well known adage that as you sow, so you reap. Chirag Paswan was heading a party which was with the NDA. Yet, he adopted a stance that damaged it in the assembly polls. This led to a sense of unease within his own party,” JD(U) leader RCP Singh told reporters in Patna.In Delhi, speculation swirled of a possible cabinet berth to one of the LJP rebels.“There has been talk that Paras or Prince could be offered a berth in the Union council of ministers. Since JD(U) made clear their views on not being in favour of Chirag, a change in leadership could be a compromise that can keep the party intact and part of the NDA alliance,” said an LJP functionary on condition of anonymityA second party leader who also did not wish to be named said Paswan took the first step to reach out to his uncle and will do his best to prevent a split in the party. “There is a possibility that he will agree to step down as party president to avoid a split in the LJP,” the second leader said.If the party leaders fail to reach an agreement and the party is split, then both factions will have to prove their majority in order to retain the party symbol.The BJP distanced itself from the issue. “This is an internal matter of the party and the family and we hope it is resolved at the earliest,” said BJP spokesperson Guru Prakash.Bihar Congress on Monday urged Chirag to break away from the BJP-led NDA and align with the Congress-RJD led Grand Alliance (GA) to fulfil dreams of his father, Ram Vilas Paswan.The Congress asked Paswan to join hands with the Opposition Grand Alliance and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) blamed Kumar. “Those who torch other’s houses shall not forget that the fire might also engulf their houses also. However, Nitish Kumar can’t just wish away the troubles that he faces after release of Lalu Prasad from the jail. The game is still on,” said RJD MLA and chief spokesman Bhai Birendra.Experts said Paswan damaged his political future by doing negative politics. “What happened in the LJP was bound to happen. Chirag got politics in platter but could not match his late father Ram Vilas Paswan’s aura. Old party men were feeling suffocated. Dalits have significant place in Bihar but Chirag couldn’t consolidate them,” said DM Diwakar, political expert and former director of AN Sinha Institute for Social Studies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-ljp-mps-rebel-against-chirag-choose-his-uncle-as-leader-in-ls-101623695565194.html
15-06-2021||India||UP journalist dies in ‘accident’ days after alleging threat to life||A television journalist died in Pratapgarh district of Uttar Pradesh, ostensibly in a road accident, a day after he said his life was under threat for reporting on the “liquor mafia” in the state. The family of the journalist has filed a complaint alleging that he was murdered, and the incident has sparked a political controversy with opposition leaders demanding a probe.The journalist, Sulabh Srivastava, who was in his forties, was found seriously injured on Katra road under the Kotwali police station limits on Sunday night, police said. Srivastava, who worked with ABP News, was rushed to a hospital in the district where he was declared brought dead, they added.Prayagraj zone additional director general of police, Prem Prakash, said it appeared that Srivastava lost control of his motorbike as the road was slippery, and suffered severe head injuries after hitting an electricity pole.Prakash confirmed that on Saturday he received Srivastava’s letter alleging a threat to himself and his family, and seeking protection. But he rejected claims that the journalist was assaulted. “Sulabh was alive after suffering injuries and spoke to his colleagues. He could have informed them had he been assaulted by someone,” the ADG said.In his letter to the ADG, Srivastava alleged that the liquor mafia was angry with him for his coverage of the illicit liquor trade in the district, and wanted to harm him and his family. He urged the official to initiate a probe into the matter, and sought protection.“ For the past two days I have observed that some persons are following me. Me and my family are living in fear of the liquor mafia who may harm us. Please get the issue investigated and ensure our security,” Srivastava said in his letter to the ADG. HT has seen a copy of the letter.“The incident is being probed from all possible angles,” ADG Prakash said, adding that the report of the post mortem examination was awaited to ascertain the exact cause of death.But Srivastava’s wife, Renuka Srivastava, alleged that he was murdered. A first information report (FIR) has been filed under sections 302 (murder) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against unidentified persons at the Pratapgarh Kotwali police station based on her complaint.Several Opposition leaders on Monday sought a probe into the journalist’s death.In a tweet, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav wanted to know why Srivastava was not provided security when he’d asked for it. “The mysterious death of a TV reporter in an alleged accident is extremely sad. The BJP government, in this case, should constitute a high-level probe, and tell the family members and the public why, despite the apprehension of murder by the liquor mafia expressed by the reporter, he was not provided security,” he said.Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in the state, accusing it of nurturing “Jungle Raj”. “Liquor mafia from Aligarh to Pratapgarh: Dance of death in the entire state. UP government silent. Journalists should expose the truth, warn the administration about the danger. The government is asleep. Does the UP government, which nurtures Jungle Raj, have any answer to the tears of the family members of journalist Sulabh Srivastava?” she said in a tweet in Hindi.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee tweeted, “Sad to see that despite “democracy & freedom” being a part of our ethos, we are unable to save lives of those who are working tirelessly towards unfolding the truth.”In a letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday, Pratapgarh MP Sangam Lal Gupta of the BJP sought financial assistance to the family of the journalist and a government job for his wife. He, too, demanded a thorough probe into the incident.But Gupta termed the allegations of the opposition leaders as “baseless”. “State government is taking strict action against liquor mafia and all other criminal elements in the state.”(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-journalist-dies-in-accident-days-after-alleging-threat-to-life-101623695446611.html
15-06-2021||India||Trust deficit remains a year after Galwan clash||A trust deficit persists between the Indian and Chinese armies a year after their soldiers were involved in a brutal clash along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the remote Galwan Valley, and the lack of confidence in each other has hampered the disengagement of rival troops from friction points in eastern Ladakh, people familiar with the border row said on Monday on the condition of anonymity.The Galwan Valley clash of June 15, 2020 was the first deadly skirmish between Indian and Chinese troops along the LAC in more than five decades, and pushed the bilateral relationship to breaking point -- it left 20 Indian soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese troops dead.“It will be extremely hard to bridge the trust deficit created by the actions of the Chinese PLA in Galwan Valley. The damage to the military relationship has been done. The current generation of soldiers will never forget what happened in Galwan,” said an official who has commanded troops in the sensitive Ladakh sector.India and China have been locked in a standoff in the Ladakh sector for over a year, and are currently negotiating a withdrawal of troops and weapons from friction points on the disputed border.Indian soldiers, led by Colonel B Santosh Babu, fought off numerically superior Chinese troops in the seven-hour conflict near Patrolling Point 14 in Galwan Valley. Babu, 37, was among the 20 Indian soldiers killed in action.Babu, the commanding officer of 16 Bihar, and five other soldiers who displayed outstanding courage during the skirmish with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) were awarded wartime gallantry awards. While Babu was posthumously awarded the Maha Vir Chakra (MVC), the other five got Vir Chakras (VrC). MVC is India’s second-highest war-time gallantry award, followed by VrC. Only one of the VrC awardees is alive.The lack of trust has cast its shadow on the disengagement process, said a second official.“Both armies have not thinned their deployments in their depth areas because there is no trust. Both sides can deploy more troops to forward locations if needed. They are also building infrastructure to support military deployments in the Ladakh theatre,” he said.The Indian Army and PLA have held 10 rounds of talks between corps commander-ranked officers after the skirmish, but the negotiations have only had limited success in hammering out an agreement for disengagement of rival soldiers from friction points. The first round of talks took place on June 6 before the Galwan Valley clash.The only significant outcome of the military dialogue so far has been the disengagement of front-line troops and weaponry in the Pangong Tso sector in mid-February.On May 28, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said that trust levels are bound to be low when a major standoff takes place between two countries leading to casualties on both sides. “However, it is always our endeavour that this trust deficit should not hinder the negotiation process. As two professional armies, it is imperative that we resolve the situation and make progress to restore trust at the earliest,” he said.The Chinese PLA cannot be trusted it will exploit any opportunity that comes its way, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd).“The Chinese in their ancient philosophy have a content of deceit. The same philosophy has been continued by the present strategists and planners of China…In Galwan, the Indian armed forces stood up to the Chinese and sent a clear message that we shall defend our territory at all costs,” Jaswal added.While disengagement from Pangong Tso has been completed, talks have not yielded any results in resolving the problems at Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang.Also, both armies have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each in the Ladakh theatre and the deployments haven’t thinned after the disengagement in the Pangong Tso sector.Naravane earlier said his soldiers were on high alert as PLA continued to base its troops and mechanised elements including tanks in its “immediate depth” across the LAC from where they could be deployed to forward areas at short notice. (Immediate depth in the context of the Ladakh sector refers to a distance of 150km to 200km from the LAC.)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trust-deficit-remains-a-year-after-galwan-clash-101623695385145.html
