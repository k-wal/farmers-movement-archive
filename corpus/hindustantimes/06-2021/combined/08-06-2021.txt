08-06-2021||News||The rural healthcare challenge||Covid-19 made inroads into rural and peri-urban areas during the second wave, with rural districts accounting for 53% of new cases and 52% of Covid-19 deaths in May, according to a recent report. This could be an even bigger challenge during a subsequent surge. Set within the larger context of a poorly funded public health system, the inadequacies of rural health care are immense.There is an 18% shortage of health subcentres (SC), 22% shortage of primary health centres (PHC), and a 30% shortage of community health centres (CHC) in rural India (2018), with just 3.2 government hospital beds for every 10,000 people.In mid-May, the government released the SOP on Covid-19 containment & management in peri-urban, rural & tribal areas. It lays down a comprehensive range of measures including surveillance, screening, isolation, referral; home and community-based isolation and monitoring; a three-tier structure for institutional Covid-19 management; post-Covid-19 management; mental health support; vaccination; and intersectoral coordination, community mobilisation and behavioural change, led by gram panchayats and community-based structures. While commendable in its approach, its implementation will be met with gargantuan challenges.Also Watch | ‘India’s recovery rate climbing up; right now at 93.94%’: Dr Harsh VardhanIt is important to understand the development philosophy that characterises India’s rural health system. Traditionally, rural health care in India has seen a prominent curative-preventive dichotomy. In contrast to urban areas, preventive care services, including maternal and child health services, family planning, and immunisation, have dominated rural health allocations, and curative care has been inadequate.Rural health services constituted only 27% of state public expenditure on “medical and public health” in 2015-16, while urban health services constitute 44%.Combating rural Covid-19 will not only entail a revamp of rural curative care infrastructure and manpower, but will also require a reorientation of health personnel competencies and public expectations from the rural health system.As of 2019, only 59.2% of SCs and 55.9% CHCs had auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) and specialists’ quarters respectively, and 11.5% SCs lacked all-weather approachable roads. As of 2020, 34.2% PHCs functioned 24x7, while CHCs saw a 76.1% shortage of specialists, with only 51.7% CHCs having a functional X-ray machine.Similarly, many district hospitals, which act as dedicated Covid-19 hospitals for severe cases, remain highly deficient in critical care infrastructure. While schools and community halls can be converted into makeshift Covid care centres, a lot would depend on how we empower ANMs and multi-purpose workers as nodal persons at these centres.Turning a four-six bed PHC into a 30-bed dedicated Covid-19 health care centre (DCHC), with the provision of oxygen, drugs, and manpower, will be a mammoth task. Also, retraining medical officers and nurses would be pivotal since, in most cases, their clinical armamentarium remains largely restricted to simple ailments and maternal and child health care.It is unrealistic to expect that such extensive curative care gaps could be filled even temporarily within a short span, which makes it even more important to focus on preventive efforts (including vaccination), with double the usual strength for rural areas. The SOP has provisions for risk communication and community mobilisation measures and envisages a prominent role for village health nutrition and sanitation committees (VHNSC) and gram panchayats. However, this has to be backed with sufficient finances, technical assistance, and local autonomy. Addressing the maldistribution of Covid facilities between rural and urban areas is essential.Also Read | PM-CARES for Children’ scheme: SC gives Centre more time to draw up modalitiesDuring the first wave, many grassroots- and middle-tier public health facilities catered to essential non-Covid-19 health care requirements. Even a cursory examination of publicly available data reveals that such routine essential services suffered considerable disruption. With most rural health facilities involved single-mindedly in Covid-19 mitigation, the impact on routine essential care could get worse and can be disastrous unless adequate provisions are made. Haphazard management of other common febrile conditions in the Covid-19 scenario has been common.Interactions with grassroots health personnel reveal that even with a lesser caseload, segregation of patients in outpatient departments has been challenging. Further, while ancillary staff are recruited to assist in a range of activities from case monitoring to surveillance, the burden of training and preparing them often falls on overburdened health personnel. It will be crucial to address these in a rural flare-up of the pandemic.One important measure to facilitate surveillance, early detection, monitoring, as well as community participation in remote areas could be to involve the ubiquitous informal practitioners (IP) through appropriate crash training. The West Bengal government recently announced such a measure. While this could be contested by the medical fraternity, an emergency of this magnitude warrants extraordinary steps as the benefits exceed the risks. It has been shown that apart from convenience and affordability, cultural factors are an important reason for visiting IPs as they often have the faith of their communities. The SOP already envisages involving religious leaders to facilitate Covid-appropriate behaviour.The most favourable and enduring transformations are often forged in the crucible of severe challenges. While the rural challenge looks insurmountable, successful implementation could provide scaffolding for an exemplary rural health system that India has dreamt of ever since independence.Dr Soham D Bhaduri is a physician, health policy expert, and chief editor, The Indian Practitioner The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-rural-health-care-challenge-101623065913926.html
08-06-2021||News||Can exports boost India’s GDP in 2021-22?||On June 4, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the reserve bank of India downgraded its growth forecast for the Indian economy. India’s GDP is expected to grow at 9.5% in 2021-22 instead of 10.5%. Even as it made a downward revision in its growth projections, MPC noted a possible source of tailwinds to growth and said that “… the strengthening global recovery should support the export sector”. Can India exploit the export route to a faster economic recovery? The answer to this question is complicated.World GDP will surpass 2019 levels in 2021, but India’s post-pandemic recovery will be relatively muted A simple way to judge the extent (or lack ) of post-pandemic economic recovery for any country is to compare its GDP in 2021-22 with the 2019-20 (pre-pandemic) value. India was a better performer on this indicator according to data from the April 2021 World Economic Outlook (WEO) by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The April 2021 WEO projected a GDP contraction of 8% for India in 2020-21 and a growth of 12.5% in 2021-22. These numbers were 3.3% and 6% respectively for the world economy. Once IMF’s projections for 2021-22 GDP growth are replaced with the RBI’s, India becomes a laggard on this count. A Bloomberg poll of economists has projected India’s 2021-22 GDP growth at 10%, a number closer to RBI’s forecast than IMF’s April projections.Global trade will bounce back at a slower pace than GDP The recovery in global trade will be slower than that in overall GDP. The WEO database also gives projections on what it calls traded volume of goods and services. This number fell sharply during the pandemic, suffering a contraction of 8.5% in 2020. It is expected to grow at 8.4% in 2021, which means trade volumes will not regain 2019 levels this year. While the annual growth will remain higher than average at 6.5% in 2022, it is expected to moderate gradually going forward. Because the latest WEO projections seem to overestimate GDP growth for India, the associated import and export growth projections -- the former will exceed the latter until 2026 -- could be misleading.Foreign trade generated tailwinds, not headwinds, for India’s GDP in 2020-21 The argument that the Indian economy could gain from higher exports this year would hold true if India were a net exporter of goods. That is not the case. So, the net impact of trade on the economy will depend on what happens to imports as well. In other words, exports will have to rise at a faster rate than imports or imports fall at a faster rate than exports, for foreign trade to have a favourable impact on GDP. The latter is what happened in 2020-21. Trade deficit as share of GDP, was 1.27% in 2020-21, the lowest since 2017-18. If 2015-16 and 2016-17 are excluded, then the trade deficit to GDP ratio in 2020-21 is the lowest since 2005-06. A major reason for the abnormal fall in the trade deficit to GDP ratio in 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2020-21 was a crash in crude oil prices; it was less than $50/barrel in all these years. Because India is a large net importer of oil, oil prices have an important role in determining the trade deficit.Lowering of trade deficit in 2020-21 was not just cheap oil Although oil is an important determinant of India’s trade deficit, it is not the only factor. India is also a large importer of a variety of non-petroleum products, especially capital and intermediate goods. Because overall economic activity took a hit in 2020-21, even non-petroleum imports came down. This can be seen clearly if India’s trade deficit is broken up into petroleum and non-petroleum components. Both these components are expected to go up significantly in 2021-22. Crude oil prices are hovering around $70 per barrel, much higher than the average price of $44.8 per barrel in 2020-21. As the domestic economy picks up, even non-petroleum imports are expected to rise. To be sure, exports should go up as well, but then, India has been running a trade deficit in non-petroleum items for a long time. This means that the net positive impact of trade (net exports) on 2021-22 GDP might be lower than what it was in 2020-21.Exports could still play a role in economic recovery A senior private sector economist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that there is another route which could lead to trade driven tailwinds for India’s GDP. If exporters are bullish about their foreign markets, they could undertake higher investments and this may create a virtuous cycle of private investment led demand in the economy. This can compensate to some extent for weak consumer sentiment driven headwinds in domestic markets, he said.Also Read | Income Tax Department to launch new e-filing portal todayThis year’s Economic Survey had an important lesson on this count. It pointed out that a big reason for India’s exports underperforming Bangladesh’s was that the latter, unlike the former, was specialising in export of labour abundant goods, where both India and Bangladesh being labour intensive countries have a comparative advantage. While Bangladesh’s export basket is in keeping with this economic reality — textiles, footwear and apparel constitute 90% of its exports — around 40% of India’s exports are capital or technology intensive. As is obvious, realignment of export driven sectors to labour intensive goods can also generate a bigger positive impact on mass incomes and aggregate demand. If India has to exploit the export route, it will need to adopt a more pro-active policy than merely hoping that a statistical rebound in global trade can lift its economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/can-exports-boost-india-s-gdp-in-202122-101623060873625.html
08-06-2021||News||There is a gender gap in India’s vaccination coverage||India’s Covid-19 vaccination drive seems to have a gender bias.Women are lagging behind men in the vaccines administered so far. The Co-WIN dashboard gives a gender-wise breakup of the number of people who have been vaccinated so far. As of June 4, 178.9 million people have been given at least one dose of vaccines. Men comprise of 54% of this number. The gender gap in vaccines varies across states and union territories. Jammu and Kashmir, Delhi, and Uttar Pradesh are among the worst performers. In two states – Kerala and Chhattisgarh — women outnumber men when it comes to those who have received at least one dose of the vaccine.What explains this gender gap in vaccination? It is important to get an in-built statistical bias out of the way before looking at probable causes. Men outnumber women in India. There were 943 women in India per thousand men according to the 2011 census. According to the population projections made for March 2021 by the National Commission on Population, there are likely to be 948 women per thousand men in India. So, is the number of vaccinated men outnumbering women just a function of India’s skewed sex-ratio?Also Read | US lawmakers push Biden for more Covid-19 vaccines and medical aid to IndiaThis is unlikely to be the case. India’s sex-ratio deteriorates as one moves from older to younger age-groups. This number is 1065 for the 60 and above cohort, 982 for the 45–60-year-olds cohort and falls to 939 for the 18–45-year-olds.Unfortunately, Co-WIN dashboard does not provide a gender-wise break-up of the vaccinated population for these age groups. It does give overall age-wise data on those who have received vaccines. As of June 4, this number is 44.1% for those who are 60 years and above, 36.5% for the 45-60 age group and 7.1% % for the 18-45 age group. Because women have a favourable sex ratio in the 45 and above age-group and it is the population in this age-group which has the biggest share in vaccines administered so far, they should have had a bigger share in the vaccinated population so far. That this has not happened shows that India’s vaccination policy has a gender bias.To be sure, not all states seem to have done badly in ensuring gender balance in vaccination. The following chart captures this in a simple way. Theoretically, the more favourable a state’s sex ratio in the 45 and above age-group and the higher the share of doses given to this age group relative to their share in vaccine eligible population, the better should the gender balance in vaccines be.Kerala and Chhattisgarh look like the perfect case in this chart and Delhi, with its worst sex ratio and low relative share of vaccination in the 45 and above age group, is the worst-case scenario. However, states such as Rajasthan and Telangana seem to be bad outliers.Why is this happening? Public health experts and women on the ground point to a variety of factors, including longstanding structural problems in health care, lack of awareness in rural areas, gender divide in tech access and the oversized control of male members of households on resources.“The gendered nature of health care access hurts women. For example, within the family, male members often get higher share of food and nutrition. It was therefore surprising that the vaccine policy was gender neutral, not gender sensitive,” said Soumitra Ghosh, a professor at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences.Take Rashi Devi, a 43-year-old woman in eastern Uttar Pradesh. A resident of Ballia district, Devi is aware of the vaccination drive but said that the elders in her village are not very keen on taking the shot. Moreover, the immunisation centre is not nearby and she doesn’t own a smart phone.“My husband will register our family along with the other men in our mohalla. He will get the first shot and I will take later; I have heard that after the jab, you get high fever for a week, so someone needs to take care of the household work during that time,” she said. Those between 18 and 45 have to register on the Co-WIN platform and book their slots.The first phase of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) conducted in 22 states and UTs in 2019-20 showed that an average of only about three in 10 women in rural areas use the internet, compared to about half the men. The average for urban and rural areas combined for these 22 regions shows that about four out of 10 women used the internet, compared to six out of 10 men.Such forms of discrimination, coupled with a critical shortage in vaccine supplies, also played into popular stereotypes that project men as the provider who go out for work and women as domestic.“There is a problem of access to information, access to gadgets and access to finances. Even though women are as vulnerable as men, they are seen as lesser priority. This can have hugely negative impact on maternal and reproductive health, nutrition and public health outcomes,” said Manjula Pradeep, director of the Dalit Human Rights Defenders Network. “This has a further damaging impact on women from marginalised communities, including those in frontline professions such as sanitation workers.”A way ahead to close the emerging gender gap can be using takeaways in previous mass vaccination campaigns and using the Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) network, said Ghosh. “There can be special drives for women, and Asha can be incentivised for every Covid shot they administer. This can be successful because the Asha network is extensive and deep. We need an innovative and multi-pronged approach,” Ghosh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/there-is-a-gender-gap-in-india-s-vaccination-coverage-101623060093797.html
08-06-2021||News||An era of new-age school assessments||The government’s decision to cancel the class 12 board examinations, conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), in the backdrop of the devastating impact of the pandemic and public outrage, comes as a relief for thousands of anxious students and their parents.The issue now is about the parameters on which students will be assessed and marked this year. Equally important is the methodology that would be used to ensure objectivity in assessment. There is an old saying — one can, albeit with difficulty, defy the effects of bad teaching, but escaping the impact of bad assessment is onerous indeed.In the immediate context, boards can think of different permutations and combinations, prioritising student interests. It can, for example, set up panels to grade each student, and, after eliminating marks given at both the lower and higher ends, come out with an average score. To do so, it can rely on historical data of the students’ performances, particularly of their best year.Additionally, marks obtained in the class 10 boards, and in the internal assessments and practical examinations in class 12 may be looked into. Fortunately, most CBSE schools have conducted practical examinations and have uploaded the results. And in cases where all practicals may not have been conducted, it may well liberally extrapolate marks from subjects for which examinations may have been conducted. Not much would be gained by assessing performances in classes 9 and 11 as students in these grades tend to be more focused on honing their co-curricular skills and social networks. For objectivity, fairness and transparency, the results of a particular school may be required to be vetted by a partner school.Irrespective of any decisions that CBSE may come up with, there will be dissenting voices. However, this being a unique year all stakeholders will need to deal with the outcome with patience, trust and understanding. Universities, boards and schools need to come together in the best interest of the students.That said, given the fact that institutions of teaching and learning — both schools and colleges — will have to undergo cyclic phases of closure and opening, they may have to adhere to hybrid learning. Working out a renewed assessment and evaluation system that, in being objective, is also simultaneously flexible, to cater to hybridity, is most pertinent in the long-run.Attempts should be made to integrate regular in-house examinations with additional parameters of assessment such as communication abilities, critical thinking, creativity, ability to use knowledge for problem-solving, as well as collaborative social and citizen skills. The key idea behind such an evaluation is to understand the level of a student’s achievement of the objectives of the subject. While, in the early stages, these objectives could be set by teachers, students could be allowed to have some say, as they move on to higher classes. Evaluators can then correlate objectives to student performance. Multiple methods of assessments need to be used so that each child is assessed at her own level and potential, to help develop self-esteem and confidence.The board exams will have to be flexible in their approach, dissuading rote learning. This learner development can only take place if assessment is sequential and continuous with application to real life, through case studies, open book testing, multiple choice questions, research and project-based learning.Interestingly, the National Education Policy or NEP (2020) has provisions on regular formative assessments, designed to test conceptual clarity, analytical abilities and competence in terms of critical thinking. It also stresses on assessments, defining and identifying learning outcomes throughout the year through formative evaluation. Additionally, the provisions for stage-based assessments in classes 3, 5 and 8, in addition to board examinations in classes 10 and 12, and the idea of a national assessment centre, Parakh, to set benchmarks in standards are novel indeed.This new-age assessment, as NEP describes it, aims to bring big shifts. But to be consistent both in approach and analysis, it necessitates multiple pedagogical approaches enabling differential learning. At the most fundamental level, however, it will be dependent on the extent to which the capacity of teachers is enhanced. Empowering them to develop internal assessment models that deal with competency-based learning, skills, attitudes and values, instead of standardised pen-paper testing systems is a must. An attempt has to be made to integrate periodic and continuous evaluation with unGooglable questions which focus on critical thinking, creativity, problem-solving and decision-making skills. Most importantly, schisms have to be laid at rest, mindsets will need change, training in pedagogy, technology and classroom transaction will have to be done on a war-footing failing which we will never be able to break the stranglehold of rote-based, pencil-paper-oriented colonial systems of learning.Evaluating the performance of students is not just an external obligation, but is increasingly motivated by those who are involved in shaping it — faculty, staff, and institutional leadership. The need to put an alternative mechanism of assessment in place, robust enough to yield results both in normal times as well as in times of exigencies, is most imperative. Let us create an assessment system that is underlined by expertise and the ethics of trust.Ameeta M Wattal is principal, Springdales School, Pusa Road.

08-06-2021||Mumbai||‘Monsoon to arrive in Mumbai two days before date of onset’: IMD||The southwest monsoon is likely to arrive in the city on June 9, two days earlier than its normal onset date of June 11, officials in the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Tuesday. “The conditions for the onset of the monsoon have become very favourable over Mumbai and the larger Konkan area. It may happen within the next 24 hours,” said Shubhangi Bhute, meteorologist with the IMD’s regional forecasting centre, on Tuesday afternoon. The north-most limit of the monsoon, as of Tuesday afternoon, was continuing to pass over Alibag and Pune. “A Low-Pressure Area is likely to form over North Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood areas around June 11 2021. Under its influence, fairly widespread to widespread rainfall activity is likely,” said the IMD.Heavy showers are expected in Mumbai for at least three days between June 9 and June 14. The IMD has also issued an orange category, ‘severe warning’, alert for the entire Konkan coast on June 12.For the day, Mumbai received 19.6mm of pre-monsoon rainfall as per data from its observatory in Santacruz. However, several other parts of the city received as much as 40mm of rain, as per data with the municipal corporation. Till June 8, Mumbai received 27 per cent of its monthly average for the season at 136 mm rain (as against the monthly average of 493.1 mm).As per the IMD’s seven-day forecast for Mumbai, “generally cloudy sky with heavy rain” has been forecast till June 12, after which the intensity of showers may reduce for a period. The city’s maximum daytime temperature was 32.1 degrees Celsius, while the minimum temperature was 25.5 degrees Celsius, both 2 degrees below normal. Mumbai has now seen two consecutive days of below normal diurnal temperatures.Despite intense spells of rain being in the forecast, independent meteorologists pointed out that IMD’s doppler radar has not been functional for at least three weeks now, since the passage of cyclone Tauktae. “The monsoon is set to arrive in Mumbai and coastal Maharashtra very soon, but the radar at Mumbai continues to be out of order. The entire coast is set to witness a lot of rain from this weekend. In the absence of this radar, real-time monitoring of heavy rains is impossible,” independent meteorologist Akshay Deoras tweeted. IMD officials in Mumbai were unable to clarify when the radar will be up and running again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/monsoon-to-arrive-in-mumbai-two-days-before-date-of-onset-imd-101623176928588.html

The blood relatives of the deceased wallowed in despair and the afternoon heat, as a vial of their blood was required to identify the deceased, after the fire had charred all 17 bodies beyond recognition.Families of the victims, who were mostly women, arrived from far flung districts of Osmanabad, Beed, and Solapur, among others, to provide DNA samples. The families also stood close to the Covid-19 treatment building of the district hospital, as the police and hospital staff failed to provide any explanation for hours. Seven of the 17 victims, mostly women, were from Urawade village, where the company is located. Their job at the company had formed an unlikely kinship among them. Saved by a parcel Vainkat Kawade had left the company premises only minutes before the fire broke out and returned to billowing flames that consumed his wife on Monday. “I had gone to drop a parcel in Pirangut itself around 3pm. Nobody told me anything. I returned and saw that sight. Our children were in a company accommodation merely a few feet away from the company. Only my wife was inside,” said Kawade. His wife, Archana Kawade (36), and her younger brother Sachin Ghodke (24), both died in the fire. The helpless man helped them gain employment in the company. Kawade had started seeing red by the time the clock struck 3:30pm on Tuesday as neither the police, nor the hospital staff or his employer, had any answers about when he could see whatever remained of his wife. Friendship of labourThe trio of Trishla Sambhaji Jadhav (32), Shital Dattatray Khopakar (43), and Sangitla Ulhas Gonde (43), lived in a residential area at the end of a narrow dirt path located around 4km from SVS Aqua Tech company, where they breathed their last.“Trishla Jadhav lived in a house above ours for a long time. The fact that she had a job was quite celebrated. Our neighbour or someone in the neighbourhood who had a vehicle would drop and pick her up every day, since her employment began during lockdown when public transport was shut. Sometimes the three women walked back home together after their shift,” said Sunit Joshi (32), a housewife living in the building where Jadhav used to live.The three were among various women who lived in the area and sought employment in the industrial units nearby.Husband escaped, but could not save his wifeMangal Baban Margale (29), had returned to work after sick leave of one month. She, like many women working in the company, had gained employment during the lockdown months in 2020.Margale and her husband’s aunt Suman Sanjay Dhebe (38), worked together, along with Margale’s husband Baban Haribhau Margale (34), at the company.“She had been working in packaging in the back room and I was in the front room. There were some routine floor tasks going on when something burst, and the fire started. We ran out the front door and assumed everyone would. By the time I realised that my wife was not among those who had come out, the fire had spread too much,” said Margale, whose eyes were blood red due to the smoke he had been around.His uncle, Sanjay Dhebe (38), worked as a delivery executive and was lost for words. He said, “I was delivering a package when I got his call, and he was crying loudly. It was difficult to make out what he was saying. By the time I changed vehicles and reached here, the fire had engulfed everything.”Fireman finds familiar name among victimsRizwan Faras (26), was among the firemen who doused the fire and cooled the place down while looking for bodies that were charred beyond recognition.Him and his friends were discussing the events of last night and looking at videos of themselves during the fire operation shot by locals. When asked about the most difficult part of the operation, Faras listed logistical problems before saying, “And then I saw a familiar name on the list. Dhanashree Shelar (22). She is a native of Nele in Javeli and is a relative of a friend of mine in Satara. She was young and had recently started working here.”Shelar was the youngest victim of the tragedy. Her parents arrived from Satara to provide blood samples to identify her remains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/friends-relatives-co-workers-tragic-story-of-lives-burnt-beyond-recognition-in-pirangut-fire-101623176926973.html

Now as the unlock process has started in the state, he returned to Pune on Monday and began his preparations for second semester examinations. “The major problem is internet connectivity in our village, as it is in a remote area of Ahmednagar district. I had to travel to other villages to appear for my online exams for the first semester. I didn’t have enough study material with me. Now I have come back to Pune to my hostel, where all my books and other necessary things are there,” said Kudale, a second-year law student. Many students who went back to their villages and hometowns have started returning to Pune. There is an entire ecosystem of messes, hostels, books and stationary stores and many things, dependent on these students. Another student, Resham Chintal, who is preparing for competitive exams said, “I come from Beed district and there are no facilities. Even electricity supply is not regular. It impacted my scheduled timetable for the forthcoming exams. Due to the strict lockdown and inter-district closure of transport I got stuck in my hometown. When the unlock began, I immediately came to Pune by a private tourist bus along with my father and have been staying in a hostel.” In Pune, especially in the peth areas, there are many private hostels, paying-guest facilities, study centres, private coaching classes, food messes and snacks centres, which provide for students coming from outside the city limits. Similar is the case near college campuses like Bharati Vidyapeeth, MIT College and D Y Patil in Chinchwad. Santosh Gadhave, owner of a food mess in Navi peth, said, “Our complete business is dependent on students who come here for studies and have two meals at our mess. As the lockdown started in April, the students started going back and hardly 10 to 12 students stayed back, which impacted our business. Now students are returning, and we hope to have better business.” Dinesh Shah, owner of a small girls’ hostel in Bharati Vidyapeeth area said, “There were seven girls at our hostel before April and then all of them went back home. It’s the same all over in Katraj. We didn’t take rent for these two months. Now slowly, one by one, students are returning to join the hostel.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/students-return-to-unlocked-pune-much-to-relief-of-hostels-messes-101623176867683.html

The victim in the video was seen asking for mercy but the assailants kicked him on his face and pinned him to the ground. The accused then forcibly removed his undergarments as well and assaulted him even as the victim desperately pleaded for mercy. In the video, the victim was heard referring to the assailants as Sonu and Imran while assailants were heard dropping names of Rajapur and Beli localities in the video.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/video-of-youth-being-stripped-thrashed-goes-viral-fir-lodged-101623175847785.html

It isn’t particularly dangerous,” Dr Ramesh Kumar, former weather scientist at the National Institute of Oceanography, said. “It is quite unlikely that the phenomenon is recent in nature. It is more likely that with recording devices being more readily available and technology having improved that we are able to witness these,” he said, adding that curiosity in the occurrence has also increased over the years. The tornado-like vortex was seen on Monday evening reaching down from the sky amid overcast conditions, swirling over the waves and reaching right up to the clouds, people who saw it first hand described as having witnessed it for the first time. Meanwhile, a lifeguarding agency named Drishti has warned beachgoers that the safest way is to move perpendicular to the direction the whirlwind is moving. “A waterspout is a vertical funnel of high-velocity wind and condensed water moving over the sea; there can be two kinds of tornadic or fair-weather and they usually last 5-10 minutes with speed up to 100kmph. As in the case of Baga, they can move to or from land. To stay safe, move at a 90-degree angle to its movement and do not go closer to explore,” the agency stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/unusual-waterspout-fascinates-goa-beachgoers-usually-harmless-say-scientists-101623175847327.html

08-06-2021||Delhi||Activists seek easier access to vaccines for transgenders, sex workers||Several activists and NGOs have demanded easier access to vaccines in “community friendly settings” and assistance in booking slots working for transgender persons and sex workers in the Capital.“Most of the transgender persons are severely hit by the pandemic. They have literally no money left for survival and on top of that, now they have no avenue to get vaccinated. Many are not comfortable visiting the usual vaccination centres because of social ostracisation. My partner has failed to get a slot till date. We know there’s a shortage of vaccines, but even those who are above 45 years in our community are finding it difficult to book slots. Some of them do not have Aadhaar cards, they need a helping hand and the government should come forward,” said Amrita Sarkar, advisor, transgender wellbeing and advocacy at India HIV/AIDS Alliance.They also pointed out that many in these communities are already suffering from HIV, complications fromsex reassignment surgery and hormone intake, and drug addiction, making them vulnerable to Covid-19. Delhi had at least 55,633 female sex workers and 9,496 transgender persons, who are covered as “High Risk Groups” under the National AIDS Control Programme of the Union ministry of health and family welfare.The All India Network of Sex Workers (AINSW), a collective of 5 million sex workers in India, last week wrote to the Delhi government demanding better access to vaccines for the people of these communities.“The community of sex workers and transgender/hijra persons are not only at high risk of Covid-19 infection, but are also vulnerable on account of their socio-economic status, the stigma, discrimination and exclusion that they face in society, as well as a lack of information, services, resources and support. Lack of identity documents, including documents with date of birth, residence proof and self-identified gender identity is another barrier in accessing services such as Covid-19 vaccination,” the AINSW said in its note to the Delhi government.The AINSW urged the Delhi government to deploy volunteers and healthcare workers to register and vaccinate sex workers and transgender persons in community friendly settings. To address vaccine hesitancy, which is high among these communities, it sought dedicated awareness programmes to address myths and misconceptions.A Delhi government spokesperson said a special vaccination drive for such communities is under active consideration. “This is under consideration. Once we have sufficient vaccination, we will vaccinate each and every citizen of Delhi,” the spokesperson said.Dr. Rashmi Singh, director of Delhi government’s department of women and child development (WCD) said, “It does not necessarily need a specific government order to implement this. Each district has a district task force which can on its own take such initiatives. But yes, as of now, there are no such drives or vaccination centre for transgender persons and sex workers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/activists-seek-easier-access-to-vaccines-for-transgenders-sex-workers-101623175606714.html
08-06-2021||Delhi||Implement One Nation One Ration Card in Delhi at earliest: Centre to AAP govt||The Union government has asked the Delhi government to speedily implement the “One Nation One Ration Card” programme, which helps beneficiaries, especially migrant workers, to avail of subsidised food commodities from anywhere in the country, pointing out that the scheme was already functional in 32 states and Union Territories.The move comes a day after the Delhi unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party asked the Delhi government to implement the scheme if its aim was to make life better for migrant workers -- a response to a claim by Delhi’s Aam Aadmi Party government that the Union government was stalling its doorstep ration delivery programme.The One Nation, One Ration Card programme is a national platform that digitises ration cards, details of beneficiaries, monthly quota of ration under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, and allows withdrawals through electronic point of sale machines, thereby allowing the mobility of ration benefits. India provides cheap foodgrains to nearly 800 million beneficiaries across the country under the NFSA 2013.Delhi has not yet implemented the scheme, which was first tried in four states in August 2019. A Delhi government spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In a letter to Delhi chief secretary on June 8, food secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said Union food minister Piyush Goyal, in February 2021, had urged the state government to “consider expeditious resumption” of electronic point of sale (e-PoS) devices in all fair price shops in Delhi for transparency in distribution of foodgrains and also to implement One Nation One Ration Card plan. “However, progress in this regard is yet to be made,” the letter said.Delhi had suspended the installation of e-PoS devices, which are similar to card swiping machines, but has resumed the process, which is critical to One Nation One Ration Card plan. There were also disruptions due to the pandemic.The past week saw differences arising between the Centre and the Delhi government over the new mechanism proposed by the Delhi government to distribute subsidised foodgrains.The Delhi government has proposed home delivery of ration, which the Aam Aadmi Party, which rules Delhi, had promised in its election manifesto.Nearly 7.2 million people in Delhi are eligible for some form of subsidized food at present, including 1.7 million ration card holders and nearly 3 million priority households, besides other additional food insecure categories identified by the Delhi government.“The Centre’s stand is that the Delhi government can offer foodgrains to beneficiaries the way it wants to, under any scheme it chooses at notified prices, but the existing national system under NFSA should not be disturbed because it is a countrywide programme under a national law,” a senior Union government official said, requesting that he not be quoted. The Centre can offer additional grains to Delhi for any new scheme it may wish to launch, he added.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying that it was a waste of resources to have two schemes trying to do the same thing. “Will there be double expenditure on the same subject in a state? This means in Delhi, the Centre and state will spend ₹2000 crore each for ration distribution? Will that be a rational arrangement?” he asked in the letter, requesting the PM to allow the state’s home delivery scheme “:in national interest” and as a way to “eliminate the ration mafia.”Most of Delhi’s working-class and daily wager population includes migrants, who cannot withdraw their quota of subsidised grains unless the digitised system (e-PoS devices) is functional, the official said.The One Nation One Ration Card programme is now functional in 32 states and Union Territories, covering 690 million beneficiaries, or 86% of those eligible for food security cover. Food distribution happens through a network of fair price shops that act as the final points of delivery.“A portable public distribution system (PDS) envisaged by the One Nation One Ration Card is a boon for beneficiaries of the National Food Security Act who lose out on their monthly quota of subsidised food when they migrate out,” said Ananya Ghosh Dastidar, a former consultant with the Food and Agriculture Organisation.A novel cohort-based migration metric, a statistical tool developed by former chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian, revealed an annual “interstate migrant population of about 60 million and an interdistrict migration as high as 80 million” between 2001 and 2011. Subramanian had called for full portability of all welfare doles.Many economists say while a digitised system undoubtedly helps plug pilferages of foodgrains, over-centralisation can have welfare costs too. “Food should be available at the most convenient point, especially to those who are not still documented. This calls for a certain amount of decentralization of the PDS network,” said Rajinder Chaudhury, an economist who formerly taught at MD University, Rohtak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/implement-one-nation-one-ration-card-in-delhi-at-earliest-centre-to-aap-govt-101623175546802.html
08-06-2021||Delhi||Court orders protection to witnesses in murder case against Sushil Kumar||A local court has ordered both Delhi and the Haryana police to provide round the clock protection to all the four witnesses in the wrestler Sagar Dhankhar murder case, in which Olympic medallist Sushiil Kumar is one of the accused.A committee headed by Swarn Kanta Sharma, principal and sessions judge, Rohini district court, on Monday directed the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), northwest Delhi and Haryana police to provide security to the witnesses and install cameras, alarms and fencing outside their homes.The committee passed the order after analysing a police report which said that the threat perception to the witnesses in the case is “real”.“The analysis report clearly indicates that the threat perception to the witnesses is real. Considering the same, DCP northwest has already provided interim protection to the witnesses who are residing in Delhi and also sent letters to SSP, Sonepat, Hansi (Hisar), Jhajjar and Rohtak --- all in Haryana -- to provide adequate interim protection to the victims/witnesses in their respective districts with immediate effect,” the committee noted in the minutes of the meeting.The committee, in accordance with the Witness Protection Scheme, 2018, passed the order of protection after the Delhi high court, on June 2, asked the State to file an application before the competent authority for protection of the witness within one week.The high court said that the competent authority will take a decision within one week of filing of the application and till a decision is taken, Delhi Police will provide interim protection to the witness.Following this, the police moved to the committee seeking an application to provide protection.Advocate Ajay Kumar Pipaniya, appearing for all the four witnesses, said his clients have been scared even to share their addresses with the police in the wake of the threat. Pipania said police’s threat analysis report also said that wrestler Sushil Kumar may use his money and clout to influence the witnesses.Taking note of the threat report and the counsel’s submission, the committee ordered that all steps will be taken to protect the witnesses, while also asking the police to submit a fortnightly report. It also asked the police to undertake regular checks around the house of the witnesses.Sushil Kumar and his associates allegedly assaulted Sagar Dhankhar, and two of his friends Sonu Mahal and Amit Kumar, at the Chhatrasal stadium on May 4 over an alleged property dispute. Dhankhar, 23, succumbed to the injuries later.Sushil was arrested on May 23. The court initially remanded him to six days of police custody, which was later extended by four more days on May 29. On June 2, he was sent to judicial custody.One of the witness, who was one of the persons allegedly beaten up by Sushil, has claimed that he fears for his life as “the Olympian has links with hardened criminals”.Advocate Pipaniya told the court that his client’s parents were being influenced and threatened continuously by goons not to give any statement or testimony against the wrestler.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/court-orders-protection-to-witnesses-in-murder-case-against-sushil-kumar-101623175486874.html
08-06-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Blue diamond, conserved||It is not just blue, it’s not turquoise, it’s not lapis, it’s not even cerulean. It actually is somewhere between turquoise and lapis. These tiles on the dome of the centuries-old Sabz Burj are looking as fresh as the morning dew.So are the multicoloured patterns on the neck of the dome.Sabz Burj’s conservation is finishing this month. The project began four years ago by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture in partnership with Havells India.In the custodianship of the Archaeological Survey of India, the 16th century tomb remains one of Delhi’s most mysterious souvenirs. Who built it for whom? We don’t know yet. The grave is missing. Older than Humayun’s Tomb nearby, it stands at the intersection of Mathura Road and Lodhi Road. Many Delhiwallas mistakenly call it Neela Gumbad —the blue dome. (To deserve its name, Sabz Burj should have looked sabz, or green.)Back in the colonial times, the Brits turned the tomb into a police station. The garden around was razed down to make way for a busy avenue. Subsequently, it withered into a ruin, reduced to a traffic roundabout.The retouch will alter that perception. The tomb still is subtly melancholic, just no longer run-down. This afternoon the top half is glistening with restored colours. The facade is draped in a protective green net, swaying like a sultan’s kaftan in the afternoon breeze.“Master craftsmen restored the facade’s missing ornamentation, conservators unearthed the painted ceiling underneath a later cement layer, stone carvers put back the sandstone lattice screens, handmade glazed tiles were put up where those were missing,” says Ujwala Menon of Aga Khan Trust.The new tiles on the dome haven’t come at the cost of the original. Those ones had fallen off long time ago, or had lost their glaze, and were replaced by a set of inappropriate blue tiles in the 1980s. In fact, the leftover historic tiles in multicoloured patterns just below the dome weren’t touched, even where they had lost the glaze; only the missing portions were replaced.Inside, the ceiling with its regained floral drawings—in “pure gold” and lapis—evokes a scene of artists hanging from the scaffolding with brushes in their hands. A bygone era suddenly seems a touch away. Every year the semal trees inside the tomb enclosure briefly bloom with pulpy flowers, lending a shade of red to the monument. That missing colour will be restored in spring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-blue-diamond-conserved-101623175319461.html
08-06-2021||Delhi||Despite shortage, Delhi has highest proportion of inoculations with Covaxin||Despite shortages of Covaxin doses, Delhi has used the indigenously developed vaccine to immunise over 30% of people administered shots against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Assam, with 19.2% Covaxin usage -- a difference of over 10 percentage points, comes second, and is closely followed by Andhra Pradesh, with 18.5% of its doses being Covaxin.In absolute numbers, however, Andhra, where over 2 million of the 11 million shots administered were Covaxin, comes first, and is followed by Delhi, which administered 1.7 million Covaxin doses out of a total 5.78 million doses, according to data on the government’s CoWIN portal.On Sunday, the Delhi government ordered all vaccination centres – government and private – to stop administering first dose of Covaxin to those between the ages of 18 and 45 years. This was done to ensure everyone who received the first shot in May got their second dose within the stipulated four to six weeks.Delhi, which administered the vaccine to over 162,000 persons between the ages of 18 and 45 years in May when the vaccine drive was opened for them, has received just 40,000 doses of Covaxin in June.“There is no strict upper limit for when the second dose needs to be administered. However, with inactivated virus such as Covaxin, the second shot needs to be given as early as possible because the first dose provides very limited protection. This needs to be boosted by the second dose. Otherwise, they might get a natural infection between doses,” said Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, independent epidemiologist and vaccine expert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/despite-shortage-delhi-has-highest-proportion-of-inoculations-with-covaxin-101623175428314.html
08-06-2021||Delhi||On Day One of Unlock Delhi, police fined 1,053 persons for not wearing masks||On Monday, the Day One of a gradual unlocking process in the national capital after over a month-and-a-half long (51 days, to be precise) lockdown, Delhi Police fined 1,053 persons for not wearing masks, 229 for not adhering to social distancing norms and three persons for holding large gatherings.Police said while metal barricades were removed from roads on Monday to facilitate the smooth flow of traffic, their teams still checked vehicles, and patrolled the markets and busy roads to ensure social distancing norms were followed.On Saturday afternoon, two days before the lockdown norms were eased, all police stations were directed to form teams to conduct checks at market places.The Delhi District Management Authority(DDMA) has allowed markets to open from Monday with shops directed to open on an “odd-even” basis while standalone shops can open on all days. “Our police commissioner has directed all district deputy commissioners(DCPs) to devise non-coercive methods and take steps to ensure normalcy while ensuring social distancing. All police stations have been asked to be in touch with market welfare associations and vendors. All shops that are open have been directed to have sanitisers ready and ensure that there is no crowding. Senior police officers are also monitoring the activities on the ground,” said DCP Chinmoy Biswal, who is also the Delhi Police spokesperson.On June 12, there is another meeting of the police brass, in which they will review the Covid-19 violation by citizens during the first five days after the lockdown norms were relaxed.Based on the review, each district will present a plan on how to ensure that citizens followed Covid appropriate behaviour.Trader associations said they are asking shopkeepers to remain cautious and follow rules. Ashwani Marwah, general secretary of Lajpat Nagar Traders Association, said,” We have instructed all our members to follow the odd-even scheme for opening shops. Every shop is displaying its address at a visible spot for easy identification. There are a few buildings that have the same number and multiple shops and such shops are being marked as odd and even and every alternate shop is being allowed to open on a given day.” He said all shop owners have been told to encourage their staff to get vaccinated. “ We are also planning to organise a mass vaccination camp in Lajpat Nagar, where all shopkeepers , their staff and family members can get vaccinated without the hassle of booking slots or standing in queues,” Marwah said.The government had clamped a lockdown in the national capital on April 19, to control the spread of Covid-19, as Delhi was reporting over 25,000 Covid-19 cases daily at that time, with a daily positivity rate -- samples that came positive among the total tested -- of over 30%. This meant that one in every three persons who were tested for Covid, was positive for the infection.Currently, the city’s positivity rate is below 1% and the daily cases are also below 500. On Tuesday, according to the state government’s health bulletin, Delhi had 316 fresh cases after conducting 71879 tests and recorded a positivity rate of 0.44%. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that to contain the spread of the infection in an area, the positivity rate has to remain below 5% for at least 14 days consecutively.During the lockdown from April 19 to June 7, police issued 104,440 fines for mask violations, 18,034 for violation of social distancing norms, and 1,529 for holding large congregations. All forms of social/political/entertainment/academic/ cultural events, which have mass gatherings and could be potential super spreader events, are still banned in the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/onday-one-of-unlock-delhi-police-fined-1-053-persons-for-not-wearing-masks-101623175427586.html
08-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi riots accused Asif Tanha gets interim custody-bail to appear for exams||The Delhi high court has granted interim custody-bail to Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) student Asif Iqbal Tanha, arrested in a case related to the northeast Delhi riots last year, for two weeks to appear in his exams scheduled for June 15.A bench of justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup Jairam Bhambhani allowed Tanha to stay at a hotel for studying and appearing in his exams, noting that it is imperative for him to take his three remaining backlogs or compartment examinations to complete his BA (Hons) (Persian) programme.The court said that Tanha would be released on interim custody- bail on the morning of June 13 and shall be brought back to prison by guards on the evening of June 26.As agreed by the counsels for the state and Tanha, he will be staying at a hotel in Kalkaji under the custody of two prison guards deputed by the jail superintendent. Tanha has undertaken to bear all the expenses to be incurred there, including food and lodging.“During the period of interim-custody bail, the applicant shall not invite to the said facility any visitors or guests, including family members, friends, classmates or any other person,” the bench said.As the exam will be conducted online, the court asked Tanha to arrange for a laptop, a basic mobile phone and a dongle for internet connection through a pairokar (representative pursuing his case). The devices will be first checked by the police officer concerned before it is delivered to him.The court also allowed Tanha to make a phone call to his family or counsel for 10 minutes a day during his stay at the hotel. It also directed him to not use the devices for any other purpose except studying and also not to erase or tamper with the browsing history on the laptop or SMSes and call records of phone.“It is clarified that even before the commencement of interim custody-bail, the applicant is permitted to receive all books and reading/study material, as he may consider necessary, through the jail superintendent, after being checked as per usual procedures.“During the period of interim custody-bail, the applicant shall be entitled to receive all books and reading/study material that he may require for his examinations, at the said facility, which would be delivered to him after being checked by the SHO, police station special cell... unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise, the SHO shall permit all such books etc,” the court.It also noted that the books and reading material may be in Persian or Arabic and asked the authorities to not withhold them for that reason alone.The court said Tanha shall not in any way misuse or abuse the guarded liberty granted to him and added that the period spent by him in interim custody-bail would be counted as a period undergone in prison as an undertrial.In December last year, the high court had granted a similar relief to the accused by directing the jail authorities to take him to a guest house to enable him to study and appear in exams.Tanha was arrested on May 19 last year in the case for allegedly being part of a premeditated conspiracy in the riots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-riots-accused-asif-tanha-gets-interim-custody-bail-to-appear-for-exams-101623175366734.html
08-06-2021||Delhi||DDA modifies building by-laws to allow oxygen plants in hospitals||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has modified the building by-laws to allow the installation of oxygen plants in hospitals in the national Capital, in a meeting chaired by lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal on Tuesday. The meeting also approved the norms for planned development in 1,731 authorised colonies.Talking about the norms for setting up oxygen plants in hospitals, a senior DDA official said until now, there was no provision in the Unified Building By-laws (UBBL 2016) to install such plants.“The DDA has been getting queries from hospitals regarding development norms in this regard,” the official said, asking not to be named.The official said such plants have become essential, especially after the city faced an acute oxygen shortage during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic from mid-April to mid-May. With many patients gasping their last for want of piped oxygen, the Centre and Delhi government had decided to augment the medical oxygen facilities in the city so as to prevent a repeat of such a crisis, and the DDA decision on Tuesday is to facilitate this augmentation, the official said.The Delhi government plans to install 57 oxygen plants, including eight pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants sanctioned by the Centre, to meet the oxygen requirement in the days to come.A second senior DDA official said, “No notice and building permit will be required from the sanctioning authority for installation of PSA plant or liquid medical oxygen plant (LMO) or similar related infrastructure in hospitals if it is in an open or setback area. However, fire safety clearance, Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization (PESO) approval and other mandatory clearances, wherever applicable, will be required. These plants will be free from the building’s floor area ratio and ground coverage norms.”DDA officials said for installation of PSA without any compressor, there is no requirement of a licence or approval from PESO. “For installation of PSA with a compressor, the PESO approval is needed. Installation of an LMO plant also requires PESO clearance,” said the official quoted above.In other decisions taken during Tuesday’s meeting, the DDA said it will not increase the rates for additional FAR and conversion charges while computing the misuse charge during conversion of property from leasehold to freehold.Another important decision taken in the meeting was regarding allowing planned development in 1,731 authorised colonies in Delhi.HindustanTimes had reported in January this year that the DDA had drafted the norms for redevelopment of these colonies. “Now the norms will be sent to the Union housing and urban affairs ministry for notification,” said the second senior DDA official.The DDA has proposed two approaches for planned development -- a regeneration scheme and regularisation of existing areas.DDA officials said regeneration or redevelopment scheme will help residents. “Amalgamation of plots will be permitted. The minimum area required for availing of the benefits under the scheme is 2000 square metres (sqm). For this, residents have to pool land and form a developer entity and submit a regeneration scheme to the local authorities for approval,” said the official.The second option is for regularisation of existing colonies whereby people can get the layout plans prepared and individual building plans approved by the DDA. “The unauthorised colonies will have to meet certain planning requirements such as having adequate access for fire tenders, open space for evacuation for effective disaster management, structural safety of buildings at plot level, provision for social facilities like healthcare and education facilities nearby etc,” said the second official.The developer entity or the RWA or the plot owner will have to pay for civic infrastructure development charges (sewer, water etc) to the service providing agency.The DDA has also approved a proposal to allow construction of small flats up to 60 sqm on some of the group housing plots on a freehold basis. A third senior DDA official said, “This will cater to the demand for 40-60 sqm affordable housing for small families. The small format houses are in line with the National Housing Policy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dda-modifies-building-by-laws-to-allow-oxygen-plants-in-hospitals-101623175306716.html
08-06-2021||Other||Govt, MCD schools to trace students who fell off the grid||With schools across the national capital gearing up to restart virtual classes after the summer break, officials of the Delhi government and civic schools said they have a major task at hand -- tracking missing students, and ensure they attend the semi-online classes.Amid an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases, the Delhi government had in April ordered schools in the Capital to close -- three weeks earlier than planned -- for the summer vacation till June 9. While corporation schools are reopening virtually from Thursday, the Delhi government is yet to announce dates for resumption of its online classes.Several principals of Delhi government schools said that they have not been able to trace some students since last March and fear that the number of such students might increase when they resume online classes. The majority of missing students, they said, are those who were promoted from primary schools run by the municipalities at the end of the last academic session and admitted to class 6. As per the official data, only 76% of the students transferred from municipal schoolslast year could be traced.“Around 40 of our students, most of them shifted from municipal schools, are still out of reach since last year. This year, another batch of students have been transferred to government schools in class 6. It will be even more challenging to focus on two such batches,” said Awadesh Kumar Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed School in Rohini.Every year, around 100,000 students move from municipal schools, which offer education till class 5, to government ones in class 6. Due to the pandemic, the induction of such students happened online since last year, on the basis of names sent by municipal schools.In February, HT had reported that over 166,000 students enrolled in government and municipal schools across Delhi were out of contact with their schools since the pandemic hit the Capital in March last year. Officials at these schools said they were unable to trace these students despite several efforts, including door-to-door visits, sending letters and assignments to addresses on their records, and forming peer groups to locate the students.Officials at several other government schools raised the same concerns. For instance, at a government girls school in Tilak Nagar, around 10-12 students are untraceable since last year. Similarly, the principal of another government school in Yamuna Vihar said that at least 30 of their students have been missing since last year.“The situation is likely to worsen now since the second wave of the pandemic has hit more people both in terms of personal and financial losses. We do not know how many children will be in the condition to join online classes. Extensive outreach programmes need to be launched to trace each and every student,” said the principal of a government school in Yamuna Vihar.According to the latest data collected by the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR), at least 1,436 children lost either one or both their parents to Covid-19 in Delhi. Of them, 59 children lost both parents, 467 lost their mother and 910 lost their father.“Many children have lost their loved ones, including parents, amid the pandemic. At least 10 students in my school lost their parents. So many people have left for their hometowns amid the second lockdown enforced by the government in April to contain the spread of the pandemic. We will have to track them all,” Jha added.HT had last month reported that at least 800,000 migrant workers travelled from Delhi to their home states in the first four weeks of the second lockdown in the Capital.Schools run by the three civic bodies -- east, north, and south-- also raised similar concerns. Vibha Singh, principal of an east municipal corporation school in Gandhinagar, said 32 students at her school were untraceable since last March. “The number is likely to increase this year. Once the school reopens, we will start monitoring students on the basis of their online attendance and collection of worksheets from school,” she said.The principal of a north civic body-run school in Jahangirpuri, who wished not to be named, said, “We could not trace at least 40 students since last year. All of them are not living at their registered addresses. We have no idea how the situation will be this time when we reopen.”Meanwhile, both the Delhi government and three civic bodies are planning to launch extensive programmes to track students soon. Shailendra Sharma, the principal advisor to Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia, said government schools will take steps to connect with children and understand their circumstances before commencing teaching-learning activities in any form. “Renewed efforts will be made to connect with students who will join Delhi government schools from municipal schools this year in class 6. Last year, we had difficulty tracing many students but our teachers proactively reached out to them and managed to establish two-way communication with nearly 76% of them towards the end of the session. This year, while we will make every effort to get the correct contact details of children coming from MCD schools, the engagement with those moving to class 7, most of whom are yet to even see their school, will also be deepened,” he said.The Delhi government is likely to issue guidelines to its schools on how to reach out to students on Wednesday.Officials of the three municipalities also said they will soon launch outreach programs to reconnect with students. Sujata Malik, additional director of north civic body’s education department, said, “We had started a survey to relocate and trace our students in April but the work had stopped following the second wave of the pandemic. But it will be a challenge to trace those who are not in the city and don’t have access to mobile phones.”Meanwhile, experts said that both the Delhi government and municipal schools should start extensive drives with the help of NGOs and civil society groups to track students. Sanjay Gupta, director of NGO Chetna (childhood enhancement through training and action), said, “The second wave definitely was a bigger disaster than the earlier one and hence, extensive efforts need to be taken to prevent our children from dropping out. Besides extensive door-to-door drives, the authorities need to involve NGOs, and district child protection units to trace these children. The government can also take the help of volunteers of the national service scheme (NSS) in tracing students in every locality. We cannot expect students to join online classes without understanding their circumstances and providing required support first.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/as-classes-restart-govt-mcd-schools-will-have-to-trace-students-who-fell-off-the-grid-101623175246818.html

In a separate incident, another civil defence personnel was arrested in south Delhi’s Sangam Vihar for allegedly posing as a police official and extorting people caught without masks. Police also arrested a cyber cafe owner for helping the man forge a Delhi Police ID card.Civil defence personnel are volunteers of the state government who work under the district magistrate of each district in Delhi and help government in their day-to-day activities. They do not have the authority to arrest or fine anyone, and often help in managing security at hospitals, vaccination centres and creating awareness on government’s initiatives, such as odd-even road rationing scheme. In the first incident, police said two men – Gaurav(20) and Ayush(21), identified by their first names in police records – had robbed a Sonepat resident, Vikas Kumar, who was on his way to a bus stop along with his friend. The victim had reached MSP Mall in Narela when the two accused stopped Kumar, assaulted him and snatched his cell phone. A police officer, privy to the case details, said that a team of police constables, who were patrolling in the nearby area, heard Kumar shouting for help and rushed to his aid. “The accused tried to flee but our team members chased and arrested them at the spot. We found that they were civil defence volunteers,” the officer said.In the second case, police arrested another volunteer Suneel Kumar (31), who was allegedly posing as a Delhi police sub inspector and “fining people” for mask violations. Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Thakur said police had received information about a man in Sangam Vihar “who looked suspicious”.“A police team observed the man’s activities and found that he wasn’t from the police station. The team members approached him and asked him to show his ID card. The man showed his ID card but it looked fake. He was taken into custody and questioned. The man turned out to be a civil defence volunteer and disclosed that the ID card was prepared at a cyber cafe. The cafe’s owner, Naveen, was also arrested. The computer used in preparing the fake police ID card was also seized,” added DCP Thakur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2-civil-defence-volunteers-held-for-robbery-another-arrested-for-posing-as-cop-to-extort-mask-violators-101623175187572.html
08-06-2021||Delhi||SAD leader among BJP’s three mayor nominees||Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Delhi unit president Adesh Gupta on Tuesday announced the names of three councillors each for the mayoral and deputy mayoral elections in the city’s three municipal corporations — north, south and east.Gupta nominated GTB Nagar ward councillor Sardar Raja Iqbal Singh (North MCD), Sagarpur ward councillor Mukesh Suryan (South MCD) and Raghubarpura councillor Shyam Sundar Aggarwal (East MCD) for the mayoral elections.Raja Iqbal Singh is a Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) councillor from GTB Nagar ward. His nomination comes months after the SAD had severed its ties from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) over three contentious farm laws.BJP and SAD contested 2017 municipal elections in an alliance. SAD won five seats. Last year, when SAD parted ways with the BJP, SAD councillors resigned their posts but Singh, who was then the chairman of Civil Lines Zonal committee, stayed. He continued his association with the BJP and has now been nominated for the post of mayor in North corporation.The candidates filed their nomination papers on Tuesday, the last day to do so. The elections to the post of mayors, deputy mayors and standing committee chairpersons will be held on June 16.Kiran Vaidya (EDMC), Archana Dilip Singh (Noth DMC) and Pawan Sharma (SDMC) have also been nominated as candidates for posts of deputy mayor in the three municipalities. Vaidya had contested Delhi assembly elections in 2020 from Trilokpuri seat on a BJP ticket but was defeated by Aam Aadmi Party’s Rohit Kumar Mehraulia.Municipal officials said that the mayoral and deputy mayoral elections should see a smooth win for BJP as it is in the majority in all the three civic bodies.BJP also announced the names of candidates for the posts of standing committee chairpersons. Jogi Ram Jain, Col BK Oberoi and Veer Singh Pawar have been nominated for the the posts of standing committee chairpersons in North corporation, SDMC and EDMC, respectively.The Delhi Municipal Corporation Act provides for the election of mayor and deputy mayor from among the councillors of the civic bodies in the first meeting of the House every year. Mayors and deputy mayors get a year-long term in Union Territories.This year, elections of mayor and deputy mayor were to be conducted in April but the process was postponed by two months due to the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sad-leader-among-bjp-s-three-mayor-nominees-101623175186764.html

Produce deity’s Aadhaar, priest told in UP’s Banda||A priest in Uttar Pradesh’s Banda district was in a bind after the Aadhaar cards of “gods” were sought if he wanted to sell crops grown on land belonging to a temple.The unusual situation came to light after the caretaker priest of the Ram Janki temple in Attara tehsil’s Kurhara village in Banda arrived at the government mandi to sell the crops grown on the temple land. It was then that he was asked to produce the Aadhaar card of the deity in whose name the land was registered.The seven-hectare land is registered in name of the deity, in this case Ram and Janki.Mahant Ramkumar Dass, the priest and chief caretaker of the temple, said he wanted to sell 100 quintals of wheat in a government mandi (market). He had done the online registration with the help of others.When it came to actual sale, he was asked to produce the Aadhaar card of the land owner—the deities.“The registration was cancelled as I could not produce the Aadhaar card, where do I get Aadhaar of Bhagwan (God)?” he asked.He said he spoke to the sub divisional magistrate (SDM) Saurabh Shukla.“He told me the registration cannot be done without Aadhaar; that is why it has been cancelled by his office,” he said.Last year, he said, he sold 150 quintals of produce at the government mandi. He said he has been selling the produce for the last several years, but never faced a situation like this.District supply officer Govind Upadhyaya said the rules were clear that produce from mutts and temple could not be bought. The purchase policy did not have any such provision either, he said, adding earlier “khatauni” (land records) were admissible but now registration had become compulsory. And for registration, one must have the Aadhaar card of the person on whose name the land was registered.SDM Shukla said the Mahant was not asked to produce the Aadhaar card of the deity, but he was explained the process.“The policy has been decided at the government level and purchase was being done on the basis of that policy,” he said.But Dass is worried: “How are we to meet the expenses and get our food if we cannot sell the crops in the mandi?” No option in sight, he said, he would have to sell the produce to the “aarathiyas” (commission agents) at a pittance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/want-to-sell-crop-grown-on-temple-land-produce-deity-s-aadhaar-priest-told-in-up-s-banda-101623173989654.html
08-06-2021||Kolkata||Adhikari meets Shah, Nadda over Bengal violence; TMC turncoats trouble state BJP||A day after Abhishek Banerjee, the new national general secretary of Trinamool Congress (TMC), said that many Bharatiya Janata Party (TMC) leaders in Bengal, including some who won the recent assembly polls, were eager to join the ruling party, TMC turncoats caused concern for the saffron camp even as it raised voice against post-poll violence, HT has learnt.“People will not accept the constant threats of Delhi and imposition of Article 356 being posed to a government that has come to power with an overwhelming mandate. We should rise above politics and stand by people affected by the Covid pandemic and Cyclone Yaas,” former state minister Banerjee wrote on his social media page after skipping a crucial meeting of state office bearers called by state president Dilip Ghosh on Tuesday afternoon. Rajib Banerjee joined the BJP at the Delhi residence of Union home minister Amit Shah before the assembly polls.At the meeting, Ghosh, who recently faced agitation by local leaders in two districts, formed a three-member committee to control dissidence in the ranks and monitor anti-BJP social media posts by party leaders. Rajib Banerjee’s post appeared hours after leader of the opposition in the state assembly, Suvendu Adhikari, met Shah and BJP national president JP Nadda in Delhi to complain about post-poll violence in Bengal. The meetings came close on the heels of a two-day national office bearers’ meet over the weekend that was chaired by Nadda where the BJP’s performance in the assembly elections held in March was discussed threadbare. The BJP bagged only 77 of the 294 seats while the TMC won 213. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has also expressed concerns over post-poll violence in the state. At its recent meeting in the capital, the issue of “extremist ideology” taking root in Bengal was discussed. “I personally feel that the situation in Bengal is much worse than what is required to enforce Article 356. However, our party has not taken a formal stand on this issue yet. Wait and see,” said Adhikari who will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday.“Those indulging in violence must remember that Bengal is a state in India and not an independent country,” he added. In Kolkata, Ghosh said, “I do not know why our central leaders met Adhikari in Delhi. We will start a state-wide agitation against post-poll violence from June 23 and meet President Ram Nath Kovind with a petition. More than 30,000 of our supporters have fled their homes and gone into hiding because of the terror unleashed by TMC.”Before the polls, Ghosh said if people of the state demand Article 356, the Centre will have to think about it.BJP Lok Sabha member Arjun Singh, however, demanded President’s rule. “The situation calls for immediate enforcement of Article 356. A time will come when people who are not being able to save their families will retaliate,” he said. TMC leaders dismissed the allegations. Some ruling party leaders said Adhikari was meeting Union ministers and top BJP leaders in Delhi to save himself from being prosecuted in criminal cases such as the 2016 Narada sting operation being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the recent theft of tarpaulin in East Midnapore, which is being investigated by the state police. “BJP’s strategy on the face of its depleting control is clear. BJP cannot fight TMC and Mamata Banerjee politically. Defeat stares them in the face all around. Hence, bogey of President’s Rule being raised in Bengal even by Tarpaulin Thief to divert attention. HIS MASTER’S VOICE !” tweeted TMC Rajya Sabha member Sukhendu Sekhar Roy. Rajib Banerjee, who lost his Domjur seat in Howrah district, wrote the post days after Subhranshu Roy, son of BJP national vice-president and Bengal leader Mukul Roy, wrote on his social media page that self-criticism is more necessary than criticising a government elected by peopleWhile Mukul Roy won the Krishnanagar North seat in Nadia district in the recent assembly polls, his son, Subhranshu Roy, was defeated from the Bijpur seat that he held in North 24 Parganas district. Mukul Roy, who was the TMC’s founder member and a close aide of Mamata Banerjee, joined the BJP in 2017. His son switched sides two years later. Mukul Roy, too, skipped the party’s meeting in Kolkata on Tuesday. “He could not come because his wife is admitted in hospital,” said Ghosh, who faced agitation by party workers on June 4 at Chinsurah in Hooghly district where people demanded the expulsion of district unit president Gautam Chatterjee. On Monday, the BJP state leadership issued a show-cause notice to Subir Nag, the former district president, amid allegations that he engineered the agitation. Reacting to the dissidence in the BJP, Abhishek Banerjee said, “BJP leaders should put their house in order instead of bringing false allegations.” In a unique incident, some TMC workers, who joined the BJP prior to the polls at Labhpur in Birbhum district, went around a village in an auto-rickshaw on Tuesday and announced over the public address system that they made a mistake and would like to return to the ruling party. Several leaders who attended the BJP’s state officer bearers’ meeting in Kolkata pointed out issues that they said led to the party’s defeat in the assembly polls. Those who attended the meeting told HT on condition of anonymity said some leaders opined that campaign speeches of Hindi-speaking leaders from north Indian states failed to touch public sentiment.Others said senior leaders from other states intervened too much in campaign policy without having any knowledge of ground reality. Questions were also raised on the selection of candidates. “The profile of candidates led to dissidence in the ranks at some seats even before the polls were held,” said a leader who attended the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/adhikari-meets-shah-nadda-over-bengal-violence-tmc-turncoats-trouble-state-bjp-101623173989214.html

He said the first-year students who were promoted to the second year last year without exams will have to appear in exams this year. He also said universities were required to draft the promotion formula by June 18.According to Sharma, the first year or first-semester students who will be promoted to the second year or the second semester without exams will be assigned marks of the first year on the basis of the marks they score in their second-year exam in the future in 2022.Sharma said barring final semester or final year, marks of students will be awarded either on the basis of their previous year’s results or on the basis of their performance in upcoming examinations.For students in the second year, who have appeared in the first year examinations in 2020, their marks can be decided based on the score in the first year, and accordingly they can be promoted to the third year, he said in a statement.The deputy chief minister said there will be no practical exam and viva will be held online. The marks obtained in the theory exam will be proportionately awarded in the practical exam.He added it was being suggested to the universities to make a single question paper comprising questions from all subjects that can also take the form of multiple choice or be OMR (optical marks recorder) based.The universities were asked to declare results by August 31 and the new academic session (2021-22) would start from September 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/first-year-ug-pg-students-in-uttar-pradesh-to-be-promoted-without-examinations-101623173146423.html

The algal bloom had given the river a green look.Besides Kalika Singh, the team comprises Ganga Pollution Control Unit general manager PC Agarwal, assistant commissioner of police (Dashashwamedh) Awadhesh Pandey and two other officials, the district magistrate said.Sharma said, “The team will complete the investigation within three days and submit a complete factual investigation report, along with pictures and video clip of the Ganga (stretches having algal bloom), by June 10 evening. The team members will suggest options to solve the problem.”Ganga conservation activist Rajesh Shukla said the algal bloom in the river in Varanasi was first seen around 20 days ago but it was washed away by rain after two days. The algal bloom returned around a week ago due to which the Ganga water looked green in certain stretches.“But most of the algae has been washed away now. At present, only 10% of the algal bloom is left,” he said.Prof Vijay Nath Mishra, neurologist at Banaras Hindu University who has also worked for the cause of the Ganga, said, “The Ganga’s flow is very slow due to which the water is nearly stagnant, causing the algal bloom. This bloom hinders the entry of the sun’s rays into the water. If the condition continues for long, the concentration of nitrate and phosphorus is most likely to increase in the water. It may be dangerous for aquatic animals.”He said efforts should be made to increase the flow of water and a test should be done to find the cause of the algal bloom resurfacing in the Ganga.“To the naked eye, it appears to be a bloom formed by an alga named microcystis. It is found in stagnant water. In the Ganga, it may have come from some side drains or stagnant sources during rain. It will disappear with the increasing flow of water. If the condition persists for long, it may cause fish mortality because the neurotoxin microcystin is produced by this alga, which is harmful to aquatic animals,” said Prof BD Tripathi, chairman of Mahamana Malviya Research Centre for Ganga, River Development and Water Resource Management (MMRC for Ganga), BHU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/algal-bloom-in-ganga-experts-collect-water-samples-in-varanasi-101623172786471.html
08-06-2021||Chandigarh||Punjabi University official under lens for embezzlement||A senior assistant working in one the administrative departments of Punjabi University, Patiala, is under the scanner for fund embezzlement, which went unchecked for at least six years and is suspected to run into crores of rupees. The university is likely to rope in the vigilance bureau for a thorough investigation into these irregularities, which came to the fore when the internal audit department and varsity’s finance wing flagged five bills, amounting to ₹6 lakh, submitted by a science department. The stamp and signatures of the department head were fake, and even the names of research scholars and assistants against whom the bills were raised turned out to be bogus, said an official privy to the development, on the condition of anonymity.Submitted bills in name of fake research scholarsAccording to the preliminary probe, the senior assistant — who handles funds provided to the university under various heads and was posted in the same department for over a decade — used to create and submit fake bills in the name of “ghost” research scholars and assistants and siphoned off the money.The funds mainly included those provided by the University Grants Commission (UGC) for development schemes, non-UGC grant for research projects and scholarships given by the ministry of human resource development besides those received under Rashtriya Uchhchatar Shiksha Abhiyan. According to the university’s budget, it has received around ₹70 crore in such grants in just the past three years.Taking swift action on the complaint received last week, vice-chancellor Professor Arvind formulated a high-level fact-finding committee to file an interim report. The committee will also look into the exact amount of funds siphoned off during all these years. “The committee is likely to look into the bank details and other financial transactions of the employee as well,” said the official.Registrar Varinder Kaushik, who is part of the fact-finding committee, said investigations are still at the preliminary stage and he could not divulge any details. “The matter is serious in nature. The V-C has directed us to conduct a thorough inquiry. The interim report will be submitted at the earliest, following which the V-C will take further action,” he said. Other members of the committee are dean (research) Ashok Tiwari and finance officer Rakesh Khurana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjabi-university-official-under-lens-for-embezzlement-101623172488407.html
08-06-2021||Chandigarh||Sikh family donates ancestral land to build mosque in Malerkotla village||Setting another example of communal harmony in the Muslim-majority Malerkotla, a Sikh family from Jitwal Kalan village in the newly created district’s Ahmedgarh subdivision has donated its ancestral land to build a mosque. Until now, around a dozen Muslim families residing in the village, situated about 15 kilometres from the district headquarters, had to go to neighbouring villages to offer prayers during Eid and other occasions. Jagmail Singh, 40, whose family owns a large tract of land, on Tuesday announced to donate 6 biswa (around 8,000 square feet) in the centre of the village to construct a mosque. Muslims from Malerkotla and other villages also assembled at the spot to offer prayers.“There are around 12 Muslim families in the village. They have to go to other villages to offer prayers. I knew they could not buy land, as they mostly work as labourers and are poor,” said Jagmail Singh, whose family has been associated with Muslims in the village for three generations.Iqbal Singh, 33, another member of the family, said: “The construction of the mosque will start after relaxations in Covid-19 restrictions. We will also try to provide financial aid for its construction.”Roshan Khan, 61, a local Muslim, said they have a long association with the Sikh family and have been living peacefully in the village for decades.Abdul Rashid, 40, a truck driver, said, “We are poor and could not purchase land for building a mosque. Our Sikh brothers have shown a big heart.”Gurwinder Singh, a local, said: “Malerkotla has been known as the land of Sikh-Muslim unity for centuries. The initiative to donate land will cement our brotherhood further.” A historic town, Malerkotla is known for communal harmony since Nawab Sher Mohammed Khan had protested against the torture and bricking alive of the younger Sahibzadas of Guru Gobind Singh. The area also remained peaceful during the Partition in 1947.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sikh-family-donates-ancestral-land-to-build-mosque-in-malerkotla-village-101623172487059.html
08-06-2021||Gurugram||MCG to begin beautifying stretch linking Museo Camera, Galleria Market, Super Mart by June-end||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is likely to start beautifying a 1.3-kilometre stretch linking Museo Camera, Galleria Market, and Super Mart, along the Galleria Boulevard Road by the end of June 2021, officials said on Tuesday.As part of the project, the MCG will make street arts, set up green belts, and use concrete bollards to barricade a section of each carriageway for pedestrians, and traffic management purposes. The MCG will also fix potholes, and level the stretch. According to the officials, the civic body has floated tenders for this project, bids for which will end on June 12.Galleria Market, established in DLF Phase 4 in 2001, is one of the most iconic landmarks in the Gurugram, with more than 100 shops, restaurants, pubs, and offices. A private real estate firm report in December 2015 and December 2017 had put Galleria Market as the third most expensive market in regard to retail rental space in India.Museo Camera, a camera museum opposite Galleria Market, opened at Chakkarpur village in August 2019. The museum operates out of a renovated community centre of the MCG, and it has over 2,500 cameras and photos, some dating back to the 1860s.Super Mart is a marketplace with over 50 shops, restaurants, eateries, liquor stores, and supermarkets.“We want to set up the 1.3-kilometre stretch as a model road. We will beautify the roads leading up to all three landmarks and ensure the existing civic infrastructure such as roads, streetlights, footpaths, and drains are also repaired simultaneously. We aim to start the groundwork by June 25 this year,” said MCG executive engineer Tushar Yadav, who is overseeing the project.Yadav also said that concrete bollards will be placed parallel to the main carriageway so that pedestrians and cyclists are safeguarded with a dedicated path, instead of travelling on the main road and block the movement of vehicles resulting in snarls.The MCG officials, privy to the matter, said that the project is expected to cost around ₹40 lakh, and be completed in three months from the date of commencement.“The project is likely to start around the time when pre-monsoon showers commence. It is likely that the bitumen-related work, as well as street arts, will begin from September and be done by October-end. It depends on when the monsoon arrives in the city, and the extent of work which can be completed in that short window,” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-to-begin-beautifying-stretch-linking-museo-camera-galleria-market-super-mart-by-juneend-101623172306300.html
08-06-2021||Gurugram||Number of Covid-19 beds halved as cases continue to dip||The reserved bed capacity for Covid-19 patients was reduced from 60% to 30% of the total bed capacity, while reservations in intensive care units and beds with ventilator support decreased from 75% to 50% in all private and government health facilities, according to an order issued by the district administration on Tuesday. The chief medical officer of Gurugram, Dr Virender Yadav, said that due to a constant decline in Covid-19 cases and a high recovery rate, of almost 99%, hospital beds are now vacant. “Except for the ICU and ventilator beds in private hospitals, where patients with severe infections are undergoing treatment, the reserve bed capacity will remain 50%. If required, it will be increased to the maximum capacity of 75%,” said Yadav. On Tuesday, deputy commissioner Yash Garg issued the order based on the recommendation of the health department, as the Covid-19 curve has flattened in the last two weeks. The weekly test positivity rate, the proportion of positives out of the sample tested, is currently at 0.7%. The district reported at least 33 new cases on Tuesday, taking the active case count to 642. Of these, 55 are critically ill patients in ICU or ventilator support system. In the last eight days, only 432 new cases of coronavirus infection have been reported.According to the Gurugram Covid Combat Companion (GC3) portal, of the 3,865 beds reserved for Covid-19 patients, at least 3,198 beds are vacant. It includes 2,887 oxygen beds in over 105 hospitals, of which at least 2,544 are vacant. Likewise, of the 703 ICU beds, 483 are empty and out of 275 ventilator beds, at least 171 are not being utilised. The district administration previously revised the bed capacity for Covid-19 patients on April 22, when active cases in the city reached a high of 3,553 cases in a day. As the positivity rate peaked to almost 35% on May 22, the healthcare infrastructure of the district was overwhelmed with patients who required immediate oxygen and ventilator support systems. At that time, of 491 ICU beds, only nine beds were available while two out of 233 ventilator beds were available. With increased hospitalisation, fatality also increased, with more than 15 deaths being reported in a day, despite allegations of underreporting. To address the crisis in April, Garg issued an order under National Disaster Management Act, 2005, reserving at least 60% of the total bed capacity in general wards and 75% of ICU and ventilator beds. Also, to accommodate the patients, makeshift hospitals with at least 800 beds were in the construction phase. According to Yadav, a decision is yet to be taken as to how these makeshift hospitals will be utilised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/number-of-covid-19-beds-halved-as-cases-continue-to-dip-101623172247695.html

In his first meeting, Ahuja directed the MCG’s IT wing to develop an online system for monitoring all civic works of the MCG.“My top priority would be to rectify the cleanliness system and get the public grievances resolved in a timebound manner. A zero-tolerance policy will be adopted in cases of corruption. The citizens of Gurugram make complaints to the MCG through various means and these complaints will be resolved on a priority basis,” said Ahuja.Ahuja and former MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh, a 2011-batch IAS officer, have swapped places, with the latter moving to Panchkula as its new deputy commissioner. Their transfers were part of a major administrative shuffle by the Haryana government last Friday, when 42 officials were transferred from across the state.Ahuja, who is holding a position in Gurugram for the first time, will also serve as the chief administrator of the Shri Mata Sheetla Devi Shrine Board.Ahuja took stock of the MCG’s progress regarding the removal of 2.5 million tonnes of legacy waste from the Bandhwari waste plant, and also examined the portion of the Badshahpur drain where the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) is widening it. The GMDA is clearing a bottleneck that reduces its carrying capacity from 2,300 cubic foot per second (cusecs) to 800 cusecs, causing flooding along parts of National Highway 48 during monsoon.MCG officials said that Ahuja had a long conversation with GMDA officials regarding monsoon preparedness measures near Shiv Nadar School. “GMDA officials apprised the MCG commissioner that they are building check dams, four creeks, and ponds near the site to ensure run-off rainwater from the Aravallis is contained and groundwater is recharged, while also ensuring the nearby Golf Course Road is not flooded,” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter.Ahuja was also apprised by officials about MCG’s property tax system, Swachh Bharat Mission, cleanliness measures, sewerage and drainage system, enforcement measures, sustainability, graded response action plan (GRAP), advertising, larvicide activities, mobile medical units, C&D waste management, door-to-door waste collection, issues related to mobile towers and the civic body’s multilevel parking project, among other civic issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/ahuja-takes-charge-as-mcg-commissioner-101623172246336.html
08-06-2021||Gurugram||Lift and loot: Robberies along highway on the rise again||Gangs of robbers posing as cab drivers offering rides to commuters along the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway have resurfaced despite earlier crackdowns, senior police officials said, with two incidents reported over the last two days and four incidents in this month so far.The police said the gangs mostly target commuters between Shankar Chowk and Kherki Daula, with as many as 100 gangs from Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and the neighbouring district of Nuh estimated to be operational at present. A total of 14 such incidents have been reported this year.Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said, “Robbers take advantage of the situation and people fall prey to their tactics due to a lack of public transport. We have already busted six gangs this year and arrested over 20 people. However, cases are still on the rise and gangs have become active again.”The police said that despite several crackdowns in February and March, the gangs continue to operate by changing their modus operandi. Also, the vehicles used in the crime are stolen or robbed, and the robbers change the registration number plates to mislead the police. They also change cars frequently, the police said. In the latest incident of robbery on Monday, a 55-year-old dairy owner was assaulted and robbed of his belongings at gunpoint around 6.30am when he tried to hitchhike from Rajeev Chowk to Kotputli in Rajasthan.Harun Qureshi, a resident of Hira Nagar in Sector 11, said that he recently bought cattle through a dealer in Bansur village of Rajasthan, located over 120 kilometres from the city. He was on his way to make a payment of ₹2.58 lakh when the incident took place.Qureshi flagged down a private car at Rajeev Chowk and boarded the car. Four people, including the driver, were already inside, he said. “I told them that I was going to Kotputli following which they asked me to board the car. After five minutes, two of the commuters suddenly attacked me and asked me to hand over my belongings. They kept on hitting me and snatched my mobile phone and nearly ₹2.6 lakh. It all happened within a few minutes and I could not even retaliate,” he said.They took the U-turn before Kherki Daula toll plaza and drove towards Hero Honda Chowk and they pushed him out of the moving car and drove towards Delhi, the police said.A case under sections 392 (robbery) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code was filed at the Sadar police station. The police said they have recovered CCTV footage from three spots and two of the suspects have been identified.The police said that such cases have increased since lockdown curbs were eased and most of them are reported from Iffco Chowk, Shankar Chowk, Rajeev Chowk, Hero Honda Chowk and Kherki Daula in the early morning or late night hours.Sangwan said that officers in plainclothes have been deployed at different locations to track such gangs. Usually, they change more than two cars in Gurugram to evade the police and sometimes, also travel on motorbikes after committing crimes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/lift-and-loot-robberies-along-highway-on-the-rise-again-101623172186437.html

Out of the total cases of mucormycosis reported the state, maximum number of cases have been reported from Nagpur which has reported half the number of Covid19 cases reported in Pune which has reported the highest number of infection cases in the state. Nagpur has reported 1,132 cases of mucormycosis (black fungus), of which 463 have recovered, 97 have been declared dead and 560 are still undergoing treatment. However, the district has reported 0.491 million Covid-19 cases, while Pune with 845 mucormycosis cases has reported a total of 1.26 million Covid-19 cases, as of Monday. The rare, but serious, fungal infection has caused serious trouble for the administration because of its high fatality rate among patients wo have recovered from Covid-19. The state government had declared it a notifiable disease, and announced free treatment schemes for the infection. The districts with the highest number of black fungus cases are Nagpur, Pune, Aurangabad, Mumbai, Nashik and Solapur, in that order. Dr Ashok Nandapurkar, district civil surgeon, said, “We have about 55 hospitals, including 11 which are MPJAY-affiliated . Since mucormycosis requires multi-specialists, only major hospitals treat patients. As per our report, we have 586 patients under treatment, whereas the state report says there are 699 patients. There may be some difference in the state and district data, since there could be duplication of names and also updating issues.” The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has also started a dedicated ward for mucormycosis at its Dalvi hospital. Dr Kiran Bhise, hospital in-charge, said, “We started the ward this month and we have three patients currently admitted. The first operation will take place tomorrow. The treatment and medicines is completely free at this hospital.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/with-less-than-half-the-covid-19-cases-as-compared-to-pune-nagpur-has-most-black-fungus-cases-in-state-101623170745992.html

08-06-2021||Chandigarh||Kotkapura police firing: SIT quizzes then MLA Mantar Brar||The special investigation team (SIT) probing the police firing in Punjab’s Kotkapura in 2015 on Tuesday questioned former Shiromani Akali Dal legislator Mantar Singh Brar among others. With this, Brar, who was then Kotkapura MLA, became the first politician to be quizzed by the new probing team.The previous SIT had named him as an accused in the case, wherein police had opened fire on people protesting against sacrilege incidents at Kotkapura in Faridkot district, leaving two men dead on October 14, 2015. However, the Punjab and Haryana high court on April 9 quashed all reports filed by the previous SIT, headed by inspector general of police Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, following which a new SIT was constituted under additional director general of police (vigilance) LK Yadav.According to sources, suspended Indian Police Service officer Paramraj Singh Umranangal also appeared before the SIT on Tuesday. He had shown inability to appear before it on Monday and had sought a day’s time. The SIT has not revealed any details about the line of questioning. Umranangal who was then the Ludhiana police commissioner was sent to help cops in maintaining law and order at Kotkapura. He was considered close to the then director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini. In February 2019, after the Congress government took over the state’s reigns from Shiromani Akali Dal, Umranangal along with other police officers was booked for negligence in duty and failing to control the situation. Subsequently, he was suspended. According to the previous SIT, Mantar Brar had made 157 phone calls to the chief minister’s officer, then DGP Saini and other senior officers of the civil administration on the night before the firing. In the chargesheet, he was accused of influencing the local police to not record the statements of complainants in the case.This was second consecutive day that the new SIT grilled people linked to the case. Others who were questioned include Gurcharan Singh, then officer on special duty in the CMO; IAS officer VK Meena, who was then divisional commissioner; and then Faridkot SSP Sukhmander Singh Mann. An officer who at the time posted as the Kotkapura subdivisional magistrate also appeared before the team. The SIT has visited Faridkot a fortnight back and had grilled police officers who were present at the time of firing on the protestors. Former DGP Saini was also questioned last week. The SIT is expected to resume questioning shortly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kotkapura-police-firing-sit-quizzes-then-mla-mantar-brar-101623169726553.html

Stalin, who has been in office for a month, urged his counterparts “to prevail on them to offer a moratorium on repayment of loans for at least the first two quarters of 2021-2022 to all small borrowers with outstanding up to ₹5 crore in view of the lockdowns induced by the second wave of Covid-19.”Citing the example of how the states’ collective effort in asking for vaccines to be procured centrally and distributed free of cost to states led to the Union government to revise its position accordingly on Monday, Stalin urged for states to come together once again. “We need to show our collective strength at this hour of great need,” Stalin said in his letter.Previously, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had written to 11 non-BJP ruled states, including Tamil Nadu, to put up a joint effort to get vaccines from the Union government. Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik also followed suit. Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy had written to Vijayan for states to speak in a single voice regarding the vaccines.During April-May last year, when the Union government announced the nationwide lockdown, a moratorium was offered on repayment of loans for such borrowers. “However, in April-June, 2021, when lockdowns are being imposed based on local conditions by the respective states, similar relief to borrowers is not being provided for,” Stalin said, adding that the absence of such relief measures would force many businesses to close leading to economic distress. “These MSMEs and small businesses are the mainstays of our economy and employment generation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/stalin-writes-to-12-cms-to-seek-loan-repayment-moratorium-for-msmes-small-biz-101623169366990.html

It had the greatest impact on livelihoods. Street vendors in urban areas are suffering financially due to lockdowns meant to control the infection,” the statement read. Last year too, the state government announced financial assistance worth ₹3,000 each to over 65,000 street vendors across 114 urban local bodies to deal with the Covid-19 lockdown. Lat year, the Central government sanctioned ₹8.2 crore collateral-free loans for street vendors in Odisha under PM SVANidhi Yojana.However, Pratap Sahu, president of Odisha Utha Dokani Mahasangha, a body of street vendors, said that the package should be further extended because there are above 22 lakh roadside vendors across the state.“The impact of Covid-19 has been very harsh on informal workers like street vendors who have exhausted their capital and earnings in trying to feed themselves during the extended lockdown period. The government stimulus package, while a welcome step, is insufficient in the nature of relief as only registered vendors are eligible, which leaves out the majority of vendors in the state,” said Sahu.Sahu said vendors need to be able to resume vending for survival and the government should take steps to begin to reopen markets and allow vendors back on the streets. “Vending zones should be designed keeping in mind the need for social distancing and for sufficient hygiene facilities. Besides, all street vendors should be vaccinated in keeping with the promise made in March this year,” he added.Nupur Patnaik, a sociologist at Central University, Koraput, said the Street Vendors Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending Act, 2014, if implemented, would have helped the street vendors. “A vital and a thriving economy is the one that takes care of its foot soldiers or those at the very bottom and yet forms the most important constituent of the economy. The Act acknowledges that 2.5% of the city’s population are street vendors and they should be absorbed into the vending zones. But 7 years that the law came into place, it is yet to be properly implemented and the gap in the implementation of the act is also the primary reason why street vendors today are facing a crisis in the pandemic,” she said....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-announces-rs-29-cr-package-for-street-vendors-second-time-amid-pandemic-101623168646258.html

08-06-2021||Pune||No change in school fees despite online classes, parents allege||As admissions for the new academic year resume, many parents allege that schools have either maintained the same fees from last year or hiked it despite online education induced by Covid-19 restrictions. Parents have alleged that various charges for amenity, transportation and snacks are also included in the fee for students. However, like last year, this year as well schools will mostly function online. Speaking about the amenity charges, a Pune-based parent said that the school has charged ₹7,000 annually for snacks. “As online classes are ongoing, why does the school need to charge for snacks and transport? The student will not be using them anyways. During this pandemic, the fee hike is not justified as parents are struggling financially. We understand that our schools are good, but schools should also understand the situation of parents,” said a parent. Another parent of two daughters in kindergarten and nursery said that the fee hike for nursery has schools has been around 25 per cent. “As compared to last year, the fee hike is more than 25 per cent. The tuition fee, admission fee and the deposit has been increased. The deposit has been increased from ₹10,000 to ₹30,000. The admission fee was around ₹10,000 which is not ₹15,000 whereas the tuition fee was ₹65,000 which is now ₹72,000,” said the parent. The parent noted that the fee hike for nursery during online academic year is not justified at all. Rajendra Singh, president of Independent English Medium School Association (IESA) said that schools have maintained the fee structure from last year. “Even though the cost for online education has increased, many schools have maintained the fee structure from last year. This year, parents and teachers both agree that students should not lose out on learning during online education. We have to provide teachers with laptops and schools have to involve a third party for assessing students and evaluating them. These are costs incurred by schools. Despite that, schools have not increased fees,” said Singh. He added that students need to be disciplined during the online classes to avoid learning loss. “Students should wear their uniforms and not be disturbed when online lectures are going on. If the video of the child is not on, then how can the teacher check if the child is attentive? This leads to learning loss of the child and hence it is important to discipline the child,” said Singh. In March this year, the Bombay high court (HC) vacated the stay on the government resolution (GR) that restrained schools from hiking fees for the academic year of 2020-21 in view of the pandemic. However, the HC said the state may initiate action against a school in case of complaints from parents or even take suo moto action in case of alleged exploitation by a school. The bench also directed the state to address complaints of parents or take suo moto action against schools that violated the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) (MEIR) Act. It also restrained schools from taking coercive actions like expulsion or not being allowed to attend classes, against students whose parents had lodged complaints.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/no-change-in-school-fees-despite-online-classes-parents-allege-101623167926211.html

The Maharashtra Rail Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (MahaRail) and revenue officers have begun negotiations with landowners for the ambitious project between Pune and Nashik. MahaRail’s managing director Rajesh Kumar Jaiswal said, “The land acquisition for the project started on ground two weeks ago. It started on a whole stretch and the concerned collector office, and our officers are carrying out this process. We published the material in Marathi and handed it over to the landowners and project affected villages. The project’s benefits are listed in it.” Jaiswal said, “This is the first high speed project on broad gauge in India. We are preparing the design for it. We’ve even made some videos and the Maharail floated the tender for appointing a consultant for preparing the design of tunnels in all respects in connection with the broad-gauge double railway line project.” Jaiswal said, “As Covid -19 pandemic is going on, we did not fix any deadline for land acquisition, but we are hoping to get it done early. We are preparing all other administrative works. Once the land is acquired, the project would get executed in record time. It’s our dream to complete this project in record time as it is India’s first high-speed railway route on broad gauge.” One of the senior officers from the collector’s office said on condition of anonymity, “There is a good response for the land acquisition. It started in all three districts, Pune, Ahmednagar and Nashik. The local officers are carrying out this process. It’s not a traditional land acquisition process, the administration is approaching only the affected landowners instead of issuing notices to all villages. There is direct dealing with the landowner and government machinery.” One of the senior officers said that to avoid land acquisition in Pune city, some part of this project is overhead on existing railway lines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/land-acquisition-for-ambitious-pune-nashik-high-speed-rail-begins-101623167445569.html

For the academic year 2021-2022, there are 982 RTE registered schools in Pune. Around 14,567 students were selected in Pune during the online lottery of the 55,813 applications that were filed. Across Maharashtra, there are 82,129 students selected under RTE during the online lottery for this academic year. The lottery under the RTE was declared on April 7, however, the document verification and other procedures were stopped due to the lockdown which continued until May end. Under RTE, 25 per cent seats of the unaided private schools are reserved for students from economically backward sections at entry level of preschool and Class 1. Parents and activists have been demanding that the RTE process should restart quickly so that children begin school soon. Students who have been selected have received a text message regarding their selection. These parents now have to take all the required original documents and photocopies of the same to the respective schools for verification. Director of primary education Dattatray Jagtap in an official statement said that the document verification process will continue for 20 days ahead of June 11. “Parents are requested to take all original documents and photocopies of the documents to the school for verification along with them. Parents should also not forget that even though Covid cases have reduced, the pandemic is ongoing. We urge parents to maintain social distance and not gather in crowds at school premises. Parents should follow Covid protocols like wearing masks while going to the schools,” said Jagtap. He further added that schools should not give admissions to selected candidates who have not filled the distance between residential address and school correctly. Under the RTE act, the distance between residences of the student and the school should be less than 3 kilometres. The act states the limits of neighbourhood schools as 1 km walking distance from the habitation of a child at the primary level that is for Classes 1 to 5 and within 3 km walking distance for upper primary level that is for Classes 6 to 8. “Schools can hold admission for now for students who have filled the distance between school and residence incorrectly. These parents should visit the taluka level committee and the education department to resolve the matter,” said Jagtap. He further added that after the admission process for these selected candidates is completed, the students in the waiting list will get admission on seats that are remaining.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/rte-admission-process-to-resume-on-june-11-101623167265520.html

The organisation has now taken an important decision to convert its diesel buses into CNG buses. Looking at the hiked prices of diesel fuel, impacting on its daily expenses over fuel, the organisation is converting its 200 buses into CNG. It would be the first time PMPML would be changing its diesel buses into CNG, for which they have put in a request to Maharashtra Natural Gas Limited (MNGL) to carry out the process. “With the hiked diesel prices and having a major impact on our daily expenses, we have put in a request to MNGL demanding to convert our 200 buses from diesel to CNG. We had a preliminary discussion with their officials and accordingly we are now working out on a plan to convert these buses. There is a cost of around ₹4 lakh to convert one bus into CNG fuelling system,” said PMPML chairman and managing director Rajendra Jagtap. “It is just like installing a CNG kit to a car, similarly the buses will be installed CNG kits, and it will save our huge fuel expenses. Our talks are going on about the same with MNGL officials, its formalisation and proposal making process is going on,” he added. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the PMPML is already facing huge losses since last year. Even in the last two months as services were closed for public, the transport body reported losses of over ₹80 crore. When asked about funding of this project, Jagtap said, “We are not in a condition to bare the costing of converting these buses to CNG, but certainly if both the municipal corporations help in providing funds it will save lot of money in future over fuel. Once we get good response to this project, later on other than purchasing new buses and to save money we would convert more diesel buses into CNG.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmpml-to-convert-diesel-buses-into-cng-due-to-rising-fuel-prices-101623166845448.html

The organization even got the approval from its board of directors, but when it comes to implementation stage many such business plans have gone for a toss in the past. “Our main aim to prepare this business plan is to increase our revenue and reduce our expenses. Apart from that it aims to make strategies, how to increase our ridership, mobile ticketing and daily pass system revision and many more things are introduced in this plan. It has been approved by the board of directors and is available on our official website for public.” said PMPML chairman and managing director (CMD,) Rajendra Jagtap. In the past three such business plans were prepared by the then CMD’s and several changes were also made in it. But sadly, till date none of them came to the implementation stage. One of the plans was even reheated by Tukaram Mundhe in 2017. Talking about these business plans, Sanjay Shitole, a transport activist and member of PMP Pravasi Manch said, “There is lack of transparency and trust while making these plans. Earlier also such plans were made, huge funds were spent over it and then nothing happened. PMPML should involve transport organisations, experts and other stakeholders while making plans rather than giving it to a private company.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmpml-proposes-fresh-business-plan-to-generate-revenue-101623166485467.html

Only 11 private health facilities have shown interest to set up vaccination session sites since the Centre decentralised its vaccine procurement policy in May, before changing it again on Monday. It has asked private health facilities to correspond directly with the vaccine firms for supplies against the 25% production share available to them. While allowing them to charge people for vaccination, it capped the service charge to a maximum of ₹150 per vaccine dose, in addition to the cost of procuring the vaccine. Patna is the lone district among 37 others in Bihar to have shown some interest. Among some big private health facilities to have applied for government permission for vaccination are the Paras HMRI Hospital, Ruban Memorial Hospital, BIG Apollo Hospital, Mahavir Cancer Sansthan, Mahavir Aarogya Hospital, Mahavir Vatsalya Aspatal, Kurji Holy Family Hospital and the Tripolia Hospital, Gulzarbagh. The number of private players in Bihar now willing to participate in the Covid vaccination programme has fallen sharply as compared to over 100 private players during the National Covid Vaccination Programme between January 16 and April 30. As many as 40 private health facilities in Patna had participated in the mission earlier. Only 11 have sustained the interest now. “There is demand among our patients for the vaccine. Already, a few companies like the Reliance, HDFC Bank and the ICICI Bank have approached us to vaccinate its employees. We are happy with the service charge the government is offering us. We have been granted permission to host a vaccination session site at our hospital after the civil surgeon inspected our premises. We are hopeful to get the vaccines in July,” said managing director of the Ruban Memorial Hospital, Dr Satyajit Kumar Singh, who was earlier averse to the idea of hosting a vaccination session site at his hospital, after the government changed its policy of giving free vaccines to private players in May. The Ruban hospital, he said, had administered an average 200 to 450 doses of vaccine a day between January 16 and April 30. The state government had granted permission to the three hospitals under the Mahavir temple trust, said its secretary Acharya Kishore Kunal. “We have been allotted the centre code after inspection of our premises and indications are that the vaccines will be made available to us next month,” said Dr Upendra Prasad Sinha, nodal officer (vaccination) at the Mahavir Vatsalya Aspatal. Some other hospitals expressed skepticism about footfall at private centres for paid vaccination after the Prime Minister Monday announced that the Centre would provide free vaccines to states and union territories for vaccinating the population above 18 years of age, while asking private players to procure them directly from firms and allowed them a service charge of ₹150 per dose. The Centre had last month expressed concern that none of the private hospital from Bihar had entered into contract with manufacturers. A letter, dated May 31, from Dr Manohar Agnani, additional secretary, ministry of health and family welfare, to Bihar’s additional secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit had asked him to encourage better performing hospitals under the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana to sign an agreement with the two vaccine manufacturers. “This would enable the state to secure more vaccines for Covid-19 vaccination,” said Dr Agnani in his letter, a copy of which was with the Hindustan Times. Manoj Kumar, executive director, State Health Society, Bihar, did not respond to calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/poor-response-by-pvt-players-to-covid-vaccination-programme-101623166365392.html

A small quantity of sanitisers was found but it could be for the use by the employees, he said.Some locals had alleged that the company was also making sanitisers -- which are inflammable -- without license."It does not seem like the fire was caused due to sanitisers. As of now it seems that the fire was caused due to some material used in making chlorine dioxide," he said.Chlorine dioxide is used for water purification.Deshmukh also maintained that the death toll was 17. SDM Shirke had earlier put the death toll at 18.As per the company officials too there were 17 workers inside the section when the fire started around 3.30 pm on Monday.As the bodies were charred beyond recognition, blood samples of relatives have been taken for DNA matching to identify the deceased, Deshmukh said.To speed up the procedure, samples are being sent to an Aurangabad laboratory besides the Pune one, the SP said.The identification process was expected to be completed in four days, the SP added.The plant is located in the Pirangut industrial area of Mulshi tehsil, near Urawade village, 40 km from Pune city.Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar had said an inquiry would be conducted and a compensation of ₹5 lakh each will be given to the next of the kin of the deceased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/fire-at-chemical-plant-near-pune-culpable-homicide-case-lodged-against-owner-101623164808744.html

The court has given (the state government) six weeks to submit a counter reply,” Madhya Pradesh’s additional advocate general Pushyamitra Bhargava said.The 33-page petition filed by senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh said the MP government did not take steps to stop the clashes that erupted in December 2020 in three MP districts, Indore, Dhar and Ujjain, after a campaign to mobilise funds for the Ayodhya temple.“This left a trail of communal violence, breach of peace and communal harmony and destruction of immovable-movable property of the victims and otherwise,” the former chief minister’s petition said.Singh said he supported the “pious work of construction of Shri Ram Mandir at Ayodhya” but the collection of funds must be voluntary. Also, he said, members of the minority community “should not be coerced or threatened to pay donation for this pious purpose”.Some organisations targeted “members of the minority community of Madhya Pradesh in order to show their dominance and breach communal harmony in the State of Madhya Pradesh,” the petition said, referring to some incidents of violence when the rallies passed through Muslim-dominated areas.The state government and the police appeared to have been “inactive and negligent in performing their statutory and administrative duties”, he said, arguing that the communal violence in the three districts demonstrated an attempt to spread the violence.Singh’s petition said the government officials concerned not only acted negligently but at certain places, witnessed the entire episode without acting against the culprit.Lawyer Ravindra Singh Chhabra, who filed the petition for Singh, said he had submitted video clips, WhatsApp chats and other documentary evidence to back up his charge.Madhya Pradesh director general of police, Vivek Johri refused to comment. “The matter is in court now so I can’t comment on it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/digvijaya-singh-s-pil-blames-mp-govt-for-dec-clashes-court-seeks-govt-response-101623162945562.html

My priority is to strengthen the party at the grassroots level. I am sure the party will be in the reckoning soon, bypassing recent setbacks,” he said in Thiruvananthapuram. Many senior leaders, including Chandy, Chennithala and VM Sudheeran, hailed his elevation and said his selection will give the right message to the party rank and file.Following the defeat in the recently-held assembly elections, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala and PCC chief Mullapally Ramachandran had resigned. Senior leader VD Satheesan was later appointed the opposition leader in the assembly but the selection of the PCC chief was delayed due to pressure from different groups.An opponent of faction politics, Sudhakaran (73) wields good support among young cadres of the party. Known for his strong position against the CPI(M), he survived two attempts on his life. A grassroots leader, he always stood with party workers through thick and thin. A fiery orator, his acerbic tongue and blunt talk often landed him in trouble but young party workers always cherished it and he became an icon among them.Two powerful groups in the party, one led by former CM Oommen Chandy and the other by Ramesh Chennithala, opposed his elevation strongly but the party insiders said leader and MP Rahul Gandhi threw his weight behind Sudhakaran.He started his political career through Janata Party in the 1970s and later joined the Congress on the initiative of veteran leader K Karunakaran. He was a legislator from 1996 to 2009 and was a minister in the AK Antony cabinet. He was elected twice from Kannur parliament seat. A post-graduate, he’s also a fitness freak.After the elevation of the new PCC president, three new working presidents were also appointed by the AICC - Kodikunnil Suresh MP, PT Thomas MLA and T Siddique. The present working president KV Thomas has been removed from the post, said the release issued by AICC general secretary (in charge of organisation) KC Venugopal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kannur-strongman-k-sudhakaran-is-new-kerala-pradesh-congress-committee-chief-101623162047206.html

The police action came after a probe committee constituted by district collector Rajesh Deshmukh, under sub-divisional magistrate Sandesh Shirke, highlighted several lacunas in its preliminary report, submitted within 24 hours of the incident. Seventeen workers, including 15 women, were charred to death in a major fire that broke out inside the industrial plant at Urawade village near Pirangut, around 40 kilometres from Pune. Following the tragedy, Deshmukh constituted a four-member team, headed by Shirke, to inquire into the cause of the fire, along with safety related aspects. The committee found negligence on the part of SVS Technologies on various counts, including no fire-safety mechanism, despite combustible material being produced at the mid-size plant. The committee highlighted a total of 12 points in its report, accessed by Hindustan Times. “The firm did not follow norms needed to be adhered to on the industrial estate. This included fire safety, building permission-related norms along with provision of entry-exit points and open spaces needed to be allotted. The committee also found that SVS Technologies did not take necessary precaution, especially as it was producing combustible material like chlorine di-oxide,” said superintendent of police, Abhinav Deshmukh. The report of the committee will now be part of the investigation against Shah and his firm. According to eyewitnesses who survived the blaze, there were sparks at a machine used for processing chlorine di-oxide, which the firm was using to make a powder for purifying water. The committee has recorded statements of the eye witnesses, which will now be part of police investigation. Before his arrest, Shah, after the fire, had denied his company was producing any inflammable material. “The firm is involved in manufacturing chemicals required for purification of water. This chemical is not inflammable, and we suspect a short- circuit as the cause of the incident,” Shah had said on Monday. The police also ruled out that the company was producing sanitisers, as alleged by relatives of the victims. “Although we found some barrels of sanitisers, it is a small quantity and possibly brought for the use of workers during Covid,” the police said.

Fire-audit wise, definitely more caution should be taken. I will ask all MIDC officials to take precautions to avoid such incidents,” said Walse-Patil, during his visit to Pirangut, where he met families who lost their kin in the incident. The minister also said that DNA tests will be carried out to ascertain the identities of victims, as the fire at the chemical manufacturing firm at Urawade in Pirangut was so devastating, that it has posed a major challenge to authorities to identify the deceased.On Tuesday, the administration also revised the death toll in the tragedy to 17. “Due to the blast inside, some bodies were found in parts. Initially it seemed like there were 18 victims. However, now we have crossed-checked with the company officials and found only 17 missing. Everyone else is accounted for. Therefore, the death toll is 17,” said Abhay Chavan, tehsildar of Mulshi area Bodies of the deceased were recovered from the site after a two-hour operation on Monday. “All bodies are completely charred due to severe burns. They cannot be identified clearly. A DNA examination of all bodies will be done for identification. Blood samples of relatives will be taken,” said Abhinav Deshmukh, superintendent of police, Pune Rural. An official at the mortuary of Sassoon General Hospital, under condition of anonymity, said on Tuesday morning, “Doctors could only barely identify the gender, but even that cannot be confirmed. Without DNA tests, it will be difficult to say anything.” A team of doctors performed post-mortems on the bodies overnight. However, the bodies have not yet been handed over to the relatives. The blood relatives of missing victims are being called in from various parts of Maharashtra. The samples will be sent for DNA testing at the government laboratory in Pune.

08-06-2021||Lucknow||UP govt sets target for vaccinating 10 crore citizens in 3 months||Hours after the Uttar Pradesh government relaxed restrictions due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in all 75 districts of the state, it said in a release that it has set the target of vaccinating 10 crore people in the next three months.As many as 797 new Covid-19 cases were reported in the state in the past 24 hours. On Monday, 2.85 lakh Covid-19 tests were done. The positivity rate of the state is 0.2%, while the recovery rate has gone up to 97.9%, according to the official data.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath instructed officials to increase the vaccination capacity in the state by three times and take it to 10 lakh doses per day in July in a bid to prevent the third wave of the pandemic. The CM also asked the officials concerned to prepare a district-wise strategy to meet the target of 10-lakh-doses a day in July."In spite of being the most populous state, Uttar Pradesh is setting new daily records in vaccination while states like Punjab, Rajasthan and Chandigarh among others have ‘underutilized’ doses of Covid-19 vaccine that have been supplied to them," the release read.Vaccination in Uttar Pradesh has been ramped up significantly after the immunisation drive ‘Mission June’ was launched. "The cumulative number of Covid-19 vaccine doses administered in the state exceeded 2.07 crore, with over 4.57 lakh doses being administered on Monday. Notably, the vaccination drive in Uttar Pradesh has seen a remarkable jump, leaving other states far behind in the run," the release added."On June 7, around 32,81,402 doses of Covid-19 vaccine were given all over the country, of which 4,57,085 doses were administered in Uttar Pradesh. Madhya Pradesh holds the second rank with 3,82,224, followed by West Bengal, which administered 2,96,843 doses and Maharashtra with 2,91,592 doses," the release said.CM Adityanath, while reviewing the Covid-19 situation in the state, welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision to take back control of Covid-19 vaccination from the states and to provide free vaccines to all from June 21. “The Prime Minister has announced free vaccination for all age groups from 21st June.

For areas like Kolhapur, which is witnessing a spike in cases, Salunke attributed the late occurrence of the virus as the reason for the rise.“The lockdown as well as other factors such as ramping up of tests and regular supply of medicines ensured reduction of cases. In areas like Kolhapur, the virus came late and hence, active cases there will come down in the next 15 days,” said Salunke.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced an easing of the lockdown-like restrictions from Monday, which was imposed in a bid to contain the rising number of cases. A five-level unlock plan was announced on Sunday allowing areas with a positivity rate of 5% or less and less than 25% oxygen bed occupancy to open up completely. However, no public movement is allowed in areas with more than 20% positivity rate and over 75% occupancy of oxygen beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-10-891-fresh-covid-19-cases-pushing-tally-to-5-58-million-101623158529585.html

It added that small scale breeding is likely to commence with the onset of the monsoon in July, but locust numbers should remain low.“We are monitoring the situation as per FAO’s desert locust update, but the chances of a locust attack are very low, said KL Gurjar, deputy director of the Locust Warning Organization (LWO).Also Read | Rajasthan: Locust attack warning issued for JaisalmerAn LWO official said that the organisation is fully prepared.To further strengthen ground control capabilities,70 new pieces of equipment were procured from the United Kingdom to increase the number of ground control teams to 104. Additionally, 55 vehicles were procured to strengthen the control potential. He said that last year, to strengthen aerial control capabilities, drones, a Bell helicopter and customised Mi17 Helicopter of Indian Air Force were deployed. Drones were used for locust control for the first time after finalising protocols in coordination with the ministry of civil aviation.According to a ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare report, a locust attack is not a regular phenomenon and large scale incursions occur characteristically in cycles of heightened activity for a couple of years, followed by long periods of inactivity. Locust attacks were reported in India during 2019-20 and 2020-21, examples of large scale locust upsurges, when locusts migrated to India after a gap of 26 years. During 2019-20, a locust incursion was reported in Rajasthan, Gujarat and Punjab, while in 2020-21, there was locust incursion in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.“During 2019-20, Rajasthan and Gujarat had reported crop loss over 1,79,584 hectares and 19,313.14 hectares of land, respectively. During 2020-21, Haryana reported minimal crop loss, much below the norms of compensation. Uttar Pradesh has reported a very nominal crop loss over 202.9 hectares of land. Maharashtra and Uttarakhand have reported crop loss of below 33% on 805.80 hectares and 292.4 hectares of land respectively. Madhya Pradesh has reported a partial crop loss of 10-15% over 4,400 hectares. Rajasthan has reported a crop loss of above 33% on 489.72 hectares and Gujarat has reported crop loss of below 33% on 6,832.20 hectares of land,” as reported by the ministry of agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/fao-alert-locust-movement-in-india-likely-during-monsoon-numbers-to-be-low-101623158385344.html

The former deputy chief minister said the move will compensate for the losses suffered by businesses due to repeated lockdowns imposed to stop the spread of coronavirus in the state. “Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had promised to waive fixed charges on power bills for two months last year, but the government went back on this commitment,” said Sukhbir in a press statement issued on Tuesday. He said the things had gone from bad to worse, as the industrial sector, hospitality sector and other businesses are running in losses, making it essential to waive fixed charges from April 1, 2021, to March 31, 2022. “Similarly, a one-year property tax waiver should be implemented for the trade and industry sectors to help them tide over the current Covid-19 crisis,” said the Ferozepur MP. Sukhbir announced that in case the Congress government remains “insensitive to the suffering of the trade and industry”, the SAD would implement these waivers if voted to power in the state in 2022. The SAD chief said it was shocking that no relief had been extended to any section of society till now. “A compensation of ₹2 lakh should be extended to families of all Covid victims besides cash assistance of ₹6,000 per month to all BPL families for six months,” he said. He also demanded a one-year waiver of road tax for all cab and auto operators as they had lost their livelihood due to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/akali-dal-demands-tax-waivers-for-businesses-in-punjab-101623158265012.html

The pilgrimage was scheduled to start on May 14 but was postponed on May 29 amid worries that it could become another super-spreader event after the Mahakumbh.The Uttarakhand government was widely criticised for its poor management of the Mahakumbh and for breach of safety protocol. The Centre was also criticised for allowing the event to go ahead. The Mahakumb coincided with a surging second Covid-19 wave that overwhelmed the health care system.Only priests of the Char Dham shrines have been allowed to perform rituals and worship after they were opened last month.A section of saints has said the pilgrimage should be allowed in a phased manner as was done the previous year with Covid protocols in place.Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad general secretary Shri Mahant Hari Giri Maharaj said the pilgrimage needed to be restricted as the pandemic was alarmingly spreading in March and April but now people from neighbouring villages and districts should be allowed in a phased manner while ensuring safe pilgrimage.Also Watch | Stranded pregnant woman rescued after landslide blocks Gangotri HighwayUttarakhand minister Satpal Maharaj has said the state was considering a plan to allow Char Dham pilgrimage for residents of Chamoli, Rudraprayag, and Uttarkashi.Mahamandaleshwar Hari Chetnanand Maharaj of Shri Panchayati Bada Udasin Akhada said Char Dham is linked with spiritual, religious aspects as well as the livelihood of the hill state. He pointed that even trade of the Haridwar-Rishikesh belt was majorly dependent on Char Dham pilgrimage. Uttarakhand Taxi-Maxi Hill Union (Pauri) conveyer Kotwal Singh Negi said Covid-19 has affected them badly for two years and the pilgrimage is critical for them. He added otherwise they will be even unable to pay the annual tax levied on commercial vehicles.Haridwar’s transporters and travel agents have submitted a memorandum saying the pilgrimage should be allowed.Kedarnath, Badrinath, Yamunotri, and Gangotri are collectively called Char Dham and millions visit them annually. The pilgrimage begins from Yamunotri in the west. It then proceeds to Gangotri and finally to Kedarnath and Badrinath in the east.The pilgrimage could not begin last year as per schedule on April 26 with the opening of portals of Yamunotri and Gangotri, the first two shrines that are opened after winter, because of the lockdown imposed to check the pandemic spread in March 2020.The shrines were opened for local pilgrims on July 1 last year and for those from other states in the last week of that month. In September, the Uttarakhand government removed the condition of having negative Covid-19 reports for pilgrims to undertake the pilgrimage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/seers-traders-seek-phased-char-dham-yatra-101623157664992.html

The girl’s 60-year-old grandmother fainted for the want of water while the duo was on its way from the grandma’s paternal home in a village Sirohi district to her in-laws’ place in a village of Jalore district.“The grandma-granddaughter duo decided to return to their home in Raniwada on Sunday morning for which they took a shortcut route of 15 kilometres through desert and hills instead of the 22 kilometres long route,” he said.Police rescued the old lady who is now hospitalised at the government hospital of Raniwara town of Jalore district in Western Rajasthan.The Station House Officer of the Raniwada police station, Padma Ram said that Sukhi Devi (60) had gone to her paternal home in Raipur village of Sirohi district from her home in Dungri village of Raniwada region of Jalore district of Western Rajasthan on Saturday. Sukhi and Anjali did not carry drinking water with them while departing for Raniwada on Sunday morning, he said. When the duo was passing through the deserted desert area of the Raniwada region, Anjali started asking for drinking water from her grandma but no water was to be found anywhere around, said Padma Ram.They also met a shepherd on the way who refused to provide drinking water to them after which Anjali fainted and died in front of her grandma who was also thirsty.Later, another shepherd saw the fainted duo after which he informed the local sarpanch. The sarpanch communicated the incident to the Raniwara police station whose Station House Officer, Padma Ram, arrived at the spot and provided drinking water to Sukhi Devi.Sukhi and Anjali were taken to the Raniwada hospital where Anjali was declared dead due to dehydration and heart attack while Devi’s treatment is underway, he said. Padma Ram said that the wells meant for agricultural activity were just 1 kilometre away from the place where the duo fainted. He said that the probe revealed that the duo walked for 7 kilometres in 5 hours due to difficult terrain and high temperature. “The duo did not carry any drinking water with them and also took the wrong decision of choosing a deserted desert shortcut route instead of the 22 kilometre-long one,” he said. Reacting to the incident, state BJP president, Satish Poonia tweeted, “starvation, thirst and death are heavy on the political statements of CM Ashok Gehlot. It is the misfortune of Rajasthan that incompetent and corrupt Congress leads the state government and has transformed Rajasthan into a land of starvation, unemployment, chaos, mafia raj and crimes”.Congress Spokesperson, Archana Sharma, said that the incident is unfortunate as the grandma-granddaughter duo took that route which did not have any water on the way. She said the matter will be probed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/5yearold-girl-dies-due-to-lack-of-drinking-water-in-western-rajasthan-101623156345571.html

We are left with a feeling that there is no commitment to the rule of law and no concern for the environment and health of the citizens on the part of the authorities concerned in the states of HP, Haryana, Punjab and UT Chandigarh,” said the bench, also comprising justice Sudhir Agarwal.The tribunal directed the chief secretary, Punjab, and the adviser to the administrator, Union Territory of Chandigarh and other concerned officers to take appropriate remedial measures to comply with the mandate of law, including the directions of the Supreme Court.It also directed a joint committee of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Punjab PCB and pollution control committee of Chandigarh to inspect the drain and furnish a status report within two months by e-mail.The tribunal said in spite of enactment of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, making discharge of untreated effluents into a water body a criminal offence, the states are still struggling to prevent untreated sewage from being discharged into the water body at a huge cost to the environment and health and lives of citizens who have fundamental right to clean environment under the Constitution. “Water pollution is a serious threat to the health of the citizens as well as other living beings who consume the water and also to the food safety for growth of which the water is used for irrigation...there can be no justification whatsoever for the State to have failed in complying with the law.The green panel said that no action is being taken against the erring officers and it gives an impression that there is collapse of environmental rule of law.“Who is to pay the cost of damage to the environment and public health of large number of unidentified citizens and other living creatures? Is such cost being calculated? How officers responsible for damage by their inaction or otherwise are being dealt with. Should the State be held liable vicariously for such failure and failure to punish the guilty,” the bench said.The tribunal was hearing a plea against failure of statutory authorities in Punjab and Chandigarh to install sewage treatment plant, resulting in discharge of pollution in the drain originating from Chandigarh and passing through various sectors and villages of Mohali, before merging into the Ghaggar river.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ngt-raps-punjab-haryana-hp-for-pollution-in-ghaggar-101623156104272.html
08-06-2021||Delhi||As Covid fatalities drop, Delhi stops night cremations||Nearly one and a half months after crematoriums across the city started holding night funerals because of the high number of daily Covid-19 deaths, Delhi’s civic agency has allowed them to stop the practice. Officials managing the crematoriums said the death count has reduced because of which mortuaries now have space, are able to keep more bodies and need not send them for night funerals. In April and May, as the numbers of Covid-19 bodies grew exponentially and there was no space in mortuaries, bodies were immediately sent for funeral -- the minute a patient was declared dead at the hospital -- often leading to crowding at such places. HT spoke to officials managing some of the largest crematoriums such as the ones in Sarai Kale Khan, Ghazipur and Shastri Park and they also confirmed that they stopped night funerals about 3-4 days ago. Also Read | Don’t think we will have serious infection in children in the future: GuleriaArvind Kumar, who works at the Ghazipur crematorium, said 3 bodies of suspected Covid-19 victims were brought to the crematorium on Monday. The facility is one of the largest in East Delhi. On Tuesday, it again received 3 bodies of suspected Covid-19 victims and conducted their funeral. A death audit committee of experts from the Delhi government checks medical records of each patient and confirms if the death is indeed caused by the viral disease. “This is the same place where we had to build funeral platforms at the parking lot two months ago. We were getting over 100 bodies then. We were all working in two shifts...This decision to stop night cremations was taken about ten days ago,” said Kumar. The officials managing the crematorium said that their head priest, Ram Karan Mishra, also left for his home town in Bihar. “He was supposed to go home but because of the high body count here, he wasn’t able to go. Last week, he left for his village. Last month, we had called many boys from our villages to help us as the body count was high. They have also left. ” The Delhi’s government’s health bulletin also shows how cases have reduced drastically. On Monday, 36 persons died of Covid, which is the lowest since April 10, when Delhi reported 39 deaths. At Sarai Kale and the Shastri Park crematoriums, which too had been made 24-hour facilities, officials have pasted notices that they would not take the bodies for cremation after 8pm. Nirmal Jain, mayor East Delhi Municipal Corporation, said, “We have now shut the night cremation facility as the number of bodies coming to our crematoriums and graveyards have reduced drastically. Allowing cremation at night was an emergency move when hundreds of dead bodies were reaching our facilities.” Jain told ANI on Tuesday morning that in east Delhi, no last rites of Covid-19 patients were held in the last two days.Also Read | Delhi reports 316 new Covid-19 cases and 41 deaths; positivity rate at 0.44%In April, the national Capital recorded 5,120 deaths, followed by 8,090 deaths in May. In the first three days of May, there were more than 400 deaths every day. The Delhi government had, on April 2, said that Delhi was witnessing the fourth wave of the infection. In terms of the number of cases and deaths, the fourth wave has been the deadliest in Delhi till date. Nigambodh Ghat, one of the largest crematoriums in the city, which has both wood-based and CNG mode of cremation, remains open round-the-clock throughout the year. Avdesh Sharma, one of the officials, who manages the crematorium in north Delhi, said, “We are open throughout the year but before the pandemic, only few would bring bodies at night. It happened only sometimes. And then last month, when we started getting 125 bodies every day, there were mass funerals at night. We get around 20-25 bodies now. And all these funerals are happening during the day.” In the third week of April, the North Delhi’s municipal corporation’s mayor, Jai Prakash, had issued an order that all six CNG furnaces too should remain operational. Officials said they longer have to use all furnaces and use the CNG furnaces only till 8pm. The mayor had then said that while Hindu rituals do not allow cremating body at night, these were unprecedented times, which required one to accommodate the changes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/as-covid-fatalities-drop-delhi-stops-night-funerals-101623153884965.html

08-06-2021||Pune||Covid second wave: From miscalculated to now, possibly, over-optimistic||The first case of Covid-19 in Maharashtra was notified on March 9, 2020. The increase in numbers began gradually till July 2020, and then, there was a sharp upsurge from August. By mid-September, new cases per day rose to 23,500, which was a peak point. Later, it gradually showed a downward trend and by end of January 2021, the figure became minuscule, at 1,800 new cases per day.In December 2020, at Amravati, numbers began increasing. The presence of variant viruses was noted in the genome sequencing of the samples of a few positive cases. Of them, some were variants from UK and South Africa, but a new mutant was noted and ignored, which later proved to be a double mutant, named recently as “delta” and “kappa” by WHO. In January and February of 2021, the Vidarbha region, including Amravati, Nagpur, Bhandara and Chandrapur districts,showed a rapid increase in Covid-19 cases. By February 20, 2021, Amravati ranked second in the list of districts with the highest number of active Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, with 5,406 active cases daily. The positivity rate was at 50%. The rest of the districts were showing a positivity rate of around 40%.Similarly in Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Aurangabad, Thane, and Navi Mumbai, the number of new cases was growing at a faster pace. In February and March, it was noticed that…- Numbers are increasing rapidly- Symptoms are changing. Low-grade fever, severe breathlessness, loose motions, vomiting, rashes over the body, Covid tongue, and anosmia were the new symptoms. - The upper middle-class and elite in big housing societies and bungalows outnumbered the slum dwellers in getting infected- The age group of 20 to 45 years was mainly affected- A large number of children below 10 years of age were getting infectedThis was the beginning of the Second Wave. Doctors and scientists informed the government of Maharashtra that this is the second wave and a new mutant of Maharashtra origin has surfaced. Government of Maharashtra clearly said that there is no second wave and no mutants.It was Rajesh Bhushan, chief secretary of health, Central government who finally, on March 24, 2021, conveyed to the Maharashtra government the existence of the mutant of Maharashtra origin - B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2, and also declared that it is the second wave.Bhushan pointed out and the doctors in the state said that: - Contact tracing of 30 testings per new patient is required.- Considering the massive rise in the number of patients, the need to make necessary infrastructure arrangements was stressed, but these suggestions were not followed. During this second wave, Maharashtra was India’s worst-affected state, just as it was in the first wave of Covid 19 last year. As of April 27, Maharashtra had 676,647 active patients, almost a quarter of the national total of 2,882,204. The state has so far recorded more than 0.1 million deaths, 30 percent of the national total of 3,46,000. Data with the Maharashtra health department shows that the growth of positive cases had been exponential since February 12, which the state marks as the start of the second wave. Maharashtra recorded 2,052,905 cases in the 11 months between March 9, 2020, and February 11, 2021. Then in just the first 72 days of the second wave, between February 12 and April 25 — it recorded 2,174,654 cases. Almost 70 percent of these cases have been recorded in Tier II, Tier III cities, and the villages.Until the middle of April 2021, the state’s positivity rate was 25.17 %, with figures from 16 rural districts coming in higher than that. These districts include Jalna, Beed, Nandurbar, Nashik, Latur, Gondiya, Parbhani, Hingoli, Osmanabad, Pune, Nagpur, Ahmednagar, Beed, Nandurbar, Palghar, and Ratnagiri. With a 39.25 per cent positivity rate, Osmanabad topped the charts, followed by Parbhani (36.78 per cent) and Hingoli (36.7 per cent). In April 2021, Mumbai recorded the lowest weekly growth rate at 1.09 per cent, and Parbhani recorded the highest, at 798 per cent, followed by Latur at 398 per cent, Beed at 347 per cent, and Jalna at 345 per cent.Oxygen shortageThere was a shortage of medical oxygen even in the first wave in October 2020. But the government did not improve production and remained happy with 1,200 metric tonnes per day. In April, during the peak period, the requirement escalated to 3,000 metric tonnes per day. Even with all the additional support, like the “Oxygen Express” train, the situation did not improve in time. Around 40 per cent of the deaths that occurred in March and April 2021, were because of a lack of oxygen. Large-scale use of the impure industrial oxygen is a probable cause of post-Covid complications, like the mucormycosis infection. This number has reached 11,000 cases.Rural pictureIn the rural areas of Maharashtra, the number of beds at Covid Care Centres was only 20 percent of the need and oxygen beds were fulfilling 70 percent of the requirement.Due to an inadequate numbers of ICU beds and ventilators, 30 to 40 per cent of patients needed to be shifted to the nearest city. Of these, 50 per cent of patients died on the way and the rest were admitted, but half of them survived.There was an inadequate number of RTPCR testing kits as well as rapid antigen tests. A sufficient amount of medicines needed were not available in the government hospitals in rural areas throughout the period.LockdownThe CM of Maharashtra announced a lockdown in the second week of April. It should have been announced one month earlier. Mumbai and Pune districts were showing a downward trend in the patient numbers around 10-15 days before the official lockdown. VaccinationIt has been proved historically and scientifically that vaccination is the only answer to curb the spread of a pandemic. The vaccination campaign never had a proper plan to vaccinate a population of 130 crore in one year. The supply chain of vaccines needed to ensure speedy vaccinations was never thought of. Registration through CoWin and Aarogyasetu apps was a bad idea that decelerated the motion. Not allowing all the registered doctors to vaccinate officially, limited the number of vaccination centres to a handful of government and private hospitals. Not making it available in the open market and keeping all the strings in the Central government’s hands, made the dream of “Vaccinating India through the Teeka Mahotsav” unapproachable. Covid vaccination is an utter failure; not only in Maharashtra, but all over India.UnlockAs of June 7, 10 districts have been relieved from restrictions and life has again started. Criteria for unlocking a region has not been very convincing, scientifically. “Covid-appropriate behaviour” is forgotten again. Let us hope that a brand new variant does not evolve in the coming months to give birth to a still devastating Third Wave.

The new policy will focus on quick rehabilitation of disaster-affected families. The decision was taken by minister of state for disaster management (independent charge) Dhan Singh Rawat after a review meeting on Monday which was attended by MLAs of both ruling and Opposition parties of disaster-prone constituencies. Rawat assured the MLAs that the new policy would focus on “ensuring quick rehabilitation of families which are affected by any natural disaster or calamities.” State’s current disaster management and rehabilitation policy was framed in 2011. Opposition Congress MLA Manoj Rawat from Kedarnath constituency which witnessed floods in 2013, said, “We asked the minister to increase the compensation amount from ₹4 lakh to ₹5 lakh in case of complete damage of the house. We also asked him to define ‘family’ in the policy because in hilly areas, usually there are two families living in the same house but during a disaster, only the family which was included in the family register during the 2011 census is considered, which is unfair.”The Congress MLA also said that all the legislators also urged the minister to frame the new policy “considering the next 20-25 years.” Minister Rawat said that under the existing policy, “1,086 families from 43 villages have been rehabilitated since 2012 at a cost of ₹45.63 crore.” The minister said the department will hold another review meeting after 10 days. “In that meeting, we will consider the suggestions given by the MLAs for the framework of new disaster management and rehabilitation policy,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/uttarakhand-to-bring-in-new-disaster-management-rehabilitation-policy-101623152204598.html

The move is a bid to honour the contributions of women faculty members and encourage more women to take up science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) courses.The institute on Monday announced that the chair has been set up with donations of an undisclosed amount from alumni member Amit Dixit, who is currently the head of Asia for private equity at global investment firm Blackstone. The announcement of the first chair is likely in September.The chair is a term for endowed professorships as a recognition of a faculty member’s contribution to the university in terms of research and academics. It is the highest honour that an academic institute can confer on its faculty. “The prestige of an endowed chair also lends an additional cachet to the departments. It helps to attract the best and brightest young students and investigators, thus securing the future of the institution. It is clear why endowed chairs are an essential constituent of IIT-B. This is what would be seen in many other outstanding educational institutions worldwide,” the institute’s policy on chair professorship states.Chair professorships reserved for women are gaining ground in western and European countries but are scarce in India. The Amit Dixit Chair professorship for women faculty members is one of the first to be set up by any Indian university. Last year, the University Grants Commission (UGC), the apex body governing all higher education institutions, had announced 11 women-centric academic chairs in various universities but they are yet to be established.“To the best of our knowledge, this is the first woman chair professorship in IITs across the country, to recognise the efforts of women. In 2020, the Centre announced 11 women-centric academic chairs in various universities in honour of historic women scientists, including cytogeneticist Archana Sharma, botanist Janaki Ammal, organic scientist Darshan Ranganatham and chemist Asima Chatterjee, among others. These chair professorships are yet to be formally established. So we are the first, for now, as far as I know. I look forward to the day once all these chair professorships are formalised, as there will be a big impetus for women in STEM,” said Suhas Joshi, professor and dean, alumni and corporate relations.Dixit, who graduated with a BTech in civil engineering degree in 1995, said this new position would inspire faculty and students and widen the funnel to develop women leaders in technology. “India has risen to global prominence for its strong talent pool particularly in STEM disciplines. IIT-B and its alumni have created a large impact on the global technology industry. It is increasingly important to promote diversity and support women so they have the opportunity to secure global leadership positions,” said Dixit.Joshi said the chosen chair will have an exciting and challenging role ahead. “Her [chair’s] work will primarily be divided under two heads – initiate and provide expert guidance in research and development programmes, improve interaction with industry through consultancy work and provide academic and technical leadership in her field as well as oversee and help mentor the volunteering groups who help attract brilliant women students to the Institute,” said Joshi.IIT-B runs an online counselling programme for incoming women and their families after the result declaration of entrance exams. The chosen chair will lead these efforts. “The volunteering group under the mentorship of the chair will provide special counselling to incoming women students and their families to encourage them to choose IITs for their studies,” said Joshi.“The participation of women in STEM fields in India has been low due to reasons both cultural and functional. IITs have hence been working on a foundational level to boost women’s presence in technical education to assuage social and cultural concerns, which do not allow women students to join IITs despite clearing the joint entrance examination (JEE). “The Centre introduced the supernumerary quota for women in IITs in 2018 and this has helped increase women admissions from 8% in 2016 to 18% in 2020. But a lot more needs to be done to attract the brightest girl minds to IITs. The endowment made by Dixit also supports these volunteer efforts,” said Joshi.According to data published by the department of science and technology, women comprised only 14% of India’s STEM workforce in research and development in 2017-18.Subhasis Chaudhuri, director, IIT-B, said, “As one of the leading academic institutions in India, we are proud to take the lead in raising awareness of the importance of women leaders with the support of Mr Dixit. The government has also played an instrumental role in our diversity efforts, introducing the supernumerary quota for women in IITs. This has helped increase the admission of women. However, there’s always room to do more. We are grateful to Mr Dixit for his generous contribution, which has laid the groundwork for change and set an example for others in the education sector.”Joshi said that the memorandum of understanding between the institute and Dixit is valid for 10 years and can be extended mutually with discussion of another decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/iitbombay-first-indian-varsity-to-set-up-chair-professorship-for-women-faculty-101623150944466.html

His elder brother Jitendra Kumar supported Birendra Kumar to realise his dreams with the income from his family business of shoe making and repairs.“I didn’t get any fancy education. I did my schooling from my village’s government school and pursued graduation from Daudnagar College of Aurangabad. I was motivated to prepare for the BPSC examination by a senior named Rajeev, and it changed my life,” an ecstatic Kumar said. Needless to say, he is the first member in his family to have qualified for a reputed government job.After his father’s demise, his elder brother took the responsibility of running the house and helped Kumar continue his studies but when the family’s financial situation deteriorated further, Kumar was forced to sell eggs to keep his dreams alive.“I started selling eggs in 2012 and continued [doing so] for five years till my brother’s business flourished. I studied rigorously for the examination under the guidance of Rajeev sir and with the help of the internet and cleared the examination in the first attempt,” the 27-year-old said.“With my humble family background and simple education, I used to feel that cracking the BPSC exam was beyond my capacity. Then I worked to overcome my weaknesses while pondering over qualities that will help me stand out among hundreds of thousands of aspirants,” he said.Kumar regrets his mother couldn’t see him become an officer.“My mother passed away in January. I miss her. She motivated and instilled self belief in me, saying hard work pays off someday,” Kumar recalled. He has now set his sight on cracking the Union Public Service Commission examination.Kumar hoped his success will help his family’s coming generation to get a good education and better living conditions.“My family reeled under poverty for a long period. Filling the basic needs was tough for us. But I hope our next generation will not have to do odd jobs like we did,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/cobblers-son-sold-eggs-for-5-years-before-cracking-bihar-civil-services-exam-101623150224118.html

The pilots’ association is also seeking priority vaccination and insurance coverage for those working during the pandemic, reported news agency PTI.The association filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) before the court on Monday seeking direction to the Centre for an ex-gratia payment of ₹10 crore to the families of the deceased pilots. The plea also stated that despite risking their lives to provide dedicated service during the pandemic many pilots have been subjected to pay cuts."In such times, several pilots have been infected by the coronavirus and many have lost their lives. Several pilots also face the risk of permanent or temporary disability due to the after-effects of Covid-19, like mucormycosis," the plea stated."Despite this, several pilots have been subjected to massive pay cuts since the beginning of 2020," it added.The PIL has also sought directions to the Centre regarding priority vaccination through the creation of a separate class of Covid-19 first responders as 'Air Transportation Workers', and formulation of a comprehensive insurance scheme.The Union health ministry defines frontline workers as the personnel from state and central police forces, armed forces, home guards and civil defence volunteers including disaster management volunteers and municipal workers (excluding HCWs), prison staff, revenue officials who are deployed in containment and surveillance activities. They are eligible for free priority vaccination and compensation in case of death due to Covid-19.Across the country many essential service providers have asked for ‘frontline worker’ statuses and equal compensation in case of death due to Covid-19. In May, another representative body, Indian Pilots’ Guild, a Boeing pilots’ union of Air India, wrote to their chairman requesting adequate compensation for three of their colleagues who lost their lives to Covid-19.A railway employees’ union, too, has launched a campaign seeking ‘frontline worker’ status for employees who have been working throughout the pandemic.The petition will be taken up by the court for hearing in due course of time, reported PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pilots-body-moves-bombay-hc-seeking-compensation-for-covid-victims-priority-vaccination-101623144405736.html

No arrests have been made yet but a probe has been ordered into the incident, which has triggered tension in the locality.The explosion is suspected to have taken place at 8 am inside a room in the Navtolia madrasa building under the Town police station area. Police said their first impressions suggested it could have been caused by gelatine- an explosive combination of chemicals.More than ten persons were present in the madrasa at the time of the explosion, which, according to police, likely took place in a room locked for several days and was heard far and wide. Police say the explosion originated on the ground floor and cracked the madrasa walls and roof, which collapsed moments later. The resultant shock waves also broke several glass windows in the neighbourhood.Besides the Banka police, a bomb squad, a dog squad and anti-terrorism squads (ATS) visited the spot. Cops said they have not ruled out any theory including suggestions that it could have originated outside the madrasa or could have been caused by an LPG cylinder; apart from the one which suggested it was caused by possible explosive substances stored in the locked room.Banka police chief (SP) Arvind Kumar Gupta said a forensic team has picked up samples from the site and will soon provide its preliminary opinion. “We are waiting,” said Gupta, while visiting the site.A case of criminal conspiracy, negligent conduct with respect to explosive substance was registered against unknown persons under sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and under Section-5 of the Explosive Act. Bihar home department has ordered an intensive probe into the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-madrasa-s-roof-collapses-in-a-mysterious-explosion-probe-ordered-101623141283955.html
08-06-2021||Patna||Niti Aayog rankings not a true reflection of Bihar’s transformation: JD-U||Bihar may be lagging behind in the overall ranking of states by Niti Aayog, finalised on the basis of yearly progress in achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs), but it has shown marked improvement in gender equality and abating violence against women, which state ministers credit to 15-years of “good governance” by chief minister Nitish Kumar.“Bihar has left many states far behind when it comes to two important social indices, gender equality and violence against women, which could prove to be a game changer in the years to come. Bihar has fumbled in some areas due to historical injustices. What needs to be noticed is the state’s phenomenal performance in areas defining societal well being,” water resource minister Sanjay Jha, who is also the national general secretary of the ruling Janata Dal-United (JD-U) party, said.Bihar is ranked 28th in the country in violence against women, and reached the national average in gender parity, which is better than 14 states and Union territories. The report has handed the ruling party an opportunity to burnish Nitish Kumar’s developmental credentials at a time when he is perceived to be ‘weak’ after JD-U’s less than impressive performance in the state polls. The chief minister has also been criticised for his handling of the law and order and coronavirus situation, with some voices from within the coalition also questioning his decisions.Bihar’s education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary cited that Bihar scored 91 for sanitation and clean drinking water, eight points more than the national average and said the ranking methodology doesn’t reflect the true picture of “turnaround” despite Bihar’s limited resources.“The comparison should be [done] in terms of pace of development in varied fields within a time period, rather than on the basis of overall development indices, which are dependent on historical and geographical factors,” Choudhary said.He also pointed to yearly improvements in Bihar’s composite score in Niti Aayog’s report since 2018, and said the state has now moved into “performers’ category”, while it is in the “front runners’ category” in five areas.His colleague and water resources minister Sanjay Jha says while Bihar will need to maintain the tempo for decades to catch up with the developed states--which have enjoyed early advantage--but it has achieved all that was possible in a short span. “Bihar’s growth story under chief minister Nitish Kumar’s leadership is before everyone. Women are today in the forefront in Bihar. They are in police, administration, education, panchayats and everywhere else... and their empowerment is reflected in statistics.”“Girls, who were in class 1 when Kumar took over as the Bihar CM in November, 2005, have now, theoretically graduated or moved into jobs. They are the real change-makers,” he added.“For the first time in Bihar, more girls were enrolled than boys in class 9 last year, almost a five-fold increase since 2007-08. It has brought gender parity in school education, thanks to the state government’s bicycle scheme for students opting for higher secondary education,” Jha said.He lists 11-lakh Jeevika groups in the state as the major tool to make women self-reliant and also counts 50% quota for women in panchayats and teaching jobs, 35% quota in government jobs among measures that are now bearing fruit. “Social indices don’t improve overnight, but once they do, other indices also start improving,” he claims.According to Pratham study, the highest jump in girls’ school enrolment was 13%, registered in the 2006-10 period. Jha says Nitish Kumar underlined the need for girls’ education to control [the] state’s burgeoning population at the very onset. Bihar has 14.5% share in the total projected population increase in the country during 2011-36, second only to Uttar Pradesh at 19.2%, as per the population projection for India and states 2011-2036 report of the national commission on population.Nitish Kumar had earlier underlined the link between girl’s education and population control, while speaking in the assembly. “In Bihar, the fertility rate is very high at 3.7%, but it drops significantly with [an] increase in [the] education level of girls. We have found if a mother is matriculate, it drops to two; if a mother is plus two, it goes down to 1.6, less than the national average of 1.7. So, education of girls is the key to solving [the] state’s main issues” Kumar said last year.Social analyst and the former head of department of economics, NK Choudhary said that Bihar will have to work on areas of improvement. “It is a fact that historical and geographical injustices have been there for decades and no Central government addressed it, but that cannot be an excuse anymore,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/jdu-minister-cites-bhar-s-improved-women-welfare-indices-says-change-is-happening-101623138042717.html

"But as patients were witnessing side effects, the government hospital has stopped using the injections for the treatment of the post-COVID complication," he said.According to Dr Dixit, some patients started experiencing side effects when they were administered lyophilised Amphotericin B injections. After this, the hospital administration decided not to give these injections anymore, he said."Lyophilised Amphotericin B injection is very cheap and has been given to patients for years. Around 30 to 70 percent of patients experience side effects when administered the injection, which mainly includes chills, which is not a matter of concern, but still, we have stopped using it. Now we are only giving liposomal Amphotericin B injections to the patients, of which we are getting sufficient quantities."The Madhya Pradesh government had decided to buy 25,000 lyophilised injections from a company based in Himachal Pradesh, out of which 12,000 injections were brought a few days ago by Indore special aircraft.Out of these 12,000 injections, 3,000 injections were given to MGM Medical College while the rest were sent to other districts of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/indore-news/black-fungus-indore-hospital-stops-administering-lyophilised-amphotericin-b-injections-after-complaints-of-side-effects-101623137619911.html

However, the metro services will be available only on weekdays from 7am to 8pm, officials said.The officials said the NMRC is making necessary preparations at all of its stations and on trains as well, so as to ensure that passengers follow social distancing norms and other Covid-19 protocols. The services were suspended on May 1 after the second wave of the pandemic had ravaged the Guatam Budh Nagar district.“As the weekend curfew is still in place, train service will not be operated on weekends,” said Ritu Maheshwari, managing director, NMRC.The officials said that passenger screening teams will be deployed at each station to check the temperature of commuters and to ensure that they follow Covid guidelines such as wearing a mask and maintaining social distance. The parking facility will be available at Sector 51 station only, they said.Maheshwari said that the social distancing norms will be strictly followed on NMRC premises and inside the trains.The NMRC has also tweaked the frequency of trains during peak and non-peak hours. During peak hours (8am to 11am and 5pm to 8pm), the trains will be available at 15 minutes interval (as against 7.30 minutes on normal days) and during non-peak hours the frequency will be 30 minutes (earlier 10 minutes).Notably, on normal days, the train services are available from 6am to 10pm.The NMRC in a statement said it would continue to run fast trains once the service resumes on Wednesday. Of the 21 stations on the Aqua Line, trains during peak hours skip a total of 10 stations which usually have lower ridership. This move is aimed at reducing travel time between Noida and Greater Noida by nine minutes.Meanwhile, NMRC on Monday also issued a fresh tender to hire a developer for the Aqua Line’s extension to Greater Noida West -- 9.6km route from Sector 51 station to Sector 2 in Greater Noida West. VV Reddy, deputy general manager, NMRC, said that the elevated extension will have five metro stations – Sector 122 and Sector 123 in Noida, and Sector 4, Ecotech 12 and Sector 2 in Greater Noida West.“NMRC had issued three tenders earlier, but we did not get suitable applicants.

08-06-2021||Kolkata||Bengal to plant 150 million mangrove saplings to protect from cyclones||The West Bengal government will plant 150 million saplings of mangroves in the state’s three coastal districts as a future protection from cyclones such as Yaas and Amphan that left the coastal areas ravaged in the last 13 months.“We will have to take the help of nature to minimise the effect of natural disasters like cyclones. The forest and environment department will plant 150 million mangrove saplings, 50 million each in three districts – North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas and East Midnapore,” said Mamata Banerjee, the Bengal chief minister.The state planted 50 million mangrove saplings after cyclone Amphan ravaged at least six districts, uprooting and damaging thousands of trees in May last. In Kolkata alone, 5,000 trees were uprooted.“This time we have suffered more damage than last year... as the cyclone coincided with the spring tide the storm surge was much higher. At least 63 villages in 14 blocks are still under water,” she said, adding that river embankments have been breached in at least 317 places.Cyclone Yaas, which hit the Odisha coast on May 26, coincided with the perigean spring tide and the resulting storm surge devastated the three coastal districts in Bengal and the Sunderban delta. Around 5 million people live on the 54 islands of the Sunderban alone.The state government has also formed a 24-member committee headed by Kalyan Rudra, a river expert, to suggest ways to strengthen the river embankments in the Sunderban delta. The committee will also include experts from Calcutta University, Jadavpur University, Kalyani University among other institutes. “We need a master plan,” Banerjeee said.A similar committee formed after cyclone Amphan submitted its report in March this year. It recommended that mangrove plants, if used to form the first line of defence, may help in reducing the impact of the waves that are triggered during cyclones, thus protecting the embankments.“There are certain deep rooted mangrove species such as Rhizophora, Bruguiera and Avicennia which may not only act as a bio-shield, but if planted on the embankments, may also help to bind the soil and make them more robust. These will take at least four to five years to grow up to the right size to protect the embankments,” said HS Debnath, former director of the Indian Botanic Garden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-to-plant-150-million-mangrove-saplings-to-protect-from-cyclones-101623131862267.html

Later these are sold to customers. Earlier, we had busted one such racket,” Banerjee said.In April 2018, police busted a racket near Kolkata for selling cattle carcasses from dumping grounds.

On Monday, the Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) said, “A sharp increase in wind speed is forecasted for the next three days favourable for dispersion. However, at the same time an increase in the long-range transport of dust from the arid regions is likely as the transporting winds are becoming favourable leading to frequent short term hourly spikes in PM10 in the next three days.

The former I-T officer, Nitin Garg, was sentenced to four years in prison and told to pay a fine of ₹3 lakh.He was convicted for committing offences punishable under Sections 7 and 13 (1) (d) read with 13 (2) of the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act, 1988.The case dates back to 2016, when the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI, ACB), Chandigarh, registered an FIR under PC Act, following a complaint by Parshotam Kumar Goyal.Goyal, who trades in TMT Bars, alleged that Garg, the then deputy commissioner of income tax of Sirsa Circle, was demanding ₹2 lakh for not imposing heavy penalties on his proprietorship firm. Following this, a trap was laid, and Garg was arrested from his hometown in Bathinda.In the courtroom, Garg, who was under trial over five years, pleaded that he is not a previous convict and is suffering from a heart ailment.But public prosecutor KP Singh argued that it is the need of the hour to give exemplary punishment to public servants found indulging in corrupt practices.Special judge, CBI, Dr Sushil Kumar Garg said: “Be you ever so high, the law is above you. One lie is enough to question all truths. It is the duty of the court that any anti-corruption law has to be interpreted and worked out in such a fashion so as to strengthen the fight against corruption.”Comparing corruption with cancer, the judge said: “If not detected in time, it is sure to afflict every walk of life, leading to disastrous consequences. Corruption is a plague, which is not only contagious but if not controlled, spreads like fire in the jungle.”Stating that punishment is designed to reform the offender and reclaim him as a law-abiding citizen for the society as a whole, the judge ordered: “Any softness in this regard could produce an undesirable result, namely, encouragement to adoption of corrupt means by public servants, which has indeed to be checked.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2016-corruption-case-cbi-court-awards-4-yr-jail-to-former-i-t-official-101623097358027.html

The second wave is stabilising and we are hopeful that the situation will further improve by the end of this month. We have a total of 566 total beds for Covid patients out of which only 79 are occupied at the moment.

08-06-2021||Chandigarh||HC grants protection to live-in partners aged 20 and 17||The Punjab and Haryana high court granted protection to a live-in couple , despite one of them being a minor, observing that if a couple has decided to be together, it is not for the courts to judge them.The order came on the protection plea from a 17-year-old girl and a 20-year-old boy from Bathinda in Punjab. The order, granting protection to a couple even though the girl was not of marriageable age was passed by the bench of justice Sant Parkash on June 3, and it comes in the backdrop of different benches of the high court giving divergent views on live-in relationships.The court was informed that upon learning about the relationship between the girl and her partner, her parents wanted her to marry a person of their choice, following which the girl left her home to live with her partner. They have decided to live together till the time they are legally allowed to solemnise their marriage, they submitted.“It would be a travesty of justice in case protection is denied to persons who have opted to reside together without the sanctity of marriage,” the bench said it would also be failing in its duty to provide people a right to their life and liberty if it did not intervene.The bench also recorded that it can’t lose sight of honour killings which are prevalent in the region. “It is for the State at this juncture, to ensure their protection and their personal liberty,” the bench said adding that petitioners have not asked the court for permission to marry or to approve their relationship. Both of these would have put the court in a spot as the girl is a minor.Different benches of the high court have given conflicting judgments on live-in relationships while hearing similar cases. On May 11, one of the benches observed that the “entire social fabric of the society will get disturbed” if a plea for protection from a live-in couple was accepted (both man and woman were majors in that case, but very young), while another bench termed live-in relationships “morally and socially not acceptable” while refusing protection. The decision on the second plea was overturned by the Supreme Court on June 4.These judgments were followed by two other benches of the high court ruling the opposite. While a bench on May 18 held that a live-in relationship is not prohibited, another bench observed that such relationships may not be acceptable to all, but could not be termed illegal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-grants-protection-to-live-in-partners-aged-20-and-17-101623096758850.html

The 40-year-old off-spinner said he posted a WhatsApp forward on the 37th anniversary of the operation without realising that the man in the picture was Bhindranwale. “I just wish to clarify and apologise for an Instagram post yesterday. It was a WhatsApp forward that I posted in a haste and without even realising the content used and what it signified and stood for,” he said in an apology note posted on Twitter. “That was my mistake I accept, and at no stage do I subscribe to the views in that post or support the people whose picture were carried. I am a Sikh who will fight for India and not against India. This is my unconditional apology for hurting the sentiments of my nation. In fact any anti-national group against my people, I do not support and never will,” he added. Operation Bluestar was an Army operation which was carried out in 1984 to flush out militants from the Golden Temple in Amritsar. Bhindranwale was the leader of that insurgent movement and was killed along with and several other people during the operation. “I have given my blood and sweat for this country for 20 years and will never ever support anything that is anti-India,” Harbhajan asserted. The veteran has played 103 Tests for India, claiming 417 wickets in them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/harbhajan-apologises-for-insta-post-featuring-bhindranwale-101623096459256.html
08-06-2021||Chandigarh||HC dismisses regularisation plea of Chandigarh MC’s contractual employees||The Punjab and Haryana high court has dismissed a plea from over a dozen contractual employees, who were seeking regularisation of their services with the Chandigarh municipal corporation.The plea filed by Shinu Gupta and others had demanded that the UT administration be directed to frame a policy for regularisation of the contractual employees. The petitioners also demanded that the recruitment process for 41 additional posts be scrapped and they be appointed instead since they had been working for 13-15 years now.It was also demanded a policy to regularise contractual employees who were working against sanctioned posts for a period of more than 10 years be framed. The court was also told that at one stage, the MC had considered framing a policy of its own on the issue of regularisation.The bench of justice Anil Kshetarpal said that from the plea it was not clear whether the petitioners were ever appointed after inviting the applications and after giving opportunity to others to apply. It also took note of the 2006 apex court judgment wherein it was said that directions on regularisation of services of temporary employees/daily wagers should not be ordinarily issued.As of MC’s proposal for a policy on regularisation, the court said it had neither been adopted nor approved and the Chandigarh administration had not granted permission to the MC to notify such a policy.To the argument that the petitioners were now being sought to be replaced by another set of temporary employees, which wasn’t permitted, the court observed that the March 2021 notice for recruitment of eligible candidates gives indication that the posts are likely to be regularised.“Thus, the eligible candidates will have the opportunity to apply and compete, which is in accordance with the requirement of the Constitution of India,” said the court while dismissing the plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-dismisses-regularisation-plea-of-chandigarh-mc-s-contractual-employees-101623096157751.html
08-06-2021||Chandigarh||Virus curve flattening in Haryana, second wave thinning out||The coronavirus growth curve in Haryana which started to decline four weeks ago is flattening, conclusively indicating the culmination of the second wave. Tracking the trajectory of the virus which went through the roof in the first week of May, recording more than one lakh infections in a week, a health department analysis showed that there was a 93% decrease in the number of cases. As against 1.01 lakh cases reported between May 3 and 9 which was the peak of the viral spread, only 6,902 infections were reported from the state last week (May 31-June 6).Additional Chief Secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora said that second wave of the virus spread was on a steep decline. Statistics showed that the number of cases started to decline in the second week of May when the weekly number came down to 78,350 cases, dipped to 43,601 in the third week and 17,361 in the fourth week. The number of active cases as on Monday was about 8,000 while 7,425 patients were kept in home isolation (as on June 5). Correspondingly, the number of deaths, which also hit a peak in the first week of May with 1,119 fatalities, came down to 491 in the last week of May. Statistics show that about 39% of the total deaths due to the viral infection have been from rural areas of the state. About 50% of the casualties have been from the 55-74 age group and 37% of the dead patients were women. “In fact, 57% of those who succumbed to the virus were senior citizens, above 60 years,’’ said an official.Statistics showed that 16 districts continued to have cumulative positivity rate of more than 6%. However, if one takes into consideration the positivity rate of last week, then 13 districts have positivity rate of less than 6%. “This is due to the sharp drop in the infection rate,” said an official. Health officials said that during the screening of rural population under the Haryana Villagers General Health Check-up Scheme, 3,465 positive cases have been detected in the last 22 days with a cumulative positivity rate of 2.83%. Officials said 34.61 lakh households in rural, per urban and high-risk areas were screened by teams in which 1.70 crore population was screened for presence of influenza-like illness (ILI). Out of these, 1.21 lakh people with ILI were tested for rapid antigen test (RAT). About 325 patients were treated through village isolation centres and most of them improved to go back home safely. At present, no patient is admitted at these centres, as per an analysis. However, the rural screening and testing data is disputed by politicians across the spectrum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/virus-curve-flattening-in-haryana-second-wave-thinning-out-101623096037830.html

In an order issued by the commissioner secretary to the government MK Dwivedi, the task forces have been sanctioned in all 20 districts. “Sanction is hereby accorded to constitution of district level task forces comprising district magistrate, chief medical officer, additional superintendent of police, district social welfare officer, district child protection officer, chairperson of child welfare committee or any member of the committee, and an NGO running a child care institution nominated by the district magistrate, in each district, for providing care and protection to children infected by Covid as well as children of Covid infected parents in the Jammu and Kashmir,” read the order. The task force will compile details of all adults who have died due to Covid complications and ascertain whether any children had been orphaned and were in need of government protection. Such children will be presented before the child welfare committee, which will decide on a plan for their rehabilitation such as adoption, foster care, or sponsorship and institutionalisation as the last resort as per the provisions of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. Children whose parents are undergoing Covid treatment and are left without relative(s), or guardian(s) to take necessary care can be placed in temporary shelters. The children will also be provided counselling. The task force will also ensure timely referral of children infected with Covid to treatment centers besides ensuring their nutritional support during post-treatment period. It will also identify and design one registered child care institution in each district and make arrangements for such institutions as Covid care centres, exclusively for children. “It is further ordered that the district level task force will meet every week and as and when required for providing intervention programmes for care and protection of these children. The district collector will be responsible for convening the meeting of the task force and will submit a status report once a fortnight,” said Dwivedi in his order. UT social welfare secretary Sheetal Nanda said, “We are in the process of collecting data of Saksham scheme beneficiaries and intend to be ready with it by June 20. Over 400 children have either lost a parent or both parents to the infection so far in J&K. After verification, we need to open their bank accounts. They will be joint accounts of the minor with a major guardian. Besides, we need details such as where they are studying.” The divisional commissioners in Kashmir and Jammu and all district heads have been given the June 20 deadline after which the process of sanctioning relief will begin. The J&K government has already constituted a five-member panel for hand-holding families of Covid victims. Apart from financial assistance of ₹1,000 a month to such families, the government has approved scholarship to their children. Under the scheme, the surviving spouse and the eldest surviving member of the affected families will receive a special monthly pension of ₹1,000 through direct bank transfer (DBT), provided they are not otherwise receiving any pension under other schemes. The scheme will provide special scholarships to children who lost their earning parent(s), sibling(s), guardian(s) to Covid. The special scholarship of ₹20,000 and ₹40,000 will be paid annually through DBT to children studying up to Class 12 and those pursuing higher education, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jk-to-form-district-level-task-force-to-look-after-covid-affected-infected-kids-101623095977824.html

The Centre’s experiments have failed and further messed up the situation.” The Congress leaders also expressed concern over stalled projects in the UT. “When the state was bifurcated, the Centre had promised development but it is nowhere to be found. Even the money allocated to the Union Territory in the budget is nowhere to be found,” Mir said. “They (the government) are trying to portray that things are moving at a fast pace by blacktopping a few roads. However, nothing is happing on the ground. Many major projects initiated by the previous government have been inexplicably stalled.” Even the elected district development council members are unhappy. “J&K has not seen anything good in the last two years. The region is rife with rumors as people do not trust anybody and have lost faith in the government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jkcong-wants-statehood-polls-101623095559332.html

Two activists, Ravi Azad and Vikas Sisar, who were booked by the police for gheraoing Jannayak Janata Party MLA Devinder Babli’ house, were released on bail on Sunday night. A third activist Makhan Singh, who was booked for attacking the MLA’s cavalcade, is yet to be released, activist Yogendra Yadav tweeted on Monday evening.Following the release of Azad and Sisar, Samyukta Kisan Morcha leader Rakesh Tikait had called off the programme to gherao all police stations in the state.

In a joint statement, Samyukta Kisan Morcha leaders said, “Two protesters have been released and the administration has assured to withdraw the FIRs against them. The MLA’s staff members, who are complainants in two cases, have given a written request to the police to withdraw the cases.”After calling off the protest at Tohana, BKU leader Tikait asked farmers to start marching towards Delhi borders to press for the scrapping of the three farm laws. “The battle will be fought at Delhi’s borders and dharnas at all toll plazas will continue,” he added.‘Only party programmes, political events to be disrupted’Speaking with reporters, Punjab farmer leader Joginder Singh Ugrahan said the Samyukta Kisan Morcha has decided that they will protest against Bharatiya Janata Party-Jannayak Janta Party leaders only at government and political events.

If it is 6.5 degrees above normal or is over 47°C, a severe heat wave is declared. While there was no heat wave in 2020, it was observed in the city on June 10, 2019, when the day temperature had shot up to 44.1°C.On why the city had escaped the heat wave so far this year, IMD Chandigarh director AK Singh said, “There have been around 10 western disturbances this year that is higher than normal. They also arrived in quick succession, not allowing the temperature to rise. The two cyclones in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea also had an impact on the weather in this region.”“After the recent spells of rain, dry weather is likely for the next few days. While the maximum temperature is likely to cross 40°C again, it may not go high enough for heat wave conditions to be declared. A couple of more rain spells are expected before monsoon arrives in the city around the end of June,” said Shivinder Singh, scientist, IMD. But it was not yet clear how much of an impact cleaner air in the past month had on the weather, AK Singh said. “When the ground gets heated, particles of pollutants also get heated, so lower pollution levels lead to lower temperatures. A study is needed to establish the extent of the impact,” he added.As the skies remained clear on Monday, the day temperature rose from 37.3°C on Sunday to 38°C on Monday, one notch below normal. The night temperature also increased from 24.4°C to 26.2°C, which was two degrees above normal. Over the next three days, the maximum temperature is expected to rise to 41°C, while the minimum temperature will remain between 27°C and 29°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/western-disturbances-to-keep-heat-wave-at-bay-in-chandigarh-101623095497749.html

The flames at Gold Pet Shop were first noticed around 2.30am by a driver, who informed the staff of a nearby hotel. The staff sounded the shop owner, Sandeep Kumar, who was in Dehradun. Sandeep further alerted the fire brigade and his cousin who rushed to the scene. By the time, fire trucks reached the spot around 3.30am, the entire shop was gutted and the pets housed in it were dead. Sandeep said around 2,000 fish, 35 cockatiel parrots, four white pigeons and a rabbit were killed in the blaze.“A short-circuit caused the fire. When the shutter was opened electricity sparks were noticed,” said Sandeep, who reached the shop from Dehradun on Monday morning. Running the pet shop for the last 13 years, Sandeep said due to the weekend lockdown, he had taken most of the birds back home, so they were saved. A few fish were also rescued with the help of water drums. Apart from the animals lost, Sandeep said he suffered a loss of around ₹14 lakh due to damage to the stored kennels, bird cages, fish aquariums, animal food and other articles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2000-fish-39-birds-perish-in-fire-at-zirakpur-pet-shop-101623095317741.html
08-06-2021||Chandigarh||If full-fledged Amarnath yatra not possible, allow restricted pilgrimage: J&K BJP president||With coronavirus casting a shadow on the upcoming annual Amarnath yatra, Jammu and Kashmir BJP president Ravinder Raina on Monday said a restricted pilgrimage should be facilitated if the prevailing Covid situation does not allow a full-fledged yatra. He also said that killing of innocents by Pakistan-sponsored terrorists would not be tolerated and all out efforts are on to wipe out militancy from the union territory. The 56-day pilgrimage to the 3,880-metre-high holy cave shrine of Amarnath in south Kashmir Himalayas, housing the naturally formed ice-Shivling, is scheduled to start from the twin routes of Pahalgam and Baltal on June 28 and culminate on August 22. “Shiv devotees from across the globe visit Amarnath every year for ‘darshan’ (glimpse) during June and July in Kashmir. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, big religious gatherings are not happening in any part of the world so at least a restricted yatra should be facilitated,” Raina told reporters after a high-level meeting of senior party leaders at BJP headquarters here. He said if a full-fledged yatra is not possible due to the Covid situation, the prayers should be organized at the cave shrine. Asked if he favours a 15-days yatra, he said at least a limited number of Jammu and Kashmir residents should be allowed. “The strategy should be chalked out keeping in mind the prevailing difficult phase of the coronaviurs. We have talked to the Lt Governor (Manoj Sinha) on the issue in the past and will meet him again on the matter.” He said the party meeting discussed in detail the prevailing security, political and pandemic situation besides the recent killing of party leader Rakesh Pandita and the security concerns of sarpanches, panches, block Development Council and District Development Council members. Pandita, BJP’s Municipal Chairman of Tral, was killed by terrorists in his home town in Pulwama district on Wednesday. “All the discussed issues will be brought to the notice of the Lt governor in coming days. Our effort is to end Pakistan-sponsored terrorism and separatism. The repeated killing of innocents cannot be tolerated,” he said. Raina said he had raised these issues with Union Home Minister Amit Shah in the past and will continue to raise these issues with him as well as the Lt Governor. Asked about reports that additional forces have been deployed in the valley, the BJP leader said “deployment of forces is a national security matter and the discussion over it should be avoided.” However, he said there is “operation all out” going on against terrorists with full vigour and deployment is made where they have hideouts to flush them out. On BJP’s stand over Assembly elections, Raina said the party is fully prepared for the polls whenever the Election Commission takes a decision. “The delimitation commission has been constituted for J&K and due to the coronavirus outbreak it was not able to visit here. The commission is expected to visit J&K soon to define the territories of the assembly and parliamentary seats. After that the election commission will take a decision about the assembly elections and as a political party we will welcome the decision,” he said. Playing down reports on social media suggesting some big decision is in offing for J&K, he said “we do not have any information... Our priority at the moment is to break the chain of the coronavirus, maintain security and reach out to the people who are in need of assistance.” Asked about a meeting between Home Minister and Lt Governor which was also attended by security, civil and police officers in Delhi, he said “Lt Governor is visiting Delhi regularly and holding meetings there. There are issues of development, security and also reports of ceasefire violations so the talks between the two sides are nothing new.” About the ongoing protests against opening of wine shops in residential localities in different parts of Jammu after the implementation of new excise policy, he said “these shops will be closed”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/if-full-fledged-amarnath-yatra-not-possible-allow-restricted-pilgrimage-j-k-bjp-president-101623095197734.html

08-06-2021||Delhi||Covid-19 cases below 300 for 1st time since March 4, positivity rate now 0.36%||The number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in Delhi reduced further on Monday, dipping below the 300-mark for the first time since March 4. The Capital reported 231 new cases of the viral infection, showed Monday’s health bulletin.With over 63,000 tests, the test positivity rate — proportion of samples that return positive — also fell further to 0.36%. The positivity rate in the city has stayed below 1% for eight days in a row, after the city saw its fourth and worst surge of cases between April and May.The city has added an average of 462 new cases each day over the past week.The test positivity rate is a vital metric to understand the spread of an infection in any region. The World Health Organization recommends a positivity rate below 5% before an infection can be considered under control in a region. In Delhi, the positivity rate has been below this number for 18 days now.At the peak of the surge, Delhi recorded over 28,000 new cases in a day and a positivity rate of over 36%.The number of deaths has also reduced with the daily toll below 100 for five days in a row now. Fewer than 50 deaths were reported for the last two days, with 36 more fatalities reported in Monday’s bulletin. At the height of the fourth wave, 448 succumbed to Covid-19 on a single day (May 3).“It is highly unlikely that there will be a third wave unless the virus mutates. Hence, there is a need for the government to keep a close eye on the virus in circulation to pick up any mutations of concern quickly. In addition, the respite between the second and third surge in cases must be utilised for preparing for the next wave by creating permanent infrastructure and vaccinating the population,” said Dr Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College – Vellore.Dr John also said that governments should study the immune response generated if mixed doses of vaccines are used, if a half dose-full dose or a full dose-half dose regimen is used like it was mistakenly done in the global trial for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-cases-below-300-for-1st-time-since-march-4-positivity-rate-now-036-101623094119305.html

08-06-2021||Chandigarh||World Food Safety Day: PAU experts express concern over rising inflation||As Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan emphasised on ensuring food security through his Tweet on the World Food Safety Day, economists at Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) expressed concern over the rising prices of essential commodities that have gravely impacted the food security and economic prosperity of the common man battling the pandemic.The experts said economic downturn, job losses and rise in the prices of essential commodities have caused a grave impact on food safety and security. PAU V-C Dr Baldev Singh Dhillon said a contentious clause of the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act which allows hoarding is also a factor leading to the price rise.He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s move to offer free ration to the poor is an encouraging step, but the government needs to control the prices of essential commodities and make them affordable for the common man.“The rise in mustard oil prices is a classic example. The drop in import has encouraged hoarding and resulted in the increase in the prices of mustard oil, which touched ₹170 to ₹180 per litre and saw a jump of ₹30 since March. The prices of petrol and diesel have increased 21 times since May 4 and the rise in cooking gas prices has adversely affected household expenses,” said Dr Dhillon, adding that the rising prices of essential commodities is against sustainable development goals.Dr Kamal Vatta, head of PAU’s department of economics, said the wholesale inflation was 10.5% in April 2021, the highest-ever recorded.“We have to look at it from a larger perspective. While people have lost their jobs, the prices of essential commodities have increased. So a person who is not earning or suffering a pay cut is also spending more to buy basic ration items. And for cooking them, he/she is ending up paying more as the domestic cooking gas prices have increased.” said Dr Vatta.Dr Sukhpal Singh, professor of economics at PAU, said the declining income of people will negatively affect the demand and business volume in the economy. The prevalence of monopoly markets known as the worst situations of the market will exploit the producers as well as consumers.However, Shruti Bhogal, an economist and researcher, said a large proportion of our population is classified under poor and lower middle-income category. “These strata have high propensity to consume, which means they spend a significant proportion of their income on consumption expenditure with a meagre or no savings. A slight increase in prices without a proportionate rise in income exerts an unendurable burden on socio-economic well-being of our masses,” she added. She said any policy action that is intended towards development would strongly address the issue of inflation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/world-food-safety-day-pau-experts-express-concern-over-rising-inflation-101623094118976.html
08-06-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana city buses remain off road amid cap on occupancy, restrictions||Even as the administration is gradually easing the restrictions in the district, 50% cap on occupancy and evening curfew is keeping city buses off the road. Citing losses, staffers of the contractor operating the buses in the city said that the service cannot be resumed until restriction on seating capacity are removed. The service was halted on May 7 and this is forcing residents to shell out ₹20 for a short journey in an auto-rickshaw for which ₹5 to 10 would be charged by city buses.Residents demand that the service is restarted at the earliest. Earlier, city buses used to ferry around 3,500 passengers daily on three routes — Sahnewal to Clock Tower, bus stand to Meharban and bus stand to Kohara.Gurdeep Singh, a resident of Meharban, said, “City buses charge ₹5 for a 5km journey while auto-rickshaw drivers charge ₹20 even for covering 2km. The authorities should restart the service at the earliest to bring some relief to the public, especially at a time when many people are going through a financial crisis.”Further, residents demand that the service should be started on other routes as well. Sonu, a resident of Jawahar Nagar camp, said, “The service should also be started in the internal areas of the city, as this will end the monopoly of auto-rickshaw drivers. Apart from benefitting residents financially, it will also bring relief from traffic congestion and help in reducing the pollution created by auto rickshaws.”As per municipal corporation (MC) officials, 120 buses were bought under the project, out of which 83 have been handed over the contractor. Out of these 83, only around 35 are citing losses.MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said that he will seek a report from the officials concerned and a notice will also be issued to the contractor to restart the service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-city-buses-remain-off-road-amid-cap-on-occupancy-restrictions-101623094117762.html

Four such incidents have been reported in the past 15 days, where the role of jailed accused came to the fore. In case of recent violent clashes, it was learnt that suspected gangsters Puneet Bains and Shubham Arora were possessing mobile phones, through which they stage-managed the attacks.The latest incident of booze and hookah party inside the prison by local gangster Manwinder Singh alias Nikka Jattana and his accomplices spoke volumes about security arrangements inside the central jail. The inmates not only sourced liquor and hookah from outside, but also recorded videos and posted them on social networking sites. A probe has already been marked in the case.On June 3, Division Number 2 police had booked a jailed accused for threatening a rape victim and her husband over phone to withdraw her complaint which she had filed against him in May 2020. The accused said if she did not withdraw the complaint, he would kill her husband and children. On May 21, Khanna police had arrested a person for supplying weapons to criminals and different gangs. The police had recovered 11 illegal pistols and three bullets from his possession. Aditya Kapoor alias Makkhan of Amritsar, who is a habitual offender, used to smuggle illegal weapons inside Kapurthala jail using a mobile phone. Later, the police brought him on a production warrant.Ludhiana Central Jail superintendent Balkar Singh said they had been conducting regular checks inside the prison. “We have recovered many mobile phones from the inmates,” he added. Criminal history of gangstersGangsters Puneet Bains and Shubham Arora had been indulging in gang wars since October 2019 when shots were fired at an eatery in Transport Nagar following an argument.In February 2020, Arora, along with his accomplices, had assaulted Bains. The Moti Nagar police had registered an FIR against Youth Congress leader Ankit Pandit, district Youth Congress (central) president Shubham Arora, Rishav, Sam Oberoi, Sandeep and seven others. After the assault, the accused had surrendered before the police.On June 8, 2020, the Division Number 3 police had registered an attempt to murder case against Bains and his accomplices for opening fire outside the house of Rishav Banipal in Dharmpura. Bains was arrested from Delhi in a joint operation by a team of the Ludhiana counter intelligence and organised crime control unit on September 13, 2020. The police had recovered two .32 bore pistols, a magazine, five live bullets, and a .9mm pistol from his possession. The police have now decided to bring both gangsters on a production warrant from jail for questioning in five cases of violent clashes that occurred between members of both gangs in the past three days.

08-06-2021||Chandigarh||Now, life detectors to help Ludhiana firemen trace victims trapped under debris||With the Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) finally initiating the process to upgrade the fire brigade, the firefighters have been equipped with life detectors which will help them in locating the victims trapped in case of a building collapse. Three life detectors worth about ₹50 lakh have been provided to the fire department under the Smart City Mission. Now, the staff is being trained to use the equipment, which includes motion and sound sensors, besides a microphone. As per the firemen, the detectors include five sensors which are attached to a monitor. In case a building collapses, the sensors will be placed at different points to check any movement of those trapped, which is extremely crucial at the initial stage of rescue operation.Fire station officer Jaswinder Singh said, “The sensors can even detect breathing vibrations and the sound produced by movement of fingers on any surface. The system also includes a small microphone, which can be lowered in a void space using cables to hear the voices of trapped persons.”He said that firefighters are first to respond to any building collapse before SDRF or NDRF teams are roped in. “Currently, we locate the victims only by listening to their calls for help. These detectors will prove beneficial in saving lives of those trapped in a short time period,” he added. The city has witnessed two major building collapses in the last four years wherein 21 civilians and firefighters have lost their lives. While 16 people, including nine firemen, were killed in Sufiiyan Chowk mishap in 2017, five lives were lost after the roof of a building caved in while the owner was lifting the lintel illegally in Daba area in April this year. Initially proposed in 2017, the project to upgrade the fire brigade is moving at snail’s pace and the firefighters do not even have safety suits and masks. Under a Smart City project worth ₹28 crore, the department is working to buy hydraulic platform, water bowser, fire safety suits, multiple gas detectors, victim location camera with breaching system, portable fire pump, and communication system at fire stations among other equipment. 4 mini-fire tenders also added to inventoryChief executive officer of Ludhiana Smart City Limited, Pardeep Sabharwal, said, “We have also received four mini-fire tenders to douse flames reported in narrow streets of old city areas. The department is working on the registration of these tenders following which these will be handed over to the fire brigade.”Firemen said that the mini-fire tender will help in reducing the response time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/now-life-detectors-to-help-ludhiana-firemen-trace-victims-trapped-under-debris-101623093998865.html

A case under the provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act was registered at Kala Amb police station by the Himachal Pradesh police and investigation pertaining to the manufacturers is in progress,” said Alphonse.He said the painkiller was seized at a police picket in Kashmere Gate on June 2 from a hired car, and three people were arrested.

08-06-2021||Mumbai||MVA parties call PM’s move “course correction”, “effort to improve image”||Nawab Malik, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) minister and party’s chief spokesperson, said that Prime Minister’s decision on providing free vaccine was taken to improve the image of the government which was dented after the Supreme Court raised questions on the Centre’s vaccination policy. “The SC had also questioned why the rates of vaccines are different for the states and the Centre. The Apex court had also asked the Union government to submit an affidavit asking why it was not spending money despite a provision of ₹35,000 crore,” said Malik. “As the SC had pointed fingers at the decision of the Union government, the PM made an announcement of taking complete responsibility for supplying vaccines to improve the failure and image of the government. We will add that this constant flip-flop over the vaccination is not good. Now, we hope that states will get the vaccine supply as per demand,” he added.South Mumbai MP and Shiv Sena chief spokesperson Arvind Sawant called the decision an unhealthy flip-flop. “They keep changing the decision every other month. Neither are they (Centre) working, nor are they allowing states to work. Regardless, we welcome the decision of free vaccination for all. Maharashtra government had already announced that it would provide free vaccines to all. Besides that, their supply will come only when they get adequate quantity,” Sawant said.Sena spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi called the move “course correction”. “This course correction came after all the state governments exposed the lies of not taking responsibility at a time when Indian Epidemic Act, Disaster Management Act, Essential Commodities Act, which give the Centre overriding power over the state despite health being a state subject. Also, this course correction happened after the Supreme Court called it arbitrary and also questioned them why the ₹35,000 crore was not used for procurement of vaccines,” she said.Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said, “The Narendra Modi government has been playing with the lives of the people for the past seven years. We witnessed similar flip-flops with the vaccination drive because the Centre could not keep its promises given to the people.” Vishwas Pathak, BJP’s media cell chief, said, “Modi government had been following WHO guidelines while ascertaining priority groups for vaccination. It would have rolled it out for the age group of 18-44 years, but state governments and especially Maharashtra government demanded for decentralisation of the powers. Now, once the Centre felt that the states are not able to do it, it has again taken up the responsibility of that age group too to ensure vaccination of all by year-end.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mva-parties-call-pm-s-move-course-correction-effort-to-improve-image-101623093516986.html
08-06-2021||City||'Change must take place...': Madras HC interim order on LGBTQIA community||Madras high court Justice Anand Venkatesh on Monday issued a slew of guidelines for the LGBTQIA community’s safety, prevention of harassment by authorities and destigmatisation in a society, in an interim order passed in the case of a lesbian couple who had sought protection.The Justice observed that, unlike other cases, this case gave the court an opportunity and responsibility to weigh in on inclusiveness, justice against discrimination, social understanding of morality and traditions. “The society and my upbringing have always treated the terms “homosexual”, “gay”, “lesbian” as anathema,” the Justice said, adding that he has no hesitation in accepting that he belongs to the majority of commoners who are yet to comprehend homosexuality.“Ignorance is no justification for normalizing any form of discrimination,” the Justice said. "...the actual problem is not the fact that the law does not recognise a relationship but that the sanction that is accorded by the society is not available. It is only for this reason, I strongly feel that the change must take place at a societal level and when it is complemented by a law there will be a remarkable change in the outlook of the society by recognising same-sex relationships,” he said.Justice Venkatesh had voluntarily undergone psycho-educative sessions with a clinical psychologist to better understand the LGBTQIA community as he aimed to deliver his judgement.In a judgement that goes on for 107 pages, the court delved into how the interaction with the petitioners of the case and psychologist helped him in his judgement.Sensitising stakeholdersIn its judgement, the court has prohibited attempts to "cure" or change the sexual orientation of LGBTIQA+ people to heterosexual or the gender identity of transgender people to cisgender. Failing which, action will be taken against professionals and licenses will be withdrawn. Mental health camps and awareness programs are to be conducted to understand gender, sexuality, sexual orientation and promote acceptance of diversity, the court said. This is among the suggestions indicated by the court to create awareness by ensuring that all stakeholders, such as police, judiciary, educational institutions, parents and health workers, are sensitised.Under this, police and prison authorities are to be sensitised about the Offences and Penalties as stipulated under Chapter VIII of The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 and compliance with Rule, 2020. NGOs with community support are to put forth first-hand problems faced in the hands of law enforcement agencies and to ensure that transgender and gender-nonconforming prisoners are housed separately from cis-men prisoners to eliminate chances of sexual assault by the latter on the former. The court also suggested programs for judicial officers at all levels to ensure non-discrimination.Educational institutions have been asked to ensure supportive families. Schools and colleges have been asked to make gender-neutral restrooms available, include ‘transgender’ in addition to M and F gender columns and change of name and gender on academic records for transgender persons.Directions for state and union departmentsIn its interim directions, the court called for Union and state governments to work towards removing prejudices and channelling the community into the mainstream. The directions include asking the police to close complaints without harassing trans persons if they receive ‘missing complaints’ of a girl/woman/man when it is found that these are consenting adults who belong to the LGBTQIA community.The court has asked the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment to publish a list of NGOs, along with their contact details, who have expertise in handling the issues faced by the LGBTQIA+ community. The NGOs and the concerned ministry can address problems, such as counselling, monetary support, legal assistance with the support of the District Legal Services Authority, or coordinate with law enforcement agencies about offences committed against any persons belonging to the LGBTQIA+ community. The ministry is also directed to make infrastructure arrangements in existing accommodation facilities for trans persons within 12 weeks of this order.The case pertains to a lesbian couple who fled their hometown in Madurai and are living in Chennai with the help of an NGO. Their parents had opposed the relationship and had filed a missing complaint against them with the police. Having been interrogated by the police, they approached the court for protection.Previously the couple and their parents had also gone through counselling on the direction of the court. The case has been posted for July 31 for passing further orders when reports are expected to be submitted on measures taken to implement the interim directions by the state’s advocate general, the state public prosecutor representing the police and the Union’s government’s additional solicitor general, all state and central government departments and institutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/change-must-take-place-madras-hc-interim-order-on-lgbtqia-community-101623093214703.html

Responding to queries on various social media platforms, state minister for medical education Amit Deshmukh said the apex medical body has advocated the need for offline exams. “The National Medical Commission (NMC) has not given permission for online exams, and therefore, we have no choice but to conduct exams in offline mode,” tweeted Deshmukh. On June 5, HC was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by HERD Educational and Medical Research Foundation, a Nagpur-based NGO (non-governmental organisation) and a physiotherapy student, Nitesh Dhanraj Tantarpale, requesting online examinations or vaccination for nearly 40,000 undergraduates before the semester exams, spreading across 20 days at 173 centres in Maharashtra, starts on June 10. Refusing to give interim relief from the upcoming winter session exams, the court directed the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) to issue an advisory to the principals of medical colleges across the state and also to publish on its website that examinees should have themselves tested for Covid-19 and produce a negative report along with the hall ticket on Day 1 of the exams. Students have again taken to social media, sharing their concerns over offline exams. “There’s no clarity on what happens if a student contracts the virus after the exam commences, or if a negative RT-PCR test report is needed before every exam. We are still awaiting clear instructions from MUHS,” said one of the aspirants. While concerns have been raised about getting RT-PCR test results in time for students from rural Maharashtra, experts said with the Covid-19 cases dipping across districts, getting the reports will not be problem for any candidate. “RT-PCR test, if negative, can be procured in less than 24 hours anywhere in the state at present. However, if students are worried about not being able to get reports in time, we suggest they get to the cities where their colleges are located, and get tests done closer to the exam venues,” said an official from a private Pune-based medical institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/apex-body-wants-medical-dental-exams-to-be-held-offline-maharashtra-minister-to-students-101623093338186.html
08-06-2021||Chandigarh||Almost equal men, women vaccinated in Himachal||Though the inoculation drive in Himachal Pradesh has hit a roadblock due to shortage of vaccines, roughly the same number of men and women have received the jab, indicating that there is little gender bias in vaccination trends in the hill state. As per data available on the Covid portal, of the 25, 24 493 jabs administered in the state, men were the recipient of 10,49,178 doses and women received 10,40736 shots. A district-wise breakdown reveals that more women had been inoculated than men in four of the state’s 12 districts, while the figures were equal in two districts. In Mandi and Hamirpur districts, the ratio of shots received by men and women was 47:53, which means more women received the jabs in the districts. Kangra, the most populous district, and Bilaspur logged a ratio of 49:51, while Chamba and Una district have vaccinated both genders equally. In the remaining six districts, more men received the vaccination than women. At 58:42, Sirmaur district has the most skewed ratio, followed by Shimla at 53:47. In May, the state government had received 4,77,080 doses of Covishield from the Centre. So far, 19,23,289 doses have been administered to eligible beneficiaries of all age groups. “Most people above the age of 44 have been vaccinated. We are trying to determine why the drive has slowed down. Right now, we have around 4 lakh doses for those above the age of 44,” said Gopal Berry, deputy director, health, who is also the nodal officer for the state’s vaccination drive. The state government has written to the central government seeking vaccines for the ‘18 plus’ bracket. Health department officials say the vaccine will be made available for the group after June 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/almost-equal-men-women-vaccinated-in-himachal-101623093277785.html
08-06-2021||Other||NCB appeals against court order to weigh seized LSD without blot paper||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday heard an appeal filed by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) against the special NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act) court order which had directed the retesting of drug samples seized from alleged drug peddler Anuj Keshwani. As per the special court order, the forensic science laboratory (FSL) was asked to reweigh the LSD allegedly recovered from Keshwani. NCB had arrested Keshwani last year while probing the drug angle in actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case. The single-judge bench of justice AS Gadkari, while hearing NCB’s appeal, was informed by advocate Shriram Shirsat that the April 30 order of the special NDPS court directed the agency to send a sample of the drug to FSL Gandhinagar, Gujarat, to assess the weight of LSD without the blot paper and whether the weight of 0.62 grams (g) of the contraband recovered from Keshwani included the weight of paper. The agency sought the setting aside of the order and pending hearing of the appeal, a stay on the direction to send samples to Gandhinagar FSL. During the hearing of a plea by Keshwani, NCB had submitted to the special court that as per the chemical analyser (CA) report, a total 585g of charas, 270.12g of ganja, 3.6g of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and 0.62g of LSD were seized from Keshwani. However, Keshwani’s lawyers had argued that the 0.62g LSD also included the weight of the blot paper, and as the NDPS Act permitted 0.1 grams as commercial quantity for LSD, they sought weight of the 31 blot papers used. Based on this, the special court had issued directions for samples to be sent to FSL. In its appeal, NCB stated that the weight of the paper should also be considered while ascertaining whether the quantity of LSD was commercial or not, as narcotics included mixtures and preparations, as per law. Advocates Taraq Sayed and Gayatri Gokhale for Keshwani submitted that reweighing of drugs as per the special court directions would not prejudice NCB’s probe. Hence, the report by FSL on reweighing the contraband could be considered.As additional solicitor general Anil Singh for NCB was unavailable to make submissions on the question of law pertaining to the weight of the contraband, Shirsat sought adjournment of the hearing of the appeal. After hearing the initial submissions, HC asked the lawyers to provide past judgments which dealt with the question whether the weight of the paper could be included in the weight of the seized LSD under NDPS Act, and posted hearing of the appeal to Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ncb-appeals-against-court-order-to-weigh-seized-lsd-without-blot-paper-101623093217016.html

Most retailers dealing in non-essential items did open their shops, followed by gymnasiums and salons. Public transport, barring trains, witnessed an increase in the number of passengers. Under the state government’s “Break-The-Chain” order for Mumbai, buses are allowed to operate with no standing passengers. A total of 3,344 BEST services were operated on Monday. BEST saw at least 20% more passengers on Monday. “The exact increase in passengers will be known only on Tuesday. However, there has been a significant increase in passengers (20%). People were also seen forming queues outside bus stops.” said a senior BEST official. No standing passengers are allowed to travel in BEST buses.Autorickshaws and taxis also witnessed an increase in passengers, however, few autorickshaw and taxi drivers were confused in regards to the number of passengers allowed to travel. Most private establishments asked their employees to continue working on a work-from-home basis. Archie Vora, a digital marketer, said, “Only 50% staff can work till 4pm as per the fresh guidelines. It makes no sense to go to the office and leave after 4pm, especially since there are no local trains. Hence, our office has asked us to work from home till further notice to ensure manpower can be fully used.” In case of restaurants, only 20%, according to officials, opened their shutters. The government has mandated that restaurants should operate at 50% of its capacity and till 4pm only. “Majority of the restaurants have their main businesses running only after 7pm and hence saw no point in opening them as they will need to shut by 4pm. In addition, many did not open as they did not have enough staff,” said Shivanand Shetty, president, Indian Hotels and Restaurant Association (AHAR), Meanwhile, salons across the city saw brisk business even as many owners insisted on prior appointments rather than walk-ins. They are mandated to operate at 50% capacity and close at 4pm. Gymnasium owners across the city are fuming owing to the restrictions imposed by the state over not allowing the use of air conditioners (AC). Rohan Salian, a gym trainer, said, “Not using AC in a gym is difficult, considering many gyms are not well ventilated. Also, there are no restrictions on restaurants over the usage of AC, so why on gyms?”(Inputs from Mehul R Thakkar, Naresh Kamath and Aroosa Ahmed)`||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/on-day-1-mumbai-s-restaurants-start-slow-best-buses-full-101623092976903.html
08-06-2021||Other||Fourth sero survey in Mumbai’s wards with fewer Covid-19 cases||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is gearing up to conduct the fourth serological survey at four civic wards in the city that have seen fewer Covid-19 cases since the outbreak of the pandemic last year. For the survey, blood samples of only those who have not been vaccinated will be collected from both civic body and private laboratories. Serological survey examines how many people in a population have been infected with Covid-19 and recovered from it. It is undertaken to gauge the prevalence of the virus in a particular area. The blood serum of a group of individuals is tested using an antibody test, also known as a serology test. Anticipating a third wave post-August, the civic body’s decision to conduct a fourth sero survey stems from their need to understand the prevalence of Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, among residents in these wards that have clocked comparatively fewer cases.In south Mumbai, the BMC has selected two wards— B (Masjid Bunder, Mohd. Ali Road, Dongri and Bhendi Bazar) and C (Pydhonie, Girgaon, Kalbadevi) with around 130,000 and 170,000 population respectively. In the suburbs, densely populated wards— L (Kurla) and M/East (Deonar, Govandi) with a population of more than 800,000 and 900,000, respectively (as per the Census 2011) have been selected.“These wards have been selected as the prevalence of the infection is much less compared to the density of population. Despite having several densely populated pockets and slums in these wards, the infection rate has remained under control,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC. “There is a possibility that herd immunity (when around 60-70% of the population in a community develop immunity to slow down the infection rate) has helped stop the spread of the infection in the wards. To establish the theory, we have decided to do a sero survey in these three wards,” he added.Till June 5, B ward has recorded only 3,821 cases since last year - the lowest number of Covid-19 cases. This is followed by C ward with 6,624 cases in total. The M-East and L wards have recorded 20,541 and 25,247 cases respectively.On the other hand, during the same period, K-West (Andheri West) has recorded 51,931 cases, the ward with the highest number of Covid-19 patients. Similarly, R-Central (Borivli) and K-East (Andheri East) have registered 48,802 and 44,194 cases since the outbreak of the pandemic.When asked the reason for not conducting a city-wide sero survey, Kakani said, “At present, we have decided to conduct the fourth sero survey as a part of the study to understand the epidemiological characteristics of the wards with less Covid-19 cases.”The first sero survey in Mumbai was conducted in July 2020 followed by a second one in August 2020. The third survey was conducted in March 2021 in all 24 wards of the BMC which showed the presence of antibodies in 36.30% samples out of the total 10,197. The third survey’s results showed that seropositivity rate has increased in non-slum areas compared with slum areas. The sero survey in slum areas showed the sero positivity at 41.6%, which was 57% in July 2020 and 45% in August 2020. In non-slum areas, the sero positivity was registered in 28.5% samples, which increased from 16% in July 2020 and 18% in August 2020.Doctors have welcomed the civic body’s decision to conduct the fourth sero survey that may help understand the factors behind the ward-wise variation in cases.“Just like an iceberg, a large number of invisible and undiagnosed infectious cases often remain hidden below the waterline. A sero survey at the wards with fewer cases may help to understand the actual infection rate. However, the concept of development of herd immunity is quite debatable. This survey may therefore help in throwing some data,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, part of the state’s Covid-19 taskforce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fourth-sero-survey-in-mumbai-s-wards-with-fewer-covid-19-cases-101623092736863.html
08-06-2021||Mumbai||Have stand-by ventilators for repaired ones in use: Bombay HC to GMCH, Aurangabad||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Aurangabad to have stand-by ventilators for the 18 repaired ventilators that are being used by the hospital to ensure there is no threat to the lives of the patients.The directions were issued after the Central government informed the bench that technicians from the company and expert doctors from Delhi had carried out repairs on the defective ventilators at GMCH, Aurangabad and other hospitals and the ventilators were made functional. The court has also directed GMCH, Aurangabad to test the 37 unboxed ventilators to ensure they are functioning properly before being used for treating Covid patients, and posted hearing on June 10 and sought a report on the functioning of the repaired ventilators. A division bench of justice Ravindra Ghuge and justice Balchandra Debadwar, while hearing the suo motu criminal public interest litigation (PIL) dealing with various issues pertaining to Covid-19 and mucormycosis, was informed by additional solicitor general Anil Singh for the Union of India (UoI) that as per the assurance given to the bench, technicians from the company and two doctors from Delhi had visited GMCH, Aurangabad and rectified the problems in 18 of the 19 ventilators there on Thursday, June 3. Singh further submitted an affidavit filed by GK Pillai, under-secretary, ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW), along with certain reports which gave the status of the repaired ventilators at various hospitals in Marathwada region. He added that around 5,500 ventilators had been supplied to Maharashtra. Singh on specific instructions from Rajiv Wadhawan, director of MoHFW, also stated that the UoI is making a statement that none of the ventilators supplied by Jyoti CNC to Maharashtra are financed by PM Cares fund. Chief public prosecutor DR Kale, on behalf of dean GMCH, submitted that due to space constraints and manpower shortage the 37 unboxed ventilators should be taken back by the company, tested and sent back after they were fully functional. However, Singh requested the ventilators to be unboxed at GMCH, Aurangabad and if they were found defective then it would be taken to the company. After hearing the submissions, the court noted in its order, “Since we are of the view that there should not be any scope for any suspicion and circumspection, it would be appropriate for the divisional commissioner Aurangabad to collect specific reports from various district collectors, wherever ventilators from this lot of 150 have been allocated, with regard to the functionality of such ventilators.” With regards to the unboxed ventilators and the objection of the dean of GMCH, Aurangabad to unbox and test the 37 unboxed ventilators the asked the dean GMCH to unbox and test the ventilators phase wise and if they were found defective could be sent back to the company. The bench said, “The ASG is agreeable to such suggestion on instructions and the faulty ventilators will be carried back to RnD of Jyoti CNC. If there is a minor defect which can be quickly addressed at Aurangabad itself without disturbing the daily routine of GMCH, a team deployed by Jyoti CNC would carry out such reports at the spot. We are therefore scheduling next hearing on this issue of ventilators on June 21.” The court then directed GMCH, Aurangabad to have stand-by ventilators for the repaired ventilators being used for the safety of patients and said that it would hear the PIL on the issue of mucormycosis on June 10.BOXHC hearing only “extremely urgent” mattersEven as the state has relaxed lockdown norms, the Bombay HC has commenced regular court after vacations on a cautious note. In a notice for the period of June 7-11, the court has continued its stand prior to the vacation of hearing only extremely urgent matters through video-conferencing only. A similar approach has been applied to the benches at Nagpur and Aurangabad as well. As a result, only a few benches are sitting on stipulated dates at the principal seat taking up only urgent matters. According to sources, a decision of having regular hearing of all cases will be taken by the full bench of four judges that will be reviewing the Covid situation on June 11. The decision of the full bench would also decide on the functioning of lower courts as well. Justice Revati Mohite Dere on Monday, while hearing a bail application, indicated that physical hearing could commence from Monday, June 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/have-stand-by-ventilators-for-repaired-ones-in-use-bombay-hc-to-gmch-aurangabad-101623092677610.html

When he went to check, he was able to spot a crowd but could barely see anyone as a thick black smog had engulfed outside the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). It was May 26 and past 8.30 pm at the Government Kasturba Gandhi Hospital for Women and Children, one of the busiest maternity hospitals in the heart of Chennai.A fire had broken out from the AC in the duty doctor’s room adjacent to the NICU where there were more than 40 neonates, including three newborn babies on a ventilator. But, at that time Jayakumar couldn’t see the source of the fire though he had entered the room. “I couldn’t even see the fire nor the person next to me,” he recalls. “But I was only thinking of the babies because if it entered the NICU, it would have created a big disaster because neonates can’t tolerate that type of hazardous fog. They will collapse in ten seconds.”Having been trained for fire emergencies seven years ago, Jayakumar ran the operation solely before fire and rescue teams could arrive. When he found the source of the fire his anxiety gripped him more. The floor below the source of the fire was the manifold room where additional oxygen cylinders were stored due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This was a second potential disaster. The NICU staff had locked themselves from the inside, switched off all power and oxygen lines and began manual hyperinflation and ventilation for the babies.Jayakumar is asthmatic. “But, at that time I didn’t know from where I got the energy,” he says. “There was no time to give instructions to someone else. My mind was only thinking I’ve to stop the fire.” In half an hour he had emptied 12 fire extinguishers to put out the fire and reduce the thick smog. After bringing the situation under control, Jayakumar collapsed.He was treated in the ICU for five days for multiple problems after he had inhaled large amounts of carbon dioxide and toxic fumes. “My peripheral controls were low, and I couldn’t even hold a cup to drink water for the first three days,” he says. He still has breathing difficulties due to his asthmatic condition and has reddish eyes. Despite wearing a PPE, his whole body had been covered with chemicals from the extinguisher. “It was unbearably hot, and my skin had turned into a hash colour, but it is getting better,” says Jayakumar.He lives in Ponneri, a town in adjoining Thiruvallur district with his wife and two daughters, aged 5 and 3, from where he commutes to Chennai every day.On Friday evening, Jayakumar received a call from Sekar Babu, minister for Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments asking him to come to chief minister M K Stalin’s residence with his family on the following day. Stalin honoured him for his bravery. “36 infants, 11 children, who were kept in incubators and their mothers were saved due to Mr Jayakumar’s actions,” an official statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chennai-nurse-braves-fire-to-save-newborns-101623092676897.html
08-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai opens up but not local trains; commuting woes still on||As Mumbai enters unlock mode with offices, retail shops, manufacturing units opening up from Monday, many citizens continue to face commuting woes. Despite people being allowed to commute by Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) buses, mobile application-based cabs, autorickshaws and taxis, passengers have to travel for three hours and are spending more than double the amount for commuting to work every day. Local train services for the general public were suspended for the second time on April 15 in a bid to control the spread of Covid-19 in the city, and the restrictions have not been lifted yet. Before the epidemic, Mumbai suburban train network was used by more than 7 million people for their daily commute. Many of these people now have to travel to their workplace again, but the cheap and fast travel option of local trains is not available yet. The authorities may allow women commuters to travel by train along with essential care workers and those travelling for medical reasons, in Mumbai which falls under level three of the unlock order. The state government has clarified that the decision on allowing women commuters to travel by local trains was given to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Disaster Management Authority (DMA). BMC, however, on Saturday evening issued a notification stating women commuters will not be allowed to travel by local trains yet.Citizens say they would end up spending ₹10,000 to ₹20,000 per month for commuting to work as they will have to travel by cabs. “My workplace is in Nariman Point and I stay in Thane. Office started in April and then was shut and has resumed now again. I am spending up to ₹2,000 every day to commute to my workplace and back. I am commuting nearly three hours every day. Local train services should immediately be resumed for office-goers,” said Savita Yadav, a 34-year-old debt finance dealer.Passengers have stated that there is no comparison to local trains. “Offices have resumed across Mumbai but people are forced to travel by other means of transport. I am travelling by my two-wheeler and BEST bus to work. Fuel prices have increased rapidly, which makes it difficult to take personal vehicle everywhere. There is no comparison of local trains when it comes to means of transport. Train services for the general public should resume,” said Neeraj Rathore, 31, who works in an automobile company.Passenger associations have urged BMC to resume local train services for people travelling to work.“Local train services for people going to work should be resumed immediately. Citizens, even last time, had to spend a lot of money and time just to travel to work. The decision of allowing people to travel to their workplace should be taken immediately,” said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-opens-up-but-not-local-trains-commuting-woes-still-on-101623092616846.html
08-06-2021||Delhi||Metro stations closed to ensure distancing||Several Delhi Metro stations had to be closed for a brief period to ensure social distancing as officials found it difficult to ensure 50% capacity amid high footfall, even as the public transit system recorded 450,000 passenger journeys till the evening, said officials.Some of the stations that were closed were Dwarka Mor, Uttam Nagar East, Vaishali, New Bus Adda, and Saket.“These were closed in the morning hours for about five to 10 minutes each as a crowd control measure,” said a Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) official. DMRC tweeted, “Entry for a few of our stations are being intermittently closed and opened for short durations to ensure social distancing as part of our crowd control measures. Please bear with us and allow for extra time in your commute.”The number of trains in service will be increased in phases DMRC officials said.“Nine special flying squads were deployed to randomly check inside trains for any kind of violations and counsel people to refrain from doing so for their own and everyone’s safety.“Till 8pm, 84 passengers were advised to get down from coach for travelling in standing position, 73 were penalised for not wearing mask and 106 were counseled to follow social distancing and wearing mask properly,” the DMRC said in a press release.Aqua Line services to start on June 9Meanwhile, the Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC) on Monday said it will resume operations on its Aqua Line from June 9 since the partial Covid curfew has been lifted. Services will be available only on weekdays from 7am to 8pm.The officials said NMRC is making necessary preparations at all of its stations and on trains as well, so as to ensure that passengers follow social distancing norms and other Covid-19 protocols. The services were suspended on May 1.“As the weekend curfew is still in place, train service will not be operated on weekends,” said Ritu Maheshwari, managing director, NMRC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/metro-stations-closed-to-ensure-distancing-101623092477804.html

The notice has been issued to the chief secretary and principal secretaries, social justice, empowerment and minorities, and higher education, on the orders of NCSC chairman Vijay Sampla. They have been asked to submit an action taken report immediately. “The JAC has stopped roll numbers in protest against non-disbursal of ₹1,549 crore under the SC Post-Matric Scholarship Scheme by the Punjab government, but private colleges cannot punish students because of mistakes or blunders of the state,” the NCSC chairman said in a statement, calling it “unacceptable”. Asking the state government to take strict action against the erring government officials, Sampla said that stopping the roll number or withholding degree of any student admitted under the post-matric scholarship is an offense. “It is the duty of the state governments to ensure proper implementation of the scheme and ensure that SC students face no hardship,” he said, asking the Punjab government to fulfil its duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sc-commission-issues-notice-to-punjab-on-scholarship-scheme-101623092558486.html
08-06-2021||Other||Lakshadweep residents hold hunger strike over new rules||The people of Union territory of Lakshadweep on Monday observed a 12-hour hunger strike 6 am to 6 pm, to protest against a set of new regulations which they fear will destroy the unique culture and tradition of the island. Residents of the archipelago said this is the first time they are resorting to an agitation, that too Gandhian way of protest, to vent their anger against what they call “unilateral and retrograde decisions” of the new administrator Praful Khoda Patel. People are protesting against the draft legislations like Lakshadweep Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Regulation (Goonda Act), Lakshadweep Animal Preservation Regulation and Lakshadweep Panchayat Regulation, 2021 among others.Residents of Lakhadweep, an archipelago in Arabian Sea comprising 36 tiny islands, out of which 10 are inhabited by humans, stood outside their homes holding placards, many wore black badges and at some places they shouted slogans. The Save Lakshadweep Forum, a body floated in the wake of mounting protests against the rules, said the maiden protest was successful. “This is the first time all islands observed such a protest. Though we have been assured repeatedly that local sentiments will be heard and addressed, the administrator is going ahead with his partisan and retrograde decisions,” said UCK Thangal, one of the convenors of the forum. The island MP, Mohammad Faizal, also said the protest was a big hit and he hoped authorities concerned will open their eyes. Due to rise in Covid-19 cases, lockdown is in force in the UT and all shops and establishments, except emergency services, remained shut from 6am to 6pm and vehicles were off the road. In Minicoy, four men were arrested when they were trying to hoist black flags at a public utility joint. Earlier, the administration had warned of strict action under the pandemic laws to deter crowding at public places. “Such protests are alien to our land. This is the first time we are resorting to it. We hope authorities will realise our sentiments and rise up to the occasion,” said Naseema Ashraf, a school student. Residents the archipelago in Arabian Sea have been protesting against Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation (2021) that proposes to develop the islands as a major tourist destination. Residents allege it will destroy the islands’ character and identity since 97% of the islands are covered by pristine forests and 95% of its Muslim population belong to the protected scheduled tribe category. “They want to develop the island as another Maldives. But the culture of two islands is different. We need development but it should not be at the cost of our culture and tradition,” another resident said. They are also protesting against Lakshadweep Animal Preservation Regulation, which proposes to ban the killing of bovine animals and prohibit the consumption, storage, transport or sale of the cattle, meant in island environments. Most of the Lakshadweep residents are Muslims and they feel the regulations will affect their food habits. They are also opposing the Lakshadweep Panchayat Regulation, 2021, which proposes disqualification of candidates with more than two children in the gram panchayat elections.Thangalsaid 34 administrators have governed the UT since its formation in 1956 but a situation like this never arose. “Anger and fear have gripped the island like never before. Hope the Union government will realise the gravity of the situation and take corrective measures,” he said, adding the future course of protests will be decided after an all-party meet. Similar protests were staged outside Lakshadweep house in Kochi, in Kerala on Moday. Congress MPs from the state said they will move a privilege motion in the assembly against the administrator for barring their visit to the island. “We have made several requests to visit the island but they were denied citing the lockdown. We have never seen such an insensitive administrator,” said Kochi Congress MP, Hibi Eden. Last week, the Kerala assembly had passed a unanimous resolution seeking the recall of the administrator, and on Sunday, 93 retired bureaucrats sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticising the “partisan attitude” of the new administrator and urged him to protect the unique culture and tradition of the islands. Many parliamentarians, former bureaucrats, artists and cine actors have described the draft regulations as “arbitrary” and aimed against the majority community of the islands. On Sunday, in a letter to the PM written, the bureaucrats alleged the draft regulations not only ignore the unique geography and community life of islands, but it also gives “arbitrary and draconian powers” to the administrator to acquire, alter, transfer and remove or relocate islanders from their property. They also pointed out that the Lakshadweep Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Regulation (Goonda Act) is quite unwarranted and uncalled for. “According to the National Crime Records Bureau the crime rate in the island is very low compared to the rest of India, it has generated fear that the real purpose of the regulation is to smother dissent or protests against the policies and actions of the administrator,” the letter said.Patel was appointed as the administrator of Lakshadweep in December 2020. Interestingly a section of the BJP also supported the protest. Last week, a party delegation had called on Union home minister Amit Shah to apprise him of the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lakshadweep-residents-hold-hunger-strike-over-new-rules-101623092557385.html
08-06-2021||Mumbai||Spread awareness about corona-free village, CM tells Asha workers and sarpanchs||Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on Monday urged Asha workers across the state to create awareness about making villages “corona-free”. Thackeray, also held a virtual meeting with sarpanchs of villages in three divisions — Nashik, Konkan and Pune, and said there should be a mass movement to make the villages free of Covid-19.Speaking at a webinar for Accredited Social Health Activists (Asha) workers with the state paediatric task force, Thackeray said the role of the 68,000 Asha workers in the state will be crucial in stopping the cases among children in the possible third wave of Covid-19. He added that while Asha workers must assure parents and guardians of affected children, they must also raise awareness about making villages corona-free.The members of the paediatric task force gave guidelines for Asha workers to follow in tackling Covid cases among infants and children. Thackeray said, “Asha workers should take charge of villages and guide the residents. They must follow the advice of the paediatric task force and refer patients to the administrative machinery immediately. There are indications that the possible third wave could impact children more, in that scenario, your role will be crucial,” the CM said.In another meeting held virtually with sarpanchs or heads of villages from three divisions, Thackeray said that villages should adopt “my village corona-free” initiative. The second wave has hit rural Maharashtra and the state’s tier-two cities more severely than the first wave with deaths significantly higher than last year as well. Last week, the state government launched a contest to make villages corona-free, wherein three winning villages from each of the six revenue divisions will get ₹50 lakh, ₹25 lakh and ₹15 lakh prize money.“Everyone should come forward to make their village, taluka, district free of coronavirus. If all unitedly focus on this goal, the day is not far when Covid-19 will be eradicated from Maharashtra. This should become a people’s movement,” the CM said. He added that villages should ensure all restrictions are followed to contain the spread and ensure there is no crowding in any event, function, wedding, agitation or morchas in the village or taluka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/spread-awareness-about-corona-free-village-cm-tells-asha-workers-and-sarpanchs-101623092556862.html
08-06-2021||Mumbai||Active cases fall by 73% in a month in Maharashtra||Maharashtra on Monday recorded 10,219 new Covid-19 cases while the number of active cases has shown a sharp decline. There are currently 174,320 active patients in the state. This was an approximate 73% decrease compared to a month ago on May 7 when the state had 654,788 active cases.Various factors such as ramping of tests, faster diagnosis as well as availability of medication have contributed to this decline.Pune has the highest number of active Covid-19 cases in the state with 19,645 cases as on Monday, down from 120,512 active cases on May 7. Kolhapur ranks second with 18,520 active cases. On May 7, Kolhapur was hardly in the spotlight as it clocked 14,491 active patients.Mumbai ranked third on both the occasions as it recorded 17,791 active cases on Monday, down from 54,162 cases a month ago.Dr Subhash Salunke, advisor to the state on Covid-19 management, attributed the fall in active cases to the reduction in daily Covid-19 cases. “The lockdown as well as other factors such as ramping up of tests and regular supply of medicines ensured reduction of cases. In areas like Kolhapur, the virus came late and hence, active cases there will come down in the next 15 days,” said Salunke.Dr Jeevan Jain, a physician from Lalbaug who has treated more than 15,000 Covid-19 patients, said it indicates the Covid has peaked and is on decline. “We will see lesser number of active cases in the coming days. We are also seeing good recovery rates. It indicates the second wave is waning and will soon become history,” said Dr Jain.A total of 187,172 tests were conducted on Monday. The total case tally since the outbreak of the pandemic has now reached 5,842,000. Death toll stands at 100,470 with Mumbai leading with 14,999 deaths, followed by Pune at 13,391 deaths.Mumbai recorded 730 new Covid cases and 28 deaths on Monday, taking case tally to 711,373 and toll to 14,999.In order to contain the Covid-19 surge, a strict lockdown has been imposed in Ratnagiri in the Konkan region till June 9. Metros like Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad and Nashik witnessed huge traffic snarls on Monday morning in view of the easing of restrictions. In Nanded, health workers sat staged an agitation, demanding pending dues which they have not received since the past three months. At Beed, social worker Ranjit Kadam celebrated his birthday by donating food items to a Covid-19 centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/active-cases-fall-by-73-in-a-month-in-maharashtra-101623092497503.html
08-06-2021||Other||TN serosurvey finds Covid antibodies in 23% population||A second serosurvey conducted in Tamil Nadu in April this year revealed that at least 23% of population has developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, a decline from 31% which was noted during the first survey conducted in October-November last year.The study was carried out by the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine across all districts, except Chennai where two serosurveys have already been done by the Greater Chennai Corporation.“We know that antibodies last only for a few months. So people who got infected in the early part of the first wave may not have detectable antibodies now in the second wave,” said Dr Prabhdeep Kaur, deputy director, National Institute of Epidemiology, explaining the decline. “This is anticipated and know from other serosurveys in India as well as around the world. Since we are vaccinating the population the only issue with serosurveys is that these tests do not distinguish whether you are infected or vaccinated.”Of the 22,904 samples that were tested, 5,316 people were found with IgG (Immunoglobulin G-type) antibodies against coronavirus. The report also said that various coronavirus variants, including B.1.617.2 (Delta) of Indian origin, were detected in Tamil Nadu.The highest seropositivity of 49% was found in Tiruvallur district and the lowest of 9% in Nagapattinam.About 756 clusters were chosen and each cluster consisted of roughly 30 participants who were randomly picked for testing from a village, rural area, a street and an urban area for the survey.During the first serosurvey conducted last year, 22,690 blood samples were collected of which 6,995 were found reactive to the antibodies.The latest report attributed the ‘sharp decline’ to four factors — timing of serosurvey, waning of antibodies, vaccination coverage and emergence of SARS CoV-2 variants.“The first survey was initiated around four weeks following the peak cases reported in August 2020 during the first wave,” the report said, adding that this time, the survey was conducted close to the beginning of the second wave.“Waning of IgG antibodies during the time gap of five months between 1st and 2nd survey (November 2020 to March 2021) could be one of the valid reasons for low seroprevalence as reported by several studies published in international journals,” it said.The government is planning to conduct a third serosurvey in July-August. The department said the period would be appropriate considering the current declining trend of Covid-19 cases combined with increased vaccinations for those above 18 years of age.On Monday, the state reported 19,448 cases, taking the overall tally to 22,56,681. With 351 deaths in the same period, the toll rose to 27,356. As many as 97,35,420 people have been vaccinated so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tnserosurvey-finds-covid-antibodies-in-23-population-101623092496938.html
08-06-2021||Mumbai||TMC converts bus into mobile vax unit for senior citizens, specially abled||The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has set up a mobile vaccination unit in a refurbished bus on Monday. This move is aimed to vaccinating the maximum number of senior citizens and specially abled citizens before the anticipated third wave. The move has come as a relief to those unable to travel or wait at the vaccination centres for long. The mobile vaccination unit will travel across Thane city on all days except Sundays and will cater to those above 60 years and the disabled above 45 years. On the first day of its operation, 48 people were inoculated. A Thane Municipal Transport bus has been used to set up the mobile vaccination unit. Beds have been fitted in the bus. It also has a provision to keep medicines and a small fridge to store vaccine vials. However, the bus does not have the facility of a ramp. The vaccinator will step out and provide vaccines to those unable to enter the bus. TMC will come up with a schedule for the bus to visit different parts of the city. This would ensure that people are aware of the areas that the mobile unit would visit. “We are still finalising the route. However, it will be available at different spots every day from 12 noon to 4pm for vaccination. Our main focus is to cater to areas where we could not provide easy proximity to vaccination centres. Moreover, we will focus on the special population within the city like leprosy colony, old age homes and similar settlements where many do not have proper identification-related documents,” said Dr Khushboo Tawri, medical officer, TMC. After an inauguration event at the TMC headquarters, the mobile unit visited Indira Nagar, a densely populated slum area. “I find it difficult to climb steps or sit for long periods. It was quite a task to get into a vehicle and reach the vaccination centre. I only had to step outside my house and head towards the road to get the jab,” said Neeta Bhanushali, 78, a resident of Panchpakhadi, happy to get vaccinated. Surekha Ghule, 66, a resident of Indira Nagar, also got immunised at the mobile unit on Monday. “My children stay in different parts of the country and I have a very basic phone, so it gets difficult for me to register online. Moreover, I am not aware of technology. I rely on news channels wherein they do not inform about which vaccination centres will be open the next day. I also went for walk-in vaccinations but there were long queues and crowd at these centres, so I returned. My neighbours told me about this facility. I went with my documents and got the jab,” said Ghule.TMC will also hold special vaccination drive for Thane jail inmates and mental hospital residents on Tuesday. Those above 45 years who do not have documents can also get vaccinated. Box – KDMC to give 2nd dose for 18-44 yrsThe Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) will provide second dose to those between 18 years and 45 years on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Thane mayor, Naresh Mhaske, has also asked the TMC to start vaccination process for those above 18 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/tmc-converts-bus-into-mobile-vax-unit-for-senior-citizens-specially-abled-101623092436911.html
08-06-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Delhi’s mask seller||He is sitting beside his packets of masks. His masked face is plopped on his knees, as if he were trying to escape from the world around him.“How can I be happy?” asks Shailesh Kumar, a hawker of face masks, here in a central Delhi lane. He talks of press photographers and TV cameramen directing their cameras at him as he and other fellow men queue up to get free food from charity organisations. “They show us as beggars... we are not beggars, but these times have made us helpless.” He is referring to the pandemic and the consequent lockdown.Mr Kumar originally used to sell “school copies and general knowledge text books.” But now there’s hardly anyone on the streets to buy them, he says, prompting him to switch to masks. “I get the supply once a week from a wholesaler in Gandhi Nagar market.” He spends the day silently walking within the same localities, never crying out like street hawkers usually do. “How can you cry out when you are in a mask... right now I was sitting because I was tired.”In the evening, Mr Kumar returns to the place where he sleeps—a ren basera, shelter for the homeless. “There, I have a bed and a chaadar.” The shelter also provides him with daily meals—“Sometimes they give dal chawal, sometimes subzi chawal.” In fact, he never strays far from the ren basera during his day-long wandering.In his early 40s, Mr Kumar arrived in Delhi from his village in Nawada, Bihar, seven years ago. “Nothing’s left for me in the village. Mummy’s gone. Father sold off our small agricultural land.” He could have been a labourer in the district, he mutters, “but I cannot exert my body, I have been having breathing difficulties since childhood.”He notes that “by my age, people already have children... but I did not marry because my life...” He doesn’t finish the sentence.Mr Kumar resumes speaking after some time. “I’ve no friends in Delhi. Not even in the ren basera. Residents of the ren basera don’t trust reach other. I’m alone.”He gazes at the empty street. “I will now get up.”At night, he will keep the bag he is carrying under his head, like a pillow, “so that it remains safe with me.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-delhi-s-mask-seller-101623092298642.html
08-06-2021||Mumbai||Day 1 of unlock: Thane witnesses crowding at several spots||Markets in Thane witnessed crowding on Monday morning as most shops and hotels opened up after almost 40 days. The peak hour rush continued to be the same with only a 5% increase in vehicular movement in Thane and Kalyan areas on the first day of unlock. Balasaheb Patil, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Traffic, said, “The peak hour rush in the morning and evening hours was the same on the first day of unlock. Overall we noticed hardly 5% increase in vehicular movement. There were hardly any instances of traffic jams or congestion in the city, apart from peak hours at regular junctions.” However, there was a crowd at Jambli market lane which led to buses piling up on the streets waiting to reach the State Transport depot and SATIS. “Today, being the first day of unlock, we did not expect much of a crowd but many had stepped out and most shops saw a slight increase in customers. This lockdown has had a huge impact on our business and delivery or take away is hardly 30% of our business. We are hoping that the timing increases so that more people turn up at our restaurants,” said Ratnakar Shetty, president of Hotel Owners Association, Thane. Hotels in the city are now allowed to stay open till 4pm for seating. Meanwhile, Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) noted a crowd in vegetable markets and at non-essential shops, especially near Dombivli and Kalyan stations. “I came to purchase some medicines at a regular store near the station at afternoon, expecting fewer crowds, however, there were many people on the streets shopping for groceries, clothes and others,” said Archana Suvarna, 48, a resident of Dombivli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/day-1-of-unlock-thane-witnesses-crowding-at-several-spots-101623092376838.html
08-06-2021||Bangalore||IAS officer hints at political link to her transfer||Karnataka Indian Administrative Officer (IAS) officer, Rohini Sindhuri on Monday said that she “did not anticipate her transfer” from the post of Mysuru deputy commissioner, days after spat with now former co/mmissioner of Mysuru City Corporation, Shilpa Nag and their subsequent transfer.“This happened suddenly while we were in the middle of doing good work. Though we did not anticipate it, it has happened,” Sindhuri told reporters on Monday.The state government transferred Sindhuri and Nag on Saturday after the latter alleged harassment and humiliation from the former and tendered her resignation from the service on Thursday. Nag who was Commissioner of Mysuru City Corporation was transferred as director (e-governance) at the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj department while Sindhuri, who was serving as deputy commissioner was transferred as commissioner for Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments.Chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Sunday said that there is no question of reviewing the transfer of the two senior officials in Mysuru district after Sindhuri met him and urged him to reconsider the decision. “Because she (Rohini Sindhuri Dasari) has been transferred, she came [to meet me]. Once a transfer is done, there is no question of reviewing it and I have asked her to report (to her new role),” the CM said. The spat between the two officials has sparked off a political war of words between the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government and the opposition outfits like Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S).While speaking to a Kannada TV news channel on Monday, Sindhuri hinted at political interference and that she was shunted out after she tried to reclaim land encroached by local politicians. “We should have been allowed to work freely. Unnecessary interference by a few should not have been there,” she said.People aware of the developments earlier told Hindustan Times that Sindhuri had thwarted efforts by at least two influential persons to usurp around 1500 acres of land next to a lake to build a 5-star resort. For the last three years, Sindhuri has been the target of vicious attacks--both at a professional and personal level--leading to transfers and court battles. After she was transferred from Hassan district in 2018, Sindhuri had approached the courts over her wrongful transfer and was reinstated, further aggravating those against her, people aware of the developments said.Meanwhile, a TV news byte of Nag, shared widely on social media on Monday, she can be heard saying that the motive of her resignation had been achieved. Though Nag had resigned in a press conference, there was no formal letter to the state’s chief secretary, people aware of the developments said, indicating the possibility that she was pressured to do so.Sindhuri said that she sympathises with Nag’s “insecurities”. The Congress said that the battle between the two officials showed a complete collapse of the administration under chief minister BS Yediyurappa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/ias-officer-hints-at-political-link-to-her-transfer-101623092316917.html
08-06-2021||Delhi||Gangster shifted from Mandoli jail to keep Sushil safe||Lawrence Bishnoi, a top gangster in the national capital region, has been shifted from Mandoli to Tihar jail in view of the threat he allegedly posed to the safety of Olympic medallist Sushil Kumar, who is currently in judicial custody in a case of murder, jail officers privy to the development said on Monday.A joint security audit by Delhi Police, Intelligence Bureau (IB) and the prison department assessed that there could be a threat to Kumar’s life in jail since the man he allegedly murdered, Sagar Dhankhad, purportedly had links with Sandeep Jathedi alias Kala, currently the most wanted man in Delhi, who is suspected to be hiding in Dubai and carries a reward of ₹7 lakh on his arrest.Since several members of the Kala gang are in Tihar, the agencies were taking measures to ensure Kumar’s safety in prison before he is taken to Tihar from Mandoli Jail, where the wrestler is lodged for 10 days as a mandatory quarantine stay.The police said Bishnoi runs Kala’s gang.Kumar was brought to Mandoli jail on Thursday (June 3). Bishnoi was transferred to Tihar on Saturday.No senior officer from the prisons department who is authorised to issue press statements, wished to comment on the matter. However, a mid-level prison officer who asked not to be named, said, “Bishnoi was transferred on Saturday night. He is currently lodged in a single cell inside Tihar’s jail number 1. The two men will be in two different complexes. For security reasons, Kumar has also been allotted a single cell in Mandoli.”Kumar also allegedly assaulted a man named Sonu Mahal, who is Kala’s nephew.“Lawrence Bishnoi was in a Rajasthan jail but he was brought to Mandoli last week... Even Kala has been named in the case. As new prisoners are first lodged in Mandoli and monitored for Covid-19 symptoms, Bishnoi was lodged there. But because of the threat to Kumar, we have made an exception and shifted Bishnoi from Mandoli,” a second jail officer, who asked not to be named, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gangster-shifted-from-mandoli-jail-to-keep-sushil-safe-101623092170235.html
08-06-2021||Bangalore||K’taka BJP issues gag order to rein in dissent against Yediyurappa||Bengaluru The BJP in Karnataka issued an order on Monday stating that no one within the party should speak against chief minister BS Yediyurappa, party leaders said, in an effort to rein in dissent. “No one should give statements for or against the chief minister’s statements. This is what our state president has ordered and what our central leaders have told us,” said R Ashok, Karnataka revenue minister and senior BJP leader. The BJP has also formed a 15-member committee to check statements against the 78-year-old chief minister and seeking his ouster, which leaders said was denting the image of the party. “No one should talk about the chief minister or his position. There are repeated statements given in the media stating that there will be a change and also projecting themselves as the chief minister. To avoid all this, this committee has been formed,” R Ashok said. The formation of the committee comes at a time when there have been growing voices from within the BJP seeking the ouster of Yediyurappa over complaints of mishandling the Covid-19 pandemic, lack of performance of the government, corruption and allegations that his son, BY Vijayendra, was overriding ministers and running a parallel administration. Yediyurappa had on Sunday said that he would step down as chief minister if the central leadership asked him to do so, sparking speculation of a softening of stance by the 78-year-old. The CM also said he would continue to be in office as long as the party’s high command has trust in him. Several senior legislators, including ministers, have made trips to Delhi and mobilised support for the removal of Yediyurappa. There has been no action against Basanagouda Patil (Yatnal), the firebrand BJP legislator from Bijapur city, who has made personal remarks against the performance of the chief minister and alleged corruption within his family. “Basically all this discussion doesn’t arise. He is our chief minister, he is in place, and he has made a statement that I (Yediyurappa) am a disciplined soldier of the party,” said CN Ashwath Narayan, the deputy chief minister of Karnataka. Meanwhile, MP Renukacharya, the legislator from Honalli in Davanagere and political secretary to the chief minister, said that he has mobilised signatures from 65 party MLAs in support of Yediyurappa and the same will be sent to the central leadership, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and BJP national president JP Nadda. In a post on Twitter, Yediyurappa said: “In the face of the hardship of the Covid pandemic, every BJP MLA should give priority to Covid control in their constituency. No one should involve in mobilising signatures, giving political statements, and instead, I humbly request you to help those in dire need.” Narayan said, “In a party, this kind of statements, sending these letters are not in the interest of the party.” Another BJP legislator, identified as one among those seeking the ouster of Yediyurappa, doubted the veracity of the signature campaign. “There has been no signature campaign against or for anybody,” Arvind Bellad, a BJP legislator said. He said that there was a signature campaign when all legislators had sought early release of funds from the rural development and panchayat raj department. Bellad said the content is normally printed on one side and on the back of the letter, there were signatures of the MLAs, indicating a possible misuse of the same. Congress state president DK Shivakumar said there was a collapse in the administration. He said he does not want to intervene in the internal matters of the BJP. “However, the administration has failed as ministers and MLAs are fighting among themselves. Lot of coordination problems are there,” Shivkumar said. “All I want is that the Covid-19 problem is solved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/ktaka-bjp-issues-gag-order-to-rein-in-dissent-against-yediyurappa-101623092256810.html
08-06-2021||Bangalore||Bengaluru volunteers battle overcharging in hospital amid pandemic||On May 18, Nanda Girish, a 31-year-old businessman turned Covid-19 volunteer, received a distress call. Unlike the usual calls for supplies or cremation services, this call was regarding a hospital not releasing the body of a Covid-19 victim. The hospital had asked the patient’s family to pay ₹12.5 lakh for treatment, only after which the body will be handed over to the relatives.“When they told us about this exorbitant bill, we decided to take a look at it and found that bill was beyond the government prescribed rates for beds. So, we drafted a letter citing these problems and also contacted the concerned joint commissioner. Once we escalated the matter, the hospital released the body and didn’t even insist on the full payment of the bills,” said Girish, who is part of Saahasi, a group of volunteers helping people with hospital bills.In the next 20 days, Girish, his friend Raghuram and close to 30 other volunteers from Saahasi have taken more than 30 cases where hospitals have charged beyond government regulation. So far in five of these cases, they have been able to get refunds of ₹22 lakh to the families of those affected by the malpractice.Talking to HT, Girish didn’t want to name the hospital since they were preparing a document that will be submitted to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), for further action.The volunteer group has now recruited some doctors as well to join hands with them for a thorough scrutiny of the bills and they have also approached the BBMP with a proposal to allow them nodal officers whom they can assist in taking action against hospitals. “The doctors and nodal officers will be helpful to find if the patients have been charged for unnecessary medication etc,” Girish said.“Since we have started helping with hospital bills, we have been getting several calls. In one case, the family was threatened by the hospital saying they would remove the patient from the ventilator if the full payment was not done. This is despite the patient’s wife making an advance payment of ₹5 lakh. After we intervened the hospital didn’t insist her to pay the full amount. This shows some amount of foul play from the hospital’s side,” he said.The work they do is not easy. Each bill runs up to 15 pages and it takes time to understand where the hospitals have overcharged. “In some cases, they charge for 5 PPE kits per day per patient, which when researched was found was not right. There were several other charges which were beyond government regulations,” Girish added.Talking about his group’s work, he said that their aim was to assist the government authorities. “When we came across these cases, we realized the government will not be able to go through each bill. But if we are able to do the backend work and inform the respective officials, they will be able to help the families. So far, the numbers are low since we have not put out a helpline number, but we will do it soon. In such a case, we have to create a zone-wise data that we can handover to officials and get notices issued to hospitals,” he said.Volunteers are closely working with BBMP commissioner, Bengaluru district commissioner and senior police officers who have been appointed as hospital nodal officers. One of these officers was additional director general of police Alok Kumar, who on June 2, had raided a hospital in Bengaluru east, which had several complaints of overcharging against it.The officer said that during the raid they found that the hospital was charging ₹1,000 for every hour of oxygen supplied to the patients. A copy of a bill showed that the hospital charged patients ₹30,000 a day in a Covid isolation ICU ward, while the state government has capped the charges at ₹15,000.“We have initiated legal action against the hospital in CV Raman Nagar limits for overcharging patients for ICU beds and oxygen. We have directed the hospital management to refund the money. Further action will be taken if they fail to comply with our directions,” Kumar said.Meanwhile, volunteers like Girish continue to go through hospital bills every day to do their part during the pandemic. “If we are able to get refunds up to ₹22 lakh from just 5 cases, we believe once we have gone through all complaint we have got, the sum will be much larger. We are also hoping that more people will come out, so we can make a case against hospitals where such practices are rampant. The most important thing for us is to continue to get support from authorities, so quick action can be taken as the number of complaints increase,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/battling-overcharging-in-b-luru-hospitals-amid-pandemic-101623092196828.html
08-06-2021||Mumbai||Bhujbal declares agitation for political reservation for OBC||Senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) minister and other backward class (OBC) leader Chhagan Bhujbal announced agitations against the Central government, demanding political reservation of the OBC in Maharashtra, which is on the verge of getting scrapped following a recent verdict of the Supreme Court. Bhujbal, who also heads Akhil Bhartiya Samata Parishad, an OBC outfit, said the details will be worked out after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s meeting with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue on Tuesday.He made the announcement after the executive committee meeting of Akhil Bhartiya Samata Parishad in Bandra on Monday afternoon.While ruling out that the reservation in favour of the OBC in local bodies should not result in exceeding the 50% cap in reservation quota, the Supreme Court also directed the state government to appoint a dedicated commission for collecting empirical data, based on which, the reservation quota of the community be fixed.It means no seat is going to be reserved for the OBC community in the upcoming local bodies comprising municipal corporations, municipal councils, zilla parishads, panchayat samiti and gram panchayats at least for this year or until the state government completes the entire process.The apex court gave its verdict on March 4 following which the state approached for a review, which was also quashed by it on Friday (May 28).Around 65,000 seats reserved for OBCs across the local bodies in the state are going to be affected with the apex court’s verdict, Bhujbal claimed. “We have decided to hold an agitation in the name of ‘OBC Bachav Janjagriti Andolan’ for restoring the reservation. We will wait till tomorrow as the CM will be discussing the issue along with others with the Prime Minister in Delhi, based on its outcome we will decide the next course of action,” Bhujbal told reporters.He said that he has discussed the matter with the NCP chief Sharad Pawar who has agreed to discuss it with chief ministers of other states as the verdict is not limited to Maharashtra and will be applicable across states. He also spoke about the seriousness of the issue with Devendra Fadnavis, former chief minister and leader of opposition. “I requested Devendra Fadnavis to explain it to the Prime Minister and he assured to help,” Bhujbal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bhujbal-declares-agitation-for-political-reservation-for-obc-101623091957976.html
08-06-2021||Chandigarh||Murder accused bludgeoned to death in Amritsar jail, probe on||A 45-year-old undertrial facing four criminal cases was bludgeoned to death by his fellow inmates in the high-security Amritsar jail, police said on Monday.The victim, Lakhwinder Singh, alias Lakha Baba, of Kamoke village falling under the Baba Bakala sub-division, was lodged in the jail since March 16 last year. In July 2019, Baba along with his two aides, had allegedly shot dead a panchayat member over old enmity. He was also facing a case under the NDPS Act that was registered in September 2018 at the Beas police station.Police have identified the accused as Avtar Singh, alias Tari, and Sultan Singh of Amritsar, and Gurjant Singh and Harpreet Singh, alias Happy, of Tarn Taran district. Three iron rods were recovered from their possession.Assistant superintendent of the jail Bhagwant Singh said: “The accused attacked Baba, Lovepreet Singh and Sajandeep Singh in room number 6 of barrack 5 on Sunday. Lakhwinder and Sajandeep received injuries and were rushed to the Amritsar civil hospital where Baba succumbed.”Another jail official said: “The incident took place at around 12.15pm. Baba, who received injuries on head and legs died around 4:30 pm.”A senior Punjab Police official, who is investigating the case, said: “Preliminary investigation suggest that the accused wanted to establish their supremacy in the barrack and Baba was opposing this. We have brought all the four accused on a production warrant. We have also identified three more accomplices of the accused, but their names could not be disclosed till the investigation is completed.”“The material used in constructing the jail is sub-standard and inmates use bricks to take out iron rods. Last year, ADGP prisons PK Sinha had ordered a probe into the construction after three inmates escaped by removing 10 bricks from the jail,” said the official. Accused Sultan and Avtar are facing five criminal cases each, including attempt to murder. Avtar was lodged in the jail since January 29 while Sultan was arrested on February 20. Similarly, Gurjant is facing two cases and Happy three.Deputy commissioner of police (DCP-investigation) Mukhwinder Singh said Avtar and Sultan were hardcore criminals. “Our probe to ascertain the exact cause of the attack is still on,” he added.A case under Sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC and various Sections of the Prisons Act has been registered against the accused at the Islamabad police station.A judicial probe has also been initiated and the victim’s post-mortem was conducted under the supervision of a judicial magistrate, said the jail officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/murder-accused-bludgeoned-to-death-in-amritsar-jail-probe-on-101623091957529.html
08-06-2021||Mumbai||Stay alert: CM to local administrations amid rain alert||Taking serious cognizance of a forecast for heavy rain in the Konkan region, covering Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) between June 9 and 14, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday directed the local administrations to be on alert and take all necessary measures required such as shifting people from low-lying areas and dilapidated structures to a safer place. He also said they need to ensure that the medical services for Covid-19 and other ailments will not be affected due to rain. He has asked authorities to deploy National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) teams at necessary places; coast guard and Indian Navy should be asked to stand by and call them for help if required in case of flooding in Mumbai and surrounding areas. The directives were issued in a meeting called by the chief minister to review the preparedness for the upcoming monsoon season in the backdrop of Covid-19 pandemic. He also directed to take effective measures in flood-prone areas to avoid waterlogging. “All agencies concerned need to have proper coordination to deal with any situation. We will have to ensure that the medical services will not be affected; alert people staying in coastal areas and shift those residing in dilapidated structures and low-lying areas, if necessary,” the chief minister said. He said that power back-ups should be set up at hospitals, vaccination centres etc. in case electricity supply is interrupted. He also directed the guardian ministers to review the preparedness of each district by holding meetings at their own level. “The preparedness needs to be made by planning even those events which are unexpected… Going by the forecast, MMR is likely to be affected the most with the heavy rain, thus the civic corporations are required to ensure no water logging, and manholes are not left open. In Mumbai, development work is going on at many places owing to ongoing Metro projects etc. and debris can be seen lying on roads. Make sure they will not lead to flooding in areas,” Thackeray said. Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) chief IS Chahal, who was part of the meeting, said they have installed pumps at 474 sites. They have also identified five schools in each ward where people will be shifted in case of an emergency. “We have decided to deploy a junior level to monitor the water logging issue in areas. We have developed two tanks to store the excess water. The BMC has also created squads in the jurisdiction of each police station who will help in clearing traffic in case of tree fall and waterlogging,” Chahal said in the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/stay-alert-cm-to-local-administrations-amid-rain-alert-101623091897904.html
08-06-2021||Mumbai||Congress protests against fuel price hikes||To condemn the Centre over petrol prices breaching the ₹100-mark in the state, the Congress staged agitations in various districts and tehsils. The Congress leaders from the state said the agitation would be intensified if the price hike was not rolled back. The Congress leaders said petrol and diesel are being sold at high prices because of the exorbitant duty levied on them and the Centre has earned hefty revenue out of it over the past few years.Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole, relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar led the agitation in Gadchiroli, party MP Balu Dhanorkar in Chandrapur, minister of state for home Satej Patil in Kolhapur, while party’s working president Arif Naseem Khan headed it in Thane. “The general public is facing hardship because of the high taxes on the petrol levied by the Centre. It has aggravated the problems of the common people who have already been facing financial crisis due to job losses amid Covid-19 pandemic. The Congress-led UPA government had successfully kept the petrol diesel prices under control despite high crude oil prices in the international market. Modi government has levied exorbitant taxes and duties on petrol and diesel,” Patole said. Satej Patil said the Centre earned about ₹20 lakh crore from the high excise duty on petrol and diesel in the past seven years. He said that to make it worse, the Modi government has levied the road cess of ₹18 per litre on petrol resulting in unprecedented hike in prices.The Bharatiya Janata Party however termed it an attempt of diverting the attention of the people from the pandemic, which has led to more than 100,000 deaths in the state. “The Congress and other parties should also talk about it. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has been appealing to political parties not resort to agitation and crowding. He has been talking about not politicising the issue of Covid-19, but Congress leaders are busy seeking political gain out of the current situation,” said BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye.Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said instead of blaming the Centre, the state in Maharashtra should waive the taxes levied by it. “Other states have reduced their duty and taxes to keep the petrol prices below ₹100 a litre.

The southwest monsoon has presently made its way across 30% of Maharashta, including Alibag and Raigad districts, IMD officials confirmed, and will soon arrive in the city as well. Till then, light to moderate rain and overcast skies are expected in the city, and are likely to intensify Thursday onward.Mumbai has so far recorded 115.3mm of rain since June 1, which is 156% above the normal rainfall for the period. June 1 saw the heaviest rain, with 48.3mm recorded in a single day, while June 4 was the calmest day with no rain. “These showers are very scattered, and though the rainfall is not as intense or frequent as monsoon showers, the accompanying winds can be very strong,” said a scientist with IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai. “With the likely formation of a low pressure area over North Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood by 11th June 2021 and strengthening of westerlies, an active rainfall spell is expected over Konkan - Goa and adjoining ghat areas of Madhya Maharashtra from 10th June for subsequent 4-5 days. Widespread rainfall activity is expected over the region during the period with possibility of heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places,” the IMD said in its daily bulletin on Monday. IMD’s automatic weather station in Santacruz recorded 17.2mm on rain on Monday morning. Colaba received lighter showers, with a reading of 9.4mm. While Mumbai, Thane and Palghar are placed under a yellow category storm warning for June 11, Ratnagiri and Raigad are placed under an orange category warning, indicating higher chance of heavy rainfall in these regions.“Strong winds with speed reaching 40-50 kmph gusting to 60 kmph likely to prevail over North Maharashtra coast on 10th and 11th June 2021.

They have been handed over a consent letter by the district administration.Though nine families in the area (Purana Gorakhpur Tappa, Kasba Pargana Haveli, Tehsil Sadar, Gorakhpur) have agreed to transfer their house and land in favour of the state government, two have rejected the district administration’s offer for compensation and allotment of land at an alternative site.District magistrate (Gorakhpur) K Vijendra Pandian said there was no coercion by the district administration on the 11 families to vacate their houses. “The administration will acquire their property only after their consent. The houses are being vacated on the direction of the state government, on the basis of the report submitted by security agencies. The families will be given adequate compensation and the district administration will facilitate their relocation also. There is no religious angle in the shifting of these families,” he said.A district administration officer said the boundary wall of the Gorakhnath temple runs parallel to the 11 houses located on the south-east corner of the temple premises. UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who is the head priest of the temple, stays in the residential complex on the temple premises during his visits to Gorakhpur. “Hence, security agencies are reviewing and assessing the CM’s security during his stay on the temple premises,” he said.On the basis of security agencies’ report, the state government had directed the district administration to shift these families. “There is no plan to demolish or shift the religious structures in the area. Strict action will be taken against anti-social elements who are trying to disturb communal harmony,” he added.A local trader, Mohammad Islam, said the Muslim families were settled near the Gorakhnath temple for generations. “For livelihood, majority of them run commercial establishments in a portion of their houses. If the state government shifts them to another location, they will face problems of livelihood. The state government should also give employment to one member of the family whose house is being acquired,” he said.Meanwhile, a delegation of Congress members led by UP Congress Committee vice-president, Vishwa Vijay Singh, met the 11 families on Sunday. “We told the families that the Congress will fight for their rights. We will oppose their suppression by the district administration. The state government should adhere to the demand of the families,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/muslim-families-living-near-gorakhnath-temple-likely-to-be-relocatedover-security-101623091777460.html
08-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai mayor calls for meeting to review desilting of city waterways||Taking cognisance of media reports highlighting increased siltation and mangrove growth in Mumbai’s waterways, which experts say will pose a major flood risk during the monsoon, mayor Kishori Pednekar on Monday called for a review meeting with Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials on the stormwater drains.The mayor said she will discuss preliminary results from an ongoing study by Pune-based NGO Srushti Conservation Foundation, which estimated that the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) has lost about 107 sqkm of waterways and agricultural land along its coast since 1990. The study is being led by Dr Deepak Apte, former director of the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS). Due to the increased rate of siltation over the past 30 years, Apte explained, waterways and agricultural lands along the city’s coastline have now turned into mudflats or mangrove forests, leading to shrinking and shallowing of the city’s creeks.About 47sqkm area has been lost in the Mumbai-Thane creek itself, which in the future may pose a threat to the area’s avian biodiversity (including flamingos). The coasts in Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai and Uran have all been affected by this process, HT had reported on June 5.Pednekar told HT over the phone: “I will be sitting down with chief engineers of the civic departments concerned to review whether desilting work in the eastern and western suburbs will be enough to prevent flooding in the city. We will also discuss ways in which the Srushti Conservation Foundation’s suggestions for desilting creeks can be implemented.”“Mumbai would have already been under water had we not taken appropriate steps to manage siltation in Mithi River. Ahead of this monsoon, we will take all steps to ensure de-clogging of areas, but we cannot say that Mumbai will never flood,” Pednekar said at a press conference on June 6. P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner and head of the storm water drains department, did not respond to calls and messages seeking comment on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-mayor-calls-for-meeting-to-review-desilting-of-city-waterways-101623091776813.html
08-06-2021||Mumbai||‘Earlier a soul, Twitter now a burden for BJP’||Amid the standoff between Twitter and Centre, the Shiv Sena on Monday hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government, saying the microblogging site, which was once the “soul” of the party’s campaign, has now become a “burden”. An editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana said that Twitter’s importance for the party has ended because the BJP’s opponents are now using the same platform to respond to the party’s “false propaganda”. Twitter and the Centre have been at loggerheads over the new information technology rules. Twitter was sent “last notice” asking it to comply with the new information technology (IT) rules. “Earlier, Twitter was the soul of the struggle or campaign for the BJP or the Modi government. Twitter has now become a burden for them and the Modi government has reached the extent of deciding whether to throw this burden away. Today, all media in the country is under the complete control of the Modi government, except mediums like Twitter,” the editorial said. The editorial said that the “working style” of BJP government has been exposed through Twitter during the pandemic. “Social media platforms such as Twitter showed the world how Modi and his government failed to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. The dead bodies flowing in the Ganges, pyre burning continuously in Varanasi and Gujarat, ambulance queues outside the crematoriums reached the world and the working style of the BJP government was exposed,” the editorial said. As the Centre issued new guidelines for social media platforms, the Sena alleged the social media platforms were used for “mudslinging” and “character assassination” of political opponents, and asked which rules allowed it. The Sena said that the opposition has learned how to effectively use Twitter and are taking on the BJP in states like West Bengal and Bihar, creating panic within the ranks of the ruling party. As long as these attacks were going on in a one-sided manner, the BJP members were happy, but when the opposition launched attacks by deploying equally capable cyber forces, then there was panic in the BJP camp, the editorial said. Maharashtra BJP chief spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said, “It is not the question of it becoming a burden, but whether these companies follow the law of the land. It is a baseless argument that this is done after the government faced criticism for its handling of the second wave. The notification for these IT laws came in January or February when there was no second wave.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/earlier-a-soul-twitter-now-a-burden-for-bjp-101623091718102.html
08-06-2021||Mumbai||Confusion on day one of unlock in Maharashtra||The latest easing of coronavirus-enforced curbs across Maharashtra, by dividing the state into five categories based on the severity of the virus’s spread in an area and its preparation, began from Monday. There was confusion as a few districts and cities opted to continue with more restrictions, despite qualifying for relaxations under the state’s five-level unlock order, while some other districts have contested their classifications, seeking more relaxations. Most cities and districts fall under levels two and three, giving them powers to ease restrictions. “Mumbai, Panvel, Ulhasnagar, Mira Bhayander, Bhiwandi, Kalyan-Dombivli, Vasai-Virar are under level three, while Navi Mumbai, Thane are under level two. But restrictions imposed for the respective levels are not being followed,” said an official from Mantralaya.“The traffic on Mumbai roads has suddenly gone up. The curfew order after 5pm is not being followed. Once commercial activities are opened, the situation goes beyond control. We are apprehensive about the surge in cases in the next few days after opening up activities. The district and city level administrations have been told to strictly enforce orders,” the official added.The Raigad collector, using her power as district disaster management authority, has upgraded Panvel corporation to level three, making it eligible for more relaxations. “Our population, including a few nodes from the rural parts, is more than 1.2 million, making us eligible for upgrading a level. Secondly, vast difference in restrictions in adjoining Navi Mumbai and Panvel make no sense, hence the we are following level-three restrictions, but with strict enforcement,” said Sudhakar Deshmukh, commissioner, Panvel Municipal Corporation (PMC).On the contrary, Nagpur district and corporation have opted for stricter curbs despite being eligible for complete relaxation. Avinash Katade, resident deputy collector, Nagpur said, “Though the Nagpur district and municipal corporation come under level one, we have not extended the blanket relaxations entitled. The shops, including malls and marketing complexes, will remain open until 5pm, while restaurants are allowed to operate till 10pm. We have allowed 100 attendees for weddings. All shopkeepers, restaurants bodies and organisers of wedding ceremonies have been warned about strict action, extending to cancellation of their licences, if violations are found.”He said that the administration has decided to review the situation every Friday, so as to take a call on further action depending on the number of cases and the positivity rate. He said that they are implementing the unlocking in a graded manner to avoid any surge. Both the rural and urban areas are following similar orders, he said.Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg, the two Konkan districts that are under level four, will continue stricter restrictions as they have upgraded their level by just a narrow margin.“The sudden spike in cases may lead to blanket curbs across the state as it has been mentioned in the notification. It clearly says that if the occupancy of oxygen beds crosses 35,000, the entire state will face restrictions applicable to level three and if it crosses 45,000, level four restrictions will be applicable. Currently the number of oxygen-supported patients are less than 32,000. The weekly review will be taken at the state level,” the officer quoted earlier said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/confusion-on-day-one-of-unlock-in-maharashtra-101623091716767.html
08-06-2021||Mumbai||CM Thackeray to meet PM Narendra Modi over Maratha reservation on Tuesday||Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray is set to meet Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi over the Maratha reservation issue on Tuesday. The state is expected to request the PM for Centre’s intervention in the issue to give reservation to the Maratha community which was struck down by the Supreme Court last month. The delegation which comprises of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, public works minister Ashok Chavan is also expected to raise a few other demands including financial aid to the state for damages caused by Cyclone Tauktae and release of the pending GST compensation, said a senior Shiv Sena minister. Prior to Tuesday’s meeting, Thackeray held parleys with Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Monday evening. The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is facing ire of Maratha community outfits after the quota was quashed by the Apex court on May 5. Various outfits have announced, while Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP and Maratha leader Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati has announced a statewide stir from June 16. Another Vinayak Mete, Maratha leader and chief of Shiv Sangram Party which supports the BJP, has begun to hold rallies under Maratha Kranti Morcha banner from Saturday.To pacify the community, the state government is tapping every possible option on legal and administrative grounds. “The delegation led by CM Thackeray, comprising deputy CM Ajit Pawar, PWD minister Ashok Chavan and chief secretary Sitaram Kunte will discuss issues like reservation to Marathas, other backward classes (in election), relief package for the cyclone-hit districts and dues towards GST compensation,” said home minister Dilip Walse Patil.The state is expected to request the Centre to clear the air on the powers of states on ascertaining backwardness of any community after the 102nd Constitutional amendment and the Apex court order on it. The Centre has already filed a review petition of the SC order which stated the states have no powers to ascertain it. The state is also likely to request the Centre to give the reservation to Marathas by putting them in central list of backward classes.Thackeray, on May 11, had met Governor BS Koshyari and requested him to send a request to the president for the reservation to Marathas. “In view of the SC decision that the authority for providing reservation is only with the president, we have written a letter to the president asking reservation for the Maratha community,” Thackeray had told reporters after the meeting.According to the leaders from the ruling parties, it is an attempt by the MVA to put the ball in BJP’s court. “The BJP has started protesting in the state to instigate Maratha community against us. Instead of holding us responsible, the BJP should act on what’s possible at Central level,” said a Congress leader.Meanwhile, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar met CM Thackeray to discuss issues ahead of the latter’s meeting scheduled with the PM on Tuesday morning. Pawar, who is considered a guiding force of the MVA government, is said to have discussed reservation issues related to Maratha and OBC communities. “Pawar saheb has been in favour of both the reservations. Both the issues were discussed in a meeting of NCP ministers chaired by the NCP chief recently. It was Pawar sahib who implemented the Mandal commission recommendation in Maharashtra as the chief minister. The same was discussed in today’s meeting,” said a NCP minister.Pawar was accompanied by deputy CM Ajit Pawar. Urban development minister Eknath Shinde too was present in the meeting. “Sharad Pawar is a mentor of this government. The CM will be meeting the PM on issues such as Maratha and OBC reservations. Pawar saheb always meets CM and discusses issues that are important for the state. Discussion was held on these lines today as well,” Shinde told reporters after the meeting. Maratha leader and a petitioner in the reservation case Vinod Patil said the state should do its bit to offer relief to the community. “Maratha youth are frustrated after losing the reservation. It is okay that the state delegation is meeting the PM, but who has stopped the state to comply with its assurances of ancillary benefits to the community. The state should immediately implement the scholarships, financial assistance for entrepreneurial projects and recruit the youth, whose process was completed for government jobs,” he said.The state is expected to file a review petition in the SC this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cm-thackeray-to-meet-pm-narendra-modi-over-maratha-reservation-on-tuesday-101623091657434.html

Events like poster designing and exhibition, debate and essay writing contests besides lecture series by experts of the field would be organised,” said AU assistant PRO Chitranjan Kumar. To note, on the occasion of World Water Day on March 22 Prime Minister Narendra Modi had launched the ‘Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain’ campaign. It is the flagship water conservation campaign under the Ministry of Jal Shakti. University Grants Commission (UGC) had recently asked all affiliated colleges and institutions to include rain water harvesting structures (RWHS) on their premises as part of ‘Catch the Rain’ campaign. The campaign initiated under the National Water Mission with the objective to conserve water, minimize wastage and ensure more equitable distribution both across and within states encourages all stake holders to create rain water harvesting structures before the onset of monsoon to catch the rain. This rain water can be used to recharge the groundwater aquifers. Apart from this, educational institutes are also to organize activities such as drives to make water harvesting pits, rooftop RWHS, check dams etc, removal of obstructions in the channels which bring water to them from the catchment areas etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/allahabad-university-colleges-to-undertake-water-conservation-mission-101623091356824.html

08-06-2021||Lucknow||UP ranked grade I in school education||Uttar Pradesh (UP) improved its grading from grade III to grade I, in performance grading index (PGI), released by the union education ministry on Monday. PGI is a tool to measure the status of school education in states and union territories. UP along with seven other states were grouped under grade I, five other states grouped under level III and seven states were got grade A++ (above grade I) in PGI, said state’s basic education minister, Satish Chandra Dwivedi. Dwivedi said chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s leadership helped improve on various parameters and said efforts would continue to further improve UP’s PGI rankings. The minister said the state made a “remarkable improvement” in the last four years and reached grade I. The school education in states was given marks on the basis of learning outcome, easy access, infrastructure, equity and governance, he said. As per an official statement, the PGI exercise envisages that the index would propel states and union territories (UTs) towards undertaking multi-pronged interventions that will bring about the much-desired optimal education outcomes. “The PGI helps the states/UTs to pinpoint the gaps and accordingly identify areas for intervention to ensure that the school education system is robust at every level,” an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-ranked-grade-i-in-school-education-101623090876674.html

Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya in a tweet in Hindi said: “Samajwadi Party chief patron and former chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav ji, thank you for taking the jab of swadeshi (indigenous) vaccine. Your taking the vaccine is a testimony that the SP national president Akhilesh Yadav had spread rumour about the vaccine. Akhilesh ji should apologise for it.”BJP UP unit president Swatandra Dev Singh in a tweet in Hindi said: “A good message...I hope that Samawjadi Party workers and the party president too would take inspiration from this.” Both Maurya and Singh posted the picture of Mulayam Singh Yadav taking the jab along with their tweets.In January, SP president Akhilesh Yadav had kicked up a controversy when at a press conference in Lucknow he termed the Covid vaccines as “vaccine of the BJP” and had declared that he would not take it. It drew a sharp retort from BJP leaders who accused him of “insulting the doctors and scientists who indigenously developed the vaccine” and called Akhilesh’s statement “irresponsible”.Later, Akhilesh reiterated that it was the “BJP vaccine” but clarified that he never insulted the scientists and researchers who developed the vaccines but criticised the BJP that was politicising the vaccine.Earlier on May 19, Mulayam Singh Yadav’s younger daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav had taken the vaccine at Lok Bandhu hospital in Lucknow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mulayam-takes-first-dose-of-covid-vaccine-bjp-hails-move-101623090696758.html
08-06-2021||Other||Case filed against Kerala BJP chief for ‘bribing’ poll candidate||Kerala Police on Monday registered a case against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state chief K Surendran for allegedly bribing Independent candidate, K Sundara to withdraw his candidature from the Manjeswaram constituency ahead of the recent state elections, following a court directive.Sundara, who stood from the Mancheswaram seat against Surendran alleged last week that he was paid ₹2.5 lakh to withdraw his candidature. He later pulled out of the political contest. IUML’s AKM Ashraf eventually won the seat.The CPI(M) candidate, V V Ramesan had moved Kasaragod magistrate court which on Monday directed the police to register a case against him. Police later said the BJP leader will be booked under Section 17I B of the Indian Penal Code and other sections. If convicted, the offender will get one- year jail term and five- year suspension from contesting elections.However, the BJP said it will challenge the decision in a higher court. “There is a concerted move to target the party and its leaders in Kerala. Both the ruling CPI(M) and opposition Congress have joined hands. Some of the recent allegations are part of this virulous campaign,” said party leader A N Radhakrishnan in Kochi.Kerala police on Sunday recorded the statement of K Sundara. “We have recorded the statement of Sundara. He said he was threatened by the BJP workers to withdraw the nomination papers. Also, he said he was offered money and that he had accepted it,” the police told news agency PTI.Sundara has hailed the decision of the court and said he was ready to depose against the BJP leader. Both the CPI(M) and Congress also welcomed the court decision.“I will take the case to its logical end. Enough money had flown in Mancheswaram during the poll. I will expose the corrupt practices of the BJP,” said V V Ramesan.“The money trail shows the BJP wanted to grab some seats by hook to crook. People of the state have shown again that Kerala is not fertile for saffron forces. We welcome the decision of the court,” said Congress leader, Shafi Parambhil.Interestingly, in 2016 assembly elections also Sundara contested but he got 467 votes while Surendran lost the seat by a slender margin of 89 votes. He said this time the BJP was more alert and many leaders from Karnataka pressurised him to withdraw from the election. After withdrawing his nomination, he campaigned for Surendran. But the state president lost the May poll by a bigger margin of 745 votes to IUML’s Ashraf.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/case-filed-against-kerala-bjp-chief-for-bribing-poll-candidate-after-court-s-order-101623089497254.html

However, backed by farm unions, the transplantation of Pusa-44 variety, which is considered environmentally hazardous, and other parmal rice (PR) varieties is going on in full swing in scores of villages in this belt.Also Read: PSPCL gears up to meet 14,000 MW power demand during paddy seasonPusa-44, which is among the oldest varieties being grown in Punjab, takes around 145-150 days to mature, which makes it highly water intensive. Also, it produces more post-harvest waste, say experts.Chief agriculture officer (CAO), Mansa, Manjit Singh said there are inputs that transplantation has begun in Bhaini Bagha and adjoining villages. After field inspections, the plantation in the identified fields will be ploughed, he said.Bathinda CAO Bahadur Singh Sidhu said farmers should follow recommended date of paddy transplantation to conserve subsoil water. “In 2019, it was mandated to start paddy transplantation from June 20. Last year, it was advanced to June 13, and this year to June 10 in view of the pandemic crisis. Rice is a water-intensive crop and experts recommend a schedule that coincides with the monsoon to balance irrigation needs,” he said.However, justifying sowing ahead of the schedule, Mansa district president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ughrahan) Ram Singh Bhaini Bagha said it was necessitated to overcome labour shortage in view of Covid restrictions, as farmers need a longer window to sow Pusa-44. “Contrary to the other recommended variety, Pusa-44 produces more yield per acre. We understand that it consumes more water, but the state government should devise a diversification plan that ensures profitability to paddy growers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/paddy-sowing-begins-early-in-southern-punjab-101623086980477.html

For a few days, they are all living in fear of the wall collapsing. Residents of the area blame the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) for constructing a compound wall along the Ambil Odha in a hurry after monsoon has arrived in the city, a work that was supposed to be completed before monsoon season. There are more than 40 families living along the Ambil Odha near Seva Dal office in survey number 133. There are old compound walls along the Odha but, they are not in a good condition. Therefore, the PMC drainage department has undertaken work to construct a parallel compound to strengthen the existing one to protect residents from a flood-like situation. However, the PMC began the work only last week. Dilip Waghmare, a resident of Indira Gandhi Vasahat said, “Last week, the PMC began work on the compound wall. They used poclain and JCB machines to dig the ground to construct a new compound wall. During the work, cracks developed on our house walls. PMC has taken up the compound wall work very late when monsoon has already arrived. If any calamity happens, what will happen to us? We wrote a letter to the PMC to make alternate arrangement and pay compensation for our damage.” Sobha Ohal, another resident of Vasahat said, “We have been living for more than 20 years in this area. In the 2019 flood situation, we had already faced a problem. Now, we don’t want something to happen to us. Now, the monsoon has started and how will the PMC be able to complete the work? There are chances of shoddy work due to the urgent deadline. Our drinking water and drainage water pipeline is also damaged. We are demanding that it be repaired as early as possible to avoid any further complications.” Mangala Ghate, a local resident said, “The PMC has included us in the Slum Rehabilitation Authority scheme (SRA), it is the duty of the PMC to take care of our life. The civic body rushes to help us when any calamity or incident occurs but, they never take appropriate steps to avoid any calamity and save our lives.” Shahubai Waghmare, another resident of Indira Vasahat said, “ It is the negligence of the PMC to start work in the monsoon period. They just want to complete work and they don’t care about time and quality of work. Every person’s life is precious whether it is living in a slum or in a building. It is our duty as PMC to protect them.” Prakash Kumbhar, deputy engineer of PMC drainage and maintenance department said, “We have started work to construct a parallel compound wall along the Ambil Odha which will secure Indira Gandhi Vasahat from flooding. There is an old compound wall existing. For precaution, we are constructing a new wall. I don’t think due to our work, cracks developed. It takes around one week to complete the work. We are taking all necessary precautions to avoid any damage or problems to residents.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/residents-blame-pmc-after-cracks-emerge-in-walls-of-houses-in-indira-gandhi-vasahat-101623082775907.html
08-06-2021||Dehradun||Environmentalists, bird lovers against ‘junky tourism’ in Sattal||Environmentalists, bird lovers and locals are opposing the proposed redevelopment of Sattal, a birder’s paradise, in Nainital district, stressing that more concretisation and infrastructure addition will disturb the birds frequenting the area and negatively impact its natural ecology.Bird lovers from across India frequent Sattal for bird watching and clicking photographs of the Himalayan avian diversity. Under the proposed redevelopment of Sattal, authorities (Nainital Lake Development Authority and forest department) plan to build a children’s park, food plaza, interpretation centre, library, ticketing office, park, pathways and so onNeerdiv Bankoti, a local, said they are opposing the redevelopment as Sattal is perhaps the last lake area in the district, also called the “Lake district of India”, which is still in pristine and unspoiled, and doesn’t have many concrete structures.“These additions will lead to crowding and stop the birds from coming here. So, in a way, if we go ahead with the redevelopment of the lake area, it will defeat the very purpose for which Sattal is famous,” he said.Aagnay Budhraja, who hails from Delhi and has been living in Sattal for four years, said he started an online petition on change.org against the proposed move. He said the area is home to over 500 bird and 525 butterfly species.“Over 17,000 people have already signed the petition. When we came to know about these proposed works, we wrote to the divisional forest officer of Nainital and other authorities that instead of adding more structures in the area, the forests around the lake should be declared a conservation reserve,” he said.Budhraja said a public interest litigation will be filed in the Uttarakhand high court next month. “We want the court to look into this ecologically sensitive matter,” he said.Avian expert Sanjay Sondhi, also the co-author of “Updated Checklist and Bibliography of the Birds of Uttarakhand” said Sattal is likely the best bird watching site in the state. “There should be no junky tourism development there; it should be left unspoiled for birds,” he said.AG Ansari, a Kumaon-based wildlife activist, said he is opposed to development around Sattal. “If concrete structures are added, there will be less green space around the lake and more people will be present in the area at a time, which will affect the movement of birds that are generally alert and shy towards crowds,” he said.However, environmentalist Ajay Singh Rawat said that in 1993 he filed a petition in the Supreme Court regarding pollution in Nainital lake. “Subsequently, the SC gave directions that Nainital lake has become opaque and it should be cleaned immediately. After that ₹43 crore were released by the state government for Nainital and other lakes in the district,” he said.Rawat said in 2013, the Uttarakhand high court ordered that the money saved from the ₹43 crore should be used for beautifying Sattal and stopping pollution.“Under this project, now the shops are being shifted 40 feet back, a children’s park and food plaza is being set up. This will give a boost to tourism and the landscaping efforts will also check pollution in the area. The opposition seems to be engineered by some vested interests who have business interests in surrounding villages,” he said.Pankaj Upadhyay, secretary, Nainital Lake Development Authority, said ₹6 crore will be spent on the Sattal lake redevelopment and beautification project. “We have plans to build a children’s park, a small park and a sitting area, develop pathways and undertake landscaping around the lake to beautify it. The contract for the project has been given a few days back and work will start soon,” he said.Mukul Sharma, forest range officer, Bhawali (under which Sattal falls), said the works proposed by the forest department haven’t been built yet.“Interpretation centre is meant to educate people and bird lovers about the avian diversity found in this area. The library will have books on wildlife and nature. Besides, we have plans to build a small office for the ticket giver. All these will not take much space. We are not doing anything to disturb the area but help the visitors to understand the diversity of birds found in the area and admire them,” he said.Subodh Uniyal, cabinet minister and spokesperson of the state government, said he will look into the matter. “The locals who are opposing the redevelopment should make a representation to me so that I can get the whole matter examined and see what can be done on this issue,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/environmentalists-bird-lovers-against-junky-tourism-in-sattal-101623013085855.html

The idea has drawn support from over 60 countries, which now include the US and China. Insiders cautioned that a breakthrough wasn’t expected.Blinken spells out targets for distribution of jabsWith the US sending millions of its Covid-19 vaccines to several countries, including India, secretary of state Antony Blinken said there is a need to increase production capacity on a regional basis across the globe.Testifying before the House foreign affairs committee on the state department’s 2022 budgetary proposals, Blinken said it is important to have three-fourths of the world vaccinated soon.The US, he said, has 80 million vaccines that will be distributed. “We want to make sure that anything we send out is safe and effective. It’s starting now and it’s going to be rolled out over the coming days and weeks between now and the end of July,” Blinken said.1 million Europeans have EU Covid certificatesMore than one million Europeans have received the new EU Covid-19 health certificate being rolled out to unlock travel within the bloc, the European Commission said on Tuesday. EU justice commissioner Didier Reynders announced the figure to the European Parliament ahead of a vote to enshrine the document in law for the continent’s summer tourism season.It is expected to be passed by a big majority after agreement between MEPs and the EU’s 27 member states on the details, with the vote result known early on Wednesday.The UK government is said to be weighing up a delay of around a fortnight beyond the June 21 timeline set for the final stage of a road map to end all legal lockdown restrictions, amid a continuing rise in the cases of the Delta variant of Covid-19 in parts of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wto-debating-on-anti-covid-jab-ipr-101623174619968.html

It also rejected an appeal by prosecutors of Mladic’s acquittal on one other count of genocide linked to ethnic purges early in the war.US President Joe Biden said the “historic judgment shows that those who commit horrific crimes will be held accountable. It also reinforces our shared resolve to prevent future atrocities from occurring anywhere in the world”.UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said on Tuesday the ruling upholding the conviction of Mladic for genocide and war crimes meant the international justice system has held him to account.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mladics-conviction-upheld-at-un-101623174410229.html

Mayra Zulfiqar, who had arrived in Pakistan earlier this year to attend a wedding, was staying at a rented accommodation in Lahore when she was found dead with two bullet wounds and signs of torture on her body.Zahir Jadoon was earlier detained by the police but was not formally arrested after Zulfiqar's uncle him and another man as key suspects in the murder case. The other man has not yet been arrested and is said to be cooperating with the investigation, reported BBC quoting the man’s lawyer. Jadoon’s brother and the driver had previously been detained.Zulfiqar, a law graduate, had been threatened by two men after she turned down marriage proposals from both of them, reported BBC citing legal documents. According to a police report filed by Zulfiqar on April 20, a man had abducted her at a gunpoint and attempted to sexually assault her a few days earlier.When she managed to run away by alerting bystanders, Zulfiqar said, the man threatened her, saying, "You won't be able to escape; I will kill you," as per BBC.Zulfiqar’s father, Muhammad Zulfiqar, had appealed for help to Pakistani Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, who was shot by the Taliban in 2012 for her work as an advocate for women’s education. Muhammad asked Yousafazai to advocate for justice on behalf of his daughter Mayra Zulfiqar.“My dear daughter Malala, I appeal to you for God’s sake please raise your voice for my daughter. She was like your sister," he told The Associated Press late on Thursday. “Your voice is heard. The only difference is that you have gone abroad after studying here and my daughter came to Pakistan to serve humanity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lahore-police-arrest-man-in-mayra-zulfiqar-murder-case-report-101623172128849.html

The medical body also said that it would communicate the decision in July 2021, unless more data was required.In a statement released on the day, the European regulator said that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) will carry out an accelerated assessment of the data submitted by the vaccine maker in their application. “EMA’s human medicines committee (CHMP) will carry out an accelerated assessment of data submitted in the application, including results from a large ongoing clinical study involving adolescents from 12 to 17 years of age. This study was carried out in accordance with the paediatric investigation plan (PIP) for COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna, which was agreed by EMA's Paediatric Committee (PDCO),” it said.EMA allows accelerated assessment of drugs that are of major interest for public health, especially medicines that are therapeutic innovations. The process would usually involve 150 evaluation days rather than the 210 days which is the norm otherwise.The European Commission, which is the executive branch of the European Union (EU), will issue the decision to extend the use of the Moderna shot in young beneficiaries across the member states. “The CHMP’s opinion on extending the use of the vaccine, together with any requirements for further studies and additional safety monitoring, will then be forwarded to the European Commission, which will issue a final legally binding decision applicable in all EU Member States,” the EMA further mentioned in its statement.Moderna’s Covid-19 shot received a conditional marketing authorisation for usage within the EU earlier on January 6 and is currently authorised to be used in the immunisation of people above 18 years of age in the bloc. The vaccine is based on a new technology called the messenger RNA (mRNA) and administered in two doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ema-evaluating-use-of-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-in-12-17-age-group-decision-expected-in-july-2021-101623172757901.html

Harris earlier Tuesday defended her approach, saying in an NBC News interview that there is “not going to be a quick fix” for the flow of people to the U.S. southern border.She rebuffed GOP criticism that she hasn’t yet visited the border. “And I haven’t been to Europe,” she said in the interview. “And I mean, I don’t understand the point that you’re making. I’m not discounting the importance of the border.”Also Read | Kamala Harris’ two assignments that could make or break her presidential bidUnderscoring the political challenge she faces, Harris also came under fire from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a prominent Democrat from New York, and human-rights groups that expressed disappointment at her warning to migrants not to make the journey to the U.S.The U.S. vice president on Monday visited Guatemala, where she met with President Alejandro Giammattei and announced several new initiatives to crack down on human trafficking and corruption as well as addressing poverty and violence which U.S. officials blame for the migration spike.During a news conference Monday, she told would-be migrants: “Do not come,” warning that “if you come to our border, you will be turned back.”Also Read | Kamala Harris tells Guatemalans ‘Do Not Come,’ urges fight against corruptionBiden and other administration officials have previously made similar remarks.

This was a terrorist attack, motivated by hatred, in the heart of one of our communities,” he said.On Sunday, a 20-year-old Canadian national rammed five people, who were waiting to cross the intersection, with a black pickup truck. According to the police, the investigators believe it was an intentional act and the victims were targeted because of their Islamic faith. The police said in a statement there is evidence that it was a “planned, premeditated act, motivated by hate.”“There is no known previous connection between the suspect and the victims,” they added.Nathaniel Veltman, 20, has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempt murder.The four family members killed in the attack were Salman Afzaal, 46, his wife, Madiha Salman, 44, their 15-year-old daughter, Yumnah Afzaal, and Afzaal’s 74-year-old mother, whose name is not yet released.

However, they failed to fully incorporate this information into all of its internal assessments about Capitol riots, the report said.The Senate Rules and Administration and the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committees jointly prepared the report which focuses on the security, planning and response failures related to the violent attack on the US Capitol.

Quoting people familiar with the matter, CNN reported that the language had to be carefully crafted in the quest for bipartisanship."Did we look at Trump's role in the attack? The answer is no.

They came back up after outages that ranged from a few minutes to around an hour.Fastly, one of the world's most widely-used cloud-based content delivery network providers, said it reported a disruption from a "service configuration" and did not explain."Customers may experience increased origin load as global services return," the company said."Incidents like this underline the fragility of the internet and its independence on a patchwork of fragmented technology. Ironically, this also underlines its inherent strength and how quickly it can recover," Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight said."The fact that an outage like this can grab headlines around the world shows how rare it is."Fastly, which went public in 2019 and has a market capitalization of more than $5 billion, is far smaller than peers like Amazon's AWS. It helps websites move content using less-congested routes, enabling them to reach consumers faster.The United Kingdom's attorney general earlier tweeted that the country's main gov.uk website was down, providing an email for queries.The disruption may have caused issues for citizens booking Covid-19 vaccinations or reporting test results, the Financial Times reported.Fastly's website said that most of its coverage areas had faced "Degraded Performance".

The body also expressed concern about the “rapidly deteriorating security and humanitarian situation” in Kayah State and other areas in south-eastern Myanmar.“Recent violence in Kayah State, including indiscriminate attacks by security forces against civilian areas, has led to the internal displacement of an estimated 100,000 men, women and children. Many of them are currently seeking safety in host communities and forests across Kayah and southern parts of neighbouring Shan state,” the UN in Myanmar said in its statement. It further warned that the crisis would force those displaced across the international border, which could be seen in many other parts of the country.Also read | Trial of Myanmar's deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi to begin next weekStressing that the people affected by the violence were in urgent need of essentials such as food, water, shelter, fuel and access to healthcare, the UN said that relief items are ready to be deployed.

It also called on the security forces to allow for a safe passage for providing humanitarian supplies and relief to those in need in Kayah and the other states as well.“The United Nations reiterates the Secretary General’s call for a global ceasefire made in March 2020 and to join forces to respond to the growing risk of another outbreak of Covid-19 and other humanitarian and health challenges,” it added.Earlier on May 20, Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said that an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 people have sought refuge in India, news agency PTI reported. Also, 60,700 women, children and men were internally displaced as of the second week of May 2021, the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said on the same day.

08-06-2021||World||NRA's gun rights message lingers in US despite legal, money woes||Liberals have cheered the highly public legal and financial jeopardy ensnaring the National Rifle Association, seeing the gun lobby's potential demise as the path to stricter firearms laws.But, it turns out, the NRA's message has become so solidified in the Republican Party that even if the organization implodes from bankruptcy and allegations of lavish spending and misuse of funds, its unapologetic pro-gun point of view will live on, as the heated debate increasingly shifts from Washington to the states.Not even the shift in power to Democrats in the White House and Congress has been enough to push through new federal restrictions, and states continue to pass laws with far-reaching protections for gun owners.Ever confident, the NRA, which is based in Fairfax, Virginia, says the suggestion it is receding is magical thinking on the left. The group promises it will emerge from bankruptcy stronger, particularly as it seeks to relocate to the decidedly pro-gun rights state of Texas.The durable nature of the NRA’s clout is an exemplar of how difficult it is to claw back control from an entrenched lobbying powerhouse that has planted deep roots in the American political system with money, organization and relentless messaging.“The NRA built up an impressive mountain of power over the course of 40 years. And despite their recent fall from grace, that power doesn't disappear overnight,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said in an interview.Not to say there is no hope for gun control — far from it, said Murphy, whose own views are shaped by the massacre of 20 children in Newtown, Conn. on Dec. 14, 2012, and the subsequent (successful) effort by the NRA to stop gun legislation in the aftermath.He said Democratic gains in Congress, despite the efforts by the NRA to stop candidates, are one measure of a change in the dynamic. Another is a shift in some public opinion. A Gallup poll in 2019 found the percentage of people viewing the NRA favorably dropping below 50% for only the second time in three decades.“There’s no doubt that their political muscle is reduced,” Murphy said. “The Georgia special elections are a pretty clear indication of that. Democrats who support universal background checks are winning all over the country, including in states where you would have thought the NRA had a stranglehold.”One of Biden’s first executive orders was on gun control. On Monday, the Justice Department announced model legislation for red-flag laws, which permit police to ask for the removal of firearms from people who may present a danger to themselves or others.In March, the House passed two bills requiring background checks on all firearms sales and transfers and allowing an expanded 10-day review for gun purchases. But the legislation faces strong headwinds in the Senate, with some Republican support required for passage.At the same time, though, the NRA has been growing, with 225,000 additional dues-paying members since January, its ranks now swelling to more than 5 million. Its embattled leader, Wayne LaPierre, has led the fund-raising efforts for nearly three decades, selling himself as an aggressive guardian of the Second Amendment right to bear arms.He positioned the lobby as the major antagonizer of Democratic administrations. Then, in 2016, the organization spent more than $30 million on behalf of Donald Trump's campaign, according to Federal Election Commission data. The effort paid off — after back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, Trump seemed inclined to take action on extensive background checks but backed off after a phone call with the NRA.But those successes were happening while the NRA was having major problems within. By 2018, the organization had a $36 million deficit due to lavish spending. A class action lawsuit by members over mismanagement and a lack of transparency followed in 2019. And then, Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James sued to disband the group, arguing it was “fraught with fraud and abuse.” In D.C., the attorney general sued over improper diversion of funds.The NRA filed for bankruptcy in January. During the trial, an embarrassing deposition by LaPierre emerged in which he said he’d borrowed a friend’s 108-foot yacht to hide multiple times between 2013 and 2018 after threats following multiple mass shootings.Even with that inner turmoil, the NRA has also been behind hundreds of successful efforts to loosen gun laws in the states — most recently working to persuade states to abandon requirements that people get training and pass background checks to carry concealed handguns.Six states have passed legislation removing or weakening concealed-carry permit requirements this year, most recently Texas. About 20 states now allow people to carry concealed weapons without a license.Four more states have passed legislation banning police from enforcing federal gun laws, a preemptive shot at any new measures passed by Democrats.The NRA is far from the only pro-gun group at the table in state legislatures now. In Utah, one of the first states to remove permit requirements this year, it was just one of at least six gun rights groups speaking in favor of the bill at the Capitol — and it wasn’t the most outspoken one.The number of generally pro-gun rights states outnumbers those that pass gun control measures 40 to 10, although the latter have more people, so the country’s population is about evenly divided between the two camps. And a Pew Research Center report released in April found the number of Americans who favor stricter gun laws has declined this year to 53%, down from 60% in September 2019.“Gun rights, the Second Amendment, the right to keep and bear arms is bigger than any organization,” said Jordan Stein, communications director for the Gun Owners of America, one such group.Gun owners would continue fighting if the organizations who often help them organize and coordinate around the issue were gone, he said.Recent gun sales suggest a new zeal for owning a weapon. Gun dealers sold more than 2 million firearms in January, a 75% increase over the same month last year and the biggest-selling January on record, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, an industry trade group. The FBI, meanwhile, reported 4.3 million firearm-related background checks, the highest monthly total since the system was created over two decades ago.While the NRA is easily the best known gun lobby, Josh Horwitz, the executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, said the real players are the state gun groups.“The groups that work at the state level are much more powerful than they used to be," Horwitz said. "Even if the NRA went away tomorrow, and it may, (Senate Republican leader) Mitch McConnell is still going to be checking in with whatever the Kentucky gun rights alliance is, and the Ohio legislature is going to be checking in with the Buckeye Firearms Association.“We’re in a generational battle," he added. "Guns in America is going to be a big fight for a long time.”Despite its troubles, the NRA remains confident in its prowess.The organization, which in January reported total assets of about $203 million, liabilities of about $153 million and $31 million in bank loans, said in court papers it saw revenues drop about 7% because of the coronavirus pandemic. To cut costs, it laid off dozens of employees and canceled its national convention.Last month, a federal judge in Dallas dealt another blow to the lobby when he dismissed its bankruptcy case, because he found it was not filed in good faith.But it has also balanced its budget and is again in the black after years of deficits.“Coupled with our typical excellent report card on legal and legislative advances and wins, the record is clear: the NRA is as strong and effective as ever as we confront President Biden’s anti-gun agenda," said Andrew Arulanandam, the NRA'S managing director for public affairs."Any suggestion to the contrary is wishful thinking from our adversaries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nras-gun-rights-message-in-us-lingers-despite-legal-money-woes-101623147680624.html
08-06-2021||World||WTO panel considers easing patent protections on Covid-19 vaccines||Envoys from World Trade Organisation member nations are taking up a proposal to ease patents and other intellectual property protections for Covid-19 vaccines to help developing countries fight the pandemic, an idea backed by the Biden administration but opposed in other wealthy countries with strong pharmaceutical industries.On the table for a two-day meeting of a WTO panel opening Tuesday is a revised proposal presented by India and South Africa for a temporary IP waiver on coronavirus vaccines. The idea has drawn support from more than 60 countries, which now include the United States and China.Some European Union member states oppose the idea, and the EU on Friday offered an alternative proposal that relies on existing World Trade Organization rules. The 27-nation bloc said those rules currently allow governments to grant production licenses — such as for Covid-19 vaccines or therapies — to manufacturers in their countries without the consent of the patent holders in times of emergency.At stake in the meeting is whether the various sides can move toward drawing up a unified text, a key procedural step that could unlock accelerated negotiations. Inside observers cautioned, however, that a major breakthrough was not expected.Even optimistic supporters acknowledge an IP waiver could take months to finalise because of solid resistance from some countries and WTO rules that require consensus on such decisions -- meaning a single country among the 164 members could scuttle any proposal. Even if adopted, ratification would also take time.Advocacy groups, emboldened by the support the United States announced last month, have increasingly pushed the plan and insisted it would not be as difficult to carry out as detractors would say.Doctors Without Borders, a Nobel Peace Prize-winning humanitarian agency, faulted the European Union, Switzerland, Norway and other holdouts on the IP waiver idea Monday for employing alleged “delaying tactics.”Pharmaceutical companies insist that an IP waiver could dampen the incentive for researchers and entrepreneurs to innovate and say vaccine-sharing by rich countries would be a much faster way to get shots to health workers and at-risk populations in the developing world.The World Health Organisation has repeatedly inveighed against unequal access to vaccines, noting that rich countries scooped up supplies well in excess of the need of their own populations while developing countries have obtained only a small fraction of the doses so far distributed and injected worldwide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wto-panel-considers-easing-protections-on-covid-19-vaccines-101623154520551.html

She says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.The ministry said the trip damaged the basis of Sino-US ties and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, and was "extremely irresponsible and very dangerous".The United States must immediately stop any kind of official exchanges or military relations with Taiwan, it added."If anyone dares to separate Taiwan from China, the Chinese People's Liberation Army will resolutely fight head-on at all costs and resolutely defend the country's unity and territorial integrity".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vile-political-provocation-china-on-us-senators-visiting-taiwan-on-military-plane-101623154100387.html

Who is the frontrunner?||Virginia and New Jersey are set to hold their Democratic primaries on Tuesday for the gubernatorial nomination that could be an indicator of where the voters stand after the divisive 2020 US presidential elections. Both states voted for Joe Biden by double-digit margins and both of their governors are Democrats. This means the primary elections will be closely watched since the party's gubernatorial nominee may as well be the frontrunner for the post.The winner of the primary will face Republican Glenn Youngkin, who won his party's nomination last month and immediately received former president Donald Trump's endorsement. Former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe currently leads a slate of Democratic candidates.The outcome of the gubernatorial election is being watched as a possible bellwether for voter sentiment ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, which will serve as an uphill battle for Democrats who are holding their majority in Congress by skin of their teeth."If the Republicans can manage to recapture Virginia, which has clearly moved in a Democratic direction, the prospects for Democrats in the midterm elections in 2022 will be dimmed, there's just no doubt about it," said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics.Also Read | Biden promotes $4 trillion plans in visit to Virginia schoolsVirginia, a southeastern US state, has become more Democratic in recent years as no Republican has won statewide office since 2009.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Tuesday said that his government has struck a heavy blow to organised crime that will echo around the world.Calling it a watershed moment in Australia’s law enforcement history, Morrison told a news conference that the operation has charged more than 800 hundred alleged offenders, seized millions of dollars in criminal proceeds, and removed weapons from the streets and saved lives. Morrison was joined by Australian Federal Police (AFP) commissioner Reece Kershaw and FBI legal attaché at the US embassy Anthony Russo for the announcement. The AFP commissioner told reporters that the law enforcement agency partnered with the FBI and gained access to a new encrypted application named AN0M.“As of today, we have charged 224 alleged offenders, including 525 charges laid, shut down six clandestine laboratories and acted on 21 threats to kill, including saving a family of five. And seized 104 firearms and weapons and almost $45 million in cash,” said Kershaw, adding that the figures are likely to increase over the coming days.Also Read | FBI employee accused of storing classified documents at homeWhat is AN0M?According to New Zealand police, the FBI dismantled encrypted communication platforms, including Canadian-based encryption service company Phantom Secure, used by criminals. Under the covert law enforcement operation, named ‘Operation Trojan Shield’, the FBI created a closed encrypted company called ‘AN0M’ to fill this void. The US federal law enforcement agency distributed the chat app in the criminal underworld through undercover officers. AN0M was initially used by alleged senior crime figures and later trickled down to associates and other criminals as confidence in the app grew.New Zealand police said in a statement that criminal users of AN0M unknowingly communicated on the system operated by FBI agents, believing their devices were protected from law enforcement by the shield of impenetrable encryption. AN0M was used to “target organised crime, drug trafficking and money laundering activities across the globe by monitoring individuals' communications about their criminal offending,” New Zealand police added.‘Operation Trojan Shield’ was led by the FBI and coordinated with the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), AFP, Europol and numerous other law enforcement partners from more than a dozen countries. New Zealand became involved in the operation in January 2020.Also Read | FBI, other agents to start wearing body cameras when serving warrantsWhy did they reveal the existence of the operation?Without further elaborating on it, AFP's Kershaw said that there was a legal time frame for this operation. “Part of it has to do with legal authorities...there is going to be a technical briefing by Assistant Commissioner Ryan,” he said.Talking about the legality of the operation, the commissioner told the reporters that they used the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2018 in combination with legal authority from the FBI. “So there were legal authorities used in relation to this app,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/criminals-fall-for-fbi-s-encrypted-app-an0m-hundreds-arrested-worldwide-101623146217451.html

08-06-2021||World||Nepal resumes vaccination campaign with Sinopharm doses given by China||Nepal resumed its stalled coronavirus vaccination campaign on Tuesday with 1 million doses given by China after the Himalayan nation made international pleas for help with a shortage of doses.Thousands of people, all 64 years old, lined up at vaccination centers even before they opened. People aged 60 to 63 are scheduled in coming days.Nepal’s vaccination campaign began in January but was stalled when neighboring India suffered a coronavirus surge and banned exports of the AstraZeneca vaccine it produces. Nepal had received 1 million AstraZeneca doses donated by India and paid for 2 million more but never received half the shipment.That left 1.4 million people over age 65 who received an initial dose of AstraZeneca vaccine still uncertain if they will receive their second.China's first donation of 800,000 doses of Sinopharm vaccine in March was snapped up quickly.Desperate Nepal made several pleas to foreign governments and international donor agencies. President Bidhya Devi Bhandari made calls to the Chinese leader and wrote to the presidents of India, the United States and Britain.Another 1 million doses donated by China arrived this month.“I am the happiest person today. I finally got the vaccine and I am now protected,” businessman Pawan Khanal said at a Kathmandu vaccine center. “I want to really thank the government.”“Not only me, but my family is also a lot safer now because we got our vaccine,” said another recipient, Gopal Shrestha, who came with his wife.City and health officials said they had been frustrated because of not being able to provide answers to people desperately seeking vaccines. “Everybody wants to get vaccinated and protect themselves,” said Saroj Dhoj Mulmi, a city council member.Nepal's coronavirus cases are declining after a lockdown imposed when infections surged. In April and May, hospitals were treating patients in corridors, parking garages and waiting areas while struggling with shortages of medicine and oxygen.The 4,472 new cases of Covid-19 reported on Monday were about half of the daily numbers reported last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-resumes-vaccination-campaign-with-sinopharm-doses-given-by-china-101623142759066.html
08-06-2021||World||Trade with India jumped by over 70% in 2021, shows China’s customs data||Spurred to an extent by India importing medical goods from China to combat the deadly second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, trade between the two neighbours soared by more than 70% year-on-year to over $48 billion in the first five months of 2021, China’s customs data showed on Monday.Calling it a “spectacular growth”, Chinese state media interpreted the increase in bilateral trade as a sign of resilience in trade ties between the two nations despite conflict at the border and political differences.“Trade between China and India soared 70.1% in US dollar terms in the first five months of this year to $48.16 billion, according to Chinese customs data released on Monday. Specifically, Chinese exports to India grew 64.1% year-on-year from January to May, while imports surged 90.2%,” the tabloid Global Times reported.The India-China trade volume was higher than the trade that Beijing conducted with other trading partners, the report said.The latest statistics were released by China’s General Administration of Customs (GAC) on Monday.As per data available in China, the rise in trade, specifically Chinese exports to India, rose sharply between April and May.Until April, the bilateral trade in goods between China and India in the first quarter of 2021 grew with the total trade volume reaching $27.7 billion, a year-on-year increase of 42.8%.The rise could be attributed to the increase of exports of Chinese medical goods and equipment by Indian companies to fight a surge in Covid-19 cases over the last couple of months.“If anything, these extraordinary growth rates show that China-India trade has largely shrugged off the impact of the political tensions caused by the border friction last year, bouncing back quickly,” the state media report said.India-China trade in 2020 had declined by 5.6% to $87.6 billion, the lowest since 2017. But China still overtook the US to become India’s largest trading partner last year.According to the Indian embassy in Beijing, though overall bilateral trade between the two countries grew exponentially - notwithstanding a fall last year because of the Covid-19 pandemic - India continues to be saddled with a big trade deficit.“The growth of trade deficit with China could be attributed to two factors: narrow basket of commodities, mostly primary, that we export to China, and market access impediments for most of our agricultural products and the sectors where we are competitive in, such as pharmaceuticals, IT/IteS, etc. Our predominant exports have consisted of cotton, copper and diamonds or natural gems,” the Indian embassy wrote on its website under the section “India-China trade and economic relations”.Chinese companies saw an increase in demand from India for medical equipment, especially oxygen concentrators, in the last couple of months following a devastating second wave of the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trade-with-india-jumped-by-over-70-in-2021-shows-china-s-customs-data-101623143023368.html
08-06-2021||World||EU, UK on collision course over Northern Ireland Brexit terms||The U.K. and European Union are on course for a fresh confrontation over Northern Ireland, with the bloc warning of “swift” and “firm” action if Britain again breaches the terms of the Brexit deal.Ahead of a key meeting with Britain’s Brexit minister David Frost on Wednesday, European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic warned Brussels would react strongly if the U.K. fails to implement the parts of the Brexit deal relating to Northern Ireland.“If the U.K. takes further unilateral action over the coming weeks, the EU will not be shy in reacting swiftly, firmly and resolutely,” he wrote in an article for the Daily Telegraph. “Unfortunately, we see numerous and fundamental gaps in the U.K.’s implementation.”The accord -- which U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson agreed to less than two years ago -- created a trade border in the Irish sea, roiling supermarket supply chains and stirring violent protests among Northern Ireland’s unionists. Tensions between the U.K. and EU have been rising for months, with the British criticizing the bloc’s “legal purism” and calling for more flexibility.But in a move that threatens to further undermine trust between the two sides, the U.K. is considering a unilateral extension to a grace period that allows sausages and other chilled meat products to continue to be moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, the Telegraph reported, without saying how it got the information. The grace period is due to expire on June 30.The EU’s patience is running thin and it could use all the tools at its disposal if the U.K. fails to put a stop to unilateral actions and threats, according to an official who asked not to be identified discussing confidential matters. They said that earlier infringement and arbitration procedures weren’t working.Under the terms of the Brexit deal, both sides have the right to impose retaliatory tariffs in extreme circumstances. Separately, the EU could prevent the U.K. financial services industry getting access to the single market.The dispute is escalating at a sensitive time for Johnson, who hosts world leaders in the U.K. for the Group of Seven summit later this week. Brexit encroached on a phone call Johnson held with French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday, ahead of the gathering.Johnson told Macron that “both the U.K. and the EU have a responsibility to find solutions” to the dispute over Northern Ireland, according to a spokesman for the British premier’s office.The onus is on the U.K. to fulfill its obligations or face a much more confrontational future, said the EU official, who said Brussels experts still did not have access to the most basic IT systems to determine what goods are moving where, and thus assess risks linked to plant and animal health.The EU is open to finding solutions, but there are limits to what can be achieved given the political decisions the U.K. has made, the official said. Solutions can only be found within the framework of the protocol, the official added.Defending the U.K.’s stance, Environment Secretary George Eustice said the EU needed to show flexibility to resolve the impasse.“The protocol always envisaged that both parties would show best endeavors to make the protocol work,” Eustice said on Sky News on Tuesday. “What we really need the EU to do is respect that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-uk-on-collision-course-over-northern-ireland-brexit-terms-101623140997779.html

In the run-up to the summit, the U.S. all but abandoned efforts to halt Russia’s construction of an undersea natural-gas pipeline to Europe that could deprive Ukraine of vital transit revenue.In a phone call Monday requested by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Biden reaffirmed strong U.S. support for the former Soviet republic, according to National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.Biden assured Zelenskiy that in his meeting with Putin, “he’ll stand up firmly for Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and aspirations,” Sullivan told reporters.The two leaders spoke in what was their second phone call this year. In addition to those discussions, Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Ukraine in May, promising that the U.S. is taking steps toward boosting security assistance to help counter Russia’s “aggressive” and “destabilizing” actions.Zelenskiy said Monday in a tweet that his trip to Washington will take place sometime next month and discussions will focus on expanding “strategic cooperation.”That’s likely to include long-standing goals such as joining NATO, as well as further strengthening ties with the West. The U.S. already supplies Ukraine with military hardware to help it fight Kremlin-backed forces in the conflict in its easternmost regions.Zelenskiy’s press office initially said Biden stressed his “full support for Ukraine’s euro-Atlantic integration and the importance of a NATO membership plan.” But in an amendment published later, that line was replaced with one from Zelenskiy describing the “importance of granting Ukraine a NATO membership action plan.”While the U.S. President said he opposes the implementation of Russia’s Nord Stream 2 energy pipeline, Blinken said separately on Monday that the project’s completion is a ‘fait accompli.’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-invites-ukraine-president-to-white-house-in-summer-101623140000467.html

To date, 173 million people have been afflicted with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and as many as 3.7 million succumbing to it, apart from trillions of dollars lost in economic opportunity.Also Read: Here's why the Wuhan 'lab leak' theory is back in newsWhile a Wall Street Journal report quoted a May 2020 study by prestigious Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California which concluded that the hypothesis that virus was a lab leak from WIV was plausible, the global community fears that the Xi Jinping regime will follow the Australia example against any country that pins the pandemic blame on China. Hence, all eyes are now on US Intelligence report on the virus origins as tasked by US President Joe Biden in coming weeks.On May 18, 2020, Australian health minister Greg Hunt in his speech at the World Health Assembly said, “We are pleased to have support for an impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation of the global response to the pandemic. We need to learn the lessons from this pandemic and ensure we have the strongest possible health architecture, with an enhanced stability to prevent and respond to future outbreaks.” The Covid-19 resolution was co-sponsored by Australia and the European Union (EU).Also Read: Indian ‘seeker’ among sleuths who raised heat on lab theoryThe Australian health minister also pointed fingers at the WHO in his speech. "This (impartial inquiry) could include an examination of whether the WHO mandate and powers, include around inspection, need to be strengthened to ensure WHO members have timely access to critical data. And we need to protect against the global health threat posed by wildlife wet markets,” he said. The wet market is reference to possible zoonotic spill-over of the virus from bats to humans.The Australian demand for an impartial probe into the origins of the virus at the World Health Assembly (WHA) led to swift retaliation from the Xi Jinping regime with economic sanctions on Australian goods like wine and beef. While a Chinese department accused Australia of having a Cold War mindset, it later suspended the bilateral economic dialogue. Beijing also blames the Australian government for cancelling two deals that the state of Victoria had stuck with China as part of its ambitious belt and road initiative.While President Xi Jinping has directed the Politburo to convey a positive and humble image of China, its wolf warrior diplomats have been issuing threats to even countries like Bangladesh on joining the Quad initiative. Fact is that given the level of investment and exposure by Japanese, American and EU companies in China, it will be very difficult for global powers to call a spade a spade and make Beijing answerable to the pandemic. The matters will be further compounded if the Chinese decide to bring out the American complicity in gain of function research at the Wuhan lab to counter the findings by the much awaited US intelligence report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-retaliation-against-aussies-signal-to-nations-favouring-wuhan-lab-probe-101623139709613.html
08-06-2021||World||'We will be annoying': Thousands of UK police poised for G7 protests||Thousands of police have been drafted in from across Britain to beef up security for what organisers promise will be disruptive and "annoying" protests when G7 leaders gather for a summit this week.The first in-person meeting of the leaders of major developed economies for nearly two years will take place in Cornwall on the tip of southwestern England, with the focus on the Covid-19 pandemic and climate change.Police have closed off roads and coastal paths to Carbis Bay, the small seaside resort which is hosting the event, erecting steel fences and putting other restrictions in place.An extra 5,000 officers have been drafted in to help the operation with about 6,500 officers and staff involved altogether, Devon and Cornwall Police said."Everything that we do will be proportionate and will be legitimate," Assistant Chief Constable Glen Mayhew, who is in charge of policing the summit, said. "We know that the eyes of the world's media will be on us over the next seven days."While the threat of terrorism remains - Britain is on its third highest alert level of "substantial", meaning an attack is considered likely - the most overt issue will be dealing with a swathe of protests, some of which will endeavour to cause major disruption to highlight their causes."Our rights weren’t won through quiet, polite protest. Our rights were won through being noisy, disruptive and annoying," said the Kill The Bill group, one of about 20 activist organisations to have joined a "Resist G7 Coalition" (RG7)."We will be loud. We will be disruptive. We will be annoying," said the group, which is campaigning against a proposed law that would give police extra powers to curb protests.Police say they support the right to peaceful protests and have allocated four sites for protesters to gather. But RG7 - whose number also includes climate change groups, anti-war activists and anarchists - has said it will boycott these."RG7 does not talk or liaise with the cops. Cops will not be welcome into any of our spaces," it said on its website.Extinction Rebellion, which caused traffic chaos in central London with 11 days of protests in 2019, has said it expects some 1,000 protesters to make their way to St Ives, the town next to Carbis Bay, for the summit."We have done our best to plan our actions to be peaceful, creative, artistic and Covid safe," it wrote in an open letter to locals last week. "We sincerely apologise in advance for any additional disruption that we cause."Police have indicated they will be taking a tough line, saying sustained disruption could not be allowed and any public order or criminal offences would be dealt with "robustly"."Assuming that a protest has the intention of causing major disruption, then we would look to clear blocked roads as soon as practicable," police said on their website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-will-be-annoying-thousands-of-uk-police-poised-for-g7-protests-101623139200777.html

The giant sauropod Australotitan cooperensis or 'the southern titan' is among the 15 largest dinosaurs of the world. Australotitan is now the largest known species from Australia, Rochelle Lawrence, senior research assistant, and Scott Hocknull, senior curator, geosciences at Queensland Museum, who were part of the study said ."The new titanosaurian is the largest dinosaur from Australia as represented by osteological remains and based on limb-size comparisons it reached a size similar to that of the giant titanosaurians from South America," the research article read.Also read: 100 million-year-old bones of sauropod dinosaurs discovered in MeghalayaTitanosaurs were the last surviving group of long-necked sauropods and the largest known land-dwelling animals to have ever existed, researchers said. Experts believe that Australotitan would have been "as long as a basketball court" or up to 6.5m (21ft) tall and 30m long."Say hello to Australia’s largest dinosaur & newest species Australotitan cooperensis – the Southern Titan! Nicknamed Cooper, he’s as long as a basketball court & has been scientifically described & named by Queensland Museum & @EromangaNHM paleontologists. ©Vlad Konstantinov," the Queensland Museum tweeted on Monday.The skeleton of the largest dinosaur of the continent was first found on a farm in south-west Queensland by the Mackenzie property owners and excavated with Queensland Museum. The team of researchers nicknamed the dinosaur Cooper based on the nearby Cooper Creek where it was found. Cooper's discovery led to the establishment of the Eromanga Natural History Museum, Lawrence and Hocknull said.The identifying process has been reported to be long due to the remote location of the bones and their sizes and delicate condition, however, many fossils were found intact. The team used new digital technology to capture each bone in 3-D and compare them to the bones of its closest relatives for the first time, Lawrence and Hocknull in the museum's blogpost said.Meet #Australotitan, Australia's largest #dinosaur as we go #BehindtheScenes of this jumbo journey.

08-06-2021||World||Mixed Israeli city of Arabs and Jews remains on edge after violence||Israeli security forces guard the streets of Lod, weeks after rioters torched patrol cars, synagogues and homes. Attackers who killed an Arab and a Jewish resident are still at large. And a mayor whom some blame for setting the stage for some of the worst domestic unrest in Israeli history remains in office.Israel and Hamas reached a truce two weeks ago to end 11 days of fighting in the Gaza Strip. But the roots of the upheavals that wracked Israel’s mixed Jewish-Arab cities during the war have not been addressed, leaving those communities on edge.“It’s hard for me to say what tomorrow will be like. To say that I will have the same trust, it’s hard to say," said Rivi Abramowitz, a Jewish resident of Lod's predominantly Arab Ramat Eshkol neighborhood.Lod, about 16 kilometers (10 miles) southeast of Tel Aviv, next to the main international airport, is home to 77,000 people. About a third are Arabs — many of them descendants of Palestinians who formed the majority of the city before a mass expulsion amid the 1948 war around Israel's creation.An urban landscape of low-rise housing projects from the 1950s and ’60s, the working-class city also is a bastion of hard-line Jewish politics. In the March 23 election, staunchly nationalist parties, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party, won more than 60% of the vote in Lod.Any tensions were largely below the surface — until last month.Clashes between Jerusalem police and Palestinian protesters in and near the Al-Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam's holiest sites, and the planned eviction of Palestinians from homes in an east Jerusalem neighborhood drove some Arab residents of Lod into the streets in protest.On the night that war began between Israel and Hamas, the shooting of an Arab man by a Jewish resident of Lod touched off over a week of violence, and the city was placed under a state of emergency.Similar disturbances, fueled by longstanding Arab grievances over discrimination and lack of opportunities, quickly spread to other mixed areas across the country.In Lod, two residents were killed: Musa Hassuna, 32, by a suspected Jewish gunman, and Yigal Yehoshua, 56, by a suspected group of Arab attackers. No charges have been filed in either case, and police say investigations are ongoing.Some Arab residents point to the election of Mayor Yair Revivo eight years ago as a turning point. Revivo has close ties with a religious nationalist movement known as the “Torah Nucleus,” which promotes what it calls Jewish values in impoverished cities.Critics say Revivo, a member of Likud, has incited hate against Arabs, advanced discriminatory policies and empowered the Torah Nucleus in harmful ways. The group's presence in Lod goes back some 25 years, but its numbers have swelled from two founding families to over 1,000 families today.Before the rioting, Revivo railed against “Arab crime” in his city, calling it an “existential threat to the state of Israel.”“Jewish criminals have a drop of compassion. Arab criminals, you don’t understand, don’t have any inhibitions,” he told Radio 103 in December.In April, he urged the government to launch a military-style operation to clamp down on the “nightmare of gunfire, explosions, fireworks and calls to prayer amplified abnormally at 4 am.”In a letter to Israel's police chief and public security minister, Revivo described “an atmosphere of terror, a Wild West” perpetrated by Arab residents.Days before the May 10 riots, Revivo toured Lod with Itamar Ben Gvir, an ultranationalist lawmaker with anti-Arab views, outraging Arab residents.Ruth Lewin-Chen of the Abraham Initiatives, a nonprofit group based in Lod that promotes coexistence, said its Arab population has grown increasingly frustrated.She cited socioeconomic disparities between Jews and Arabs, violent crime and the absence of effective policing, planning and housing policies. She also pointed to the growing influence of the Torah Nucleus.Many Arabs in Lod view the group with suspicion because of its ties with the West Bank settler movement. Some Arab residents refer to all of them collectively as “settlers.”During the unrest, Arabs targeted property belonging to the religious nationalist community. In response, armed West Bank settlers and other ultranationalists mobilized to Lod, fanning the flames.“We are observant from the religious Zionist community. I don’t see why we’re put into the rubric of ‘settlers,’” said Abramowitz, who has lived in Lod for six years with her husband, who was born in town and whose parents were among the founders of the Torah Nucleus. “Nobody has come to throw out anybody.”Arab politician Mohammed Abu Shikri said that in his decades on Lod's city council, “I’ve never seen a mayor of a mixed city of Arabs and Jews who incites against Arabs, brings in settlers."“I’ve known eight Lod mayors,” he said. Until Revivo, “the mayors always had good relations with the Arabs.”Arabs comprise about 20% of Israel's population and are citizens with the right to vote. But they have long suffered from discrimination, and their communities are often plagued by crime, violence and poverty. They largely identify with the Palestinian cause, leading many Israelis to view them with suspicion.A 2018 report by the Israel Democracy Institute noted disparities in Arab representation in mixed municipalities.Although Arabs make up 30% of Lod’s population, only 14% of municipal employees are Arabs, with only four on the 19-member city council. The city hasn't had an Arab deputy mayor in four decades, the report said.“What does this say about the place of Arabs in the city?” asked Lewin-Chen. Lod lacks almost any facilities for "shared communal life," she said, and city hall does little to bring Jews and Arabs together.A rare exception seems to be the Maccabi Lod boxing club, where Jewish and Arab athletes trained together. “Here we are like family,” said coach Yaacov Wallach.But signs of division are widespread. The town's community center has separate exercise and music classes for Arabs and Jews.In the tense Ramat Eshkol neighborhood, members of the Torah Nucleus community held a circumcision ceremony for a newborn on a recent morning. The next day, an Arab family celebrated the birth of their boy. Although the events were just a block apart, there were no signs of the communities celebrating together.Abramowitz, for her part, says she has cordial relations with her Arab neighbors. But she believes there are limits to how far things can go, saying she wants “live together, but separately.”“There are after-school activities for Arabs, there are after-school activities for Jews,” she said. “We are not interested in mingling — assimilation.”Revivo's office declined interview requests. But it dismissed claims of discrimination, saying he has worked “to improve the quality of life in the Arab community the likes of which hasn’t been recalled since the founding of the city.” It added that “throughout the city, Jews and Arabs live as good neighbors.”Samah Salaimeh, founder of Arab Women in the Center, a Lod-based advocacy group, said she’s optimistic the unrest will be a “wake-up call that we can’t continue this way.”Malek Hassuna, the father of the Arab killed in the unrest, stood by his son's grave, which sits beside those of several generations of the deeply rooted Lod family.“If it's Jew or Arab, it's one blood,” he said, expressing hope his grandchildren will live peacefully with their Jewish neighbors. “I want Lod to go back to how it was 40 or 50 years ago, how it was with coexistence with Jews."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mixed-israeli-city-of-arabs-and-jews-remains-on-edge-after-violence-101623135341203.html
08-06-2021||World||Death toll in Pakistan train collision rises to 63||Pakistani engineers Tuesday combed the mangled wreckage of two trains that collided in a remote farming region, an accident that killed dozens and highlighted huge safety problems on the nation's dilapidated rail network.At least 63 people were killed early Monday when a high-speed passenger train knifed through carriages of another express that had derailed minutes earlier near Daharki in Sindh province.Also Read: At least 36 killed in train collision in Pakistan's SindhArmy and civil engineers have cleared much of the wreckage of carriages crushed like tin cans in the collision, and welders were finalising repairs to the damaged rails.A heavy stench of diesel, sweat and blood hung over the scene, with workers saying bodies were still being pulled overnight from mangled carriages."This is the most colossal accident I have seen in about 10 years of service," railway engineer Jahan Zeb told AFP, his eyes puffy from sleeplessness.The Millat Express was heading from Karachi to Sargodha when it derailed, its carriages strewn over the tracks as the Sir Syed Express from Rawalpindi arrived minutes later in the opposite direction, smashing into it.The accident has reignited debate about the parlous state of Pakistan's public transport system -- particularly a rail network that has seen little investment in decades.It is not known what caused the Millat Express to jump its tracks, but Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid -- a former railways minister -- described that section of the line as "a shambles", while current minister Azam Swati called it "really dangerous".Pakistan Railways said Tuesday that 63 people had died in the accident, issuing two lists that named 51 victims and marked 12 others as unidentified.Usman Abdullah, the deputy provincial commissioner, confirmed the toll.They ranged from a months-old infant to a woman who was 81.Khan Mohammad, station master at nearby Reti junction, said more lives could have been saved if they had just a few more minutes after the derailment."I saw a six- or seven-year-old girl trapped underneath the locomotive, her knee stuck in the track," he said."We somehow rescued her, and she was miraculously alive."But then the oncoming train hit."If there had been a delay of about 10 minutes, this accident could have been averted," he said.The double accident happened around 3:30 am (2230 GMT) when most of the 1,200 passengers aboard the two trains would have been dozing.ak-fox/ecl/qan||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-in-pakistan-train-collision-rises-to-63-101623133576537.html

The meeting was set for early June and could take place as early as this week.Kim's plans were not specified but were described as intending to bring “tangible change" to stabilising the economy and people's living conditions.The North Korean economy has been crippled by decades of mismanagement, US-led sanctions over Kim's nuclear weapons program and the coronavirus pandemic. South Korean officials say there are no signs North Korea is easing the border controls it imposed at the start of the pandemic to import more industrial and agricultural materials to boost production.The Workers' Party last held a plenary meeting of Central Committee members in February, when Kim ripped into state economic agencies for their “passive and self-protecting tendencies” in setting their annual goals.Earlier in the year, at the party's first congress since 2016, Kim urged his people to be resilient in the struggle for economic self-reliance and called for reasserting greater state control over the economy, boosting agricultural production and prioritizing the development of chemicals and metal industries. Those sectors have been critically depleted by sanctions and halted imports of factory materials amid the pandemic.The economic setbacks have left Kim with nothing to show for his ambitious diplomacy with former President Donald Trump, which failed to bring the North sanctions relief, and the North has so far ignored the Biden administration's calls to resume dialogue.Some experts say Kim could use the upcoming Central Committee meeting to address the stalled nuclear diplomacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-shows-plans-to-stabilise-battered-north-korean-economy-in-covid-aftermath-101623124760033.html

Doctors now want to know if it’s also more severe.Hearing impairment, severe gastric upsets and blood clots leading to gangrene, symptoms not typically seen in Covid patients, have been linked by doctors in India to the so-called Delta variant. In England and Scotland, early evidence suggests the now-dominant strain carries a higher risk of hospitalization.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Delta, also known as B.1.617.2, has spread to more than 60 countries over the past six months and triggered travel curbs from Australia to the U.S. A spike in infections, fueled by the Delta variant, has put pressure on the U.K. government to reconsider its plans of reopening later this month. Higher rates of transmission compared with other variants, and a reduction in the effectiveness of vaccines, have made understanding the strain’s effects especially critical.“We need more scientific research to analyze if these newer clinical presentations are linked to B.1.617 or not,” said Abdul Ghafur, an infectious disease physician at the Apollo Hospital in Chennai, southern India’s largest city. Ghafur said he is seeing more Covid-19 patients with diarrhea now than in the initial wave of the epidemic.‘New Enemy’“Last year, we thought we had learned about our new enemy, but it changed,” Ghafur said. “This virus has become so, so unpredictable.”Stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, hearing loss and joint pain are among the ailments Covid-19 patients are experiencing, according to six doctors treating patients across India. Beta and Gamma variants -- first detected in South Africa and Brazil respectively -- have shown little or no evidence of producing different clinical signs, according to a study by researchers from University of New South Wales last month.Some patients develop micro thrombi, or small blood clots, so severe that they led affected tissue to die and develop gangrene, said Ganesh Manudhane, a Mumbai cardiologist, who has treated eight patients for thrombotic complications at the Seven Hills Hospital during the past two months. Two required amputations of fingers or a foot.“I saw three-to-four cases the whole of last year, and now it’s one patient a week,” Manudhane said.Baffling ClotsIndia has reported 18.6 million Covid-19 cases thus far in 2021, compared with 10.3 million last year. The Delta variant was the “primary cause” behind the country’s deadlier second wave and is 50% more contagious than the Alpha strain that was first spotted in the U.K., according to a recent study by an Indian government panel.The surge in cases may have driven an increase in the frequency with which rare Covid-19 complications are being observed. Even still, Manudhane said he is baffled by the blood clots he’s seeing in patients across age groups with no past history of coagulation-related problems.“We suspect it could be because of the new virus variant,” he said. Manudhane is collecting data to study why some people develop the clots and others don’t.Doctors are also finding instances of clots forming in blood vessels that supply the intestines, causing patients to experience stomach pain -- their only symptom, local media have reported.Some Covid patients are also seeking medical care for hearing loss, swelling around the neck and severe tonsillitis, said Hetal Marfatia, an ear nose and throat surgeon at Mumbai’s King Edward Memorial Hospital.“Every person is showing different symptoms” in the second wave, she said.‘Atypical Presentations’The unusual presentations for Delta and a closely related variant known as Kappa, whose spread led to a fourth lockdown in Melbourne, are still being confirmed, said Raina MacIntyre, a professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. “In the meanwhile, it is important to take note of this and be aware of possible atypical presentations,” she said.The most alarming aspect of the current epidemic in India is the rapidity with which the virus is spreading, including to children, said Chetan Mundada, a pediatrician with the Yashoda group of hospitals in Hyderabad.Also read: How Centre will vaccinate all 940 million adults against Covid by DecemberApollo’s Ghafur said he was also seeing entire families with Covid symptoms, instead of the individuals that dominated last year, reflecting an increase in household transmission caused by the Delta variant.Cases of Mucormycosis -- a rare opportunistic fungal infection -- have also been surging in India. It had infected more than 8,800 Covid patients and survivors as of May 22, forcing local health care authorities to call it an epidemic.Even as India’s outbreak begins to ease -- daily infections have slipped to about a quarter of the May 7 peak -- Delta has sparked outbreaks elsewhere, including virus havens such as Taiwan, Singapore and Vietnam, bolstering calls for mass immunization.But with emerging evidence Delta and at least one other variant may be adept at evading vaccine-induced antibodies, pharmaceutical companies are under pressure to tweak existing shots or develop new ones.“New vaccines have to prepared with new variants in mind,” said Ghafur. “We can’t get ahead of the virus, but at least we can least keep up with it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gangrene-hearing-loss-point-to-delta-variant-of-covid-19-being-more-severe-101623126133600.html

Several leaders including Canadian PM Justin Trudeau have condemned the killings and said hate has no place in the Canadian society.Nathaniel Veltman drove his vehicle into the Muslim family, who were out for an evening walk in the town of London in the Canadian province. London police said the victims “were all members of the same family” and the deceased included a 74-year-old female, a 46-year-old male, a 44-year-old female, and a 15-year-old female, and a 9-year-old male, who remains in hospital with serious, but non-life-threatening injuries.Veltman, resident in the same town, was charged with four counts of first degree murder and one count of attempted murder.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was “horrified” with what had occurred. “To the Muslim community in London, and to Muslims across the country, know that we stand with you. Islamophobia has no place in any of our communities. This hate is insidious and despicable – and it must stop,” he said in a tweet.Opposition leader Erin O’Toole described the killings as “vile and extreme hatred”. “This type of vile and extreme hatred must be condemned. An Islamophobic act of terror like this has no place in Canada.”Ontario Premier Doug Ford too said that hate and Islamophobia had no place in the province. “Justice must be served for the horrific act of hatred that took place in London, Ontario yesterday. My thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends during this difficult time. These heinous acts of violence must stop,” he added.A statement released by London police cited investigators to say it was an “intentional” act and that the victims were targeted because of their Islamic faith. “There is evidence that this was a planned, premeditated act, motivated by hate,” it said.Names of the victims were not released due to a request for privacy from family members.At approximately 8:40 pm on Sunday, the black pick-up truck being driven by Veltman mounted the sidewalk and hit the victims who were waiting at an intersection near Hyde Park Road. Veltman then sped away from the scene but was apprehended by police about five minutes after the attack.Offering his condolences to the family, London mayor Ed Holder said in a statement, “I speak on behalf of all Londoners, when I say our hearts are broken. We grieve for the family, three generations of whom are now deceased. We weep for their loved ones. We pray for the recovery of the 9-year-old boy who remains in hospital.” He ordered the flags outside London City Hall to be lowered for three days of mourning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-caught-for-ontario-islamophobic-killings-charged-with-murder-101623123100636.html

He was promised a share of profits.Lata Ramgobin, who is the daughter of noted rights activists Ela Gandhi and late Mewa Ramgobind, was also refused leave to appeal both the conviction and the sentence by the Durban Specialised Commercial Crime Court.When trial in the case against Lata Ramgobin started in 2015, Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) had said that she allegedly provided forged invoices and documents to convince potential investors that three containers of linen were being shipped in from India.At that time, Lata Ramgobin was released on a bail of 50,000 rand.On Monday, the court during the hearing was informed that Lata Ramgobin had met Maharaj, director of the New Africa Alliance Footwear Distributors, in August 2015.The company imports and manufactures and sells clothing, linen and footwear. Maharaj’s company also provides finance to other companies on a profit-share basis. Lata Ramgobin had told Maharaj that she had imported three containers of linen for the South African Hospital Group NetCare."She said she was experiencing financial difficulties to pay for import costs and customs and she needed the money to clear the goods at the harbour,” NPA spokesperson Natasha Kara said on Monday."She advised him (Maharaj) that she needed R6.2 million. To convince him, she showed him what she claimed was a signed purchase order for the goods. Later that month, she sent him what seemed to be a NetCare invoice and delivery note as proof that the goods were delivered and payment was imminent," she said.Lata Ramgobin “further sent him confirmation from NetCare’s bank account that payment had been made”, Kara said.Because of Ramgobin’s family credentials and NetCare documents, Maharaj had entered into a written agreement with her for the loan.However, after Maharaj found out that the documents were forged and NetCare had no arrangements with Lata Ramgobin, he laid criminal charges.Ramgobin was founder and executive director of the Participative Development Initiative at the NGO International Centre for Non-Violence, where she described herself as “an activist with focus on environmental, societal and political interests.”A number of other descendants of Mahatma Gandhi are human rights activists and among them are Lata Ramgobin’s cousins Kirti Menon, the late Satish Dhupelia, and Uma Dhupelia-Mesthrie.Ramgobin’s mother Ela Gandhi in particular has been internationally recognised for her efforts, including national honours from both India and South Africa.

08-06-2021||World||More Chinese companies could be affected by Biden's broader investment ban||President Joe Biden's order last week banning U.S. investment in certain Chinese companies is broader than a similar one signed by his predecessor Donald Trump and has a lower bar, making it easier to add more companies later.Legal experts say it also may help the administration avoid embarrassing defeats in court after a ban imposed near the end of the Trump administration failed to hold up against legal challenges.Biden's order will prohibit U.S. investments in about 60 companies in China's defense or surveillance technology sectors."It's broader in scope and it's a much lower standard for listing," said Washington lawyer Kevin Wolf, a former Commerce Department official, adding it should better withstand legal scrutiny.The new order prohibits investments in companies that "operate in or have operated in" China's defense or related materials sector, or in surveillance technology, or are owned or controlled by someone who does. Its aim is to limit the flow of money to companies that undermine U.S. security or "democratic values," which allows listings for human rights abuses.The Trump ban was placed on Chinese military companies as defined years ago in the National Defense Authorization Act: companies owned or controlled by or "affiliated with" the People’s Liberation Army, a government ministry or the People's Republic of China's defense industrial base.The revised order eliminates the requirement for a direct link to the Chinese state, using the more vague language that a company must "operate in" the defense or surveillance sectors.The Trump order needed to be shored up after three companies went to court to challenge it. Two got their designations halted, and there's been no ruling in the third case."Courts are usually reluctant to overrule the president when he makes a national security determination," said Bill Reinsch, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). "The fact that they did so suggests really poor drafting on the part of the Trump people and a poor defense of the decisions made.""ARBITRARY"Beijing-based smartphone maker Xiaomi, which lost some $10 billion in market capitalization in the month after it was included on the list of banned firms, was the first to bring a case to try to expose flaws in Trump's order.The judge halted Xiaomi's designation in March citing a lack of evidence it was affiliated with the PLA or PRC, and calling its listing "arbitrary and capricious."The government's evidence included an award given to Xiaomi's chairman, which more than 500 entrepreneurs had received since 2004, including the leaders of an infant formula company. It also cited Xiaomi's investments in 5G and artificial intelligence technology, but the judge noted they are fast becoming standard for consumer devices, not just military modernization.The judge also noted errors in the government's decision memo, including incorrectly quoting the statute at issue, and said the government did not meet the definition of "affiliated with," namely, "effectively controlled by another or associated with others under common ownership or control."Last month, the Biden administration agreed to remove the company from the list.Luokung Technology Corp, a mapping technology company, won a similar initial ruling.Neither Xiaomi, nor Luokung nor Gowin Semiconductor, the third company that challenged its designation, are on the revised list.Major Chinese firms included under both orders include China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co Ltd, Huawei Technologies Ltd and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp .Hong Kong-based lawyer Wendy Wysong, who had been considering bringing cases over Trump's order, said Biden's listings appear to be on more solid ground."It may be harder to challenge the designation because the underlying rationale presumably won't be so weak, and the designation criteria is not as narrowly worded," said Wysong.Many more companies could be affected by Biden's order depending on "how aggressive the U.S. administration wants to be," said CSIS's Reinsch."In theory it could expand the universe rather significantly," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-chinese-companies-could-to-be-affected-under-biden-s-broader-investment-ban-101623110728642.html

Also hit with Russian sanctions were Lt. Gen. Mike Rouleau of the Canadian armed forces and Rear Adm. Scott Bishop, the head of the military intelligence command, and Brian Brennan. a deputy police commissioner.The Russian travel ban on Canadian officials follows similar sanctions previously imposed by Moscow against US and European officials in response to their restrictions against Russian officials.Navalny, the most determined political foe of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was arrested in January upon his return from Germany where he spent five months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin — accusations that Russian officials reject. European labs have confirmed that Navalny was poisoned.In February, Navalny was handed a 2 1/2-year prison term on charges of violating the terms of a suspended sentence while he was in Germany. The sentence stemmed from a 2014 embezzlement conviction that Navalny has condemned as politically motivated.Russia has rejected the US and the EU criticism of Navalny’s imprisonment and of Russia’s crackdown on protests demanding his release as meddling in its internal affairs.The tensions over Navalny further exacerbated Russia’s relations with the West, which sank to post-Cold War lows over Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula, the accusations of Moscow's interference in elections and hacking attacks.Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement that Moscow remains open for “the development of our ties on the basis of mutual respect and with the emphasis on cooperation in areas such as the Arctic issues, relations between regions and business ties where our interests objectively converge.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-imposes-sanctions-on-9-canadian-officials-in-retaliatory-move-101623096514194.html

Monaco said the takeaway for the private sector is that if companies come quickly to law enforcement, officials may be able to conduct similar seizures in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/millions-in-ransom-recovered-from-colonial-pipeline-hackers-us-official-101623094054615.html
08-06-2021||World||Kamala Harris tells Guatemalans ‘Do Not Come,’ urges fight against corruption||Vice President Kamala Harris warned Central Americans not to migrate to the US and said the administration will intensify efforts to combat corruption in the region, after meeting with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei on Monday.“Do not come. Do not come,” Harris said at a news conference in Guatemala City. “If you come to our border, you will be turned back.”Harris’s trip is part of the Biden administration’s effort to address the so-called root causes of migration from Central America, after more than 200,000 attempts by migrants from the region to enter the US since the start of the year. President Joe Biden directed Harris to lead the effort to stem the surge in migration.Harris and Giammattei had a “very frank and very candid” conversation that included “the importance of anti-corruption and the importance of an independent judiciary,” she said. In April, the country’s legislature -- controlled by Giammattei’s party -- refused to seat an anti-corruption judge, Gloria Porras, a move criticized by US officials.Giammattei said at the news conference that there are “zero” allegations of corruption against him.The Justice Department on Monday announced new steps to fight human trafficking, including a joint US law enforcement task force and additional assistance to Central American governments to address the problem in their own countries. The department is also stepping up its efforts on investigations, prosecutions and asset recoveries of corruption in the Northern Triangle countries.“Corruption does not know borders,” Harris said. “We have to follow the money and we have to stop it.”The new announcements follow $310 million in humanitarian aid for Central America that Harris unveiled in April.US and regional leaders must “give the people a sense of hope that help is on the way and to then follow through, understanding that hope does not exist by itself,” Harris said earlier as her meeting with Giammattei began. “It must be coupled with relationships and trust. It must be coupled with tangible outcomes, in terms of what we do as leaders to convince people that there is a reason to be hopeful about their future and the future of their children.”Republicans have criticized Harris’s effort, repeatedly noting that she has yet to travel to the US border. She said in response that the reason she’s in Guatemala is “because this is one of our highest priorities,” adding that she wanted to talk about “what we can do in a way that is significant, is tangible.”“I will continue to be focused on that kind of work as opposed to grand gestures,” she said.The Biden administration’s migration strategy is not yet fully formed, and Harris’s advisers have framed her first overseas trip as a fact-finding mission to help develop the policy. The final strategy is not expected to be released until after Harris returns to the USUS officials have said the Biden administration’s plan will center on improving economic conditions in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador so their citizens have less reason to leave. That strategy has been tried before with mixed results; those countries remain among the poorest in the Western Hemisphere and racked by violence.Harris regards corruption as a main driver of migration since it affects all sectors from the economy to criminal justice. She has pledged to work with non-governmental organizations and companies to direct assistance. Later Monday, she plans to meet with civil society leaders and entrepreneurs before flying to Mexico.”These are efforts that have not been tried in the past that we believe will be quite productive,” Harris said.The benefits of greater US financial aid may be used to soften the blow of tough messages Harris and other officials are expected to send about cracking down on corruption and upholding democratic principles.The US has already condemned the government of El Salvador for a recent purge of the judicial branch and views Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez warily since federal prosecutors implicated him in a drug trafficking ring involving his brother.While Harris is meeting with the leader of only one of the three countries that make up the Northern Triangle of Central America, administration officials say they’re also working with El Salvador and Honduras.Harris is expected to meet on Tuesday with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. AMLO, as he is known, said earlier Monday that he will sign a migration agreement with the new US administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-tells-guatemalans-do-not-come-urges-fight-against-corruption-101623093285577.html

Low-income countries have administered just 0.4 per cent, Tedros said, adding that the most frustrating thing about this statistic is that it hasn't changed in months.At the World Health Assembly, Tedros also called for a massive global effort to vaccinate at least 10 per cent of the population of all countries by September, and at least 30 per cent by the end of the year.As this weekend, the leaders of G7 countries will meet for their annual summit, Tedros said "These seven nations have the power to meet these targets. I am calling on the G7 not just to commit to sharing doses, but to commit to sharing them in June and July.""I also call on all manufacturers to give COVAX first right of refusal on new volume of vaccines, or to commit 50 per cent of their volumes to COVAX this year," he added.Tedros also called on companies whose vaccines rely on mRNA technology to share their knowledge with the WHO's Covid-19 Technology Access Pool."We continue to call on companies with mRNA technology to share it through the Covid-19 Technology Access Pool - the result can be a win-win for both the owner of the know-how as well as for public health," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lifting-covid-19-restrictions-too-quickly-can-be-disastrous-for-those-not-vaccinated-who-chief-101623092761664.html

We need to do the same. That's why in this budget, we've requested USD 58.5 billion for the State Department and USAID for Fiscal Year 2022," he said, adding that this budget will strengthen global health."The United States has been a leader in this field for decades in Africa and around the world. We're asking for USD 10 billion for global health programs, including nearly USD 1 billion for global health security, to help us prevent, prepare for, and better respond to future global health crises so we can stop outbreaks before they turn into pandemics that put our safety and our prosperity in danger," he said.He said that the budget will accelerate the global response to climate change and the climate crisis by providing USD 2.5 billion for international climate programs, including USD 1.25 billion for the Green Climate Fund, to help developing countries implement climate adaptation and emissions mitigation programs.Blinken said the budget will double down on the fight for democracy, which, he said, is under threat in too many places."Our budget request includes USD 2.8 billion in foreign assistance to advance human rights, to fight corruption, stem the tide of democratic backsliding, and strengthen and defend democracies, for example, through technical training for elections and support for independent media and civil society. It also requests USD 300 million for the National Endowment for Democracy," he said.Responding to a question from Congressman Gregory Meeks, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Blinken said that China invests about 50 per cent of its global assistance and 50 per cent of its economic diplomacy in the Indo-Pacific. "So this is clearly a priority for them," he said."We are working closely with partners to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific. And our budget reflects that. We have a significant budget allocation for work in the Indo-Pacific for work that we hope the Congress will support, and this will help us engage effectively in the region," he said.He said the President held the "first ever leaders' summit among the so-called Quad countries: the United States, India, Japan, Australia. We are working with them across a number of fronts to strengthen the work that--that we do together in the region."Meeks said last month he unveiled the Ensuring American Global Leadership and Engagement Act or the EAGLE Act which will reinvigorate US institutions and America’s diplomatic efforts to effectively respond to the challenge that's posed by China and boost US engagement in the Indo-Pacific region."In these efforts we must tack from a position of strength but emphasize it through the values that set our nation apart including multilateralism and building alliances, promoting human rights and democracy, and leading the fight against climate change," he said and asked Blinken what are the most critical step to take to advance US engagement, values, and interests in the Indo-Pacific region?Blinken said the budget includes a request of USD 3.6 billion to "pay our assess contributions in full to international organizations, initiatives, and peacekeeping efforts, including to restore America’s annual contributions to the World Health Organization.""As China and others work hard to bend international organisations to their world view, we need to ensure that these organisations instead remain grounded in the values, principles, and rules of the road and rules of the world that have made our shared progress possible for so many decades," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-has-to-revitalise-alliances-and-partnerships-outcompete-china-says-secretary-of-state-antony-blinken-101623085099309.html

Lekhi compared Kejriwal to an infamous conman Natwarlal and asked him not to keep the people of Delhi in the dark by writing letters to the Centre.Political fight escalates on ration delivery plan“Your name is Kejriwal and not Natwarlal, so please stop keeping the people in the dark by continuously writing letters to the Centre,” Lekhi said. The MP was referring to Kejriwal’s letter where he had questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the halting of the doorstep delivery of ration.“People have been made to queue up for ration by the governments in the last 75 years. Sir, let not they remain in ration queues for next 75 years. They will never forgive me or you,” Kejriwal said in his letter to PM Modi.Just interested in abusing Kejriwal: Sisodia slams BJP over ration delivery plan“We are ready to make whatever changes the central government wants in this scheme. Kindly allow us to deliver ration to the doorstep of people,” Kejriwal further added referring to the earlier dispute that arose following usage of the word Mukhya Mantri in the scheme.The Mukhya Mantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna was renamed Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna. Delhi’s government’s doorstep delivery of ration met a roadblock after the Centre stopped the scheme saying that its approval was not taken. Delhi CM Kejriwal, however, maintained that the Delhi government was not legally bound but it sought Centre’s permission to avoid any dispute.Lekhi alleged that by not implementing the One Nation One Ration Card scheme the Aam Aadmi Party-led government wants to bring middlemen in the process and make room for corruption. The Union food and public distribution ministry on Saturday claimed that the Delhi government wants to ‘tinker’ with the Centre’s nationally administered programme. It also alleged that the Delhi government would be doing so at the cost of Delhi consumers by charging the cost of milling etc. from them, according to a report by PTI.BJP leader Vijender Gupta on Sunday also alleged that four lakh fake ration card holders were identified after the Kejriwal government implemented e-PoS system in January 2018 but it never took any action towards weeding them out. Lekhi said if AAP MLAs do not take action against these people then they are also participating in corruption.“You have been the Chief Minister of Delhi for more than five years. Tell me how many licenses of ration shops you have cancelled, how many people have been sent to jail, how many FIRs have been lodged and what actions you have taken in these years besides writing letters to the Prime Minister. If not done, then it is clear that your MLAs and you yourself are part of the mafia,” the BJP Lok Sabha MP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kejriwal-not-natwarlal-lekhi-to-delhi-cm-over-ration-delivery-scheme-101623174045026.html

They are even travelling 250 kilometres to get the jabs,” Vibhu Talwar, medical director of Moolchand Medcity was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Noida: Only UP residents eligible for vaccination of 18-45 groupTalwar said that it was a good sign that people are participating in the Covid-19 and said it reflects that citizens are now taking the pandemic seriously. “People have been coming from Mainpuri, Aligarh, Etawah, Mathura, Delhi, Meerut, Gurgaon, Noida, among other places, to get vaccinated. It is a good sign that people are travelling 250 kilometres to get inoculated against Covid-19,” he further added. A person travelled on a bike to Agra to get his jab.Centre fixes rates private hospitals can charge for three Covid-19 vaccines“There is scarcity of vaccines, especially for the 18-44 age group, in Delhi. I consider myself lucky to get my second dose at the Agra hospital. I believe ₹1,800 and above charged by private hospitals is nothing as compared to a person's life,” the person told PTI.The Delhi government has on several occasions flagged the shortage of vaccines and said that it has impacted the speed of vaccination among people aged between 18-44 years. “It is becoming a serious issue as a lot of people in the 18-44 group are nearing their date for the second dose. We have also come across reports about people travelling 100-200 km to Meerut, Bulandshahr to get their shots because there are no vaccines in Delhi,” AAP leader Atishi flagged on Tuesday.But several beneficiaries were not so lucky. On June 3, several beneficiaries returned from government vaccination centres without getting jabs as authorities said that only those having a state residence proof can avail the facility, citing an order by the state’s mission director of the National Health Mission (NHM), according to a report by HT. This rider does not apply to private hospitals in the state.The Centre on Monday said it will provide a fresh supply of vaccines for this age group on June 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-residents-travel-over-200km-to-agra-to-get-covid-19-jabs-101623172889654.html

08-06-2021||India||House panel meetings to resume from June 21||After a gap of more than two months, Indian parliamentary committees will resume their meeting from June 21, authorities involved in the planning told HT. “The chairpersons of the standing committees have been informed that they can resume panel meetings from June 21,” said a senior MP who heads a panel. Officials maintained that June 21 has been chosen, keeping in mind the lockdowns in some of the states. The authorities expect that by June 21, the remaining lockdowns would be lifted amid an improving Covid-19 situation in large parts of the country. On June 21, the government would also switch over to the centralized vaccine programme in which the Union government would provide free vaccine to the states. Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Monday that the states would not have to pay for the vaccines and all adults can receive free vaccines organized by the Centre. As the national capital and large parts of the country reels under the overwhelming second wave of Covid-19, many House committees had to cancel their meetings in the past few months and no new meeting have been planned. Indian Parliament could work for only 34 days since the pandemic hit Indian shores in March 2020. The entire winter session of 2020 had to be cancelled while the last three other sessions were cut short.The Labour panel, led by Bhartruhari Mahtab, had planned to meet on April 23 on cotton plantations and scheduled a study tour in April. “We had to cancel both. In my panel, at least 15-16 members are in the NCR region or UP and can travel by road to attend any panel meetings. But some of those members were reluctant to come for meetings,” said Mahtab. The panel will now meet on June 23. Earlier, a meeting of the agriculture committee was similarly cancelled, officials said. Another meeting of the IT panel, led by Congress leader Shashi Tharoor had to be cancelled. Usually, three to four meetings of various parliamentary committees are scheduled in a week. Officials said while the Covid-19 situation is preventing some lawmakers living in other states to travel to Delhi, many parliamentary officials too were not attending office and were working from home. “So, even if a panel wants to meet, proper arrangement for that meeting might be a challenge,” said a senior official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-panel-meetings-to-resume-from-june-21-101623164565834.html

08-06-2021||India||There are certain fights you can win only by being cautious: Dr Ashutosh Tewari||Dr Ashutosh “Ash” Tewari, chair of the department of urology at Mount Sinai hospital in New York, has mobilised, collected and shipped crucial life-saving equipment to India, driven by the death of a childhood friend in the second wave of cases and inspired by a colleague’s humanitarian work in Honduras.Tewari was himself infected by Covid-19 in the early days of the pandemic, when New York had turned into the epicentre, and spent two weeks in the ICU at the hospital where he works, looked after by his colleagues.Tewari and his colleague, Michael J McCarry, who is senior vice-president of perioperative services, have led a hospital-wide effort that has sent two consignments of 25 ventilators and 100 sleep apnea machines with kits to convert them to ventilators, along with other medical equipment to India, through chartered flights in three separate shipments.Baba Kalyani of Kalyani Forge and actor Anupam Kher have been a great help, Tewari said, in ensuring his help reached the right places and people. Dr Tewari spoke to Hindustan Times recently. Here are edited excerpts from the interview:Could you talk a bit about your own infection? How do you think you might have contracted it?I was in New York, which was the epicentre of the pandemic, and I was always at work, like my other colleagues. I got it and brought it back home to my wife and daughter, who was with us. My daughter got it from me; she had given birth just a few weeks before.Several doctors got it, and I am one of the lucky ones who is here to talk about it.Also Read | Indian experts urge faster inoculations ahead of free Covid-19 shotsWhen was this? It was in the second half of April and first half of May 2020. I was in the ICU for two weeks.And at that stage, there was no remdesivir (a therapeutic medicine that reduced the severity of the illness and brought rare cheer in the grim pre-vaccine world). There were none of these other therapeutics (such as convalescent plasma and dexamethasone, a common steroid that was used to treat then US President Donald Trump)?That’s the reason I complement my own institution. They had initiated a clinical trial on remdesivir. And I got it. When I do clinical trials now, I appreciate why it’s important to go through them.As you recovered, what did you think was going right or wrong in the US at the time?I focus on what we did right rather than what we did wrong. I don’t have the bandwidth to focus on what happens the other way around. I think that with high population density, some places will have more Covid infections. What we did right was to figure it out in terms of the molecular structure, treatment protocols, medications, figuring out different phases of infection, and Covid-19 long-haulers (people who are left with long-term effects from the illness).We became so innovative in my hospital that while we were figuring out how to get more ventilators, my colleagues in the ICU figured out how to use one ventilator between two patients; they figured out how to make an ICU in our hospital lobby; they t figured out how to create a hospital in the Central Park. Just being innovative and then focusing on the only one thing that we have to deal with. My summary of the whole process is that certain fights you can win by being strong and feisty, but there are certain fights where you can be victorious only by being cautious. This is one in which we have to be cautious, don’t underestimate the enemy, take all the precautions you can, and deal with it. If you still end up getting it, don’t lose hope; there is life after Covid.This is a good time to segue to what’s happening in India, which has touched you personally as you lost a childhood friend to the second wave of Covid-19. As a medical professional, what do you think is happening in India?India is facing the same thing which all other big-number countries have had to deal with. I am a big fan of Indian doctors because it’s a very organic system: doctors, nurses, technicians, nursing homes, clinics, hospitals, big hospitals, all those things they combine in a very interconnected way. I know of my friends who are doctors—they were on non-stop phone calls; they created a network of support systems; they were not sleeping. And that inspires me.But there comes a point when the human hand cannot fix everything, specially Covid. They need gadgets (and equipment) such as oxygen concentrators or ventilators. They (shortages) were an issue here as well and there was no surprise that it was happening in India.Share some personal experiences that you had about Covid as regards India, which really motivated you.I know how innovative the Indian system is. But I was sad that people were dying. I did not want people dying because of the lack of access to equipment. I am far from the battlefield right now in India, and my connections are through WhatsApp, video chats, phone calls and text messages. This is not an easy time, and hopefully. things will change. Covid affected people very close to me, and I lost friends.Could you talk a little bit about that, if it’s not too painful to recount?It was late in the night. His adult kids were talking to me about what to do for their father. They tried to go to different hospitals. Nothing was available. They made it to one with great difficulty, but it was not equipped to treat Covid patients; it wasn’t one of the so-called Covid-designated hospitals. They did everything possible, but they did not have all the gadgets that were needed, and he did not live through the night.Which city was this? And was it during the second wave in April?Kanpur (Dr Tewari’s hometown). Yes, it was during the second wave.Was this the tipping point when you decided you needed to do something?That was the trigger. On one side, I was sad, but I can channelise my sadness into something positive. I think this story has, what you call, serendipity. So, it is happening in April, and in early April, I was talking to a friend of mine who is a senior vice-president at Mount Sinai — nothing to do with India — and he told me that he is doing some things for Covid patients in Honduras. He started talking to me about how innovative he has been in terms of modifying the BiPAP machines (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure machine, a non-invasive form of therapy for patients suffering from sleep apnea) and he was telling me that the machine has saved 100 people; and these are small gadgets. So, I was curious about it, and suddenly this happens (his friend’s death). I said I wish I had something (like this) to give to my friend. At that moment, he said, “you should get this”. And then, he spoke to the (hospital) leadership, and I spoke to the dean and the president of the hospital. The next question was, how will I get them to India. That is when I thought of friends who are resourceful. I reached out to Mr Kalyani of Bharat Forge (Babasaheb Neelkanth Kalyani, chairman and managing director).I said, “Baba, I have lots of gadgets, can you get them to India?” He said, “Sure”. I did not care where this equipment went as long as they ended up in good hands. So I reached out to Anupam Kher, whom I had met at social events in New York. He also said, “Why not? I will figure it out”.I started with couple of hundred items, and then the cascade happened. That small consignment led other people to look at what I was doing, and they started reaching out to me. We have sent two consignments, and the third one is waiting to go soon.So you are collecting the equipment, Baba Kalyani is flying it to India, and Anupam Kher is essentially distributing them?That’s right. And then, every now and then if I have requests, I just share the list with them.Have you thought of travelling to India anytime soon?Yeah, as soon as travelling gets easier, I will.And you still have a lot of family there?My mom is there, fully vaccinated; I lost my father some time ago. I have a typical Indian family with lots of chachas, mamas, cousins, mausis and buas (uncles, cousins, aunts). That’s who I am.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/there-are-certain-fights-you-can-win-only-by-being-cautious-dr-ashutosh-tewari-101623162585936.html

The central government cited that it is facing a shortage of officers at these levels.The personnel ministry asked the state governments not to nominate officers who are on the verge of promotion, citing that the promotion often leads to their early repatriation to their cadre to avail the benefit. “It may be ensured that the names of only those officers are forwarded who are likely to remain available under the Central Staffing Scheme (CSS) for full tenure,” the letter issued by the personnel ministry said.“It is, therefore, requested that a larger number of officers may kindly be recommended for appointment at DS/Director/JS level under the Central Staffing Scheme so that the central deputation reserve/ deputation reserves are duly utilised for this purpose,” the communique further said.The CSS allows officers of the level of deputy secretary, deputy director and above to be appointed on central deputation in ministries of the central government or central government’s departments. The personnel ministry in December had asked state governments for officers to be deputed under CSS as well as for the posts of chief vigilance officers (CVOs) and in central public sector enterprises (CPSEs). It also sought officers to be deputed to central ministries and departments.The Centre said that the nomination received after its communique issued in December has been ‘very minimal’.“The number of nominations received so far has been very minimal and as such the representation of officers from various cadres or services especially at DS and Director level is extremely low,” the letter said. It also pointed out that working under the CSS adds to the experience of officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-tells-states-to-nominate-more-officers-for-central-deputation-101623161511285.html

08-06-2021||India||Indian experts urge faster inoculations ahead of free Covid-19 shots||Indian officials and health experts welcomed a federal government plan to give free Covid-19 shots to all adults as a step in the right direction on Tuesday, but cautioned that vaccinations must be accelerated to prevent new surges in infections.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday the federal government would take over the inoculation programme from Indian states and offer free doses to everyone over the age of 18.His announcement on national television followed weeks of criticism of a vaccine rollout that has covered fewer than 5% of India's estimated adult population of 950 million. This has left the country vulnerable to another wave of infections after a surge in April-May which government data showed killed 170,000."Took him 4 months but after much pressure, he has finally listened to us and implemented what we've been asking all this while," Mamata Banerjee, chief minister of West Bengal state, wrote on Twitter.India has been giving an average of 2.4 million shots a day. Health officials say this is far from adequate for a country as large as India."We need to vaccinate 7-8 million persons per day to meet the target of covering all the eligible persons before the end of December," Giridhara Babu, a member of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the country's main health research agency, told Reuters.Babu is part of the national taskforce's working group on epidemiology and surveillance.Daily infections have fallen and officials aim to switch the focus to mass vaccinations. India reported 86,498 new cases overnight, the lowest number in over two months and a sharp drop from a peak of around 400,000 a day in May.India has been inoculating its people with AstraZeneca shots produced at the Serum Institute of India, and Covaxin made by Indian firm Bharat Biotech. It is set to commercially launch Russia's Sputnik V in mid-June.One reason for the low coverage is that supplies are tight. At Delhi's Sir Ganga Ram hospital, there are no supplies of AstraZeneca, a hospital executive said.Authorities in Delhi have asked hospitals to stop giving the first dose of home-produced Covaxin to people aged from 18 to 44 and focus instead on the elderly until supplies improve, a spokesperson of the party governing the city said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-experts-urge-faster-inoculations-ahead-of-free-covid-19-shots-101623157002741.html
08-06-2021||India||These assembly polls, Cong lost most candidates to other parties: ADR report||During the recent assembly elections in Puducherry, Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, Congress saw the most candidates leave the party, reveals a report by National Election Watch and Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR). The report also shows that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was their favourite destination.The report, which came out of the analysis of affidavits of 60 candidates and 51 MLAs who changed parties and contested the recent elections in these 4 states and Union Territory of Puducherry, says that the trend suggests that “private interest of politicians” is gaining over “interest of citizens”.Out of the 60 candidates who changed their parties, 8 were from Congress, followed by AIADMK, AIUDF and BJP which lost five candidates each.As far as welcoming turncoats is concerned, the BJP inducted 20 of them. This was followed by Trinamool Congress which welcomed 8, and the Congress that inducted 5.As many as 20 of the 51 MLAs who left their parties belonged to Congress. This was followed by 15 MLAs who left Trinamool Congress to join a different party to contest elections.Also Read | Suvendu Adhikari meets home minster Amit Shah, says discussed several mattersAgain, BJP topped the list by welcoming the most defectors. 20 out of 51 re-contesting MLAs joined the BJP followed by 17 who joined the Trinamool and 7 who joined AMMK.A look at the financial assets also shows that it is mostly the monied politicians who have switched sides. Out of these 60 candidates, 29 are crorepatis with JD(U) defector MV Shreyams Kumar from Wayanad, who joined Loktantrik Janata Dal, being the richest. As per his latest election affidavit, Kumar owns assets worth 88 crore rupees.Similarly, out of 51 MLAs who contested from other parties, 35 are crorepatis. Pointing out the most plausible reasons behind such defections, the report mentions that the absence of value-based politics, non-existence of laws on functioning of political parties have led to “skewing of fundamental principles of Indian democracy”.HT also analysed how these turncoats fared in the elections. Out of 60 candidates who changed parties, 39 lost the elections, with the highest being 19 from Bengal where 25 candidates had left their parties. In Kerala, 7 candidates left their parties and 6 of them lost. Similarly in Tamil Nadu, 13 left and 8 of them lost. In Assam, 13 candidates left their parties but only 5 lost. In Puducherry, one of two defector candidates lost.With regard to MLAs who changed parties and contested, 29 out of 51 lost elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/these-assembly-polls-cong-lost-most-candidates-to-other-partiesadrreport-101623158685395.html

In his response, Ramdev has said his comments were taken out of context and blown out of proportion while he was merely questioning the excessive use of experimental therapy.He added several medical experts have also expressed concerns about the overuse of the experimental therapies and that many of them were later removed from the treatment protocol. Ramdev said he holds no ill will against any discipline of medicine.“The notice issued by you … is completely misconceived, devoid of merits, and has been issued on the basis of incomplete information. Therefore, … you are advised to withdraw your notice immediately,” Ramdev said in his response to the notice by Federation of All India Medical Associations (FAIMA).Ramdev last month said he was “withdrawing” the controversial remarks hours after Union health minister Harsh Vardhan asked him to rescind them.Also Read | A year of internal and external challengesEarlier, in a letter addressed to Ramdev, Vardhan said: “People of this country are extremely hurt by your comments against allopathic medicines, and doctors. Your explanation issued yesterday on your comments has not helped much in healing the hurt sentiments of people…”Ramdev referred to his statement that about 10,000 doctors died despite vaccination, and added he was echoing the concern of the masses that medical professionals were dying despite immunisation.At least 646 doctors have died of Covid-19 during the second wave of infections and 753 during the first wave, according to the Indian Medical Association (IMA). IMA has pointed out no vaccines were available during the first wave and most of those who died during the second wave had not been able to take their shots.Suvrankar Datta, general secretary, FAIMA, said they will seek legal opinion on the way forward. “...we shall be working along with... IMA and other Doctor Associations to decide our next course of action. We shall be initiating a nationwide meeting of all major associations this week to decide on the major issues including violence against doctors and how to stop systematic misinformation campaigns against modern medicine by self-proclaimed spiritual leaders,” he said.Several medical associations joined the black ribbon protest called by the Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association on June 1 to protest against the statements of Ramdev.The IMA also sent Ramdev a legal notice over the remarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ramdevs-response-to-doctors-body-statements-withdrawn-no-merit-in-notice-101623155325132.html

A jail term of two years can effectively bar the individuals from contesting elections for a period of six years.Also Read: ‘Election Commission has always been neutral and impartial’: CEC Sushil ChandraThe Election Commission proposed a ban on political advertisements on newspapers during the ‘silence period’ -- between the end of electoral campaigning and the day of elections. The poll body also proposed to make “paid news” an electoral offence.All of these proposals require an amendment to the Representation of the People Act, 1951.The commission also suggested an extension of the Section 126 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, to bring print media under its purview and ban any political advertisement on the day of polling. Currently, only electronic media is barred from displaying political advertisements during the 48 hours before polls conclude.The poll body sought to link Aadhaar numbers with electoral rolls. The proposal, which was initially suggested in August 2019, wants to empower electoral officers enough to seek Aadhaar details of existing voters as well as new voters. Chandra told Hindustan Times that this is to eliminate duplication and to make it easier for people to transfer their votes when they move to a different constituency. In 2015, the Supreme Court had halted a previous attempt by the election commission to link Aadhar number with electoral data.Prasad had said to the Lok Sabha in a written reply recently that the proposed amendments are under consideration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cec-nudges-centre-on-pending-electoral-reforms-seeking-ban-on-paid-news-aadhaar-electoral-rolls-linkage-101623150559728.html

"No data, global or Indian, has had any observations of children being affected more. Even in the data from the second wave kids who were infected had mild illness or co-morbidities," he said. "In many parts of the world where new waves are happening there's no data to show children are being severely affected," he added.Watch | 'Black Fungus not a new disease': AIIMS doctor demystifies Mucormycosis ﻿﻿The AIIMS director said that the majority of the children who were infected recovered with no hospitalisation unless they had co-morbidities.

"Since she got it validated fraudulently from Caste Scrutiny Committee by producing fabricated and fraudulent documents, caste certificate is cancelled and stands confiscated," the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court said, according to news agency ANI.A division bench of Justice RD Dhanuka and Justice VG Bisht directed her to surrender it within six weeks. The bench also imposed a fine of ₹200,000, which she needs to pay to the Maharashtra Legal Services Authority within two weeks.According to PTI, the high court noted her claim of belonging to 'Mochi' caste for obtaining the Scheduled Caste certificate itself was fraudulent. The court also said that it made with an intention to avail benefits given to a candidate from such category, despite knowing she does not belong to that caste.“I respect the court's order as a citizen of this country. I will approach the Supreme Court. I am confident that I will get justice,” Navneet Kaur Rana said after the court’s order, according to ANI.The Bombay High court pronounced the order cancelling the lawmaker’s caste certificate on the complaint filed by veteran Shiv Sena leader Anandrao Adsul.

The most important issue raised during the meeting was political reservation for the Maratha community and Other Backward Classes. The state government has requested the Centre to accord reservation to Marathas from the Central quota and remove the 50% ceiling on reservation.Also Read | Maharashtra records 10,219 Covid-19 cases“The Centre has already filed a review petition in the Maratha reservation ruling, challenging the apex court’s ruling that state governments do not have powers to decide the backwardness of any community after the 102nd constitutional amendment. We requested the Centre that empowering the states with the powers to decide the reservation will not be sufficient until the cap of 50% on the reservation is removed. We have requested the Centre to take legal steps to remove the cap, as it has affected not only Maratha reservations, but many others, including political reservation to OBCs,” Thackeray said, while addressing the media at Maharashtra Sadan after the meeting.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said that the state has demanded constitutional political reservation to OBCs. “The political reservation in the local body elections to the OBCs has been struck down recently by the Supreme Court. It was the statutory reservation and has been quashed as it was surpassing the 50% cap. The verdict will impact in all elections across the country. We have requested the Prime Minister to accord constitutional reservation to OBCs,” Pawar said.Pawar said that the delegation also requested that the governor of Maharashtra be instructed to nominate 12 members to the legislative council from his quota. “The names were submitted to the governor around eight months ago. Taking note of a PIL, the high court has asked for a submission. We have requested the PM to instruct the governor for the nominations. We have also requested the PM for the quick release ₹24,306 crore due towards the compensation of losses of GST to the state exchequer,” Pawar said .Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said that the Prime Minister has assured the delegation he will consider the issues raised by them. “He said he will take detailed information on each of the issues and take positive steps,” Thackeray said.After the meeting with the delegation, PM Modi met Thackeray in a one-on-one meeting for around 30 minutes. “Yes, we had a separate meeting.

08-06-2021||India||Stop illegal adoption of kids orphaned by Covid: SC to states, UTs||The Supreme Court has directed states and Union Territories to stop illegal adoption of children who were orphaned or abandoned during the Covid-19 pandemic.Passing a slew of directions on a suo motu petition with regard to protection of rights of children affected by the pandemic, a bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose said, “The state governments/Union Territories are directed to take action against those NGOs/individuals who are indulging in illegal adoptions.”The court was informed about adoption posts circulating on various social media platforms amid the pandemic that saw several children lose either one or both their parents.The problem of illegal adoption was brought to the attention of the court by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR). The commission received complaints where the identity of the affected children was disclosed in public announcements by agencies and individuals inviting interested persons to adopt them. Such adoption routes were in violation of the Juvenile Justice Act which prescribes adoption through Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA).An application filed by NGO ‘We the Women of India’ informed the court about adoption requests on social media, which, upon enquiry by the NGO, were found to be fake. The NGO through advocate Shobha Gupta stressed the need for immediate action to be taken by states and UTs to stop the circulation of such posts on social media and take stringent action against persons responsible for making such posts.The bench directed all states/UTs to prevent any NGO from collecting funds in the names of affected children by disclosing their identity and inviting interested persons to adopt them. “Stringent action shall be taken by the state governments/Union Territories against agencies/individuals who are responsible for indulging in this illegal activity. Invitation to persons for adoption of orphans is contrary to law as no adoption of a child can be permitted without the involvement of CARA.Among other orders given by the court, the states and UTs were directed to ensure continuation of education of children affected by Covid-19 in both government and private schools. The directions came on a similar suggestion by amicus curiae advocate Gaurav Agrawal.The bench said, “The state governments/Union Territories are directed to make provisions for continuance of education of the children both in Government as well as in private schools.”On June 1, the Supreme Court had directed states to identify children who were abandoned, orphaned or lost one of their parents during Covid-19 since March 2020 by uploading the information on a website “Bal Swaraj” run by NCPCR. On June 6, NCPCR informed the court that there are 30,071 such children of which 3,621 lost both parents, 26,176 lost one, and 274 were abandoned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stop-illegal-adoption-of-kids-orphaned-by-covid-sc-to-states-uts-101623144643654.html

He added if they waited, then it would have been difficult for them to track the residents in the upper reaches of the Gurez region and they could not have been vaccinated before October. He said the second dose would be given after 12 weeks and they have asked the residents for details of their locations in the meadows where they will be headed to.Also Read | With 977 cases, J&K’s daily count drops below 1,000 after 56 daysIqbal said the residents came forward for the vaccination drive only after proper counselling. “Two weeks ago, when we sent a team there, only six people including the village head came forward for the vaccination.” He said the village head, Lal Bhat, motivated the remaining adults of the village to get vaccinated.He said a 10-member team led by a doctor vaccinated 362 people over the two days it was stationed in the village for the vaccination drive.The health department quoted Bhat saying when other residents saw him taking the jab without any side-effect, they too overcame their hesitancy. Bhat thanked the department for their “tremendous work.”Director general (health, family welfare, and immunisation) Saleem-ur-Rehman said Weyan was on their priority list because the residents of the village are nomads. He said it is among villages in Jammu and Kashmir where their teams have to trek long distances to vaccinate people. “Like Weyan, the department has shortlisted many such villages where 100% population above 18 will be vaccinated.”Rehman said Jammu and Kashmir was doing well in terms of immunisation. “Already 35 lakh [3.5 million] doses have been administered which is a good average and we will try to improve it further in the coming days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashmir-village-first-in-country-to-record-100-covid-vaccination-101623144583295.html

08-06-2021||India||Arunachal officer offers 20 kg free rice to break vaccine hesitancy, it works||An Arunachal Pradesh government officer’s offer of free 20 kgs of rice as an incentive for getting vaccinated against Covid-19 has broken through the reluctance among some residents aged above 45 years and managed to accelerate the vaccination drive in Lower Subansiri district.The incentive was planned by Yazali circle officer Tashi Wangchhu Thongdok, and it successfully lured the residents to the vaccination center. Yazali has a population of around 12,000 and nearly 1,400 of its residents are above 45 years. While 84% of these residents had received their due doses, the remaining 209 residents were unwilling despite the administration’s attempts to vaccinate them at home.“Some were unwilling to give up alcoholic drinks for a few days after vaccination, while others were dissuaded by a fake viral message on WhatsApp which claimed vaccination will lead to death in two years. We carried out awareness drives telling people that the message was false and the benefits of vaccination outweigh minor discomforts,” Thongdok told HT over phone.Since April this year, Yazali has recorded 243 Covid-19 positive cases, including 190 persons who have recovered and 53, who are still active. The area has not witnessed any Covid-19 deaths.“We were lucky to find two sponsors who donated the money needed to procure rice for the 209 people who were yet to be vaccinated. We decided to run the campaign for three days from June 7 to June 9, urging people to visit the vaccination centre at Yazali to get their jabs,” said Thongdok, an Arunachal Pradesh civil service officer from the 2016 batch.Despite heavy rains, on Monday, the first day of the campaign, nearly 50 people turned up, got vaccinated and took their 20 kilos of rice each. The authorities are confident that in the next two days all other eligible beneficiaries will come forward and get vaccinated.“When the circle officer approached me with the idea, I immediately decided to help out. Along with my school friend, Taba Nagu, who is also from Yazali, we transferred the amount needed to procure the rice,” said Licha Birbal, a businessman from Yazali, who is based in Guwahati these days.Till Monday, Arunachal Pradesh recorded 29,696 Covid-19 cases and 125 deaths. The state has a recovery rate of 88% and 3,440 active cases at present. Around 385,000 people in the state have got vaccinated till date with 306,000 persons getting the first dose and nearly 79,000 receiving both the doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arunachal-officer-offers-20-kg-free-rice-to-break-vaccine-hesitancy-it-works-101623144103428.html
08-06-2021||India||Tourist guides struggle to make ends meet as pandemic hits sector hardest||Faheem Khan, a government-registered tourist guide, familiarised foreign tourists to Delhi at Archaeological Survey of India (ASI)-protected monuments in the city until March last year when the Covid-19 pandemic prompted a nationwide lockdown. As someone who largely guided foreign tourists, Khan could not fully resume work even after lockdown restrictions were eased. The surge in Covid-19 cases this summer worsened the situation of guides such as Khan. They say they do not expect the situation to get better as foreign tourists were unlikely to return anytime sooner. “International flights were stopped... Since then, our work has halted,” said Khan, a Persian language expert with a doctorate from Jawaharlal Nehru University.Financial distressWith all his savings drying up and no source of income, Khan returned home in Bihar last month and took up farming for survival. “There are zero work opportunities for people like me who were dependent on international tourism. We are struggling to make ends meet. I returned to my village and have taken up farming for sustenance,” said Khan, who is from Sarai in Bihar’s Vaishali district.He said tourism was among the first sectors to be affected and has not seen any recovery. “Most other sectors picked up post unlock [easing of lockdown norms]. There was no revival or change in circumstances for guides who rely on international travellers,” he said.Domestic tourism picked up slowly post the lockdown, but it hardly made any difference to the lives of tourist guides such as Khan. International visitors are a major source of income for them since the percentage of domestic tourists availing of their services is negligible. “Within the country, a major section of tourists are budget travellers. They do not hire guides. We have waited for hours at monuments but hardly anyone approached us. Foreigners working in India are the only ones who approach us but even those opportunities have been curtailed...”Pleas for financial supportDildar Singh, another tourist guide, said he has been without work since last year. Singh guided tourists of different nationalities due to his ability to speak at least seven languages. “The market is broken. On top of that, the lockdown is another added burden. We have been sitting idle at home for the past one and a half years. There is no stipend or medical support either,” said Singh, who is in his 60s.Also Read | Delhi lost over 300 trees in three weeks. Experts explain what needs to be doneFinancial support has been extended to guides in places such as Kerala and Jammu & Kashmir, but there has been no such assistance in Delhi. “Nearly 90% of tourists visiting the country visit Delhi and other cities in the northern region but no support has been given to us,” said Singh.Government Approved Tourist Guides’ Association president Sanjeev Kumar said the guides, who are at the lowest rung of the tourism sector, have been badly hit and 17 of their associations sought financial support in March last year but received no response. “There are around 500 registered guides in Delhi-NCR [National Capital Region] alone and nearly 4,000 in the country. The government has not provided any monetary support.”Sanjay Sharma, president of the Tourist Guides Federation of India, said the government ignored their demands. “The guides are the front-line warriors of the tourism industry but unfortunately we have not received any support despite reaching out to the tourism minister, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and everyone else. They have not even acknowledged our grievances.”Online course, a new challengeKumar said the introduction of the Incredible India Tourist Facilitator Certification Programme last year to create more opportunities in the tourism industry has added to their woes. Participants, who have cleared their Class 12 exams, are eligible to become certified tourist facilitators under the tourism ministry after completing the programme.Kumar said they are facing a double whammy of the pandemic and the government apathy. “It is ironic that when the government should be supporting us to overcome the hardships due to Covid-19 pandemic, it is trying to abrogate our licenses,” said Kumar. He blamed the government for failing to guarantee a minimum of 90-day work required by the ministry’s guidelines. “The world is thinking about ways to restore the employment of at least a part of the people engaged in tourism, but our government is thinking of creating further employment which is nothing but a farce.”Singh said the pandemic snatched their livelihood and the introduction of facilitators was a threat to people who have spent decades in the sector. “Most old guides are graduates, post-graduates, or PhD holders with fluency in multiple languages. The government has approved [as guides] even [those who have just cleared Class 12 exams]... How can facilitators be equal to guides? This is a cruel joke since registered guides like us are unable to get any work,” said Singh. He called tourist guides cultural ambassadors of any country and asked the government to help them amid the crisis.Also Read | Centre releases revised Covid-19 vaccination drive guidelinesAn ASI official, who did not wish to be named, said the government started the online certification programme last year, but more clarity on it would be available once the Covid-related restrictions are lifted.The tourism ministry did not respond immediately to an HT request for comments.Tour operatorsThe pandemic has also hit tour operators and travel agents. Paharganj, a popular destination for tourists and a hub of low-budget hotels, restaurants, and shops, has been wearing a deserted look since last year.Anil Bhardwaj, a travel agent and moneychanger, has not reopened his shop in the market since March 21, 2021. A Haryana native, he has fallen back upon farming. He is among those whose businesses in the market have been shuttered in the absence of foreign tourists, their primary clientele. “I have not opened my office since last year since there are no foreign tourists. My work is 99% dependent on foreign tourists. Nearly 50% of the market is deserted. Paharganj is on the verge of devastation,” said Bhardwaj, 53. He said the entire tourism ecosystem, from hotels to cabs, has been hit. “I get daily calls from cabbies from other cities who used to get clients through me. Hotels are barely surviving with two staff members. Our future looks uncertain.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tourist-guides-struggle-to-make-ends-meet-as-pandemic-hits-tourism-sector-hardest-101623142843201.html

Wastage of vaccine will affect the allocation negatively,” the guidelines say.The government of India will provide states and Union territories advance information of vaccine doses to be supplied to them. States will have the flexibility to further allocate doses well in advance to districts and vaccination centres.States have been advised to put information in the public domain about the availability at district and vaccination centre level, and widely disseminate it among the local population,In order to incentivise production by vaccine manufacturers and encourage new vaccines, domestic vaccine manufacturers have been given the option to also provide vaccines directly to private hospitals.“This would be restricted to 25% of their monthly production. States/UTs would aggregate the demand of private hospitals keeping in view equitable distribution between large and small private hospitals and regional balance. Based on this aggregated demand, Government of India will facilitate supply of these vaccines to the private hospitals and their payment through the National Health Authority’s electronic platform. This would enable the smaller and remoter private hospitals to obtain timely supply of vaccines, and further equitable access and regional balance,” the guidelines said.Each vaccine manufacturer will declare the price of vaccine doses for private hospitals, and any subsequent changes would be notified in advance. The price to offer the service has been capped by the government at a maximum of ₹150 per dose as service charge.State governments have been directed to monitor the amount that private hospitals are charging. While all citizens irrespective of their income status are entitled to free vaccination, the government encourages those with the ability to pay to use private hospital’s vaccination centres.The revised guidelines will come into effect from June 21, 2021, and will be open to review.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-revises-vaccine-policy-healthcare-frontline-workers-to-be-prioritised-101623140862979.html

Officials have said that vaccination in Weyan village was covered under the J&K model, a 10-point strategy to inoculate everyone who is eligible for the shots at a faster pace.

Nearly 6,000 orders such orders were issued until the first week of June this year up from around 3,600 in 2019 and over 9,800 in 2020. The government has sent Twitter two non-compliance notices for failing to act against certain accounts in the last six months over posts on the ongoing farmers’ agitation and the Covid-19 pandemic. Also Read | Committed to complying with new IT rules: TwitterIn January, the government asked Twitter to take down content on the farmers’ agitation that carried a controversial hashtag regarding the Prime Minister, saying that it was a threat to public order. While Twitter withheld access to the posts, it refused to take down content by activists and journalists saying that it violated the tenets of free speech. A month later, as the impasse between the government and Twitter continued over the demand to block 257 accounts and posts related to farmers’ protests, the government asked the company to take over 1,178 accounts that may “foment trouble”.In April, the government issued emergency blocking orders to take down over 100 “inflammatory” posts and accounts across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram related to Covid-19, including an official Facebook page of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. The government faced pushback against the orders with many arguing that the posts ordered to be blocked were critical of the government’s handling of the Covid pandemic.Twitter will have to face “unintended consequences” including losing the legal protection from criminal liability that it currently enjoys if it does not comply with the new rules for digital content, according to a “last notice” issued on Saturday as a “gesture of goodwill” by the government to the social media firm.The warning escalated a worsening standoff between the government and the social media company, which has previously urged the Centre to give it more time to comply with the new IT rules and raised concerns over the “core elements” of the norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-blocks-local-access-to-accounts-of-jazzy-b-3-others-on-govt-request-101623135342521.html
08-06-2021||India||Free vaccines, food to cost India additional $11 billion: Official||India will need to spend an additional 800 billion rupees ($11 billion) to provide free vaccines and food to millions of people devastated by the deadly coronavirus wave, people with knowledge of the matter said.The government will earmark an additional 700 billion rupees for providing food to the poor and other eligible groups until November, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the numbers aren’t public. The administration will need an extra 100 billion rupees to provide free vaccinations, they said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed Monday to provide free inoculations, reversing a policy where states ended up competing for supplies for certain age categories, leading to severe shortages. His administration also has been criticized for its handling of the second wave of the virus, which has killed thousands of people in India.In an address on national television, Modi said all Indians above age 18 can be vaccinated for free starting June 21, to speed up the inoculation drive.The government may not have to tap the bond market for the funds, the people familiar said, citing the 991.2 billion-rupee dividend the government received from the central bank and expected inflows from asset sales. With the extra money, the government will end up spending a total of 1.3 trillion on providing food, the people said, and has set aside 350 billion rupees for vaccinations in the budget.A finance ministry spokesman declined to comment.Even after accounting for the bumper dividend from the Reserve Bank of India and better growth numbers that should result in higher tax revenue, the “fiscal math will likely worsen,” said Madhavi Arora, an economist with Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. in Mumbai. That’s because of higher payouts on food and fertilizer subsidies as well as for a rural jobs-guarantee program. There’s also a risk that the asset-divestment program could raise less money than anticipated.“Amid various push and pull there is a likelihood of fiscal slippage, to the tune of around 0.5% from the initially budgeted 6.8% of gross domestic product,” she added, referring to the expected fiscal deficit.India has administrated 232 million doses since the world’s biggest vaccination drive began Jan. 16, with 3.4% of the population now fully immunized. At that pace, it will take another 22 months to cover 75% of the population, according to the Bloomberg Vaccination Tracker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/free-vaccines-food-to-cost-india-additional-11-billion-official-101623134161328.html
08-06-2021||India||Before PM Modi changed Covid vaccine policy, a nudge from the Supreme Court||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday announced that the Central government will resume procuring 75% of vaccines made in the country and giving them for free to states from June 21 to vaccinate all adults in the country.PM Modi’s announcement, which marks a significant departure from the liberalised policy introduced on May 1, comes less than a week after the Supreme Court’s strong disapproval of the Centre’s policy along with a direction to the Union government “to undertake a fresh review of its vaccination policy”.On June 2, a 32-page order by a bench comprising justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat underscored that the Union government’s vaccination policy, which put the entire onus of giving doses to adults in the below-45 year age group on the states and private hospitals, was “prima facie arbitrary and irrational”.The bench said the policy, which required people in the 18-45 age group to pay for the vaccine, “conflicts with the constitutional balance of responsibilities between the Centre and states” in conducting free vaccination themselves for groups under the first 2 phases.The court’s June 2 order was a culmination of its proceedings on May 31 when the bench pressed for a review of the vaccination policy, observing that “policymakers must have their ears to the ground”.To be sure, the Centre’s second-most senior law officer, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, strongly opposed judicial review of the vaccination policy, contending that “any overzealous judicial intervention” by the Supreme Court may lead to unintended circumstances.But the bench rejected this argument, highlighting that the Constitution did not envisage courts “to be silent spectators when constitutional rights of citizens are infringed by executive policies. Judicial review and soliciting constitutional justification for policies formulated by the executive is an essential function, which the courts are entrusted to perform.”Mehta also asked the bench to desist from commenting on the pricing policy but the judges were emphatic on the lack of rationale and equity behind the “dual pricing” that requires states to pay at least twice as much as the Centre for the vaccines. The judges said the government should negotiate and buy vaccines for the entire country “in a national crisis” rather than leave states in the lurch.Hearing a suo motu (registered on its own motion) case on the management of second Covid-19 wave, the court pointed out that if the Union government’s “unique monopolistic buyer position” was the only reason why it was getting the vaccine doses at a lower price, it was important for the so-called liberalised vaccination policy to be examined under Article 14 of the Constitution since “it could place severe burdens, particularly on states/UTs suffering from financial distress”. Article 14 guarantees the fundamental right to equality in India.Nudging the Centre to utilise its position as the monopolistic buyer in the market and pass the benefit to all persons in the country, the court said that the “avoidable expense” due to the differential pricing will eventually hurt the welfare of individuals residing within those states and UTs.Another cause for worry for the top court was the distinction drawn between those above 45 and those in the 18-45 age group under the Centre’s liberalised policy. The court asked why inoculation was open for 18-45 group in the third phase on a payment basis even though the experience of the second Covid-19 wave showed people of this age group were also affected.“Can there be a justification for the Centre to now say that we will only take care of those who are above 45? We are aware that we don’t have time to enter the realm of policy-making but your policy has to be logical and reasonable,” the bench had asked the SG, seeking instructions if the Centre was ready to act like a national body for procurement of vaccines.The court also asked the Union government to explain how ₹35,000 crore, earmarked for procuring vaccines in the Union Budget for 2021-2022, had been spent so far and why this amount could not be utilised for vaccinating persons in the 18-45 age group.The bench will hear the case next on June 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/before-pm-modi-changed-covid-vaccine-policy-a-nudge-from-the-supreme-court-101623134442210.html

According to guidelines announced by the state government, districts with less than 600 active cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) can get relaxations. The Covid-19 numbers in all the districts of Uttar Pradesh are now below the threshold."Uttar Pradesh lifts Covid-imposed curfew from all districts. Active caseload in the state stands at 14,000 with less than 600 active cases in each district," a statement from chief minister's Yogi Adityanath's office said on Tuesday.A state government spokesperson said that there will be relaxation in coronavirus curfew in all the districts of the state from Wednesday onwards, from 7am to 7pm, for five days. However, the night curfew - 7pm to 7am and weekend curfew (for entire day) - will continue.The decision was take after a high-level virtual meeting chaired by Adityanath on Tuesday.The 'corona curfew' was clamped on April 30 after a surge in cases of Covid-19. The state government allowed relaxations from June 1.Uttar Pradesh reported 727 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Monday. It was the first time since the second wave of the infection started wreaking havoc in the state that the daily caseload went below 1,000.The fresh cases have declined by more than 37,000 from its peak of 38,055 on April 24, the state government said.The state also recorded 81 fatalities in the same period.

The carcass of the elephant was spotted by local residents on Monday.“There is a sagging 11 KV power transmission line that passes through the orchard. The elephant, part of an eight-member herd, may have touched the electric line while searching for food,” said Sudarshan Badi, assistant conservator of forest of North Ghumsur forest division.On Sunday, a tusker was similarly electrocuted in a mango orchard at Gobindaprasad village under Sadar forest range of Dhenkanal district. Though people claimed the elephant died after coming in contact with the solar fencing around the orchard, forest officials said the farmer must have charged the fence with high voltage since the fence doesn’t normally carry enough voltage to kill a huge animal like an elephant. The orchard owner was later arrested.“We are waiting for the post-mortem report. Action will be taken based on the post-mortem report,” assistant conservator of forest Rashmiranjan Swain said.Since April 1, at least 13 elephants have died in Odisha due to electrocution and poaching.Wildlife conservationists claim Odisha has turned deadly for elephants. “Many are getting killed as they cross human habitations to find food. The vast forests have been reduced to tiny forest patches with very little left for elephants,” alleged wildlife conservationist Biswajit Mohanty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-elephants-electrocuted-in-odisha-in-2-days-while-searching-for-food-101623133482018.html

The models can only be used within animal biosafety level three labs, which are present at the institute.The models will likely be used for research by the National Institute For Research In Reproductive Health (Mumbai), Indian Institute of Technology Indore, Institute For Stem Cell Science and Regenerative Medicine (Bengaluru), National Chemical Laboratory (Pune), and Center of Innovative and Applied Bioprocessing (Pune), etc.Such models are needed to understand the virus and to test therapeutic agents for safety and efficacy before human trials. A team of researchers from the institute tested the hamster Sars-CoV-2 model using local virus isolate. The study of proteins shows similarities between the infection in hamsters and humans.Also Read | Gangrene, hearing loss point to Delta variant of Covid-19 being more severeThe clinical parameters and tissue samples analysed also show the similarity in infection. “This provided strong molecular evidence that supports the clinical relevance of this model in Covid-19 research,” said a ministry of science and technology statement.The platform at ILS has been established with the support of the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council under Mission Covid Suraksha.ILS has also established K18-h ACE2 transgenic mice colonies, mice in which the ACE 2 receptor is added so that the Sars-CoV-2 virus can attach to it just like in humans. So far, the transgenic mice needed for Covid-19 research were being imported to the country.This facility will be available on a fee-for-service or partnership mode to researchers, industry, and start-ups from India and abroad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/institute-tests-hamster-mice-models-resembling-human-sars-cov-2-infection-101623131561650.html

After Prime Minister Narendra Modi's address to the nation on Monday, Gandhi tweeted to ask why people would still have to pay for jabs at private hospitals."One simple question - If vaccines are free for all, why should private hospitals charge for them?" Gandhi asked in his tweet.Responding to it on Tuesday, Puri asked if the Congress leader is actually trolling his own party's government in Punjab."Sh Rahul Gandhi has been going around asking “If vaccines are free for all, why should pvt hospitals charge for them?” Is he actually trolling his own party’s government in Punjab?" said the Union minister tagging Rahul Gandhi's tweet.Sh Rahul Gandhi has been going around asking “If vaccines are free for all, why should pvt hospitals charge for them?”Is he actually trolling his own party’s government in Punjab? pic.twitter.com/h6A9uaLprsThe Punjab government faced flak from the Centre and state opposition parties for selling Covid vaccines to private hospitals at a premium. Hindustan Times was first to highlight how the vaccine, procured on state government rate of ₹400 per dose, was sold to private hospitals at the rate of ₹1,060 per dose. The private hospitals were further selling the dose at ₹1,560.The Centre wrote to the Punjab government, seeking a clarification over reports that it had earned a profit by selling jabs. Union minister Prakash Javdekar also criticised the Punjab government’s decision.After the attack and Centre's tough words, the Punjab government asked the private healthcare facilities to return all the stock.On Monday, PM Modi announced that the Centre has decided to buy 75 per cent of jabs from vaccine makers, including 25 per cent of the state quota, and give it for free to state governments, while private sector hospitals can continue to procure the remaining 25 per cent but cannot charge more than ₹150 per dose over the pre-fixed price.Along with Gandhi, many Congress leaders also criticised the PM's announcement saying the goal of universal free vaccination against Covid-19 has still not been achieved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-he-trolling-cong-govt-in-punjab-puri-jabs-rahul-gandhi-101623130821959.html

In a letter to the states, ICMR director general also said that this survey will include children aged 6 years and above.Apart from the general population, blood samples will also be collected of health care workers in district hospitals of these 70 districts in 21 states.In the letter written on June 4, ICMR director general, Balram Bhargava, said, “ICMR will be conducting the fourth round of ‘National sero-survey for Covid-19’ in June 2021. This sero survey will be conducted in the same 70 districts in which the first three rounds were conducted. The survey will cover general population aged 6 yrs and above and health care workers working in district hospitals of these districts.”“The findings of the sero survey will help in ascertaining the current Covid-19 situation in India,” the letter further read.Also Read | High immune response from Covishield and Covaxin: StudyThe 21 states where the samples will collected from select districts for sero survey include Andhra Pradesh (Krishna, SPSR Nellore, Vizianagram), Assam (Udalguri, Kamrup Metropolitan, Karbianglong), Bihar (Muzaffarpur, Purnia, Begusarai, Madhubani, Buxar, Arwal), Chhattisgarh (Bijapur, Kabirdham, Surguja), Gujarat (Mahisagar, Narmada, Sabar Kantha), Jharkhand (Latehar, Pakur, Simdega), Karnataka (Bengaluru urban, Chitradurga, Kalaburagi), Kerala (Palakkad, Ernakulam, Thrissur), Madhya Pradesh (Dewas, Ujjain, Gwalior), Maharashtra (Beed, Nanded, Parbhani, Jalgaon, Ahmednagar, Sangli), Odisha (Rayagada, Ganjam, Koraput), Punjab (Gurdaspur, Jalandhar), Haryana (Kurukshetra), Rajasthan (Dausa, Jalore, Rajsamand), Tamil Nadu (Tiruvannamalai, Coimbatore, Chennai), Telangana (Kamareddy, Jangaon, Nalgonda), and Uttar Pradesh (Amroha).Blood samples in a sero survey are tested for the presence of IgG (Immunoglobulin G) antibodies that determine a past infection due to the virus. Sero surveys are also important to determine whether the disease has entered the community transmission stage or not. ICMR’s National Institute of Epidemiology in Chennai has been the nodal agency for all past surveys and will most likely supervise the fourth one as well. The earlier sero surveys suggested that a significant size of the population was still susceptible to catching the viral infection, and India was far from achieving herd immunity. The first one was designed as a cross-sectional survey of adults aged 18 years or more from 21 states, where the districts were categorised into four strata according to the reported Covid-19 cases per million population .In the second and third rounds, all other parameters were the same except for the age bracket — samples were taken from people aged 10 and above. The third sero survey, conducted between December 17, 2020, and January 8, 2021, found 21.4% of those aged 10 and above infected with the virus. In the second round, nearly one in 15 (6.6%) people above the age of 10 was found to be exposed to the virus till August 2020. The first survey conducted in May last year had found the infection rate to be 0.73% nationally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-to-start-4th-national-sero-survey-this-month-101623130661825.html

08-06-2021||India||Commercial sex workers largely left out of welfare measures amid Covid: NGOs||Commercial sex workers have largely been left out of welfare measures for the vulnerable sections of the society during the pandemic, NGOs working in Goa, Maharashtra, Delhi, and West Bengal have found.The finding is based on consultations NGOs Diksha (Kolkata), SPID Society (New Delhi), Anay Rahit Zindagi (ARZ) in Goa, and Prayas (Mumbai) have conducted. The NGOs found commercial sex workers faced a complete loss of livelihood because of the pandemic and lockdown. The stigma they face also prevented them from approaching the government or well-meaning people for help, they added.Also Read | 200 trans people, sex workers vaccinated at special camp in GurugramThe Supreme Court last year directed the supply of dry rations to sex workers without insistence on identity documents amid the pandemic.Arun Pandey, who runs ARZ and coordinated the consultation in Goa, said most of the sex workers have not benefited from the Supreme Court’s direction. He said many have taken up alternative livelihoods or are jobless and without financial support. “Most of them being bread earners for their families have to earn for themselves and their families. Due to loss of employment/source of earning, the sex workers...and their families are facing hunger, sexual exploitation and are vulnerable to trafficking.”The consultations were conducted with the sex workers in Goa and the top three sources of trafficking to the state--Delhi, Maharashtra, and West Bengal--to understand their situation during the pandemic and benefits they have received as per the Supreme Court direction and under government schemes.A report based on the consultations said the loss of income was reported by all. “Those engaged in commercial sex lost customers due to the lockdown and the economic crises... Those who had moved away from commercial sex were reconstructing their lives on their own, with minimal or no external support. Family support was often absent. As a result, they had to fend for themselves, even with lack of education and vocational skills,” the report said.A commercial sex worker told one of the NGOs that they did not even have soaps. “We did not have money and we had no clients to attend to. The ration was given but there are other expenses... We were given tea leaves, but no milk.”The report said participants with family members reported that many of their immediate family members also lost jobs. “Participants who earned from commercial sex after the lockdown was lifted reported that their earning had drastically reduced, and they were still not able to meet their basic needs.”Most participants said they found it difficult to pay rent. Some shifted out of their residences to live with friends in larger groups, others moved to families who resented their return without income. Many took loans to meet these expenses. “Medical needs had to be compromised upon, because the government hospitals were now Covid-care centres and thus could not attend to other patients – leaving participants to search for private health facilities which most could not afford, or because there was no money for medicines or travel to hospitals during the lockdown,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/commercial-sex-workers-largely-left-out-of-welfare-measures-amid-covid-ngos-101623124421071.html

In this regard, I would like to humbly submit that it will be difficult for state governments to bear such huge cost," the chief minister wrote.In his letter, Reddy asked the prime minister to 'visualise a scenario wherein, houses will be completed and fir for occupancy but due to lack of basic infrastructure, couldn't be occupied by the intended beneficiaries.'He also requested PM Modi to direct ministries of housing and urban affairs and the rural development ministry to incorporate the creation of basic infrastructure in greenfield colonies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-cm-reddy-writes-to-pm-modi-seeks-infrastructural-help-in-pmay-colonies-101623121759996.html

Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan has said 536 million vaccine doses are available for vaccination till July, while arrangements are being made to have 1336 million more doses between August-December to inoculate all 940 million beneficiaries.According to Bhushan, of these 536 million vaccine doses, nearly one-third or 180 million doses were purchased directly by state governments or hospitals.

The Central and Assam governments will rehabilitate the cadres of all four factions through measures like a lump sum payment of ex-gratia, funding of economic activities through existing schemes, vocational training and recruitment in government jobs as per eligibility. The deal also stipulates that criminal cases against NDFB cadres for non-heinous crimes will be withdrawn, but cases involving heinous crimes will be reviewed on a case by case basis as per the existing policy on the issue. Following the accord, over 1600 cadres belonging to the four factions laid down arms at a ceremony in Guwahati.

08-06-2021||India||States won’t have to pay for vaccines: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday announced that the Union government was taking back the responsibility for procuring vaccines and distributing them to states, in response to a growing chorus of demands from the states, sharp criticism by the Supreme Court, and amid increasing concerns that supply shortages and the insistence of foreign vaccine makers that they would only deal with the Union government could derail India’s vaccine drive.The Union government will continue to allow private hospitals to buy up to 25% of vaccines made in India, although it has capped the service charge they can levy on these at ₹150 a dose. The details of India’s new vaccine policy will be worked out in consultation with the states in the next two weeks, and it will be launched on June 21, Modi added.The Union government will bear the cost of vaccinating everyone over the age of 18 years (the population currently eligible for vaccines), he said.Some chief ministers welcomed the move. “The decision of free vaccination will decrease the financial burden of the state governments,” Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, too, praised the move.The Delhi government said that if the Centre wanted, it could have taken this decision a long time ago. “We express our gratitude to the Supreme Court. After its intervention, free vaccines will be available to all age groups across the country. If the central government wanted, it could have done this long ago. But due to the policies of the Centre, neither the states were able to buy the vaccines, nor the central government was giving it,” Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia said in a tweet.In his address to the nation, the Prime Minister also defended his government’s vaccine policy, pointing out that it was “decentralised” only in response to demands from many states that they be allowed to manage the vaccine drive, and buy directly from both Indian and foreign manufacturers. The Union government, therefore, allowed this from May 1, he said, pointing out that health was a state subject.In phases till then, the Union government had managed the vaccine drive for health care workers, frontline workers, people over the age of 60 years, and those over the age of 45 years but with co-morbid conditions that made them more vulnerable to Covid-19. But in response to the demand from the states, it decided to allow states to offer vaccinations to all starting May 1.The Prime Minister’s speech comes ahead of a hearing in the Supreme Court on the Covid-19 situation and the state of vaccination in the country. In its previous hearing, the apex court said the Union government’s coronavirus vaccination policy that put the onus of giving doses to adults in the below-45 years age group entirely on states and private hospitals was “prima facie arbitrary and irrational”. It ordered the Union government last week to submit within two weeks “all relevant documents and file notings” on the thinking and process behind the strategy.India bore the brunt of the second wave in May – it added 9 million cases, or 31.2% of its total cases to date, and saw 120,071 deaths, 34.4% of the total, in the month – and this, combined with the supply situation, made the vaccine drive chaotic. States also found it impossible to deal with foreign manufacturers, many of whom wanted the Union government to provide them protection from lawsuits for adverse events (discussions on this are on). In just a few weeks, the PM claimed, states realised the old system was better.India has already administered in excess of 230 million doses, Modi said, and its vaccine drive is among the fastest in the world, but the new policy will make it faster. Till Monday, a total of 46.6 million people in the country have been vaccinated fully, and another 142.8 million vaccinated with one dose.K Sujatha Rao, former Union secretary, ministry of health and family welfare, said: “It was time that they changed the vaccination policy, which had already been badly delayed. A lot of precious time was already wasted in states trying to float global tenders.” Dr Sudarshan Ballal, chairman, Manipal Hospitals, said: “Central procurement of the vaccine would certainly strengthen our vaccination drive as the Centre would have a lot more clout in dealing with the multinationals and also the procurement of vaccines from the other manufacturers rather than individual states or smaller players directly negotiating with these companies. Also, free vaccination for 18 and above is a welcome move. As far as the private sector is concerned, not much would change at present.”To be sure, apart from the unwillingness of foreign companies such as Pfizer and Moderna to deal with the states, and their inability to get anywhere with their global tenders – at least six states raised these, but most received little interest – the states were significantly hampered by the sheer lack of supply. With demand increasing manifold suddenly – there are 600 million Indians between the ages of 18 and 45 years who became eligible for vaccines on May 1 – and supplies not keeping pace, this was always going to be a problem.The situation has improved in June, with the government anticipating supplies of at least 120 million doses, and the number is expected to increase even more in the coming months.The Union government has said that 2.16 billion vaccines will be available in India between August and December, but this number includes aggressive estimates for the production of some existing vaccines, and some vaccines that are still in different stages of development and testing.At least 710 million of the 2.16 billion expected doses are of vaccines yet to be approved. Reuters said in a report that Serum Institute of India will likely miss its target of 750 million doses in these five months by 27% (or 200 million), and Bharat Biotech’s scale-up to 550 million doses is clouded in ambiguity, with the company saying last month that there is a lag between production and availability, which means doses made in April will only be available in July. The actual availability in that period may instead be around 1 billion, according to an analysis by The Ken.India has approved three vaccines (one locally developed, a second made under licence, and a third imported as well as locally made by at least half a dozen companies under licence) and most experts are convinced that vaccine supply will improve in the coming months, especially with the local production of Sputnik V, which India is currently importing.The PM referred to this in his speech and said there were seven vaccines in various stages of development and three in final trials, including a nasal vaccine (being developed by Bharat Biotech, again), which, if approved, would significantly speed up the pace of vaccinations. Among the vaccines in late stage trials is one developed by Biological E, for which India has already placed an advance order for 300 million doses. Two vaccines are also being tested on children, the PM said.The government has told the Supreme Court that it plans to vaccinate all eligible Indians by the end of this year, something that will require it to deliver 238 million doses a month, according to an HT analysis.Responding to criticism of India’s vaccine strategy, Modi said that the government set up a vaccine task force as far back as April 2020, supported vaccine makers through trials and through funding, and planned a phased delivery starting with health care workers, something that helped them work without fear during the second wave.Describing the coronavirus pandemic as a “once in a 100-year” epidemic, the PM said he understood that many Indians had lost people to Covid-19, and that his sympathies were with them. The disease was “unprecedented in the modern world” but India fought it together, he added, “building hospitals, increasing ICU capacity, making ventilators, creating new health infrastructure…”And then, he said, when, during the second wave, the country saw the kind of demand for medical oxygen that it had never seen before, it sourced liquid oxygen and concentrators from all parts of the world, deploying its navy and air force, using trains to move oxygen tankers, and working on a manifold increase in oxygen manufacturing capacity.At a time such as this, Modi added, “politicking” isn’t good. It is important that states focus on the task at hand, he said – vaccinating everyone, including the last person in line. Some people have been consistently spreading misinformation about vaccines, he added, leading to fears and hesitancy among people. Such people, he added, are “playing with the lives of innocents”.The Union government has repeatedly targeted opposition politicians for their comments on vaccines and said this could lead to hesitancy.The Congress said the announcement marked yet another instance when the Modi government has done a “somersault” on the vaccination policy. “The people opposed the government’s policies, the Congress party opposed it, and Supreme Court bitterly reprimanded them and asked them to file an affidavit. Now, they have taken a third summersault. The policy is also flawed even now. Why should citizens of India be made to pay in the private sector? Do we make you pay for DPT injection or a pulse polio injection in the private sector?” said Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala.Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot said: “Prime Minister Narendra Modi should share details on which states made the demand of being able to buy vaccines for the 18-44 age group. To my knowledge, no state made such a demand... I am happy that the PM had to change his old decision keeping in view the public sentiments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-won-t-have-to-pay-for-vaccines-pm-modi-101623095410385.html
08-06-2021||India||Mehul Choksi names ‘abductors’, hints at role of a politician||Fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi has named a woman, Barbara Jarabica, two Indians he identified as Narender Singh and Gurmit Singh, and “unknown persons” as his abductors in his complaint filed with the Royal Police Force of Antigua and Barbuda.Hindustan Times has seen a copy of the five-page complaint in which the 62-year-old has claimed that once he was brought to Dominica, he was informed by his abductors that a high-ranking Indian politician would speak with him.In his complaint filed with the commissioner of police of Antigua on June 3, Choksi said he was on friendly terms with Barbara Jarabica for the past one year. She initially lived opposite his residential complex at Jolly Harbour, but later shifted to Coco Bay Hotel. She was friendly with Choksi’s staff too, and they used to meet regularly, often going out for evening walks, he added in the complaint.On May 23, the day he went “missing” from Antigua, Choksi says, Jarabica asked him to deviate from their normal schedule of meeting at a public place and asked him to pick her up from her house.Antigua’s Prime Minister Gaston Browne has said the island nation has started investigations into Choksi’s abduction allegations, even though he doesn’t believe that the businessman was abducted.The businessman, wanted in India for defrauding, with his nephew Nirav Modi, the Punjab National Bank of ₹13,578 crore, added in his complaint that he reached Jarabica’s residence around 5-5.15pm and was invited in by her. She told him that they would step out after she finished her glass of wine. Once he entered, about 8-10 heavily built men appeared from all sides. “They claimed to be Antiguan police and that they know about me and have been watching me for a while,” Choksi said, adding that they wanted to take him to St John’s police station.He alleged that the men beat him up with bare hands and tased him, and also took away his Rolex watch, cellphone, and wallet containing $1,500. He was then put on a wheelchair in an unconscious state, gagged and his face covered, the complaint said. When all this was happening, Choksi said, Jarabica didn’t even attempt to help him, which “clearly points to the fact she was an integral part of this entire scheme to kidnap me”.He was then placed on a small watercraft, and then a larger boat, but when he resisted, he was threatened at knifepoint, the fugitive businessman said.On the boat were two Indians and three people of Caribbean descent, according to him. Their appearances suggested, Choksi claimed, that the two Indians were highly trained mercenaries, hired specifically to abduct him. “One of the Indians said I was under observation for almost a year. They knew intimate details about my household, such as where I would walk, my favourite restaurants, my daily schedule, etc,” he said.Another Indian asked him detailed questions about his finances and offshore bank accounts and threatened of dire consequences if his answers were not satisfactory, Choksi said. “I was also made to speak on the phone with a man who identified himself as Narender Singh. He said he was the chief agent on my case. He began to pressurize me to say I had cooperated with my captors and that I accompanied them of my own free volition which of course was not true,” Choksi’s complaint read. This person, Choksi alleged, also asked him to leave Jarabica out of the matter as it would lead to a public scandal.Choksi claimed the boat reached Dominica 15-17 hours after his ordeal began, which was roughly 9.30-10am Antigua time on May 24.“...I was told that I have been brought to this special location to give an interview to a high-ranking Indian politician. He also told me that my citizenship would be ‘fixed’ in Dominica and that I would soon be repatriated to India,” the complaint read.Choksi said he was received by a battery of police officers in Dominica, including the chief of police, who informed him that he was arrested on an Interpol red notice. In Roseau police station, the complaint said, Choksi was kept in a cell and was denied medical treatment or legal representation.Choksi’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal said: “Truth and false are both five-letter words and not even a single letter is common. My client, Mr Choksi, by giving detailed narration of events, has stated his truth. Now (the) false, which was state sponsored, will get exposed if investigated honestly.”In his first statement since Choksi was caught in Dominica on May 24, the island’s Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit said on Monday that the “rights of Mehul Choksi will be respected as has been done thus far”. Skerrit also referred to Choksi as an Indian citizen. “The matter with this Indian citizen is before the courts, the courts will decide what happens to him,” the local media quoted him as saying||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehul-choksi-names-abductors-hints-at-role-of-a-politician-101623095183523.html
08-06-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||India ended Monday with fewer than 100,000 new Covid-19 cases, the first time since April 5 that it registered cases below this benchmark. Low as this number may look — everything is relative — compared to the peaks of early May (yes, it was just a month ago), it is worth remembering that at its peak, India’s first wave did not see cases crossing 100,000. Back then, that seemed like a large number; right now, it seems like a low one.India also ended Monday with 46.6 million people vaccinated fully, and another 142.8 million vaccinated with one dose — a significant milestone because this means at least 20% of the population eligible for vaccines (those over the age of 18 years) now has some form of protection against Covid-19. The supply of vaccines is expected to increase from this month — it is not likely to reach the rather optimistic projections provided by the government, but vaccinating 4 million people a day (the likely number this month) is still a significant achievement — and a combination of non-pharmaceutical interventions, Covid-19-safe behaviour and partial restrictions on movement and activities, should help India ensure there isn’t a third wave of the pandemic.The chaos and confusion over India’s vaccine drive, and recent scientific revelations point to the need for some changes in how India procures vaccines, and how and when it administers them. The Union government, on Monday, addressed some of these.On procurement, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in an address to the nation, the Union government will procure vaccines, and then allot them to the states. The move came after most states, including those that wanted to procure vaccines on their own, said they wanted the Union government to take over the task. India is one of the few countries allowing private hospitals to directly procure vaccine doses from manufacturers, and it has decided to continue to allow this, with the existing 25% ceiling on the number of doses that can be thus acquired.But there are other changes that should be discussed.On administration, for instance, it makes no sense for the country to open up vaccination to those under the age of 18 years till it covers at least 75% of the addressable population over that age. That’s 705 million people, and once they are fully vaccinated, the vaccine drive can move on to those under the age of 18 years. If supplies are going to be a constraint, it is important to prioritise who gets the vaccine (and when) and sequence the drive. If supplies are not a constraint, then the government should open up vaccinations to all.The drive also has to factor in new scientific revelations that both doses of two-dose vaccines are required to effectively combat variants of the coronavirus, including the so-called Delta variant first identified in India, and which, it is now clear, was behind the surge of cases during the second wave in the country. India would do well to ensure the gap between two doses of Covishield, the Indian version of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, which is currently being administered to the majority of people in the country, does not exceed 12 weeks.Equally important to factor in is new research that shows that vaccine-provided immunity fades faster than natural immunity acquired from an infection, pointing to the need for booster shots. Some of the vaccine companies, including Pfizer, have also said that boosters are required. More data on this will become available in the next few months when the first recipients of vaccines (in clinical trials) will complete a year after being vaccinated. It is becoming clear that the first generation of vaccines may be effective only for a year at the most.This means India will have to plan for two, maybe three simultaneous vaccine drives in 2022: one, for those who need to be given booster shots (which is pretty much every one of the 940 million adults in the country, although not all of them need it); two, for those who were either not covered by the first drive, or chose not to be vaccinated, in 2021; and three, for those under the age of 18 (even in the most optimistic scenario, India is unlikely to fully vaccinate 705 million before October, which means that even if this phase is launched immediately after, it will continue into 2022).The process will require a realistic assessment of capacities and supplies (not cheery projections), the placing of advance orders, and a phased vaccine administration plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101623094724933.html

08-06-2021||India||Fee order stands, parents must pay 1st instalment: HC||City private schools on Monday assured the Delhi high court that they will give 15% concession on development fee and annual charges for the current academic year, and that these can be paid in six monthly instalments, even as a bench of justices Rekha Palli and Amit Bansal rejected a Delhi government plea to stay an earlier order allowing schools to levy such charges.In a statement before the court, the Action Committee Unaided Recognised Private Schools (ACURPS) — a body of 450 private unaided schools in Delhi — said they will, till the next hearing, follow principles laid down by justice Jayant Nath in his order on May 31. Justice Nath ruled that schools may collect these charges for the last academic year, on a monthly basis, but only after a 15% reduction in the payable amount, in lieu of unutilised facilities (such as water and electricity) during the lockdown.The state challenged the ruling on Friday, arguing that “schools being charitable organisations are adopting an inhumane approach by charging parents more in the unprecedented time of the pandemic”.The bench on Monday said, “We are rejecting the stay application,” adding that the parents should pay the first instalment.It also remarked that the state government should not be “populist”, and asked them to give subsidies to the schools since they have to pay taxes.“Please don’t just be a populist government saying that oh we have done this. It’s not a short term lockdown; things were different last year… The Delhi government should give some money (subsidy) to the schools,” justice Palli said.Justice Nath, in his order, quashed two orders issued by the Delhi government, on April 18 and August 28 last year, which restricted private schools in the city to collect additional charges. He, however, said students should not be barred from attending classes over the non-payment of the fees.Advocate Kamal Gupta, representing the private schools, said, “Schools have been standing right besides the parents in these tough times and in continuation to that have extended the reduction of 15% as also instalments system for this year’s tuition and development fee”.Advocate Santosh Tripathi, standing counsel of the Delhi government, said the government will challenge the order as “it is in the teeth of several judgments of the division bench of the high court and the Supreme Court”.Senior advocate Shyam Diwan, counsel for (ACURPS), told the court on Monday that they will follow the principles laid down by the single judge for this academic year also.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, for the Delhi government, argued that the extra charges such as the development fees was suspended as upgrades, improvements and maintenance are not required when schools are shut for more than a year-and-a-half and since there is no wear and tear in the furniture and fixtures.Opposing the stay application, Diwan told the court that the Delhi government did not have the powers to issue such a diktat. He said the schools have not indulged in commercialisation and profiteering which has been noted by the single judge.Advocate Khagesh B Jha, appearing for four private parties challenging the judgment, also said parents have received bills of around ₹1 lakh per child.The court noting the submissions declined to grant stay and issued notice to the private schools on the plea by the city government.The Delhi government did not respond despite repeated requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fee-order-stands-parents-must-pay-1st-instalment-hc-101623092938990.html
08-06-2021||India||I stand corrected, says P Chidambaram after attack on PM Modi over Covid vaccine||Former Union minister P Chidambaram on Monday rebutted Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s assertion that the Centre allowed states to buy vaccines in response to demands from states but backed down after a February letter by West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee appeared on social media.“I told (news agency) ANI ‘please tell us which state government demanded that it should be allowed to directly procure vaccines’. Social media activists have posted the copy of the letter of CM, West Bengal to PM making such a request. I was wrong. I stand corrected,” Chidambaram said on micro-blogging site Twitter.In this letter to PM Modi, Mamata Banerjee wanted Bengal to be allowed to procure vaccines on its own to fulfil its requirements for the vaccine.Also read | ‘Not right to go into the past and seek credit’: Congress on PM Modi’s address“We would request you to kindly take up the matter with appropriate authority so that State government is able to purchase the vaccines from designated point(s) on top priority basis because the West Bengal government wants to provide vaccination free of cost to all the people,” Banerjee said in her February 24 letter. It is a point that she reiterated in subsequent months as well.Chidambaram was one of the many from the opposition to criticise PM Modi after his address to the nation, insisting that PM Modi was trying to blame the opposition for his mistakes.“Nobody, but nobody said that [the] Centre should not procure vaccines. He (PM) now blames state govts saying - they wanted to procure vaccines so we allowed them. Let us know which CM, which state govt, on what date demanded that he should be allowed to procure vaccines,” Chidambaram had said, according to an ANI tweet.Banerjee’s letter surfaced soon after.To be sure, in her reaction to PM Modi’s address, Mamata Banerjee did not refer to her demand that Bengal be allowed to directly procure vaccines. Instead, she focused on PM Modi’s announcement that the Centre would provide the vaccines to all adults free of cost and recalled that she had, on multiple occasions, made this demand.“Took him (PM) 4 months but after much pressure, he has FINALLY listened to us & implemented what we've been asking all this while,” she tweeted.In his address, PM Modi said the Union government is taking back the task of Covid-19 vaccination from the states. He said that the Centre, which was procuring 50% of the vaccines produced in the country and letting the states buy another 25%, would now procure 75% of the vaccines. Private hospitals and institutions will continue to procure the remaining 25 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-stand-corrected-says-p-chidambaram-after-attack-on-pm-modi-over-covid-vaccine-101623092045962.html
08-06-2021||India||Muslim families living near UP temple likely to be relocated over ‘security’||LUCKNOW Muslim families living in the vicinity of the Gorakhnath temple in Gorakhpur are likely to be relocated in the wake of the state government’s plan to bolster security around the complex. Though nine families in the area (Purana Gorakhpur Tappa, Kasba Pargana Haveli, Tehsil Sadar, Gorakhpur) have agreed to transfer their houses and land in favour of the state government, two have rejected the district administration’s offer for compensation and allotment of land at an alternative site. District magistrate (Gorakhpur) K Vijendra Pandian said there was no coercion by the district administration on the 11 families to vacate their houses. “The administration will acquire their property only after their consent. The houses are being vacated on the direction of the state government, on the basis of the report submitted by security agencies. The families will be given adequate compensation and the district administration will facilitate their relocation also. There is no religious angle in the shifting of these families,” he said. A district administration officer said the boundary wall of the Gorakhnath temple runs parallel to the 11 houses located on the south-east corner of the temple premises. UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who is the head priest of the temple, stays in the residential complex on the temple premises during his visits to Gorakhpur. “Hence, security agencies are reviewing and assessing the CM’s security during his stay on the temple premises,” Pandian said. On the basis of the security agencies’ report, the state government directed the district administration to shift these families. “There is no plan to demolish or shift the religious structures in the area. Strict action will be taken against anti-social elements who are trying to disturb communal harmony,” he added. A local trader, Mohammad Islam, said the Muslim families have been living near the Gorakhnath temple for generations. “For livelihood, a majority of them run commercial establishments in a portion of their houses. If the state government shifts them to another location, they will face problems of livelihood. The state government should also give employment to one member of each family whose house is being acquired,” he said. Meanwhile, a delegation of Congress members led by UP Congress Committee vice-president Vishwa Vijay Singh met the 11 families on Sunday. “We told the families that the Congress will fight for their rights. We will oppose their suppression by the district administration. The state government should adhere to the demand of the families,” Singh said. The families themselves have remained silent during the controversy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/muslim-families-living-near-up-temple-likely-to-be-relocated-over-security-101623092076827.html
08-06-2021||India||Bengal governor, Moitra continue to trade barbs||Kolkata: The war of words over the alleged appointment of his relatives at Raj Bhavan escalated on Monday after West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar termed the charges by Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Mahua Moitra as “factually wrong” and called it a “distraction strategy” from the “deteriorating law and order situation in the state”. The TMC legislator, however, refused to withdraw her remarks and urged the governor to explain the appointments of six officers on special duty (OSDs), who she alleged are related either to him or other Raj Bhawan officers.On Sunday, Moitra claimed that three of Dhankhar’s own relatives, two relatives of a former aide-de-camp (EDC) and one relative of his present EDC were appointed as OSDs at the governor’s house. She added that the law and order situation in Bengal would improve if the governor left with his “extended family”. Responding to the allegations through a series of tweets, the governor on Monday said that none of the six appointees were part of his close family and that four of them belonged to another caste. “Assertion @MahuaMoitra in tweet & Media that six coterminous appointee OSDs in personal staff are relatives is FACTUALLY WRONG. OSDs are from three states and belong to four different castes. None of them is part of close family. Four of them are not from my caste or state,” he posted on Twitter. The governor added that the TMC legislator’s tweets were a part of the “distraction strategy to divert attention from the deteriorating law and order situation in the state”. “This is unfolding of ‘distraction strategy’ to divert attention from alarming law and order scenario @MamataOfficial. Would continue undeterred and with zeal to serve the people of state and vindicate my oath of office under Article 159 of the Constitution,” Dhankhar tweeted. Taking note of one of his tweets, Moitra urged the governor to explain how the six OSDs were appointed to Raj Bhavan. “Asking Uncleji to lay out right here what antecedents of the appointees are & how each one got into Raj Bhavan. Do it NOW. BJP IT Cell can’t get you out of this one Uncleji.. And I don’t think Vice President of India also happening for you,” she tweeted. BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu said, “Raj Bhawan officials are appointed by the state government, not the governor.”Dhankhar assumed charge as Bengal governor in July 2019. Leaders of the ruling TMC have time and again accused him of being “an agent” of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and criticised his allegedly partisan behaviour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-governor-moitra-continue-to-trade-barbs-101623092016888.html
08-06-2021||India||SC panel finalises draft rules for live-streaming trials||Courts across the country may soon open their doors to cameras. In a major step towards making courtrooms accessible to more people, the e-Committee of the Supreme Court has finalised draft rules for live-streaming and recording of court proceedings of the high courts, trial courts and tribunals, finally taking forward the promise of a three-year-old judgment. The committee, headed by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, has written a letter to chief justices of all 24 high courts in the country, seeking inputs and suggestions on the draft rules for live-streaming and recording of court proceedings by June 30. “The right of access to justice, guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, encompasses the right to access live court proceedings. To imbue greater transparency, inclusivity and foster access to justice, the e-Committee has undertaken the project of live streaming of court proceedings on priority,” stated the letter. Live-streaming, added the letter, will enable access to live court proceedings, including on matters of public interest to citizens, journalists, civil society, academicians and law students on a real-time basis, something otherwise constrained by geographical, logistical or infrastructural issues. The e-Committee, which is working with the Department of Justice under the National Policy and Action Plan for implementation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the Indian judiciary, has also invited suggestions and inputs from all stakeholders by June 30. The Supreme Court in 2018 held in a judgment (Swapnil Tripathi and Indira Jaisingh) that telecast of important cases to an audience outside the courtroom would usher in greater transparency and aid accountability, but little moved since. The finalisation of the draft rules is a leap towards letting lights and cameras inside the public institutions. Speaking to HT, justice Chandrachud said that the rules provide for a legal framework and a balanced regulatory structure for live-streaming and recording of court proceedings. “Going forward, infrastructural requirements such as cloud storage and adequate bandwidth will have to be met. The committee is working towards ensuring proper infrastructure so that high courts across the country have an efficient platform to stream the proceedings.” Justice Chandrachud added that the draft rules have been framed with a view to realise the vision of the 2018 judgment and to make certain the courts are open and accountable to the community. The draft rules place a presumption in favour of broadcasting of court proceedings except in a defined range of circumstances. Cases relating to matrimony, sexual offences, gender violence, recording of evidence and those that may provoke enmity among communities have been kept out of the ambit of live-streaming. Besides, the high court may decide in its wisdom some other category of cases or specific cases where streaming will not be allowed. “There shall be a delay of ten minutes in streaming, which may be changed as per the direction of the Court. A remote-control device shall be provided to the presiding judge on the bench to pause or stop the live-streaming at any time,” said the rules. Under the draft rules, parties have been given the option of raising objections to live-streaming by specifying their reasons. “The final decision as to whether or not to allow the live-streaming of the proceedings or any portion thereof will be of the Bench; however, the decision of the bench will be guided by the principle of an open and transparent judicial process,” stated the draft rules, adding the decision of the bench shall not be justiciable. In cases where the proceedings are not live-streamed, the draft rules states, the recording shall be maintained for usage by the courts and can be given to the parties at appropriate stages after required redaction and filtration. The draft rules said that the content of the recording will be vetted and shall be posted, usually within three days of the conclusion of the proceedings, on the courts’ website or made available on such digital platforms, as directed by the court. “The live stream shall not, without the prior written authorisation of the court, be reproduced, transmitted, uploaded, posted, modified, published, or republished in any form,” stated the rules, underlining any unauthorised usage of the live stream will be punishable as an offence under the Indian Copyright Act, Information Technology Act, and other provisions of law, including the law of contempt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scpanel-finalises-draft-rules-for-live-streaming-trials-101623091898515.html
08-06-2021||India||Cong panel failed to resolve issues: Pilot||NEW DELHI: Last year’s crisis in Rajasthan that the Congress papered over by setting up a committee to address the issues raised by then deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot against chief minister Ashok Gehlot have resurfaced, with the former expressing his displeasure at the lack of action.“It has now been 10 months. I was given to understand that there would be swift action by the committee, but now half of the term is done, and those issues haven’t been resolved. It is unfortunate that so many of the party workers who worked and gave their all for getting us the mandate are not being heard,” said Pilot, refusing to elaborate on his next move. One of his key supporters, MLA Hemaram Choudhary, resigned suddenly last month.HT learns the central leadership of the Congress is trying to work out a cabinet reshuffle in Rajasthan.Pilot told Hindustan Times that the Congress high command has failed to deliver on the promises that were made to him when he along with 18 legislators returned to the party after a month-long drama. In July last year, Pilot and his supporters left Jaipur to camp at a secret location in Haryana, threatening the stability of the Ashok Gehlot government. Pilot was removed as Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president, and it was only when the Gandhis intervened and set up a committee under general secretary Ajay Maken that he returned to the fold. However, the dilemma for the central leadership now is to find a solution that is acceptable to both chief minister Gehlot and Pilot. “It is not the right time for me to speak,’’ said Maken when contacted by HT. “However, there are vacancies in the Rajasthan government, and they are likely to be filled soon,” he added. A cabinet reshuffle isn’t a straightforward solution. There are nine vacancies in the Rajasthan cabinet as there can be 30 ministers but only 21 currently. Of the nine vacancies, three were created when Pilot supporters were sacked last year for the rebellion. Now, Pilot may want more of his supporters to find a place in the cabinet, but Gehlot is pitching for independents and former Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) legislators who saved his government during the floor test last August.“Just like Pilot may have been promised that his grievances will be heard, these independent legislators were also promised they would be accommodated if they supported the Congress. This cannot be ignored ,” said a Congress leader on condition of anonymity.The leader quoted above said that they appreciated Pilot’s contribution which led to a consolidation of Gujjar votes for the Congress in the state, but the chief minister had also proved himself by winning the recent bypolls. He attributes the 10-month delay to the death of senior leader Ahmed Patel , as he was the crisis manager working out the details of Pilot’s return. But the January reorganisation of the state party unit accommodated Pilot’s team . For example, of the eight general secretaries, at least three are Pilot’s candidates and one of his team members has also been made vice president, this leader added. “Ashok Gehlot is the senior most Congress person that we have right now as he is a three-time chief minister and was a Union minister before that. He also got 10% more votes in the bypolls than he did in 2018, so how can we not go with him?” asked this person. However, there is agreement within the party that a solution acceptable to Pilot will have to be found, and that might mean that one of the two leaders takes on a bigger role in the central organisation. The chief minister’s office did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment. ‘’The only way to sort things out will be a genuine commitment of both of them to work with each other, which is easier said than done. Gehlot has to show a large heart and accommodate Pilot who must — on his part — be comfortable to contest the 2023 election under Gehlot’s leadership. Till a public announcement of this kind is made, these exercises of cabinet reshuffle will be cosmetic and in fact, will end up creating more problems for both camps,’’ said political commentator Sanjeev Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-panel-failed-to-resolve-issues-pilot-101623091717400.html
08-06-2021||India||18 workers charred in Pune factory fire||Pune: At least 18 people were charred to death in a major fire that broke out at an industrial plant in Urawade village near Pirangut, around 40 kilometres from Pune, on Monday, officials familiar with the matter said.While 41 workers had reported to duty, 18 of them were trapped inside the plant when the fire broke out, Sandesh Shirke, sub-divisional officer of Maval, Mulshi area, said.“We have so far recovered 18 charred bodies. Two people were found alive and moved to a private hospital on Karve Road, Pune, for treatment,” Shirke said.  The victims, which included 15 women, were local villagers working at the plant, officials said. The fire, officials added, broke out at around 4pm in SVS Aqua Technologies which manufactures chemicals used in water purifiers. The fire brigade department of Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) pressed eight fire tender units to douse the flames which was brought under control by around 6:45pm.“The company will be in a better position to tell why most of them were women,” Shrike said.Suhas Diwase, PMRDA chief executive officer, said the bodies recovered were beyond recognition and were sent to Sassoon general hospital. “We will know about their identity after the medical examination,” Diwase said.  Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar in a statement said that an inquiry has been ordered to find out the cause of the fire. He also announced a compensation of ₹5 lakh to kin of each of the deceased.Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “We have constituted a committee to inquire into the fire incident. Details such as the cause of the fire and safety-related aspects will be probed.” Urawade has around eight industrial units, most of them producing chemicals, which locals claimed were not inflammatory. “The firm is involved in manufacturing chemicals required for purification of water. This chemical is not inflammable and we suspect a short circuit as the cause of the incident,” Nikunj Shah, director of SVS Aqua Technologies, said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed grief over the incident. “Pained by the loss of lives due to a fire at a factory in Pune, Maharashtra. Condolences to the bereaved families,” Modi tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/18-workers-charred-in-pune-factory-fire-101623091596717.html
08-06-2021||India||Covishield dose gap cut for special cases||The Union health ministry on Monday allowed the gap between two doses of Covishield vaccine to be reduced from 84 days to 28 days for those who need to travel abroad for work, study, or to represent India at the Tokyo Olympics scheduled for July.Through a press statement, the ministry said the matter was discussed by the Empowered Group 5 (one of the six groups formed last year to monitor the Covid response) and “appropriate recommendations” were received for allowing the administration of the second dose of Covishield to those who need to travel abroad for the specified reasons, but whose planned travel dates are earlier than the mandatory 84-day interval between the two doses.This special concession will be available to “students who have to undertake foreign travel for the purposes of education; persons who have to take up jobs in foreign countries; athletes, sportspersons and accompanying staff of Indian contingent attending the International Olympic Games to be held in Tokyo...,” the statement said.However, the ministry specified that the facility will be available for travel up to August 31 this year.Serum Institute of India locally manufactures the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine under the brand name Covishield. It is one of the two vaccines currently being provided under the national Covid-19 immunisation programme and has been granted emergency use listing by the World Health Organisation.According to current guidelines, based on the recommendations by National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19, the second dose of Covishield has to be administered at an interval of 12-16 weeks (or 84 days) from the first.All states have been directed to designate a competent authority in each district to allow the expedited second dose. They will have to ensure that there is a minimum gap of 28 days between the two doses and the purpose of travel is genuine. Documents pertaining to admission offers from universities abroad, job offer letters, or nomination papers to participate in the Olympics will be verified.The health ministry’s standard operating procedures have advised the use of the passport as one of the identification documents for vaccination. The passport number will be printed on the vaccination certificate. But it doesn’t matter if any other identity paper was used to obtain the first dose.All technical protocols, including adverse events following immunisation monitoring, will have to be strictly followed.“The Co-WIN system will soon provide the facility for administration of 2nd dose in such exceptional cases…,” the health ministry statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covishield-dose-gap-cut-for-special-cases-101623091295017.html

Advise/order for remdesivir must be written and bear the name, signature and stamp of the concerned doctor,” said the advisory.India has allowed use of remdesivir only in select moderate to severe hospitalised Covid-19 patients on supplemental oxygen, as it is a reserve drug approved by the drugs controller general of India under the emergency use authorisation only.According to the advisory, every hospital needs to set up a special drug committee (SDC) to review the use of remdesivir. “The Special Drug Committee should share their findings with the clinicians periodically to ensure rational and judicious use of remdesivir...,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-issues-advisory-for-rational-use-of-remdesivir-101623090587910.html
08-06-2021||India||Central teams visit Yaas-hit Bengal, Odisha||Two separate central teams on Monday visited areas hit by Cyclone Yaas in the coastal states of Odisha and West Bengal to assess damage and submit reports to the Union government.In Odisha, an interministerial team led by joint secretary, home affairs, Sunil Kumar Barnwal toured Bhadrak and Balasore for on-the-spot assessment of damages. Bhadrak district collector Gyana Das said the team saw saline inundation of agricultural lands and houses damaged in Dmara. At least 8,000 houses in Bhadrak suffered damage from the cyclone. The team held discussions with the local administration and the affected people during the assessment of damages, he added.On May 26, Yaas hit the coast between Balasore and Bhadrak districts with a sustained wind speed of 130-140kmph, gusting up to 155kmph. The storm caused very heavy rainfall in Balasore, Bhadrak, Mayurbhanj, Jagatsinghpur and Kendrapara districts, affecting over six million people in 11,000 villages. Three deaths were reported, the lowest among cyclones that have hit the state since the 1999 super cyclone. The teams will visit Mayurbhanj and Kendrapara districts on Tuesday for further assessment. There has been large-scale destruction of trees by the cyclone at Similipal tiger reserve in Mayurbhanj district. The central teams before leaving for Delhi will hold a meeting with Odisha chief secretary SC Mohapatra.Special relief commissioner PK Jena said the Odisha government has not sought any immediate funds from the Centre for Yaas relief. “We have sought assistance for a permanent solution for disaster risk reduction by having a disaster-resilient power sector and long-term coastal protection,” he said.Another seven-member central team visited areas hit by Yaas in West Bengal and will be visiting several places in the next two days. The team arrived at Kolkata on Sunday. Cyclone Yaas severely affected the state.“The central team visited South 24 Parganas on Monday and East Midnapore on Tuesday. On Wednesday the team would visit the adjoining areas of Kolkata. They would also hold a meeting with top officials of the state government to assess the damage before submitted a report to the Union home ministry,” said a senior official of the state government.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has already handed over a preliminary report to PM Narendra Modi on the damage caused by the cyclone in the state-- estimated to the tune of ₹20,000 crore. Modi announced financial assistance worth ₹1,000 crore for relief activities, which will be released on the basis of the damage, according to the Prime Minister’s Office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-teams-visit-yaas-hit-bengal-odisha-101623089376549.html

On March 8th I had been assured by Mrs Meenakshi Lekhi the Chairperson that the draft report will be circulated for comments by members. That is still awaited,” Ramesh said in response.Prasad then clarified that the report was yet to be finalised. “I appreciate their (the committee’s) hard work. I look forward to their final report so that the Parliament approves a Data Protection Law soon.”Ramesh’s party colleague and panel member Manish Tewari also hit out at the delays in the finalisation of the report. “The select committee finished it’s deliberations in December 2020. There is no final report for 6 months now. Any idea why @rsprasad? Truth is at times stranger than fiction,” Tewari wrote on Twitter.According to people familiar with the matter, the deliberations of the committee have resulted in some very “serious differences” between the original bill and draft report. “The report that is likely to be finalised is going to be very different from the original bill that the committee set out to debate,” one person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.Lekhi did not respond to a request for comment.The joint parliamentary committee has 20 members from the Lok Sabha and 10 from the Rajya Sabha. The committee was set up in 2019 to review the Personal Data Protection Bill, which was introduced in the 17th Lok Sabha. It first sought and received an extension till the winter session last year. It then received an extension till the first week of the second half of the budget session. HT reported on March 9 that the panel was looking at another extension before finalising the report. The report is now likely to be submitted in the monsoon session.The committee has met various stakeholders as it debates far reaching reforms for personal data protection. It has also carefully analysed the bill that covers cross border transfer of data and the use of personal data by government and private companies. Provisions of the bill related to localization of data within the country and curbs on data sharing across borders have come in for criticism from global technology companies, but like many other countries in the world, India wants to ensure the data of its citizens is safe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/data-protection-bill-prasad-panel-members-spar-over-draft-report-101623089197242.html
08-06-2021||India||Committed to complying with new IT rules: Twitter||Social media company Twitter has told the ministry of electronics and information technology (Meity) that it is “committed to complying” with all clauses of the intermediary guidelines and asked for a week’s time, officials familiar with the matter said on Monday, days after the government issued an ultimatum to the company.The government on Saturday said Twitter would have to face “unintended consequences” that can involve it losing its legal protection from criminal liability for user content if it does not comply with the new rules for digital content.“The company has highlighted that there have been some difficulties in making appointments for some key personnel and sought a week’s time to comply with most of the provisions, while saying that it will implement all provisions as soon as possible,” said a ministry official, who asked not to be named.The official added that the platform has also informed the ministry that it is looking to set up an office in the country, as required under the new rules that seek a physical address for significant social media intermediaries, or companies running networks with more than 5 million registered users from India.The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, was notified in February, with all clauses of it coming into force on May 25. These guidelines require digital companies such as Twitter, WhatsApp, and Facebook to change how they regulate content, appoint nodal officers for compliance and grievance redressal, and adopt features such as traceability of messages and voluntary user verification.Twitter said in a statement on Monday that the company is making every effort to comply with the new guidelines while continuing a constructive dialogue with the government. “Twitter has been and remains deeply committed to India, and serving the vital public conversation taking place on the service,” a Twitter spokesperson said, adding, “We have assured the government of India that Twitter is making every effort to comply with the new guidelines, and an overview on our progress has been duly shared.”There have been several instances of confrontation between the United States-based company and the government of India, particularly around government’s content takedown orders and Twitter’s actions against prominent people linked to the Bharatiya Janata Party for violation of its terms of use.Against this backdrop, the new IT rules hardened the stand-off last month, with the microblogging website earlier asking for more time to comply, raising concerns over the “core elements” of the norms, and flagging potential threats to the safety of its employees after a visit by the Delhi Police the same month.“Our intent was always clear: the company is free to do business in India, but it has to comply with the law of the land,” the official mentioned above said. The ministry earlier echoed this sentiment when it had said, “Leave alone proactively creating such a mechanism, Twitter Inc is in the inglorious bracket of refusing to do so even when mandated by law.”Hindustan Times reported on May 29 that other significant social media intermediaries that have 5 million users or more, such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and Google, have shared the details with the ministry.Under criticism over the past few months, the government has maintained that the new IT rules make companies more accountable for the online content posted on their websites and protects users from abuse. But the companies, several experts and Opposition parties believe that the norms may have a bearing on the right to free speech and privacy.WhatsApp has challenged the rules in the Delhi high court, calling it unconstitutional and a threat to Indians’ fundamental rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/committed-to-complying-with-new-it-rules-twitter-101623089136487.html
08-06-2021||India||SC seeks Covid orphans’ data from Delhi, Bengal||The Supreme Court on Monday told Delhi and West Bengal governments to share full information about the number of orphans and vulnerable children who were abandoned or lost single parent during the Covid-19 pandemic since April 2020.A tabular chart presented to the Court by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) contained a list of 30,071 children across states/union territories who lost either or both parents for the period from April 1, 2020 to June 5, 2020. Delhi reported unusually low figures of five orphans and 12 children who lost either parent. The figure was even low in West Bengal with just three orphans and eight children who lost one of their parents. This information was listed by the respective district or state level officers on the NCPCR portal “Bal Swaraj”.The “Bal Swaraj” portal requires states to provide information about orphans, abandoned children or those needing care and protection on account of losing a parent or guardian in six stages.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) KM Nataraj appearing for NCPCR singled out Delhi and West Bengal and said, “We are concerned about these two states/UTs as they are not at all cooperating in filling up the data on our portal. Rest of the states/UTs are reasonable in their figures.”“If information is not given to NCPCR, continuous monitoring of these children becomes difficult,” the law officer said.The concern expressed by the ASG was palpable. The death toll due to Covid-19 in West Bengal has already crossed 16,000 and in Delhi, in just two months (April-May 2021), there were over 13,000 deaths.The figures appeared unusually low to the court too which sought an explanation from the two governments. A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose said, “Delhi can’t be similar to Andaman and Nicobar Islands or a state like Sikkim. How do you explain your figures?” The court put this query to West Bengal government as well seeking an explanation.Advocate Chirag Shroff appearing for Delhi informed the Court that this data has been procured from the Child Welfare Committees (CWC) where children in need of care and protection (CNCP) (including orphans and abandoned children) have to be produced. Shroff said, “In the last 15 days, we have written to all departments and police to provide the data. In other states, the district magistrates directly provide this information.”The bench told Delhi government to upload the information on NCPCR website at the earliest and reach out to the children by providing their immediate needs. “States have constituted Special Task Forces having people from local administration and police at district level to identify these children. Do it in Delhi too,” the bench added.West Bengal was represented by advocate Sayandeep Pahari. Pahari said that the officials in the state were confused on whether the information sought pertained to children affected by Covid-19 or of CNCPs under the Juvenile Justice Act. “Don’t take refuge under confusion,” the bench replied, adding, “If all states have been uploading information as per our June 1 order, how can it be that West Bengal alone is not understanding.” The court directed the state to immediately upload the data on NCPCR portal.On June 1, the court had ordered the Centre to provide details about the PM CARES for Children scheme announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to look after children left destitute or without care giver during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Centre informed the court that modalities of implementing the scheme are being worked out and sought further time. The bench heard amicus curiae advocate Gaurav Agrawal and state governments on the immediate directions to be issued for catering to the needs of children affected by the pandemic. An order in this regard is expected to be passed on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-covid-orphans-data-from-delhi-bengal-101623088717214.html
08-06-2021||India||800mn to receive free ration till Diwali: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Monday a fourth extension of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) till Diwali in November this year, to help an estimated 800 million people retain access to free food grain and cope with the impact of the second wave of the pandemic and any future surge in Covid-19 infections.“Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana will be extended till Diwali. This means 80 crore people will get free ration in fixed quantity every month till November. The government stands with the poor people in all their needs. We are doing this so that my brothers and sisters and their families don’t have to sleep hungry,” said Modi in his address to the nation.Terming it a “big decision”, the Prime Minister added, “last year when we had to impose a lockdown, PMGKAY served 80 crore people for eight months. This year, it was extended to May and June due to the second wave.”The scheme, rolled out last year, provides five kilogram of free food grain to 800 million people already covered under the National Food Security law -- the world’s largest subsidised food support programme. The PMGKAY handouts come over and above the federal food law’s subsidised allocations.The decision was welcomed by members of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance.“The decision to provide free ration to all ration card holders by extending the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana till Diwali is useful and commendable. Thanks to the Hon’ble Prime Minister for this. This will be helpful in winning the war against Corona,” said Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said that the decision “fulfils the mantra ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas’”.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, however, attacked the PM, saying, “The Prime Minister has talked about vaccination, talked about the poor, but one of the biggest problems is emerging in the country regarding black fungus, what will he say about it, The black fungus under the nose of the Modi government The injection of fungus is being directly black marketing and the government is once again asleep.”The central government announced the first phase of the welfare programme, along with a slew of measures including a job package for returnee migrant workers, in April last year. The latest extension is aimed to cover the impact of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic that has gripped the nation since March.Last year, too, the PM extended the special scheme for food handouts till Diwali, to cover the entire festive season amid uncertainties looming large.According to the reports presented by the agriculture ministry last year, the scheme has been a “highly successful programme”. “During April-November 2020, 32.2 million tonnes of food grains were allocated, and 29.8 million tonnes were distributed, which is 93% of the allocation,” said the ministry in its report.Experts, however, said that a significant section of the beneficiaries have not got the benefits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/800mn-to-receive-free-ration-till-diwali-modi-101623088657178.html
08-06-2021||India||28,252 cases of black fungus logged during 2nd wave: Govt||India has reported about 28,252 cases of mucormycosis, a fungal infection, following the second wave of Covid-19, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said on Monday while chairing the 28th meeting of the group of ministers (GoM) on the pandemic.Mucormycosis, often also referred to a black fungus infection, is an opportunistic infection that is believed to be taking hold in people with suppressed immunity. Experts are trying to understand why there has been a spurt in cases, and suspicion has fallen on overuse of steroids and immunosuppressants as well as uncontrolled diabetes during Covid-19.“Twenty eight states have reported 28,252 cases of mucormycosis till now, out of which 86%, that is 24,370 cases, are having a history of Covid-19. Around 62.3% cases, that is about 17,601, are having history of diabetes. We have the maximum number of cases from Maharashtra which is about 6,329, followed by Gujarat with 5,486 cases, and then MP, UP, Rajasthan etc are affected,” he said.The health ministry also said that close to 30,000 Covid-19 samples have undergone whole genome sequencing in 10 laboratories that are a part of the INSACOG network. In total, there are 28 labs that are a part of the network meant to perform genome sequencing – a process that helps scientists understand if and how the virus has mutated.The Centre set up a consortium of 10 laboratories under INSACOG in December last year after the first of variants of concern appeared globally.“INSACOG sequencing labs are looking at the mutants which have significant potential of severely affecting the disease transmission. As of now, 10 national labs under INSACOG have sequenced around 30 thousand samples. 18 more labs have been added to the consortium recently to boost the capacity,” said the health minister.VK Paul, member (health), Niti Ayog presented a brief snapshot of the Covid-19 vaccination status, preparedness for paediatric Covid-19 care, and on steps to prevent a third wave.According to Paul, India took 141 days to deliver 230 million doses, which remains the second highest in the world after the US.Also, India is one of the world’s fastest countries in terms of number of doses administered so far, he said, although experts have called on the government to see these metrics in terms of proportion of population covered.“Out of 88.7 crore (887 million) people who have been administered at least one dose globally, India accounts for 17.9 crore(179 million), which is 20.2% of the global coverage. India is fully prepared to deal with paediatric Covid-19 care but caution remains the key as we deescalate (curbs). The third wave can be prevented if we continue following the Covid-apropriate behaviour such as wearing a mask, maintaining physical distancing and hand hygiene, and avoiding large-scale gatherings,” said Paul.As for the declining number of cases, the health minister said: “About 83% of active cases are in 10 states and the remaining 17% in 26 states and Union Territories. At least seven States— Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana, Gujarat, Uttarakhand and Jharkhand— have less than thousand cases… Even the most affected states like Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have observed decline in the number of cases at a significant rate. Growth rate has declined from 14.7% (5th May) to 3.48% (today).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/28252-cases-of-black-fungus-logged-during-2nd-wave-govt-101623088536510.html
08-06-2021||India||Unlocking begins in more states as Covid cases drop||Tamil Nadu, Haryana and Sikkim on Monday joined states such as Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat in announcing “unlock” guidelines that paved the way for reopening of businesses after the deadly second wave of Covid-19 gripped the country in April and May.Some states announced minor relaxations in restrictions in May but more joined them in the past few days, moving towards ending the curbs fully by the end of this month if there is no spurt in Covid cases. However, some states such as Kerala, where cases are still surging, Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh decided to extend the lockdown till June 16.In Kerala, the test positivity rate remained under 15% but the death toll crossed 10,000, according to data released by the state health ministry. The state is under lockdown since May 6 and it was extended twice; the government extended it for the third time when it was about to end on Wednesday.Karnataka is expected to announce “unlock” guidelines after a review of district-wise Covid numbers, state home minister Basavaraj Bommai said on Monday. The state is under lockdown till June 14. Himachal Pradesh has also extended its partial lockdown till June 14 while allowing opening of shops for an additional two hours every day.“Whatever we know from possible scenarios presented by eminent people, it (Covid) will decline and June will be much better but the concerns are when we open up, how do we behave because the virus has not gone anywhere,” NITI Aayog member (Health) VK Paul said last week. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday stressed on maintaining Covid protocols while opening up businesses and work.“The state government is taking a calculated risk and hence people have to take care of themselves. Nothing is going to be eased immediately,” Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said ahead of the start of the “five-tier unlock process” based on the weekly positivity rate and occupancy of oxygen beds in districts. Delhi started the unlocking exercise from May 31 and saw further easing of restrictions from Monday, with the government allowing resumption of metro train services at 50% capacity and reopening of markets and malls on an odd-even basis. The Uttar Pradesh government also extended relaxations to 71 districts where shops and markets outside containment zones will be allowed to open five days a week. Haryana has also relaxed norms while continuing with the lockdown till June 14.The Sikkim government, while announcing a state-wide lockdown for one more week till June 14, also allowed relaxations for shops selling groceries and hardware. Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin announced the extension of the state lockdown by a week till June 14 with some easing of restrictions from Monday, except in 11 districts where the number of new cases reported was still high. Goa extended its Covid curfew till June 14 with easing of some curbs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unlocking-begins-in-more-states-as-covid-cases-drop-101623088476441.html

08-06-2021||India||6k social media content takedown orders this year||The number of orders issued by the central government to social media companies to take down posts and accounts under Section 69(A) of the Information Technology Act, 2000, has seen a steep rise over the last couple of years, with nearly 6,000 orders issued until the first week of June this year, officials familiar with the matter told Hindustan Times.The number, said officials, has gone up from being around 3,600 in 2019, to over 9,800 in 2020. The posts asked to be taken down have been spread out across social media companies, including prominent players like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.“The posts concerned various issues including the recent farmers’ agitation, Kashmir, Khalistan and the pandemic that could have been a threat to public order or violated section 69(A) of the IT Act,” an official familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity, adding, “The orders were sent to Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, WhatsApp, Pinterest, Telegram. 99% of the orders have been complied with.”Section 69(A) of the IT Act allows the government to act against social media posts and accounts that may pose a threat to public order or India’s sovereignty and integrity, defence of India, security of the State, and friendly relations with foreign states.The order to block a post/account is issued by a designated officer appointed by the central government, who chairs an inter-ministerial committee comprising officials from the ministries of law and justice, home affairs, information and broadcasting and the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In). The committee approves requests from different stakeholders, including states and central agencies, and also gives the intermediary a hearing. The designated officer at present is Pronab Mohanty, the deputy director general of UIDAI.According to a reply filed by the ministry of electronics and information technology in Parliament on March 10, 9,849 URLs/accounts/web pages were blocked in 2020, up from 3,603 in 2019; 2,799 in 2018; and 1,385 in 2017. Of these, 1,717 orders were sent to Facebook and 2,731 to Twitter.The government has already sent Twitter two non-compliance notices for failing to act against certain accounts in the last six months that had posted on the ongoing farmers’ agitation and the Covid-19 pandemic. Last year in June, the government invoked this very provision to block access to over 250 mobile applications, mostly of Chinese origin, including popular short video streaming platform TikTok and game PUBG in the wake of increased tensions with the People’s Republic of China.In January this year, the government asked Twitter to take down content on the farmers’ agitation that carried a controversial hashtag regarding the Prime Minister, saying that it was a threat to public order. While Twitter withheld access to the posts, it refused to take down content by activists and journalists saying that it violated the tenets of free speech. A month later, as the impasse between the government and Twitter continued over the demand to block 257 accounts and posts related to farmers protests, the government asked the company to take over 1,178 accounts that may “foment trouble”.In April, the central government issued emergency blocking orders to take down over 100 “inflammatory” posts and accounts across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram related to Covid-19, including an official Facebook page of Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. The government faced pushback against the orders, which included blocking access to accounts of Congress’ Pawan Khera, Revanth Reddy, TMC’s Moloy Ghatak, a West Bengal state minister and filmmaker Vinod Kapri, with many arguing that the posts ordered to be blocked were critical of the government’s handling of the Covid pandemic.Apar Gupta, Internet Freedom Foundation trustee, said that the trends are related to the increase in the number of internet connections and rising online advocacy of subjects concerning citizenship laws and farm laws. “With respect to the examining committee, these orders earlier were restricted to specific posts to social media. But now some of these orders also require accounts to be blocked,” Gupta said. “ The continuing practice of lack of transparency and secrecy continues to be a problem.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6k-social-media-content-takedown-orders-this-year-101623014539309.html
08-06-2021||Today's||Covid-19: Not just an acute infection||The world is facing the biggest pandemic of the 21st century as the second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) continues to infect almost 170 million people across the globe, with numbers still counting. As the second wave of the deadly virus is beginning to recede, new post Covid-19 sequelae are coming into play.The post-Covid complications are proving as detrimental to the population as the acute Covid-19 illness does. The post-Covid sequelae may occur as a result of the side effect of the medications used during Covid-19 infection or due to severe immunity compromise and lung damage occurring as a result of the infection. Even the patients with asymptomatic acute Covid-19 illness can have highly complicated post-Covid repercussions. However, no strict risk factors have been defined for post covid sequelae so far as this condition is still very new and under investigation.In the previous wave of Covid-19, children presented with a Kawasaki-like illness (high-grade fever, rash, conjunctivitis, swelling, lymph node enlargement) within four weeks of Covid-19 infection with multi-systemic complications, that came to be known as post-Covid multi systemic inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). A similar presentation is seen in adults during the second wave with varied presentations still under research.Even after 14 days of illness, many patients are experiencing severe lethargy, joint pains, chest heaviness, breathing difficulty. These are caused by serious damage to the immunity and lungs during the acute illness and need good nutrition, breathing exercises, chest physiotherapy etc., for relief and recovery. These symptoms are very common and can take upto three months for complete remission.Post-Covid illness needing medical attention presents itself as generalised fatigue not improving with rest, continuous cough, dyspnea, palpitations, maculopapularrashes, arthralgia, high grade fever upto 4-12 weeks post acute Covid-19 illness. The condition can also present as a highly fatal illness causing pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction,viral myocarditis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, deep vein thrombosis, stroke, pancreatitis, hepatitis,etc. Such patients need to see a doctor immediately if they are experiencing any of the above symptoms. Any delay in treatment can cause severe complications and even death.Mucormycosis, more commonly known as black fungus, is one of the recent complications encountered in the patients recovering or recovered from Covid-19. It is a non-communicable fungal infection seen predominantly in patients taking high dose ill regulated steroids, using industrial oxygen for inhalation and having poorly controlled diabetes. Other risk factors are still under research as we are encountering almost 100 patients of mucormycosis everyday at AIIMS, New Delhi. Early signs of the infection include facial swelling, dental pain, blurring of vision/ double vision,discoloration of nose. Early identification of symptoms is very crucial for early diagnosis and initiation of treatment. If left untreated it can spread to vital organs like lungs and brain leading to increased complications that are very difficult to treat.Apart from all these varied symptoms, patients are also presenting side effects of high dose corticosteroids like hyperglycemia, severe bradycardia, gastritis and superadded bacterial infections. These signs need corticosteroid tapering and can not be regarded as post covid sequelae.Henceforth, early recognition of the signs and symptoms is extremely important to unfold this mysterious illness that is still under investigation.(Dr. Anupam Kumar Ranjan is a senior resident, emergency medicine at AIIMS New Delhi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/covid19-not-just-an-acute-infection-101623169602745.html
08-06-2021||Editorials||Franklin Templeton: A sordid saga||Many investors in mutual funds opt for debt funds because they believe them to be safe. But as the story of six Franklin Templeton India debt funds shows, it all depends on the risk appetite, assessment and integrity of the fund’s managers. To be sure, the pandemic’s impact on the economy was the factor that triggered the closure of the six funds last April, but as an order from stock market (and mutual fund) watchdog, Sebi, explained on Monday, there were other factors too. The order (which Franklin Templeton will challenge) points to the information asymmetry that allowed a senior executive at the company and his family to withdraw their investments in the six funds — shortly before they were closed. While investors have received around 27% of their investments in these funds, and will likely receive at least 60% in total (that’s the amount that’s come back to the funds), there are lessons in this sordid saga.The first lesson is for investors. Many may have been drawn to the generic safety of debt funds and the specific attractiveness of Franklin Templeton. This approach was clearly flawed because it ignored what the funds were investing in. The second is for the fund managers, with revelations of significant gaps in the due diligence process. The third is for regulators. Details of how Franklin Templeton ran its funds, and how its senior executive Vivek Kudva and his wife Roopa Kudva, who runs the impact investment firm Omidyar Network in India, exited the funds just before their closure point to possible areas that require monitoring, if not regulatory change. Sebi’s findings are also bound to raise questions of propriety and probity around the behaviour of the Kudvas, but that is beyond the regulator’s purview and a matter between them and their respective organisations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/franklin-templeton-a-sordid-saga-101623160725646.html
