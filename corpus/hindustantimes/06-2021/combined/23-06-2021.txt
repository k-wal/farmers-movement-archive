However, with the second wave of Covid-19 striking the country in April, he had to postpone his wedding.Now, Singh is planning to get with 50 of his close family members at a banquet hall in Sector 71 on June 28.“We have been hearing about the possibility of a third wave of the coronavirus disease and are uncertain how long relaxations will continue. Now that some restrictions have eased, we thought of using this window of opportunity to get married in a small ceremony,” he said.Like Singh, many couples had postponed their weddings which were scheduled in April-May this year owing to the spike in Covid-19 cases. Now, with young and old alike getting vaccinated against the virus, families are opting to go ahead with earlier plans.“My wedding was scheduled for May 13 but we had to postpone it because of the restrictions. At the time, only our grandparents had been inoculated. Now, while the grandparents on both sides are fully vaccinated, our immediate family, including uncles and aunts and cousins as well have got their first dose. Though we are aware that vaccination does not ensure full safety from the virus, we feel the risk is lower,” said Vibha Joshi, a resident of Sector 19, Noida.With new cases going down and restrictions getting relaxed, banquet hall owners say bookings have started coming in.“At least 20 weddings were supposed to be held at our banquet hall in the last two months. However, all of them were postponed. Now, we have again started getting at least one query a day and have been booked for three weddings, which are going to take place in the last week of June and the first week of July,” said Shashank Gupta, who runs Rajdhani Party Hall in Sector 104.According to Gurnam Sethi, owner of a banquet hall in Sector 51, most bookings are at very short notice.“Generally bookings for weddings are done months in advance but these days, we have been getting queries asking if the banquet hall is available in the next two-three days itself. Since we have been out of business for the last two months, we are happy to take such bookings as well,” he said.However, with the night curfew still in place – from 9pm till 7 am everyday – weddings have to be wrapped up by 8pm.“We have got around four bookings for weddings and all of them are day weddings, as we have to shut down the hall latest by 8.30pm because of the night curfew,” said Vikas Kasana, who owns a banquet hall in Greater Noida.To control the surge of Covid-19 cases that started this year in April, the Uttar Pradesh government had issued tight restrictions, including on weddings, besides imposing night curfew, which spoiled the wedding plans of many. The restrictions were eased in Gautam Budh Nagar on June 7 after the number of active cases fell below 600, but night restrictions are still in place.On May 19, revised guidelines from the state government restricted wedding ceremonies to 25 people. Now, as per the latest guidelines issued on June 19, weddings can be held with a maximum of 50 people in a closed or open space. All Covid protocols, precautions and social distancing need to be followed and organisers will be solely responsible for any violation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/banquet-halls-in-noida-get-bookings-as-weddings-resume-101624472864569.html
23-06-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad, GB Nagar come up with plans for mega vaccination starting July 1||Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar have prepared their micro plans for the mega vaccination drive that will begin on July 1. Ghaziabad: 40K vaccinations-a-dayGhaziabad has divided the district into 440 clusters that will be served by 305 teams.“In our plan, we can offer at least one dose to the 2.3 million adults eligible for the vaccine within 45 to 60 days. Of the clusters, 401 are in urban area. The biggest cluster is at Makanpur (Indirapuram) that has an estimated population of about 410,000. In Indirapuram, our teams will also hold camps at high-rises,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO) of Ghaziabad. The plan will see each Covid vaccination centre (CVC) reserving 50% of the slots for those who booked online and the rest for those within the cluster. Walk-in registrations will be available.“We have roped in four private hospitals that will also provide free vaccination with vaccines that we will provide,” said the CMO. to for providing free vaccination and more will be roped in. The vaccine to these centres is provided by the health department,” the officer added. GB Nagar: 25K vaccinations-a-dayThe health department said that their micro plan will be completed late Wednesday night and so details are currently unavailable. “We aim at over 25,000 doses a day. Each cluster will cover 8-10 square kilometres of area for one cluster. In rural there will be static vaccination centres and mobile camps that will move from place to place vaccinating people. Housing societies will be covered,” said Dr Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer of GB Nagar. Starting June 21, both the districts as also other districts in UP have taken up ‘near to home’ vaccination at selected centres. According to the Cowin portal figures at 9.30pm, the Ghaziabad district on Wednesday administered 20419 doses while GB Nagar administered 22312. The GB Nagar district stood at third spot after Gorakhpur (25861) and Lucknow (25301) while Ghaziabad stood fourth among the 75 districts in the state in terms of single highest one day vaccination. The state of Uttar Pradesh administered total of 743942 doses on Wednesday. “Our previous achievement was more than 26000 doses on June 21 and 22. It dropped somewhat on Wednesday as most of the centres were administering routine-immunisation doses and this activity is done on Wednesday and Saturdays every week. So, our vaccination was less on Wednesday,” Dr Gupta added. At the cluster vaccination centres, the beneficiaries aged 18 years and above can opt for on-spot registration and get the jabs. The teams operating in clusters will provide doses and try to saturate local area population with vaccination and thereafter move to another cluster.Before the cluster vaccination activity, mobilisation teams will take up three-day activity in clusters and will spread awareness about vaccination drive and urge people to come out and get themselves vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-gb-nagar-come-up-with-plans-for-mega-vaccination-starting-july-1-101624472863981.html

They said nobody was injured in the incident and the bullet hit the pavement. The incident took place outside the residence of an attache of the Israel embassy. Delhi police clarified that a woman constable’s 9MM pistol misfired “when she was handling it.” Police said the bullet did not hit anyone and hit a pavement on the road in front of the diplomat’s house on Paschimi Marg. Police said the woman constable was posted in a PCR van outside the attaché’s residence.Deputy commissioner of police(south west) Ingit Pratap Singh said, “Nobody is reported injured in the incident.

23-06-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Death count 3.5 times in second Covid wave||An analysis by the Ghaziabad health department found that although the total number of Covid-19 cases in the first and second wave of infections were more or less similar, deaths increased two to five times in different age groups.The department considered the first wave to be from March 1 last year to March 31 of this year. The second wave was considered to be from April 31 to June 18.The analysis also confirmed what experts had long been saying - children were less severely affected. It also confirmed that the elderly was particularly vulnerable, and experts say this further pushed the need to vaccinate them on priority. The analysisIn the first wave, the district accounted for 27,671 cases over 395 days, the second wave saw 27,849 over 78.Two children under 10 years of age died during the first wave, but the second wave had none and also saw fewer cases. Even those between 11 and 20 years had no deaths during both waves.From then on, the mortality rates -number of deaths per 100 cases- kept increasing. Those who were 60 years and above suffered the most with their mortality rate being 1.19% of the 3,354 cases during the first wave and 4.76% of 2,962 cases in the second wave.The overall mortality during the first wave was about 0.37%, while it was 1.28% in the second.And although more males died in both waves, which is consistent with previous research that said men were more likely to contract a severe form of the disease due to their lifestyle and higher levels of ACE-2 receptors that the virus uses to enter the cells, the mortality rate of females was higher.Health dept’s plan for a 3rd waveBased on such data and comments from experts, the district expects the third wave to run on similar lines.“Although we are preparing for any likelihood of the next wave, we expect children not be affected then too. They have shown better immunity, while routine immunisation also helped them against many viruses. The closure of schools and colleges has also helped,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, district surveillance officer.“The severity of infection was high during the second wave and majority of fatalities took place during the short span in months of April and May this year. It was due to pneumonitis and involvement of lungs which affected about 80% patients during the second wave. Majority of patients were referred to L2 or L3 category hospitals due to severity of infection and demand for ICU beds also soared,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. “Children in from 0 to 10 years showed resilience. Still, keeping in mind the possibility of a third wave, we have started preparations with paediatric ICUs in different hospitals and even new oxygen plants are getting installed for medical supplies to serve all ages.”Uttar Pradesh has a three-tier Covid health care system with L1 for mild case, L2 for moderate and L3 for severe cases.Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad), said that although data suggested that children were less affected, it may not have taken into account asymptomatic cases that were not confirmed through tests.“From our experience, we can say that more children were affected during the second wave and many of them were asymptomatic. In any case, in the event of a third wave, it is not only children who may be affected. It could be anyone from the different age groups who have not taken vaccination or have not developed antibodies. The higher severity of the infection (Delta variant) resulted in higher fatality rate in short period during the second wave,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-death-count-3-5-times-in-second-covid-wave-101624472803349.html

Identified as Harswaroop, 44, the accused is presently posted at the police headquarters. His brother Prem Gyan Sagar, 38, works as a delivery man with Swiggy. The two are married to two sisters.While Prem was stabbed multiple times, his wife Divya, 35, sustained one stab injury that proved fatal. Prem is undergoing treatment at Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32. Harswaroop has been booked under Sections 302 (murder) and 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code on the statement of the couple’s teenaged son. The couple has two sons. Brothers had strained relationship for longThe two brothers stay in the house owned by their father, who lives in Himachal Pradesh. While Harswaroop stays with his wife, son and daughter on the ground floor, Prem’s family stays on the first floor.According to police, the brothers had a strained relationship and used to regularly fight over issues such as division of electricity and water bill. For the past few days, they had been having arguments over water supply. Prem had reportedly accused Harswaroop of deliberately keeping the water pump motor switched off to stop supply to the first floor, and even called up his father to complain. Harswaroop told police that when he returned home on Tuesday, Prem again started arguing over the issue. Around 9pm, the ASI, who was drunk, went to the first floor and attacked Prem while he was having dinner. Prem was stabbed half a dozen times. As Divya intervened to save her husband, she was stabbed too, said police. ‘I wanted to put an end to daily fights’ Divya’s brother Abhinandan, whose other sister is married to Harswaroop, said the cop has always been hot tempered and had tried to harm Prem and Divya earlier too.

Senior BJP leaders said the Delhi government must tell people why it has not been able to implement the ‘One nation, One ration card’ scheme in the entire city.Reacting to deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia’s press conference regarding the Centre’s letter on doorstep delivery of ration, Delhi’s BJP chief Adesh Gupta said, “It is ridiculous when the government that is unable to deliver ration at fair price shops and distribution centres on time talks about doorstep delivery of ration.”Gupta said the AAP government has failed to ensure proper distribution of ration provided by the Centre. “They have done little to bring transparency in the distribution system. The e-POS system is yet to be implemented,” he said. A Delhi government spokesperson said BJP is giving incorrect information. Imran Hussain, AAP leader and Delhi’s food and supplies minister, said, “Under the visionary leadership of CM Arvind Kejriwal, the Delhi government is firmly committed to provide free ration to both NFS (National Food Secutity) beneficiaries and non-PDS (public distribution system) needy people (who do not have ration cards), as long as the situation warrants. The Delhi government strongly believes that free ration in Covid pandemic is not a privilege but a basic obligation of the government towards its people. We are providing free ration to people of Delhi and will continue to do so.” Senior BJP leaders Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, leader of the opposition in the Delhi assembly, and northeast Delhi MP and former Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari targeted the government for not implementing the Centre’s ration policy and not using e-POS to ensure transparency in ration distribution. Bidhuri alleged that the Delhi government has implemented the One nation, One ration card scheme in just one circle or assembly constituency.Tiwari said, “Most states have implemented the Centre’s schemes and provisions for ration distribution, but only Delhi government has a problem with e-POS and One nation, One ration card scheme.”Gupta also sought an explanation as to why the state government is discontinuing the free ration scheme from July 1. “I want to ask @ArvindKejriwal, when the Centre is giving free ration till November, then why is Delhi government discontinuing free ration scheme from July 1?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-slams-delhi-govt-for-not-implementing-centre-s-ration-scheme-101624472443296.html
23-06-2021||Other||Now, no need to visit RTO for registration certificate||The Delhi government has empowered self-registered vehicle dealers in Delhi to issue temporary registration certificates to owners who buy a new car or two-wheeler from their outlets but reside outside the national capital. Senior transport officials said the larger plan in the coming months is to completely decentralise the process of issuing registration certificates (the permanent ones) at the dealers’ end, so that vehicle owners do not have to visit a regional transport office (RTO) to get it issued. In an order passed on Tuesday night, the state transport department said the temporary registration certificates to be issued by self-registration dealers will be valid for a month. “Self registration dealers in Delhi can now issue temporary registration certificate for new vehicles sold from their outlet, along with a unique registration mark listed under Rule 34 of Delhi Motor Vehicles Rules (DMVR). The self-registration dealers will be allocated blocks of registration marks for the purpose of issuing temporary registration certificates,” said transport minister Kailash Gahlot. The order, seen by HT, stated that the temporary registration mark in red letters and figure on yellow background will be displayed on the vehicle in a prescribed manner. The designation and address of the self registering dealer will be also cited on the registration plate, it said.Currently, those who buy a new vehicle from Delhi need to simultaneously visit an RTO to get a temporary registration certificate issued by the motor licensing officer (MLO). Now, this has been decentralised and approximately 200 self registration dealers across the city have been given the authority to create on-the-spot temporary registration certificates. “While it is easy for owners of new vehicles who are residents of Delhi to visit the RTO and do such things, those who come from NCR to purchase a car or two-wheelers in Delhi found it very cumbersome to first go to the showroom, then to the RTO and then return to their city. This will save a lot of time as now, the owner can directly head home after purchasing a new car or bike,” said a senior transport official, who did not wish to be named. Approximately, 1,000 vehicles are sold in Delhi every month, with most of the owners living in other states. “Once they have taken the temporary registration certificate from the dealer, they can directly get a permanent registration certificate made from their respective state and immediately apply for it. No time will be wasted,” the official explained. The state transport department is running a pilot project in three of its RTOs - New Delhi, Sarai Kale Khan and Mall Road - to completely decentralise the process of issuing registration certificate. “The next step will be to issue permanent registration cards directly from the dealers. So, there will be no need to come to an RTO,” said Gahlot.This is part of the department’s ambitious project of providing “faceless transport services” to people. At present, 12 services, including renewal and duplicate driving licence or registration certificate, permit or RC transfer, among others, have been shifted online. The second phase will include 58 services. The department is now also working on issuing learners driving licences online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/now-no-need-to-visit-rto-for-registration-certificate-101624472384066.html

Interestingly, over 65% respondents have approved that their children receive the Covid-19 vaccine if it is made available by September 2021.“We conducted six separate surveys this year. In January, nearly 69% parents were ready to send their wards to school by April 2021 but this number fell to a mere 20% in the June survey. Given the lack of online education in many rural parts of the country, the fatigue of online classes, the risk of Covid spread and the possibility of a third wave, we conducted this survey to understand the opinion of parents on sending their children to school,” highlighted the survey report made public by LocalCircles, a community social media platform enabling citizens and small businesses to escalate issues for policy enforcement and interventions.The survey received more than 19,000 responses from parents located in 293 districts of the country. Around 48% parents were from Tier 1 districts, 29% from Tier 2 districts and 22% from Tier 3, Tier 4 and rural districts of India. Of the 19,000 respondents who participated in this survey, a little over 2,000 parents belong to Maharashtra. The survey report highlighted how nearly 70% parents in Maharashtra were not comfortable with the idea of sending their children to school unless Covid cases go down to zero. Similarly, 58% parents approved of vaccinating their wards while 25% felt they would consider this move based on appropriate data/findings.“Majority parents are not ready to risk the lives of their children, especially at a time when we are hearing of new variants of Covid and the fact that more children contracted the virus in the second wave. We have been requesting the government to conduct vaccination drives at least for the Class 8 to 12 students for the time being, if not for the younger children,” said Anubha Srivastav Sahai, president of India Wide Parent Association (IWPA). She added that even in January 2021, when the state government decided to reopen schools in some districts, many parents chose not to send their children to school despite dwindling cases. “Instead of focusing on reopening schools, the government should focus on the vaccination drive at present and to ensure that all children have internet facilities so no one misses out on education,” she added. While the state of Maharashtra has not yet clarified its stand on school/college reopening, several other states have announced similar decisions. Both Bihar and Telangana governments have decided to reopen schools and colleges from July 1, whereas the Uttar Pradesh government has asked teachers to start attending schools physically and conduct online lectures from their schools starting July 1.Dr Samir Dalwai, developmental and behavioural paediatrician said the fear among parents is more about the fact that reopening of schools will automatically mean a large number of people sharing the same space. “We cannot trust children to keep masks on or follow social distancing rules,” said Dalwai. He added that there’s also a group of parents who feel reopening of schools will calm the anxiety among children, who have been locked up at home with their families for over a year now. “There has been an increase in the number of children seeking counselling because their interactions are limited to online classes. However, the fear of children contracting the virus in schools is fear and the majority of parents are not open to sending their children to schools,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/76-parents-don-t-want-to-send-kids-to-school-till-covid-cases-drop-to-zero-survey-101624472144687.html

Asha workers were on indefinite strike in the state from June 15.The state has also assured to provide a smartphone to all the Asha workers and an additional allowance of ₹200 for crowd management duty at vaccination centres. The decision was taken in a meeting with representatives of Asha workers and state health minister Rajesh Tope, on Wednesday.They were receiving around ₹6,000 per month that included ₹1,000 as allowance for Covid duty from the Centre. The state Asha Workers Action Committee had demanded to increase the honorarium up to ₹18,000.It was the third meeting called to resolve the issue as the state government was not ready to increase honorarium, saying that they were facing a financial crunch.Tope said, “After discussions, we have decided to increase fixed honorarium by ₹1,000 and ₹500 for Covid duty a month from July 1. We have also decided to provide smartphones to all the Asha workers which will be very useful for them in their day to day work.”“We have also decided to provide another ₹200 as an additional allowance for crowd management duty at vaccination centres. Besides, ₹500 will also be increased in the honorarium from next year,” he added.The state has around 71,867 Asha workers that include 3,570 supervisors also known as ‘Gat Pravertak’. The hike will bring an additional burden of ₹202 crore on the state exchequer.Asha workers are considered the backbone of the rural healthcare system in the state. They have been playing a significant role in the state’s fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.Asha was formed under the National Rural Health Mission to provide every village in the country with a trained female community health activist.

In addition, Mhada will also pay rents to the existing tenants who have been deprived of the same for years.The tenants who have been fighting for years finally heaved a sigh of relief. “The state government has finally done justice to our cause. We will finally get our legal house,” said Rajesh Dalvi, president, Patra Chawl Sangharsh Samiti. “This is finally the first time that Mhada will be paying rents to the tenants,” he added.The redevelopment of Patrawala Chawl in Siddharth Nagar has been mired in controversy due to the builder’s failure to provide new houses to existing tenants, depriving Mhada of its share of flats and for not paying rent to tenants.In 2007, Mhada allowed Guru Ashish to redevelop and rehabilitate 675 chawl tenants. However, Mhada received complaints that he had sold the project to HDIL. However, Guru Ashish denied these claims.A 2018 report by the then housing secretary Sanjay Kumar found that an error in the calculation of Patra Chawl area caused losses to the tune of ₹474 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-mhada-to-revamp-47-acre-patra-chawl-101624471963330.html

According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the maximum temperature will hover around 41°C on Thursday as well. IMD also said that the monsoon is only expected in the first week of July, refusing to give a fixed date.On Wednesday, IMD recorded maximum and minimum temperatures for Noida at 40.5°C and 28°C, respectively, against 39.8°C and 27.4°C a day earlier. On Monday, Noida had recorded the daytime temperature at 34°C.At the Safdarjung monitoring station, considered average for the National Capital Region, the maximum and minimum temperatures on Wednesday were recorded at 40.7°C and 28.6°C, respectively.“The monsoon has been delayed and is only expected to arrive in the first week of July. The dry westerly winds would continue, and the maximum temperature may rise slightly on Thursday. There are chances of patchy rains on June 25 and 26 due to formation of convective cloud, which may lead to slight drop in mercury but not below 38°C,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.On June 11, the IMD had forecast that the south-west monsoon would hit the region by June 15. However, in a later forecast, the Met department said that its arrival was delayed by 10-12 days.The monsoon generally hits the region late June with 65cm (long period average) of rainfall expected between June 1 and September 30 and considered normal for Delhi-NCR, including Noida (average based on old records). Last year, however, the region received 57.6cm of rainfall, which was about 88% of long period average. Meanwhile, the air quality of Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad deteriorated from ‘moderate’ to ‘poor’ category over the past 24 hours “due to transport of dust from arid region”, pollution monitoring agencies said.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Wednesday was 227 (‘poor’) against 127 a day earlier. Similarly, the AQI of Greater Noida was 240 against 116 a day earlier, while Ghaziabad recorded an AQI of 225 against 137 a day earlier. An AQI level up to 100 is considered ‘good’, between 101 and 200 is ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is ‘very poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the pollution levels are likely to spike for short range of time. “Surface winds are moderate and westerly. Although ventilation is favourable for dispersion, an increase in dust long-range transport is expected for the next three days. AQI is likely to deteriorate,” said a SAFAR statement on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/mercury-soars-air-quality-worsens-in-noida-as-monsoon-delayed-101624471723986.html

Dr Mukherjee was the founder of the Bharatiya Jan Sangh, the predecessor to the Bharatiya Janata Party. Speaking on the occasion at Civil hospital here, Yogi praised the Prime Minister and home minister for abrogation of Article 370 and said this was a dream of Dr Mukherjee. “Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee gave a vision to the country but when the Congress government came to power, he dedicated himself to the service of Bharat Mata. When the then central government added Article 370 in the Constitution, he opposed it. He gave a slogan: ‘Ek desh mein do pradhan, do vidhan aur do nishan nahi challenge.’ He became the victim of a conspiracy on this day in 1953. His sacrifice became the basis for the unity of India,” said the CM. “We all appreciate PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah who fulfilled the dream of Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee and removed Article 370 in August 2019. This connected Jammu and Kashmir with the mainstream and they prepared the roadmap of development with the pledge to eliminate terrorism from the Valley. J&K is connected with development mainstream now,” said the CM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/yogi-pays-tributes-to-dr-shyama-prasad-mukherjee-101624471543794.html
23-06-2021||Noida||Noida to get two more STPs by December||NOIDA: The deadline of two sewage treatment plants, which are being built in sectors 123 and 168, has been reduced by nine months, the Noida authority said on Wednesday. Officials said that the ₹259 crore project will now be completed by December this year. The authority had in August 2020 started work on the project with a deadline of September 2022. “We are constructing two new STPs as per the needs. These two facilities will benefit the residential areas near the project sites,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer of the Noida authority.The authority is constructing a 100 million litre per day (MLD) capacity STP in Sector 168 and another 80 MLD capacity STP in Sector 123. The treated water from the two STPs will be used for irrigation and horticulture purposes, thereby saving precious groundwater, the officials said.“Both the STPs will be completed by December 2021 as we have expedited the work after restrictions of Covid-19 pandemic were lifted last week,” said an authority official, not authorised to speak to media.Notably, Sector 168 already has an STP (40 MLD capacity) and Sector 123 has a 35 MLD STP. But the authority decided to construct two more STPs in these two areas, where new residential and commercial development is taking place. At present, the city has a total of six STPs -- two (34MLD and 25MLD capacities) in Sector 50, two (33MLD and 54MLD) in Sector 54, and one each in sectors 123 and 168. The proposed STP in Sector 168 will treat the sewage from newly developed group housing complexes located in sectors 128, 129, 130, 135, 150 and 151, among others, while the Sector 123 STP will cater to sectors 118, 119, 120 and 121, among other areas, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-to-get-two-more-stps-by-december-101624471543287.html

So was the case on the Pune-Nashik highway where 80% of the drivers violated the speed limitFollowing the survey, Parisar has written to the director-general of police (DGP) Sanjay Pandey to lower permissible speed limits in urban areas and to adopt appropriate and strong enforcement measures to curb speed violations across state.“Our survey shows that vehicles are speeding with impunity. This is despite the fact that there is a minimum ₹1,000 fine for this offence,” said Ranjit Gadgil, program director, Parisar. “The Supreme Court-appointed Committee on road safety has also asked states to take ‘strong and urgent measures to deal with over speeding’ and directed them to suspend the violator’s licence for a period not less than three months. Enforcement of the speed law is not happening adequately,” he added.According to the National Crime Records Bureau 7.58 lakh people lost their lives in road accidents in 2019. Maharashtra has ranked second for the maximum number of road accidents after Tamil Nadu. The state also stood in the second position in terms of fatalities in road accidents with 14,608 deaths in 2019.According to the Maharashtra highway traffic police, 51,495 persons lost their lives in the state in road accidents between 2016 and 2019, while 82,527 people were seriously injured in road accidents in this period. According to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways report of 2019, Uttar Pradesh recorded the highest 22,655 road crash deaths or 15% of total deaths in 2019 across the country, followed by Maharashtra, which recorded 12,788 or 8.5% of the total deaths in India.Sandeep Gaikwad, senior program associate at Parisar said, “We need to see enforcement agencies showing urgency to enforce speed laws on the road.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-rampant-speed-limit-violations-in-cities-says-survey-101624471484081.html

A team of Atulya Ganga, an organisation formed by Army veterans and civil volunteers, conducted a ‘hawan’ to mark the successful completion of the yatra at Samudra Koop, Jhunsi. Earlier, the team of Atulya Ganga undertook a 7-km walk from Phaphamau to Samudra Koop in Jhunsi, marking the last leg of the journey. The Parikrama had commenced from Prayagraj on December 16, 2020. On Thursday, a formal function to mark the end of the ‘Atulya Ganga Parikrama 2020-21’ (Prayagraj-Gangasagar-Gangotri-Prayagraj) would be held at the Circuit House where the team members would share the ‘The Parikrama Story’ followed by a brief felicitation ceremony for the walkers. One of the organising members of the yatra, Abhay Mishra said that ‘Atulya Ganga’ was envisaged to be a massive mass movement with youth participation. This was to be an endeavour for 11 years (2020-2030) with its main pillars being ‘Ganga Parikrama’ or Walkathon, pollution mapping, tree plantation drives and youth mobilization. “This was the biggest ever Indian walk for the cause of vanishing Indian rivers. On the walk, a dedicated team geotagged, measured and recorded every source of pollutant discharged into the Ganga. As part of Vrikshmaal Drive’, thousands of trees like Bargad, Neem and Peepal were also planted by ‘Atulya Ganga’ team in the flood plains as part of this initiative. The team planted over 30,000 trees with tree-mentor and locations nominated at the sites for ensuring high survival of saplings,” explained Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/atulya-ganga-parikrama-concludes-in-prayagraj-101624471363342.html
23-06-2021||Gurugram||Residents’ associations joined forces to deal with Covid-19 second wave||As the second wave of Covid-19 hit the city hard over the last two months, with thousands of new cases being reported every day, 59 residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) joined forces to support one another with essential supplies and medical aid for infected persons in their societies as the healthcare infrastructure was overburdened.Coming under the banner of RWAs United (RU), the association set up Covid-19 care centres, arranged vaccination camps in residential areas, arranged for regular oxygen supply and ensured timely collection of biomedical waste, after receiving the administration’s approval for the same.“The tragedy and urgency of the situation led to this pan-city RWA group,” said Jyoti Ahuja, the joint secretary of Vatika City RWA, which was one of the founding members of RU in 2019, to promote cooperation among friends and acquaintances living in different societies.Since April, the group expanded from a collective of dozen RWAs of societies located on Sohna Road to include 59 members from across the city.Pawan Tharwani, the president of Carlton Estate Condominium Association, which is a member of RU, highlighted that the collective played an important role in saving the lives of residents. “Our biggest challenge was in late April, when there was no availability of oxygen cylinders anywhere in Delhi-NCR. During this time, all the RU members kept passing leads in the hope of a breakthrough,” said Tharwani. “Finally, one of the members was able to find an oxygen plant in Haridwar that was willing to fill empty cylinders. For seven to 10 days, a vehicle was sent to Haridwar every alternative day to refill cylinders,” he said, adding that the transportation costs were borne by 10-12 RWAs that were in dire need of oxygen cylinders for their residents.Amid making alternative arrangements, the RU was also simultaneously engaged with the district administration for the procurement of oxygen cylinders. “The administration eventually heeded to our demand and registered RWAs for the distribution of oxygen cylinders. Those two weeks were the most challenging for RU, but they were also the most rewarding as we were able to help and perhaps, save many lives,” said Tharwani. Ahuja said that the purpose of this group is to learn and benefit from each others’ experiences and share good practices with one other. “We believe that we will all benefit and achieve more if we come together on common issues and concerns. A united front of RWAs will give us much greater strength and leverage with authorities and government departments to resolve our issues. None of us has prior experience or training in governing our societies, but we learn from each others’ experiences,” said Ahuja.Tharwani said that there are some basic guidelines for the members of this group.“We don’t have any leadership positions in RU. Every member is equal. We believe in representing ourselves to the authorities without any intermediary. Anyone can put up a new idea or proposal for consideration on our Whatsapp group and have it discussed by all present for merit and any improvements or suggestions. With majority consensus it is then forwarded to authorities under a common letterhead,” said Tharwani.Tharwani said that new members have to adhere to a list of guidelines. “Filling up an online form is mandatory for joining RU, in order to authenticate and verify credentials of said RWA. RU can accommodate a maximum of two governing body members from any single residential area,” said Tharwani.Gurugram mayor Madhu Azad commended the group on coming together and said that such associations are vital for getting concerns and demands of residents passed on to the government to expedite resolutions. “Unions and joint groups often lead to positive outcomes. It becomes much easier for the government to pass on directions as well as address queries through a single channel. It not only streamlines the process of dispersing information but also ensures that the maximum number of citizens receive vital and above all, genuine information, through one common entity,” said Azad.Even as the number of Covid-19 cases has decreased this month, members of the association said that they are looking to expand the group further. They said that they will coordinate on civic issues, such as exchanging numbers of contractors who have carried out painting work, built colony roads and fixed electrical transformers, among others.“Under RU, RWA members are exchanging information with each other regarding measures that help in running the society efficiently, discussing ambiguities in laws, holding election processes and sharing concerns with authorities, among other such matters. Our aim to incorporate at least 100 RWAs under this group by the end of this year and serve as a common voice and changemaker in the city,” said Nilesh Tandon, the president of Fresco Apartments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/residents-associations-joined-forces-to-deal-with-covid-19-second-wave-101624471186024.html
23-06-2021||Gurugram||Covid-19: Men account for 61.5% of total vaccinations in district||As many as 61.5% of the residents who have been vaccinated so far are men, while women account for only 38% of the total in Gurugram, an analysis of data available on the Co-WIN platform revealed. Experts say that while the existing gender disparity plays a role here, setting up vaccination services near residence will help in reducing the gender gap in vaccination.As per the data, of 1,056, 946 people who have been vaccinated with at least one dose in the district till now, 650, 749 are men, while 406,197 are women. At the state level too, 3,801,804 men have been vaccinated while 3,056, 294 women have received their first dose of Covid-19 shot. The trend was also observed in neighbouring Delhi, where 3,004,947 men and 2,173,101 women have been vaccinated, as per the Co-WIN data.The Co-WIN app, however, did not display data regarding transgender persons in the district.Going by the 2011 census for Gurugram, out of the 1.5 million population, about 800,000 are men while 700,000 are women, with the sex ratio of 854 females to 1,000 males, reflecting the existing gender gap in the population. The chief medical officer for Gurugram, Dr Virender Yadav, said that the health department has been holding vaccinations at all health centres to facilitate people in getting vaccinated. “Many women in rural and semi-urban areas cannot move out easily due to responsibilities or sometimes, they are hesitant to go out on their own. They need the male member of the family to assist them. These factors restrict the (lower) footfall of women,” said Yadav. Vaccination started in the district on January 16, with the inoculation of healthcare workers, followed by front-line workers. It gradually opened for people above 60 years, followed by those above 45 years and then for people in the 18-45 age bracket. The pace of vaccination has picked up in June, with almost 400,000 vaccine doses administered in the last 23 days. On Wednesday, about 12, 419 doses were administered, out of which 7,494 were administered at government health centres while 4,925 were administered at private hospitals in the district. Of the total doses, about 9,437 inoculations were of people in the 18-45 age group, followed by coverage of 2,849 people aged above 45 years. At least 59 healthcare workers and 83 front-line workers and their family members also took the vaccine shot. Senior epidemiologist Dr Rajesh Kumar, the former head of community medicine department and school of public health, PGIMER-Chandigarh, said, “Near-to-home vaccination services started in a few states to cover elderly and persons with disability will help those women who are not able to move out easily due to household chores or restrictions on the movement. It is still a challenge for many women to stand in a queue for hours to take the vaccine shot. In many cases, families prefer getting male vaccinated instead of women. The existing gender gap also casts its impact on the overall vaccination number.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19men-account-for-61-5-of-total-vaccinations-in-district-101624471185438.html

The cars were spotted by passers-by on Monday evening after flow of water in the canal was controlled for desilting work. Police used cranes to pull out the cars and found one decomposed body in each car. SSP of Muzaffarnagar Abhishek Yadav said, “Post mortem examination reports confirmed that the deaths were due to drowning and the bodies were handed over to family members for last rites”. He said that district magistrate Selva Kumari J had directed the officials of the department concerned to put up proper reflectors on the canal side road and also to construct protection walls. The first car was spotted in Ratanpur area and was pulled out with the help of a crane. A decomposed body was found on the back seat and the man was identified as Dilshad Ansari (33) by the driving license recovered. He was a resident of Lakhaan village in Muzaffarnagar and had gone to meet his elder brother in Kukda village on January 17. He left the house at midnight to fetch some people from IGI Airport but neither reached there, nor returned to his village. His family lodged a complaint of missing in Nai Mandi police station on January 22. Police informed his family members about the incident and recovery of his body. Similarly, passers-by spotted a car near Chitaura Jhal after the water level receded. When the car was pulled out of the water a decomposed corpse was recovered and later identified as a retired LIC officer Harendra Atrey (62), who lived with his family in Dwarika City colony of Muzaffarnagar. He was also missing since February 11 and identified through some papers of LIC recovered from his car. A canal side road bifurcates from Moradnagar town in Ghaziabad which goes to Haridwar and commuters use it as an alternative route to go to Haridwar, Rishikesh and Dehradun. Many incidents have been reported in past years when cars fell into the deep water of the canal after drivers lost control over the wheel. These two cars are also believed to have fallen into the canal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2-bodies-pulled-out-of-ganga-canal-believed-to-be-mishap-victims-101624471184060.html
23-06-2021||Gurugram||No water supply, police curtailing movement, allege Khori Gaon residents||Residents of Khori village in Faridabad, where about 10,000 houses built illegally on Aravalli land are to be demolished, on Wednesday alleged that increased police presence in the area has brought their daily life to a halt. Residents said that neither are water tankers being allowed to enter the village nor are they being allowed to move out for basic things, such as going to work or seeing a doctor. The police, however, denied the allegations.Sapna, a resident of Khori village, said that only those residents who are packing their belongings and leaving the village are being allowed to move freely. “Water and electricity supply to the village have already been disconnected for over a week and now, police deployed outside the village are not even allowing water tankers to enter. Many houses do not even have drinking water and are being forced to drink dirty water,” she said.Nirmal Gorana, the general secretary of Bandhua Mukti Morcha, an organisation that has been working with the residents of Khori village to seek rehabilitation, said, “In the past two days, police deployment has increased in the area and the main problem that the residents are facing is of water, as tankers are not being allowed to enter. The situation is such that the residents are neither able to live in their own homes nor find a new place elsewhere, as they do not have the financial strength.”Residents of Khori have been vacating their homes since the Supreme Court, on June 7, ordered the demolition of slums encroaching on the Aravalli forest area in Faridabad district, holding that there cannot be a “compromise or concession on forest land”. Residents, however, have been demanding rehabilitation since then, but haven’t received any response from the authorities yet. Last week, a 70-year-old man, who had recently completed the construction of his house by spending around ₹3 lakh, allegedly killed himself, fearing that his house would be demolished.“As the lockdown guidelines have been eased a bit, many residents are trying to go outside to look for temporary jobs, but with movement being stopped, how are we supposed to do that? A group of residents had planned to peacefully march till Delhi to the Prime Minister’s office to share our demands, but that was also stopped by the police officials,” said a resident, who did not wish to be named. Officials of Faridabad police said that around 150 police personnel have been deployed at Khori village and checkpoints have been set up at all entry points of the village. Refuting the allegations of the residents, Sube Singh, spokesperson for Faridabad Police, said, “Police have set up checkpoints at entry points of the village from a safety point of view, to ensure that outsiders do not spread violence or misinformation in the village. Residents of Khori are being allowed to move freely.” Officials of the district administration also said that water supply through tankers is being continued to the village. “Water tankers might not be allowed to enter the village but tankers are regularly being sent to the area and stationed at particular points from where villagers can carry the water,” said Pankaj Kumar, the subdivisional magistrate of Badhkal, which comprises Khori village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/no-water-supply-police-curtailing-movement-allege-khori-gaon-residents-101624471183270.html
23-06-2021||Gurugram||Material recovery facilities to replace secondary waste collection points||To reduce the load on the Bandhwari landfill, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is planning to develop material recovery facilities, for segregating waste at a secondary level, officials said on Wednesday. Currently, all waste collected from households is dumped at a waste collection point or waste pit, marked as secondary points, from where it is carried to the landfill for processing. During an interaction with MCG councillors on Monday, MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja said that the civic body is changing its waste collection strategy and setting up material recovery facilities to replace all existing secondary collection points. The facilities, he said, will be used for segregating waste, from which recycled items can be sold to private companies. “There is a big difference between sitting in Chandigarh and seeing Gurugram on the ground. We all (officials and councillors) have to work together to make Gurugram a better city. Officials have been directed to make the city garbage and polythene free. Under this, material recovery facilities will be developed instead of pits or secondary waste points,” said Ahuja, who, until last month, served as the deputy commissioner of Panchkula.During the meeting, Ahuja also apprised councillors that Ecogreen, the MCG’s concessionaire for door-to-door collection of waste, and the civic body’s sanitation wing officials have been directed to set up these facilities. MCG officials said that a material recovery facility is a key component in the Solid Waste Management (SWM) Rules, 2016.A senior official, requesting anonymity, said “Besides reducing the load on the landfill, a material recovery facility helps in saving and earning money. With the load of waste reducing, the quantity of waste carried to the landfill, and the number of trips to carry it also reduces, thereby saving fuel and transportation costs. The sale of recycled waste then helps in generating money.” The official said that in a nutshell, a material recovery facility will have various types of machines to segregate waste at different stages, through which items such as plastics, glass bottles, metals and paper, among other such items, can be recovered, recycled, and sold.

23-06-2021||Gurugram||Illegal road on forest land closed near Damdama||Taking action against illegal encroachments in the Aravallis, the Gurugram forest department shut one such route used near Damdama, officials said on Wednesday.Officials from the forest department said that they found that locals had constructed a road that was more than the approved length on the pretext of repairing a road to a local temple. “We had learnt from the villagers that they wanted to repair a kachha road leading to a temple in Damdama near Rojkagujar, but when our staff visited the area, they saw that the villagers had formed the road on more than required area, which can be used for illegal mining. The road connects around 12 villages and around four small lanes had also been carved out. But as the work continued for a longer duration, we found it was suspicious. We blocked the road after an inspection by our team,” a forest official from the Sohna forest range said.Encroachments in the Aravallis of Gurugram and Faridabad have increased in the past two months of Covid-19 induced lockdown. Earlier this month, encroachments were reported at the Aravalli Biodiversity Park near Nathupur village in Gurugram, along with similar incidents being reported from Faridabad. In May, a wall was built across one acre of Aravalli land in Faridabad, in a fresh encroachment attempt. In March, a little over 25 acres of forest land in Ankhir village of Faridabad forest division was also found encroached.In another incident, reported from Mangar village in Faridabad, locals alleged that four acres of Aravalli land were levelled on Tuesday.Raj Kumar, the divisional forest officer Faridabad forest division, said, “I learnt from locals that levelling of land was being done with fresh mud dumped on an encroached plot in the Aravallis. We sent a team for inspection to the site on Wednesday and I am waiting for a report from them.” The land in question is notified under special sections 4 and 5 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act that extends protection against land-use change to certain specified Aravalli areas, forests and trees. Sunil Harsana, a resident of Faridabad, said, “This land was encroached upon around 2017 and some or the other work like fencing, dumping of mud is being carried out at regular intervals. Due to the lockdown, it has been easier to encroach Aravalli land and in the latest incident, around four acres have been levelled for further construction.” After several complaints were made by citizens’ groups over encroachments and illegal mining taking place in the Aravallis, authorities have increased vigil over illegal activities. On June 1, deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala had written to all forest and police officials to take action against illegal activities being reported from the Aravallis and submit a report. The deputy chief minister was responding to complaints registered by a Gurugram based citizens’ group, Aravalli Bachao. Neelam Ahluwalia, of Aravalli Bachao, said, “After the deputy chief minister wrote to all the authorities seeking reports, the officials are more alert as encroachments and illegal mining activities increased a lot during the lockdown. We had been repeatedly writing to all forest and police staff, reporting about such illegal mining activities. The Aravallis need to be saved for the future generations of Delhi-NCR as, otherwise, residents would choke from dust storms while our natural water resources also continue to get affected.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/illegal-road-on-forest-land-closed-near-damdama-101624471123331.html

They demanded withdrawal of ‘fake cases’ registered against some zila panchayat members and their family and alleged they were being registered on their workers and zila panchayat members to pressurise them to vote in support of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate in zila panchayat presidents’ election on July 3. At the over three-hour long panchayat, they warned officials of serious consequences if this continued. RLD general secretaries Rajendra Sharma, Dr Marijuddin Ahmad, former MLA Veerpal Rathi, party’s Baghpat president, Jagpal Singh Teotia, SP’s district president Manoj Choudhary, Khap Thambedar Brijpal Singh and Deshkhap Choudhary Surendra Singh who attended the panchayat later handed over a memorandum to the officials, accusing them of working at the behest of the ruling BJP. “Officials have assured of fair investigation in all the cases registered against zila panchayat members,” Dr Mairajuddin said. RLD leader Kuldeep Ujjwal said that panchayat has warned officials against framing their party members. Baghpat has 20 zila panchayat members. A candidate requires support of 11 members to ensure victory. The district is a reserved seat for dalit woman. In panchayat elections RLD backed candidates won 8 seats, SP backed candidates won 4 while independent candidates bagged 4 seats. BJP won 4 seats but later a SP zila panchayat member defected to the BJP and was declared BJP candidate. RLD and SP are fighting together, and their leaders claim support of 14 members, including 3 independents. The RLD and SP leaders claimed that four cases were registered against SP’s elected zila panchayat member Mehmoob Alvi and his family members after Alvi’s win on May 2. His brother and two sons were taken into custody for interrogation on June 20 after a case under SC/ST was registered against them on June 19. They pointed out case of another zila panchayat member, Shahida, who was backed by RLD and won. ‘Her sons were accused of being involved in a firing incident in the village,” the leaders said. “We had given memorandum to IG (Meerut zone) Praveen Kumar who has directed district officials to be fair in their action, but nothing happened,” said RLD secretary Kuldeep Ujjwal who was present at the panchayat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/at-a-joint-panchayat-sp-and-rld-allege-zila-panchayat-members-being-framed-101624470403271.html

ABAP’s president Mahant Narendra Giri said that we must provide an equal opportunity to all so that such incidents can be stopped.“Past experiences have shown us that those, who have been neglected or who have been treated as outcasts, have often taken refuge in other religions. We will request all Hindus to rise above the caste lines and not to treat anyone as inferior while ensuring that they do not create circumstances wherein someone changes his or her religion”, said Mahant Narendra Giri.He said that soon a meeting of the representatives of all the 13 akharas would be held and the only agenda would be to ask disciples and common Hindus to rise above the caste system and mull over the steps for bringing back those who have changed their religion. “We have always advocated welcoming back those who have switched over to other religions and our seers and disciples would be given the task to make people aware of the need to rise above the narrow caste system. Juna Akhara and for that matter even ABAP does not believe in caste system because of which even dalit have been appointed as Mahamandeleshwars,” said Mahant Hari Giri, ABAP general secretary and chief patron of Juna Akhara, the largest of the 13 akharas in terms of members.The decision of the ABAP comes close on the heels of their earlier stand advocating for bringing a legal draft for population control. Narendra Giri, in a press statement had said that the seers have already been demanding that the ever-increasing population in the country should be controlled. He had said that under the Population Control Act it should be ensured that couples, irrespective of their religion, should have only two children.He said that if the population growth in the country is not stopped by bringing a law, then there may be a big population explosion in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/now-akhil-bhartiya-akhara-parishad-mulls-ways-to-prevent-religious-conversions-101624470283219.html

Jehanabad superintendent of police (SP) Deepak Ranjan said, “The NIA is investigating the case.”According to MHA officials, the probe has revealed that arms and ammunition are being brought in the area since a long time with the help of Maoists from Jharkhand. A three-member team of NIA reached Jehanabad and inspected Nandlal’s house and orchard and recovered arms, ammunition and explosives, said an official.“A grenade launcher base was spotted for the first time in this region. Following a tip about the presence of Maoists close to Bistaul village, an NIA team began a search operation when they chanced upon the Maoists’ countrymade grenade launcher base,” an official said.Seized items included more than 600 detonators, one regular rifle, seven magazines, six rifle bolts, 25 live cartridges, two wireless sets, three police uniform, electric wire bundle, 279 detonator caps, two-strike pins, 685 safety catches, rubber washers for grenades, five partially manufactured grenades, three grenade launching bases.According to MHA, the arrested persons have been booked under sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), and the NIA will probe the case.” The team is expected to visit Jharkhand and other states to investigate the manufacturing and storage of arms and explosives,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/nia-to-probe-links-between-maoists-of-bihar-bengal-jharkhand-101624464523732.html
23-06-2021||Patna||Rahul tweets concerns on ‘flood’, Bihar minister says fed wrong info||Though the real flood fury in Bihar is yet to unfold, miseries caused by the initial brush of Monsoon and heavy rainfall in Nepal, which led to inundation and waterlogging in many areas, has set off a war of words over Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi’s tweet on Wednesday.“My sympathy with flood-affected people of Bihar. This disaster, at the time of a pandemic (Covid-19), is a big crisis. I appeal to Congress workers to extend their help in relief work. Each of our step should be for public help. This is the real Congress ideology,” Gandhi tweeted.Not wasting time, Bihar water resources minister Sanjay Kumar Jha immediately responded on the social media platform with a list of the present state of rivers. “No river was flowing above the danger mark on Wednesday. But, I cannot help if people fail to differentiate between waterlogging and flood. The Bihar government is always on the ground at the time of crisis to ensure safety and relief to people. It does not do kite-flying on social media,” he wrote.Jha, through another tweet, said the water resources department (WRD) team is working round-the-clock for protection from flood and keeping a constant vigil on the water level and embankments. He also called out the Congress leader for not having “correct information” about the ground situation in Bihar. “Your tweet shows that either you are not provided with correct information about the situation on the ground, or you are not interested in knowing the real picture,” he tweeted.He added, “Looks like you have been wrongly fed about ‘floods’ in Bihar. There is none yet and in wake of heavy rains we’re not ruling it out either... Kindly refrain from confusing people.”However, the minister said the flood threat in Bihar was “real”, and it was not entirely due to heavy rains in the state. “The reason lies in Nepal and heavy discharge of water often causes waterlogging in some areas, but that cannot be termed as floods. We know the huge threat perception, and therefore the chief minister himself keeps monitoring it,” he said.Though the Congress vice-president did not tweet further in response to Jha, party MLC Prem Chandra Mishra fired salvos, citing the flood in Gandak, which has affected a large population in East and West Champaran and Gopalganj. “Kamla, Kosi, Gandak and Bahmani rivers have touched the danger mark at several places, the breach in the Piprasi bundh is yet to be bridged,” he said.JD-U spokesman Ajay Alok, however, said the government was prepared for the flood threat, but such a situation had not arisen so far, with rivers not even touching the danger mark. “Even if the rivers touch the danger mark, they don’t cause immediate flooding. Danger mark is to heighten alertness,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/rahul-tweets-concerns-on-flood-bihar-minister-says-fed-wrong-info-101624464523070.html

The parcel was booked from Secunderabad in the name of one Mohd Sofian on June 15. The consignment, carrying a bundle of ready-made clothes, caught fire following an explosion upon arrival at Darbhanga railway station, while it was being shifted. Though no one was injured, an investigation was launched by the railway police.A glass bottle having 50 ml of unidentified liquid was retrieved from the damaged parcel packet after the blast and sent for forensic examination.Darbhanga’s senior superintendent of police Babu Ram said local police had no role in the probe.Meanwhile, a GRP team iin Secunderabad station is tracing the origin of a car on the basis of CCTV footage that showed four men getting down from the vehicle and carrying a packet which looked similar to the one that exploded at Darbhanga station. A senior railway police official said the mobile number as provided in the parcel receipt had also been traced and located. A CCTV footage from Darbhanga station obtained by GRP is said to be showing a man moving around the blast site and talking on a mobile phone. The man later boarded Swatantrata Senani Express bound for New Delhi from platform number one, sources said.The parcel had been booked in the name of one Mohd Safian, who is yet to be found, said GRP sources.A senior railway police officer said no other security agency had contacted him regarding a probe so far. Darbhanga was last in news for alleged terror links in 2014, when Delhi Police arrested Tehseen alias Monu from Samastipur, who was allegedly inducted into proscribed outfit Indian Mujahideen in 2010.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/darbhanga-station-blast-local-fsl-can-t-figure-cctv-clues-give-hope-101624464403715.html

This is the first time the RJD scion has spoken about the LJP following rebellion in the party in which five of its six MPs broke away from Chirag Paswan and threw their lot with his uncle and Hajipur MP Pashupati Kumar Paras.Paswan, son of former union minister and LJP founder late Ram Vilas Paswan, is currently locked in a tough battle with Paras to regain control of the party. While the Lok Sabha secretariat has recognised Paras as LJP’s leader in the House, the Election Commission of India is yet to decide as to which faction would retain the party symbol. Paswan has also expressed his disappointment at the BJP’s silence on the rebellion in his party, saying he had always supported Prime Minister Narendra Modi wholeheartedly.Yadav also took a swipe at chief minister Nitish Kumar over the LJP split, saying “everybody knows who masterminded the rebellion in the party”. On his father Lalu Prasad’s health, Yadav said he was is recovering from his ailments and could return to Patna soon. Days after he got bail in April a series of fodder scam cases in which he was convicted, Prasad was released from AIIMS in Delhi where he was undergoing treatment for various ailments and is currently recuperating at his daughter Misa Bharti’s house in the nation capital. Meanwhile, JD(U) MLC Neeraj Kumar hit out at Tejashwi Yadav. “Tejashwi is only busy on Twitter and has come back after the lockdown after coronavirus cases subsided in Bihar. It shows his commitment for the people of the state,” he said. BJP’s state president Sanjay Jaiswal said the Yadav scion is more like a tourist to the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/chirag-welcome-to-join-rjd-alliance-tejashwi-101624464403047.html

All these must be resolved within a month,” the SAD added. SAD senior leader Bikram Singh Majithia said chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh should explain why allowances of some categories of employees had been stopped altogether. “Why has the state created different categories of employees by enforcing the Central Pay Commission on new recruits. The chief minister should also tell why thousands of contract employees, whom he had committed to regularise five years ago, still continue to be on contract,” Majithia added. He also sought immediate dismissal of finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal. “Employees across the Ssate have expressed their no confidence in the finance minister by holding a pen-down strike followed by a walkout from government offices. The agitation is expected to intensify in the coming days with the employee federations announcing a week’s agitation plan. The CM should sack Manpreet immediately so that talks with employees can begin.”“It seems that not only employees, but even the government has been deceived as the Pay Commission report which is being sold as a bonanza for employees, in fact is discriminatory towards them,” Majithia claimed, adding that Non Practicing Allowance (NPA) of doctors must also be fully restored.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/row-over-6th-pay-commission-recommendations-explain-fraud-call-special-session-of-assembly-sad-to-state-govt-101624463803775.html

The PMPML will be adding a number of e-buses to its fleet in the next few months which has prompted them to start the facility. According to the PMPML authorities, the number of e-bus services will be going up as more buses are being inducted in the fleet. Currently, the charging station is situated in Bhekrainagar in Phursungi which has a limited capacity but a mega charging station will be set up at Manjri depot. MLA Chetan Tupe who has been spearheading the project said that even private vehicles or buses can get their batteries charged at the said station which will have sufficient capacity to accommodate a number of buses on a daily basis. MLA Tupe, PMPML officials including Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) authorities have conducted a site inspection and a feasibility report has been submitted to the administration. Funds from the deputy chief minister’s office including the local MLA fund will be spent for the construction of the state-of-the-art charging station which will charge the bus batteries in real time. MLA Tupe said, “PMPML president Rajendra Jagtap had briefed us about the project where he has said that the existing facility at Bhekrainagar is limited and with the introduction of new buses, a new set up will be required. We have conducted a visit and all the modalities have been worked out. MLA Sanjay Jagtap has also taken serious efforts towards this project which will be started soon.” The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) last week had proposed 15 new charging stations in an initiative aimed at promoting electric vehicles (EV) in the city in addition to the existing station used for the public transport bus service.

We were scared as the virus was fast spreading in rural areas. Being a part of a small village, it was difficult to brainstorm measures to curb the virus. So we formed a Covid-19 taskforce, wherein, members went from door-to-door and distributed masks and sanitiser," he said.Hygiene has come to the fore as the main element in keeping the infection at bay and thus, a sanitization drive was conducted in the village every week, said the president."Gutters were cleaned to maintain hygienic atmosphere, priority was given to clean drinking water supply. Taskforce members kept an eye on the villagers' health and whenever symptoms were seen we took them to hospital and got tested," said Radder.Following these measures, not a single Covid-19 positive case was reported in the village, he said.Tremendous efforts were being put in at a time when several villages across the country were registering high number of cases and related deaths. Many had even complained of not getting access to a proper medical facility or testing centres.A hotel owner in the village, Shivalingapp Angadi, said that he refrained from opening it to the public in the light of Covid-19."I have a hotel but I did not open it due to the Covid-19. We maintained distance and did not visit other villages," he said.Ratnavva Basvanneppa Hubballi, a villager from Allapur stressed that it was a team effort to achieve a Covid-free village."Anganwadi teachers, ASHA workers, Gram Panchayat members - all together went from door to door to create awareness about the pandemic and preventive measures that needed to be taken."She further informed that the villagers showed full cooperation as they wore masks and maintained social distancing even while working in fields."Some cases were reported in the nearby village of Kadapatti, but none in ours," she said.Karnataka on Tuesday recorded 3,709 fresh cases of Covid-19.

He embraced Islam under the influence of his Muslim friends while pursuing higher studies (BSc and MSc Agriculture) in Nainital in 1984, said police.One of Gautam’s close friends from a Yadav family in Gorakhpur too embraced Islam under his influence and changed his name to Mohd Usman.Umar Gautam and Jahangir Alam, 52, both residents of Jamia Nagar in New Delhi, will be interrogated further about their claims in the videos and conversion programmes conducted by them during their seven-day custody remand that began on Wednesday.In the video, Gautam was even heard saying that several people from countries like Poland, Portugal, Germany, Singapore, US and England visited the Islamic Da’wah Centre (IDC) run by him in Delhi’s Jamia Nagar to get legal assistance to embrace Islam, said the official.In a previous video, Gautam had stated that he and his organisation helped over 1,000 people embrace Islam in Delhi, UP and other parts of the country, said the official. “The ATS has also come to know about Gautam’s properties in Ghaziabad. A team will be sent along with him to Ghaziabad to probe into his network in Ghaziabad and people linked to his mass religious conversion racket,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/umar-gautam-went-to-britain-18-times-us-four-times-for-religious-conversion-programmes-101624459062964.html

The joint coordination committee of government doctors has also decided that only emergency services will remain operational. On Wednesday, doctors also submitted a memorandum to deputy commissioners in this regard Dr Gagandeep Singh, state president, Punjab Civil Medical Services (PCMS), said, “Doctors are risking their lives every day in this pandemic. We hoped for a financial gift from the Sixth Pay Commission. It has, however, reduced the NPA, which has resulted in huge financial loss to our community.”Dr Indervir Gill, organising secretary, PCMS, said, “All organisations related to the medical profession are fighting against the state government seeking the restoration of the NPA, under the banner of the Joint Coordination Committee. We appeal to chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh to intervene and ensure justice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-govt-doctors-to-strike-on-june-25-against-reduction-in-non-practising-allowance-101624458343680.html
23-06-2021||Delhi||‘Obligation of father does not end after son turns 18’: Delhi HC||The Delhi high court on Tuesday said that a father’s obligation does not end as soon as his son turns 18 years as the burden of his education and other expenses cannot fall only on the mother. The court made this observation while granting ₹15,000 interim maintenance to a divorced woman to cover expenses for her adult son until the time he completes graduation or starts earning.The court said that it cannot turn a blind eye to the rising costs of living and said that it is unreasonable to let the mother single-handedly bear the entire burden for herself and for her children. The husband was giving a small amount of maintenance for the maintenance of their daughter.“The woman has to take care of the entire expenditure of the son who has now attained majority but is not earning because he is still studying. The Family Court, therefore, failed to appreciate the fact that since no contribution is being made by the respondent (man) herein towards the son, the salary earned by the woman would not be sufficient for the woman to maintain herself,” Justice Subramonium Prasad said, according to a PTI report.The estranged couple got married in November 1997 and had two children. They divorced in November 2011. The son and the daughters are 20 and 18 years old respectively.“The two children are living with the mother. Since the purpose of granting interim maintenance is to ensure that the wife and the children are not put to starvation, the courts while fixing interim maintenance are not expected to dwell into minute and excruciating details and facts which have to be proved by the parties,” the court said.“This court is therefore inclined to grant a sum of ₹15,000 per month as interim maintenance to the woman from the date of son attaining the age of majority till he completes his graduation or starts earning whichever is earlier,” the court further added.The high court noted that the woman was working as an upper division clerk in Delhi Municipal Corporation, earning about ₹60,000 per month. The court also said as per salary certificate filed by the man the gross monthly income, as on November, 2020, was ₹1.67 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/obligation-of-father-does-not-end-after-son-turns-18-delhi-hc-101624456254775.html
23-06-2021||Bhopal||MP gang targets people by recording obscene video calls, blackmailing them||When a local Bharatiya Janata Party leader from Madhya Pradesh’s Chambal received a Facebook request from a woman, the unsuspecting politician accepted it and began chatting with her in April this year. The two soon began talking via WhatsApp before the politician was shocked to get an extortion call from a gang. The caller asked him to pay or else they will make the politician’s obscene video calls public. The politician paid some money initially. He was left with no choice but to approach the police when the gang continued blackmailing him for money.The politician is among at least 100 people the gang has targeted in Madhya Pradesh alone. The victims also include several other political leaders, doctors, businessmen, students, and even police personnel.Chhatarpur police superintendent Sachin Sharma said a Congress leader was trapped after he received a message on his WhatsApp from an unknown number. “The person introduced herself as Anushka from Mumbai. The person did an obscene video call and recorded it. Later, the accused sent a screenshot of the chat between two and recorded video with a threat of uploading it on Facebook.”Also Read | Madhya Pradesh creates record, 1.64 mn people vaccinated in a daySharma said the Congress leader registered a case and a 19-year-old student, Adil Khan, was arrested from Rajasthan’s Bharatpur for blackmailing him. He cited their probe so far and added Khan was allegedly a part of the organised gang of over 40 people, who blackmailed people by recording their obscene calls with women. Sharma said many cyber frauds and online extortionists operate from Bharatpur.Police said the gang sourced a SIM card from Odisha for entrapping people and has extorted ₹14.22 lakh from at least 21 people from across India. Sharma has submitted a case study of over 40 people from Khan’s village in Bharatpur to Madhya Pradesh’s cyber cell to investigate other cases of extortion.The Madhya Pradesh police were looking for three more accused in the case.Additional director general of police (cyber cell) Yogesh Chaudhary said this was an old modus operandi of extorting money but the number of such cases increased during the Covid-19 pandemic. “In Rajasthan and Haryana, fraudsters... have started (online) extortion in an organised manner.”He said the cyber cell was investigating the matter and has also informed the police forces of other states. Chaudhary added the cell has also issued an advisory asking people to avoid video calls from unknown people on WhatsApp and friend requests on Facebook.Cyber-law expert Yashdeep Chaturvedi this type of cybercrime is increasing as people do not file complaints out of fear of getting defamed “They should understand that the Supreme Court has said the identity of victims in such cases will not be revealed as it is a breach of privacy. If they started reporting incidents, the number of such cases will come down.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-gang-targets-people-by-recording-obscene-video-calls-blackmailing-them-101624452883378.html

Bhattacharjee added they got their doses but were later told they have been administered Covishield after they inquired about it out of curiosity. He said he recorded his conversation with a health worker confirming that they were administered Covishield instead of Covaxin and were even offered fake certificates.Also Read | 4 arrested for assaulting woman health worker at vaccination centre in Assam“There was no physical distance or proper wearing of masks. However, since it had been almost 42 days since our first dose, we decided to get the vaccine... We went to get the vaccine knowing that Covaxin was being given. Even the message that was sent to us mentioned Covaxin. But the health worker gave us Covishield instead. I think there are many people who were getting Covishield instead of Covaxin in this process.”Bhattacharjee said when they threatened to expose the matter, the health workers said that they have only been provided with Covishield. “This means even though slots for Covaxin were shown on the app, many people are getting Covishield as the second dose. We do not know yet what the side effects of this might be, but we are now afraid.”Hailakandi’s joint director (health services) Ashutosh Barman said he has suspended the verifier of the centre and ordered an investigation. “We are aware of the matter and the person-in-charge has been suspended. The case has to be investigated thoroughly and we can take action after we get the probe report.”Manabendra Chakraborty, a former employee of the Cachar Paper Mill, has separately threatened to go on a hunger strike if he did not get the second Covid-19 vaccine dose that he has been waiting for almost two months.“My wife and I are waiting after 58 days of our first dose. I have heard that if you do not get the second dose within 56 days of taking the first dose of Covaxin, the first one will not help. I have written to the deputy commissioner twice before as well and demanded for the availability of the second dose of Covaxin.”District immunisation officer (Cachar) Sumana Naiding assured that doses will be arranged for the couple. “Manabendra Chakraborty is a senior citizen, and we are aware of his concern. We have asked him to write a letter to us with all his details including the certificate of the first dose. Due to a shortage of Covaxin, we were facing some issues, but things have been sorted now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-1st-dose-of-covaxin-assam-siblings-get-covishield-as-second-dose-101624450845828.html

We are not vaccinating for photo-ops or event management,” Jain told reporters during a briefing.“Citizens are being vaccinated regularly. Everyone knows there was a scarcity of vaccines these past days,” he added.Jain’s reaction followed Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri’s criticism of the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government’s vaccination drive."On a day India vaccinated more than 84 lakh people, Delhi administered only 76,259 out of more than 11 lakh doses available. Why? Instead of focusing on health & welfare of people of Delhi, Kejriwal Ji is busy in Punjab searching for a Sikh CM face for his party," Puri tweeted on Tuesday."Vaccination is not an event,” Jain said, adding, "They are asking why we didn’t vaccinate more people on that particular day, but we are any way vaccinating 75,000-80,000 a day. Isn’t it better to vaccinate everyday rather than one day?"Jain told reporters that Madhya Pradesh’s vaccination numbers have been “nosediving” since June 21. “They prepared for an event for a long time, gave everyone Monday’s date just to show they vaccinated a large number of people,” he said.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, too, responded to Puri’s allegations on Tuesday, asking the latter to provide enough vaccines for the citizens instead of “abusing” the chief minister.Also Read: Madhya Pradesh accused of 'slowing down' Covid-19 vaccine drive to achieve record high"Hardeep ji: pls focus on providing enough vaccines for the youth, rather than just abusing Arvind Kejriwal all the time. Central Govt’s vaccination flip-flops have created a crisis situation all over the country." Sisodia posted on Twitter.On the lack of vaccine availability the health minister said that a crunch in the available number of Covaxin doses will continue for the next many days but Covishield will be available. As per the vaccination bulletin tweeted by AAP leader Atishi on Tuesday, the Covaxin stock reserved for the 18-44 age group in the national capital will last one more day.The health minister said the national capital recorded 134 cases of covid-19 in the last 24 hours. 8 more individuals also succumbed to the virus, and Delhi's positivity rate stands at 1.45% as of Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-vaccinating-citizens-regularly-unlike-madhya-pradesh-aap-slams-centre-101624446615203.html

23-06-2021||Chandigarh||When Atithi Devo Bhava was practised as preached||As we turned our bicycles from the national highway to the main city of Kurukshetra on our way to the ancient water pool of Brahma Sarovar, my partner slowed down. Pointing towards a nameplate, my seasoned structural engineer friend in his late 50s said, “I think that’s the home of one of the Art of Living (AOL) volunteers. Let’s meet him.” Without giving much thought, I agreed. We stopped outside the huge gate, seeking permission from the guard to meet the owner, Mr Sudershan. Our appearance in bicycle gear with helmets, goggles and cycling shorts amused the guard, yet he instantly spoke to someone on the landline. He gestured at us to enter even before he hung up the receiver. The house was at an appreciable distance from the main gate, as the first half of the property served as a plastic factory. By the time we walked with our bikes to reach the house at the other end, Mr Sudershan was standing at the main door to receive us. We could see the welcoming glow on his face as he greeted us with the AOL catchphrase, “Jai Gurudev.” With that, he led us straight to his living room, elevating us to the category of family friends and relatives. No sooner than we sat down, his better half and father too came in to greet us. They were in awe and admiration of our bicycle ride from Ambala to Kurukshetra. On hearing the encouraging applause, we too felt delighted by our feat. With AOL serving as the common ground, all of us immediately began relating our respective journeys and experiences on the spiritual path and how our lives had been transformed. A little later, their 23-year-old son, who had just finished his MBA, joined us and mentioned that he was coming up with an innovative oral care range for the Indian market. As he displayed his products, I shared that I’ve been a dental practitioner in Ambala for 25 years. On knowing my professional credentials, Sudershan Ji said, “You’ve not come to meet us; you’ve come to bless our son. Now he can also resolve his queries and take feedback from you.” I heartily treasured the divine connotation given to our meeting. However, it wasn’t just about the AOL connection; the reception we received from this family we met in person for the first time was heartwarming, too. We could feel the traditional Indian philosophy of Atithi Devo Bhava, revering guests as Gods; from the moment we stepped in. We had literally gatecrashed, but the warmth with which we were served poha, cutlets and almond milk prepared in a matter of minutes was another mark of their affection. The entire family came out to see us off when it was time for us to depart. As we clambered onto our bikes, we could see the engaging friendliness in their eyes. Sealing that in our hearts, as we pedalled our way out of the entrance gate, the charming smile flashed by the gatekeeper was a bonus. From entry to exit, the grace with which we were greeted and entertained was unforgettable. vikasdeepak23@gmail.com The writer is an Ambala-based dentist||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/when-atithi-devo-bhava-was-practised-as-preached-101624444482995.html
23-06-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka records two Delta plus Covid-19 variant cases||Karnataka recorded its first two cases of the Delta plus variant of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Wednesday. State health minister K Sudhakar told reporters that one case each of the Delta plus variant was recorded in Bengaluru and Mysuru districts, and that the Union home ministry has been notified.“Two cases (1 in Mysuru and 1 in Bengaluru) of the Delta plus variant of novel coronavirus have been found in Karnataka. This information has been shared with the Union health ministry,” Sudhakar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.This news comes against the background of the Union health ministry urging the states of Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, and Maharashtra to be on guard as these three states have been recording cases of the new variant sporadically. "As of now among the samples sequenced (45000) in India, the Delta plus variant has been observed sporadically in Maharashtra, Kerala & Madhya Pradesh, with around 40 cases identified so far and no significant increase in prevalence," the health ministry said.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan wrote to the chief secretaries in these states, asking them to take up immediate measures for containing the spread. "The Public Health Response, in this case, while broadly remaining the same, has to become more focused and stringent. Thus, you are requested to take up immediate containment measures in these districts and clusters including preventing crowds and intermingling of people, widespread testing, prompt tracing as well as vaccine coverage on a priority basis," Bhushan wrote.Mysuru’s first recorded case of the delta plus strain is asymptomatic, reported PTI. Sudhakar told reporters that the infected individual has been isolated and the infection has not been passed on to his primary and secondary contacts, calling it a “good sign”.The state health minister also said that genome sequencing is being done on 5% of the total samples tested to track cases of variants. The government is also sending vaccines to districts which are vulnerable to the variant and the state is conducting 1.5 lakh tests a day, he added.Bhushan sought to assuage public concern about the new variant. "Currently the number of such Delta plus variants in India are only few,” he wrote in his letter. However, he urged states to exercise caution and enhance contact-tracing measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-records-two-delta-plus-covid-19-variant-cases-101624441902503.html
23-06-2021||Chandigarh||Second autopsy at PGI rules out gangster Jaipal Bhullar tortured||The autopsy conducted by the Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, has ruled out that gangster Jaipal Singh Bhullar was subjected to torture before his death in Kolkata on June 9. After the post-mortem on Tuesday, a board of four PGIMER doctors said in their report: “X-rays of all major joints, including both upper and lower limbs, do not show fracture of any kind. There are no injuries suggestive of physical torture. The possibility of multiple firearm injuries resulting in haemorrhagic shock cannot be ruled out.” Also read: 2 dead, 16 injured in blast near LeT founder Hafiz Saeed’s Lahore residenceGangster’s father had alleged torture This was the second post-mortem examination as the first was performed in West Bengal. Jaipal, a wanted gangster, was killed in a police encounter in Kolkata. However, his father Bhupinder Singh, a retired Punjab Police inspector, alleged that Jaipal was killed in a staged encounter. Bhupinder claimed that his son’s body was handed over by the West Bengal authorities in a sealed box on June 12. Before conducting the last rites the next day, he said, a number of injuries were found on the body, showing that Jaipal had been tortured. He demanded a second post-mortem. Bhupinder also claimed that he was denied an autopsy report of his son, detailing the cause of death and other factors. On June 13, Bhupinder alleged that Jaipal’s body had multiple injuries, including a fractured left arm, indicating he was tortured before being killed in a fake police encounter. The family had refused to cremate the body. Second autopsy on high court’s directions The second autopsy conducted on the directions of Punjab and Haryana high court refutes the allegation of torture. “Fracture on the left forearm, alleged to be caused by torture, is actually due to impact of bullet resulting in fracture and shattering of the bone. The presence of a metallic piece adjoining that shattering (limb) proves the same,” reads the report. X-ray examination states four bullet injuries and fractures caused by firearm impact. Three bullets were recovered from the gangster’s body. A panel of experts was unanimous to say “no underlying injury was found at any place suggestive of any kind of torture.” Upset father refuses to share next move When contacted at his Ferozepur residence, Bhupinder expressed shock and rejected the findings of the report. “My hopes were dashed as I thought PGIMER experts will give a fair picture. Jaipal was killed in a gruesome manner and the WB police administration acted in an inhuman way. We want justice but I will not share the next move,” he said. Bhupinder confirmed that the autopsy was duly photographed and filmed. It took three hours for the post-mortem examination on Tuesday and a report was handed over to Bhupinder the same night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/second-autopsy-at-pgi-rules-out-gangster-jaipal-bhullar-tortured-101624442262727.html

The parliamentarian immediately investigated the matter following which police arrested one man.“I received a message that a vaccination drive was launched by the joint commissioner of Kolkata Municipal Commission for transgender and differently abled people.

I also asked for my vaccination certificate which they said I would receive within some time. I immediately asked my office to enquire if people present at the site received registration messages, to which the people present said that they have not received any such message,” she further added.Mimi said she stopped the vaccination drive immediately and with the help of the police arrested one Debanjan Deb who posed as an IAS officer. The police later recovered a fake ID card along with hand sanitizers and masks which had the logo of Kolkata’s civic authority.Police are trying to ascertain how the miscreants got access to Covishield vaccines which were used at the centre.

23-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s sero-prevalence remains same, report calls for another round of survey||Delhi’s latest sero survey shows that the population-level prevalence of antibodies in the city was at 56.09%, almost the same as that of the January round, said officials. The survey, however, is not comparable to the earlier one, which found the sero-prevalence to be 56.13%, as sample collection had to be cut short this time amid rising Covid-19 cases mid-April. The report, submitted to the government last Monday, hasn’t officially been released yet.The report by researchers from Maulana Azad Medical College also suggests that the next round of sero survey be conducted in June-end or July-beginning to capture the exposure to infection during the massive second wave that saw Delhi reporting over 28,000 cases in a day. For the April round, around 13,000 samples were collected instead of the proposed 28,000; and from just 141 of Delhi’s 272 wards. To make it comparable, researchers will have to go through the data from these 141 wards from the previous round of the survey. Also Read | 6th sero survey kicks off in Delhi amid Covid-19 case surge“The survey had to be stopped midway because cases started rising and a lockdown was implemented. Now, the samples that were collected during the five or six days that the survey was carried out are being analysed,” a Delhi government official had told HT earlier. The sample collection for the sixth round began on April 12, just a day after the city reported over 10,000 cases in a day for the first time, and was stopped once the government announced a lockdown on April 19. The reports of the antibody testing are yet to be shared with the study participants. “The dates for the next round of sero survey haven’t been confirmed yet,” said an official from Delhi’s health department.When the first sero survey was conduced in June-end last year, 22.6% of the 21,000 people sampled had antibodies. This shot to 29.1% of the 15,000 people sampled in August, and then dropped to 25.1% among the 17,000 people sampled in September (due to a change in methodology and dropping antibody levels in the population, the researchers said). In October, it went up to 25.5% in a sample size of 15,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-sero-prevalence-remains-same-report-calls-for-another-round-of-survey-101624433622454.html

Issuing a strict warning, additional city magistrate (first) Khalid Anjum said strict legal action would be taken against those found violating Covid-19 norms.However, opposing the move to allow weekly markets to open, the Shastri Nagar Vyapar Mandal handed over a memorandum to the district administration saying Covid-19 protocol cannot be followed when more than 1,000 temporary kiosks would function in the market. Additionally, Ashok Chawla, general secretary of the Mahanagar Vyapar Mandal said, "Even before the outbreak of the pandemic, house owners and shopkeepers raised their concerns against weekly markets as the shopkeepers set up their temporary stores in front of houses."Chawla further said the administration should allow weekly markets in open spaces such as Ramlila grounds which, he said, would help maintain social distancing.On the Covid-19 front, both Ghaziabad and the neighbouring Gautam Buddh Nagar district saw less than 10 new Covid-19 cases on June 22, with the number of active cases in the two places also falling below 100, official data showed. While nine fresh infections were detected in Gautam Buddh Nagar, the corresponding number for Ghaziabad was four, with their respective active cases being recorded at 93 and 77.Also, 38 and seven patients recovered in the two districts, taking cumulative recovered cases to 62,453 and 54,968 respectively, the data showed.

23-06-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana CM seeks Centre’s help to free Vishal Jood from Australian jail||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has sought external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s intervention to secure the release of Kurukshetra youth Vishal Jood, currently lodged in an Australia prison for alleged hand in a series of hate attacks on suspected pro-Khalistan Sikhs in Sydney earlier this year.A statement released from the CM’s office said 24-years old Jood was “innocent” and was jailed following a “conspiracy from anti-national forces” since he opposed anti-India elements for the Tricolour’s sake. The statement said that Jaishankar has in return assured the chief minister of taking steps to secure Jood’s release.Jood, who has a visa to study in Australia, was arrested on April 16 in Sydney for alleged hate speech and role in three suspected hate crimes, including clashes between youths from Haryana and members of the Sikh community at Harris Park in Sydney in March and April this year. Several videos of the clashes at Harris Park were circulated widely on social media.Khattar raised this issue following a week-long protests by the members of the Ror community—to which Jood belongs-- in Karnal and Kurukshetra districts. The community has been pressuring the ruling party leaders on this issue. The community members claim that Jood saved the Indian flag from a group shouting pro-Khalistan slogans, however, local media earlier this month cited the New South Wales (NSW) police as saying that Jood was arrested for three incidents, including the one on February 28, for attacks on Sikhs in which baseball bats, rods, sticks and other weapons were used.The police had said that the group of Sikhs attacked on February 28 had earlier participated in an anti-farm laws protest in Australia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-cm-seeks-fm-s-help-to-secure-vishal-jood-s-release-from-australian-jail-101624430562386.html
23-06-2021||Delhi||Toxic foam floats on surface of Yamuna in Delhi||A layer of toxic foam was seen floating on the surface of the Yamuna river at Kalindi Kunj in Delhi on Wednesday morning. Before this, the toxic foam was seen floating over the river on April 6 and 20.At that time, the environmentalists had said that the frothing could be because of the release of certain gases when reacting with few specific bacteria.Also read| Yamuna pollution: Artificial wetland to naturally treat Kondli drain to be ready by NovemberThe foam at the Yamuna river made global headlines in 2019 when the devotees of Chhat puja were seen standing in waist-deep toxic forth in the Yamuna at Kalindi Kunj.When inquired about the incident, experts said that the formation of forth was a common thing in the Yamuna but has increased in the last five to six years.The Delhi government chalked out a nine-point action plan earlier this year to reduce frothing in the Yamuna river, which is happening due to the discharge of untreated sewage in the river.The state government on June 14 also banned the sale, storage, transportation, and marketing of soaps and detergents not complying to the latest BIS parameters to curb pollution in the river.The Yamuna Monitoring Committee (YMC)'s, which was set up by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in July 2018, recommendations, made in January, were accepted by the tribunal. The YMC had suggested directing the government to issue an order "prohibiting sale, storage and transportation and marketing of detergents which do not conform to the revised BIS standards".The NGT has also directed to initiate an awareness campaign to educate about the harmful effects of using substandard soaps and detergents.High phosphate content in the wastewater because of detergents used in dyeing industries, dhobi ghats and households is the main reason leading to the formation of toxic foam in the Yamuna river, PTI quoted an official of the Central Pollution Control Board as saying."A large number of unbranded detergents are also used in households and dyeing industries. The wastewater containing high phosphate content reach the river through untapped drains," he said, reported PTI.These detergents and other organic matter get deposited in the riverbed when the river is flowing at its normal pace but when the water falls from height on reaching a barrage, it causes turbulence and churning resulting in the formation of the froth.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/toxic-foam-floats-on-surface-of-yamuna-in-delhi-101624420711017.html

Monsoon has so far covered most parts of the country except parts of Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab. “The salient feature of the monsoon in 2021 is its progress to eastern, central and adjoining northwest India earlier than normal (up to 7-10 days). However, further progress over the remaining parts of the country is unlikely during the next seven days,” IMD said.Also Read | Delhi’s air quality likely to deteriorate marginally from WednesdayThe northern limit monsoon continues to pass through Barmer, Bhilwara, Dholpur, Aligarh, Meerut, Ambala and Amritsar. There is 37% excess rains over the country till Monday—76% excess over northwest India; 58% excess over central India; 24% excess over south peninsula and 13% excess over east and northeast India.Normally, the monsoon reaches Delhi by June 27 and covers the entire country by July 8.Last year, the wind system had reached Delhi on June 25 and covered the entire country by June 29, according to Skymet Weather, a private forecasting agency.Mahesh Palawat from Skymet Weather said chances are that Delhi will get monsoonal showers only around June end.

The incident took place with editor-in-chief of Hindi Khabar, Atul Agrawal, on the intervening night of June 19 and 20, they added.The accused took around ₹5,000 cash that he was carrying in his wallet and tried to choke him, Agrawal said in a Facebook post.Police said that they have not received a complaint from Agrawal regarding the incident but have launched an investigation into the matter after taking suo moto cognizance of his social media post.In his Facebook post, Agrawal said that the incident took place barely 250-300 metres from a police post in Greater Noida (West), also called Noida Extension."The music system in my car had some issues so I had to stop my car to adjust the USB pen drive. Suddenly, five young men on two motorcycles came there and waylaid my car," he added."The car was locked from the inside. They started banging the windows but I resisted. Then one of them pulled out a gun and pointed it at me, forcing me to come out of the car. I had no other choice so I followed their instructions as they held me at gunpoint," he said in his Facebook post.Agrawal said he pleaded with the assailants, all of whom were wearing face masks, to spare his life as he has a young son and told them they could take his car and whatever money he was carrying.He further said that the assailants took around ₹5,000 cash that he was carrying in his wallet but left behind his mobile phone and gold jewellery after finding out that he is a journalist.At one point, Agrawal claimed, one of the accused attempted to choke him but was stopped by one of his associates."We took suo motu cognisance of the incident after it came to light on social media. We have formed police teams to investigate the matter and track down the assailants," Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central Noida) Harish Chander told news agency PTI."However, there has been no cooperation from the journalist with the local police.

23-06-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Back to the bench||The sun’s glare is blinding, but here it feels like an unconfirmed rumour. The leafy tree is doubling up as an ample parasol. Make the bench on this cool spot your part-time getaway. It is in a bus terminus in Connaught Place.Only a few chai shacks are open this afternoon in Shivaji Stadium Bus Terminal. Only a sprinkle of commuters. You could as well be in some secluded corner of the city. Being on this bench is special because it connects you to the Delhi of a different era, when our city’s underground had not been hollowed out yet into a maze of tunnels—that is, when there was no Delhi Metro. When travelling in the DTC bus was the primary experience of every carless Delhiite. When the city roads would be chock-a-block with those privately-owned Blueline buses notorious for their reckless speed.Around the turn of the century, Shivaji Stadium would team with these now-extinct buses from early morning to late night. A great number of Delhiites working in Connaught Place would board their route numbers from here rather than from the bus stop nearer to their office, in the hope of finding a spare seat, for the terminus would be the starting point. The place also doubled as an all-purpose bazaar. There would be pavement stalls hawking a great variety of “ladies and gents garments”; there would be a handful of magazine kiosks that also stocked questionable monthlies one would buy with some shame; there would be stalls serving every desi snack imaginable, from jhalmuri and roasted bhutta to anda bread, aloo tikki and chhole bhathure. Very many commuters would buy takeaway burger-cum-softy from a chain outlet whose rear side opened into the terminus. A rare person with spare time might settle down on this bench to catch a breath.Today, most of the area’s magazine stalls are history (including many of the magazines they stocked). Most snack stalls are gone as well. You don’t see that many buses either. Perhaps because the Connaught Place commuters have shifted their loyalty to the super-busy Rajiv Chowk Metro station nearby.One isn’t certain if this bench dates from those years or has replaced a previous bench. Whatever, sitting on it—under a tree that has been a continuous witness to the area’s changing life—gives you a sense of escape from the hurry-hurry of contemporary life, and connects you to the ghost of Delhi’s former commuting subculture. Come here, preferably by bus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-back-to-the-bench-101624399541198.html
23-06-2021||Delhi||Govt, civic bodies join hands to ensure smooth transition of students||The Delhi government’s Directorate of Education (DoE) and the Municipal Corporations of Delhi (MCDs) on Tuesday joined hands to track each student who transitioned from corporation schools to government ones in Class 6 this year.The move comes after government schools faced several challenges in tracking such students last year as their admissions were done virtually due to the closure of schools in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.Every year, around 170,000 students move from municipal schools that offer education only up to Class 5 to government schools in Class 6.Owing to the pandemic, the induction of such students is happening online this year as well, on the basis of names sent by municipal schools. As per the official data, only 76% of the students who transferred from municipal schools last year could be traced.On June 8, Hindustan Times reported that the Delhi government was planning to collaborate with the three civic bodies to track and trace Class 6 students who were transferred to DoE-run schools.Education minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday chaired a meeting with the municipal commissioners of North, South, and East Delhi corporations on the matter.During the meeting, Sisodia asked the three corporations to provide the correct contact details of transferred students. “Last year, only about 30-35% of students’ phone numbers were correct. So, a large number of students could not get the worksheets or participate in the semi-online classes. Government school teachers made special efforts to ascertain the whereabouts of these children and, eventually, 76% of students enrolled in Class 6,” the government said in a statement.“We should ensure that students transitioning from MCD to DoE schools get the same emotional and learning support as other classes,” Sisodia said.Initially, government schools will try to contact students and in case their phone numbers are found to be incorrect, the municipal teachers will try to find out the correct details with the help of their other students, the government statement said.MCD officials said they have also been asked to provide details of students who have not been attending online classes or visiting schools to collect worksheets. “Together, we will make efforts to trace them,” said a senior official of the east civic body’s education department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-civic-bodies-join-hands-to-ensure-smooth-transition-of-students-101624397458209.html
23-06-2021||Chandigarh||Kharge panel discusses party rejig, pending poll promises with Captain||Amid growing tension in the ruling Congress, Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had a three-hour meeting on Tuesday with the three-member committee set up to end the factionalism in the party’s state unit ahead of next year’s assembly polls even as some ministers and MLAs conveyed to the central leadership their displeasure over former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu’s public statements. Capt Amarinder met the committee headed by leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge at the latter’s Parliament House office in Delhi. The committee, which also has Congress general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat and former Delhi MP Jai Prakash Agarwal as members, discussed with him the implementation status of the 2017 poll manifesto, revamp of the party’s organizational set-up and preparations for the coming elections, said one of the members on the condition of anonymity. He said the panel specifically asked the chief minister about the pending poll announcements, including justice in sacrilege and police firing cases, action against drug dealers and the annulment of power purchase agreements (PPAs) with independent power producers, that have been raised by the dissenters. Amarinder, while informing the trio on the progress made on election promises, specifically briefed them about the status of probe into sacrilege and police firing cases, with an assurance to implement the pending ones within the next six months, according to sources close to him. “The committee members were informed that the special investigation team report in Kotkapura firing incident was quashed by the court and the new SIT had already made quick progress,” they said. The CM’s one-to-one audience with the central panel – their second meeting in less than three weeks – came on the day the SIT questioned SAD patriarch Parkash Singh Badal, who was the chief minister at the time of the 2015 police firing, for two hours. Hindustan Times has learnt that the panel is expected to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi tomorrow to update her about the issues. However, the problem between Amarinder and Sidhu may have got exacerbated with both taking a ‘maximalist’ position according to one person who didn’t want to be identified. The CM told committee members that they should make a fair assessment about what each person brought to the table. While he was willing to go along with whatever the party decided, he wanted them to see the troubles Sidhu was stirring with his public outbursts against the CM. Capt’s side seemed to be upset that Sidhu drew his support from Priyanka and Rahul. “The problem is we need both CM and Sidhu so we have to work it out,” said the leader quoted above. The other issue, said the above leader, was the choice of deputy chief ministers or PCC chiefs. Both Sidhu and the CM are from Patiala and so the central leadership is looking for another deputy candidate that would balance out regional representation. The discussions with the CM were also about rollout of Dalit- oriented schemes as they form 30% of the population in the state. Amarinder later also met senior party leader Ambika Soni, who is also a Rajya Sabha member from Punjab, at her Lodhi Estate residence over lunch. Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu, who met Kharge after the committee’s meeting with the CM, said Rahul is having a close look at everything and the party’s set-up in the state would be revamped within the next few days. Though the CM was scheduled to return to Chandigarh on Tuesday, he decided to spend one more day in the national capital.

23-06-2021||Chandigarh||Punjabi varsity fake billing scam: Panel submits report, finds ‘key evidences’ against erring officials||The fact-finding committee probing the alleged fake billing scam at Punjabi University, Patiala, on Tuesday submitted its interim report to the vice-chancellor. Though the contents of the report were disclosed yet, the three-member panel claimed to have gathered “substantial evidences” to proceed against the erring employees. A senior assistant working in an administrative department of the varsity had come under the scanner for a multi-crore embezzlement, which went unchecked for at least six years.The matter came to the fore when the internal audit department and the varsity’s finance wing flagged issues in five bills amounting to ₹6 lakh purportedly submitted by a department.The stamp and signatures of the department head were found to be fake and even the names of research scholars and assistants against whom the bills were raised turned out to be bogus.Acting on a complaint early this month, vice-chancellor Prof Arvind formed the fact-finding committee comprising registrar Varinder Kaushik, dean (research) Ashok Tiwari and finance officer Rakesh Khuranato file an interim report. “The committee gathered substantial evidences in the matter. It probed bank accounts of the senior assistant in question and his alleged accomplices.

23-06-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana youth killed in crossfire between two groups in Kotkapura||A 26-year-old youth was killed in crossfire between two groups in the Rishi Nagar area of Kotkapura town in Faridkot district on Tuesday. The deceased, identified as Deepak Kumar of Ferozepur Rajput village in Haryana’s Palwal district, was one of the 3-4 unidentified assailants who opened fire on Harvel Singh, a history sheeter, in the afternoon, police said. Tension gripped the area following the incident. Superintendent of police (SP) Bhupinder Singh Sidhu said, “Harvel and his aides also returned fire. Around 15 rounds were fired by the two groups. During the crossfire, the persons who attacked Harvel accidentally shot one of their aides. He was rushed to the government hospital, where doctors declared him brought dead. We found a driving licence on the deceased. Further investigation is underway.” “A forensic team inspected the crime spot and collected all vital evidences. We are trying to identify the other accused and the motive behind the attack. As per the preliminary investigation, it seems an attempt was made on Harvel due to rivalry between two gangs,” he added.

23-06-2021||Chandigarh||NIA arrests 2 more suspects in Shaurya Chakra awardee killing||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has arrested two more suspects in connection with the high-profile killing of Shaurya Chakra awardee Balwinder Singh Sandhu. The arrested men —Harbhinder Singh, alias Pinder Dhillon of Jeobala village and Navpreet Singh of Jhamke village in Tarn Taran district— were allegedly in contact with key accused Inderjit Singh, who was taken into custody earlier, sources said. Sandhu, who was awarded the bravery award for fighting terrorism in Punjab, was gunned down by two-bike borne men at his residence in Bhikhwind town of Tarn Taran district in October last year. On Tuesday, Harbhinder and Navpreet were produced in a Mohali court that sent them to four-day NIA remand, said Harbhinder’s counsel advocate Navjot Kaur Chabba. The two had allegedly been in contact with the Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF), a militant outfit. Inderjit was arrested by the Punjab Police in January from Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, Mumbai, hours before he was scheduled to board a flight to Dubai. The Punjab Police had claimed that Inderjit was one of the two shooters who barged into Sandhu’s house. Another shooter was identified as Gurjit Singh, alias Bha. Chabba, citing NIA, said the two were arrested on Monday. “The NIA had served notices to the duo and Harpinder has appeared before the investigating agency twice. She said both the two were cooperating with the investigators and their arrest was uncalled for. Harpinder, who had taken part in army recruitment thrice, had applied for an Australian visa,” she said. Earlier, the special court in Mohali had granted bail to 12 accused in the case as chargesheet was not presented against them. The case was initially registered by the Punjab Police in Tarn Taran on October 16, 2020. Later NIA took over the probe after registering a case on January 26 this year. It had earlier filed a chargesheet against eight accused in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nia-arrests-2-more-suspects-in-shaurya-chakra-awardee-killing-101624392161240.html
23-06-2021||Chandigarh||PM’s all-party meet: Pro-Jammu outfits stage protests, burn effigies||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s all-party meet scheduled for June 24 has stirred a hornet’s nest in Jammu where pro-Jammu parties feel enraged over what they called “BJP’s appeasement politics of inviting Kashmir-centric and pro-separatists parties to the meeting and giving negligible share to them.” Under sweltering sun, outfits such as the Panthers Party, the Dogra Front and the PoJK Refugees Front staged protests in Jammu. The Panthers Party activists led by former minister Harsh Dev Singh staged a vociferous protest and burnt the effigy of the BJP for “neglecting Jammu region in all party-meet and development programmes”. “We are protesting over the way political parties of Jammu are being neglected. Kashmir has always remained a pampered child, while Jammu has always been neglected, be it jobs, tourism, power, development projets, assembly seats, or allocation of funds. In this all-party meet, Jammu has been given a negligible share, but from Kashmir leaders who talk about separatism and separatists are being invited. Even those who do not want to attend are being persuaded,” he rued. “We have no hope from BJP leaders from J&K because they surrendered before the PDP in the past and played a second fiddle. The Congress unit will also toe the central line. Then who will talk about Jammu? It’s an attempt to subjugate Jammu, which will have far-reaching consequences on the region and its people,” he added. Dogra Front president Ashok Gupta also questioned the logic behind government’s decision to invite Valley-based politicians. “Farooq Abdullah sought China’s help for the restoration of Article 370. Mehbooba Mufti made derogatory remarks against the Tricolour. And they have been invited to the all-party meeting, but Jammu’s nationalist and patriotic political leaders have been ignored. Displaced Kashmiri Pandits who were driven out of their homes in the Valley by terrorists have also been neglected,” Gupta said. Ikkjutt Jammu (United Jammu), a Jammu-based political party, has also slammed the Modi government for “surrendering to Kashmir-centric parties”. Party president Ankur Sharma has said that the government is committing a big blunder by inviting the Kashmiri parties. “The Centre has invited parties from Kashmir, who are not even recognised, but the political parties from Jammu, who took part in elections, were not afforded even a single opportunity of being heard,” he said. A frontal organisation of the Kashmiri Pandits — Panun Kashmir — has also criticised the decision. Ajay Chrungoo, chairperson of Panun Kashmir, said, “The government is negating everything which had been achieved following the revocation of Article 370 and 35A. The dialogue process started by the government is a clear testimony to the fact that the government still wants to run J&K through halfway separatism. This is a political suicide.” PoJK Refugee Front, which staged a protest outside the local Press Club, sought 24 assembly seats for them. “Those who are distress have not been called for the meeting,” he said. The meeting has its own sanctity: J&K BJP president Without according much priority to the demands of People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), the president of Jammu and Kashmir Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Ravinder Raina, on Tuesday said, “The all-party meeting by the Prime Minister has its own sanctity and all the issues which are in the interest of the people of Jammu and Kashmir will be discussed.” He, however, added that “J&K was, is and shall remain an integral part of India”.Addressing mediapersons after holding an impromptu meet here, Raina said, “Since PM Modi has invited all parties with an open mind and a big heart, therefore we should also talk about Ek Bharat, Sreshth Bharat.” “The PM has invited all parties from J&K to discuss the issues and problems. He was the one who strengthened grassroots level democracy in Jammu and Kashmir after 70 years of successive rule by various parties. He was the one who tried to do justice with West-Pak refugees, PoJK refugees, Pahari speaking community, Gurkha and Valmiki communities and women,” he said. “I am confident that all the leaders invited there will take part and with an open mind and heart will discuss all issues before the PM,” he said in a clear reference to PAGD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pms-all-party-meet-pro-jammu-outfits-stage-protests-burn-effigies-101624392104239.html

Dr Ashutosh Dhanuka of Sacred Heart Hospital said that post-discharge the patient complained of low-grade fever, cough and blood in sputum and was re-admitted on June 14.Since the patient was a follow-up case of severe Covid, the possibility of a fungal infection was to be ruled out and hence a series of medical investigations were performed. He said a suspected fungal culture report came positive for aspergillus flavus and anti-fungal medications were started. The patient’s condition is improving, said Dr Ashutosh.He added that multiple factors including diabetes, use of steroids and underlying damaged lungs predispose patients to secondary infections and hence the cases of green and black fungus are on the rise in India.On June 20, a 62-year-old Covid survivor had been diagnosed with green fungus infection at the hospital in Jalandhar.Symptoms of the diseaseAmong the symptoms of allergic aspergillus sinusitis are stuffiness, runny nose, headache and reduced ability to smell.

23-06-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab Cong leaders meet Rahul, say Sidhu’s actions will damage party||ChandigarhAfter former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu’s spate of interviews bad-mouthing chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, some party leaders are learnt to have conveyed their displeasure to former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and the three-member central committee, telling them that such actions would damage the party. Rahul met more than a dozen party leaders from Punjab for direct feedback as part of his consultation efforts before the central leadership takes any steps, including changes in the organisational set-up, to end factionalism in the state unit. Those who met him included cabinet ministers Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Charanjit Singh Channi, Sukhbinder Sarkaria, MPs Ravneet Singh Bittu, Dr Amar Singh, MLAs Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon, Pargat Singh, Tarsem Singh, Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, Sangat Singh Gilzian, Inderbir Singh Bolaria and ex-MLA Ashwani Sekhri. Bittu and Amritsar MP Gurjit Singh Aujla met leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, who heads the panel looking into the present crisis in the state unit, according to people familiar with the matter. During these meetings, at least four leaders, including two MPs, drew their attention to the Amritsar East MLA’s statements against Amarinder over the past two days. In a series of interviews, Sidhu had accused the two-time chief minister of colluding with Badals and failure to fulfil several key poll promises, besides alleging corruption in the state government. Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu, who raised the issue with both Rahul and Kharge, said that several leaders have informed the high command about his (Sidhu’s) statements and notice has been taken. “There is discontent over this. The CM has been appointed by Sonia Ji and Rahul Ji. This kind of things coming from someone who was in the cabinet is unfortunate and not acceptable,” he said, insinuating that such blame game happens close to the elections when people are looking to jump ship. Amritsar MP Gurjit Singh Aujla, while expressing his displeasure, is also learnt to have urged the leadership to discipline those who are not adhering to the party’s directions and decorum. In their one-to-one meetings with Rahul, the Punjab leaders, most of whom have been critical of Capt in the recent weeks, repeated the concerns they raised during their interaction with the Kharge panel three weeks ago. Rahul gave on an average 15 minutes to each leader. Jalandhar Cantonment MLA Pargat Singh told him about justice in sacrilege and police firing cases, action in drug cases and power purchase agreements being their prime concern, pointing out that if these promises are fulfilled, issues will get resolved automatically. Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar and Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa are likely to meet Gandhi on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cong-leaders-meet-rahul-say-sidhu-s-actions-will-damage-party-101624391862207.html

Minor scuffles broke out between the protesters and cops as the workers attempted to break through the police barricades, following which around two dozen workers, including women, were detained.“Arjun Partap Singh Bajwa, the son of Qadian MLA Fateh Jung Singh Bajwa, has been appointed a Group B inspector in the Punjab Police, while Bhisham Pandey, the son of Ludhiana (north) MLA Rakesh Pandey, has been made naib tehsildar. However, the fate of the thousands of youngsters who had filled forms under the ‘Ghar Ghar Rozgar’ mission is still up in the air,” said Kainth. On the party’s decision to lock up the DC’s office, LIP student wing president Harjap Gill said, “Deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma should clarify how many of the youngsters who had registered themselves at job fairs organised by the state government and administration have been provided jobs. Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh approved the jobs to gain the MLAs’ backing amid a feud in the Congress.” Saying that the youth had been backstabbed, Kainth said, “Teachers and other contractual staff in different sectors have been agitating, while the government has announced jobs for the sons of affluent MLAs, who have crores in their coffers.”Division number 5 police station house officer Kuldeep Singh said LIP workers and leaders were detained to maintain law and order. “No FIR has been lodged against the protesters and they were released after some time,” he said. At a time when epidemiologists have advised caution and predicted a third wave of the Covid pandemic, a large number of LIP workers gathered at the protest site, disregarding social distancing and masking protocols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jobs-to-congress-mlas-sons-lip-leaders-workers-detained-after-scuffle-with-cops-in-ludhiana-101624391140810.html

23-06-2021||Bangalore||Despite Cong warning, 2 more MLAs back Siddaramaiah as CM||At least two more legislators from the Congress on Tuesday endorsed Siddaramaiah as the future chief minister of Karnataka, adding to the growing factionalism and challenges for the principal opposition party in the southern state ahead of the 2023 assembly elections.The public airing of views on the party’s chief ministerial choice comes on the same day when state Congress president, DK Shivakumar met Rahul Gandhi in Delhi on Tuesday.“It is the dream of the entire people of the state that Siddaramaiah should become the chief minister,” JN Ganesh, the Congress legislator from Kampli in Ballari said on Tuesday.Bhima Naik, the Congress legislator from Hagirbommanahalli in the same district, added that the youth who voted for BJP in the 2018 assembly elections, are now stating that they had made a mistake. Naik too said that it was his opinion that Siddaramaiah should become the chief minister again.The statements fuels factionalism in the Congress party and further sours relations between opposition leader Siddaramaiah and state party president DK Shivakumar.The statements come a day after the national leadership of the Congress warned legislators in Karnataka from projecting anyone as the chief ministerial face.Earlier, Chamrajpet MLA Zameer Ahmed Khan and Koppal legislator Raghavendra Hitnal had aired their views backing Siddaramaiah in public, irking the state party president who also nurses ambition to take the top job if the Congress is voted to power in 2023 elections.Shivakumar was in Delhi on Monday to get the central leadership to crack down on such statements. Promptly, Congress national general secretary in-charge of Karnataka, Randeep Singh Surjewala issued a statement in which he warned party legislators from airing their views on who will be the next chief minister.Speaking to reporters earlier in the day, Shivakumar said that he did discuss various developments of the state with Rahul Gandhi but refused to comment on a specific question of his party legislators mooting Siddaramaiah’s name as chief minister.“I am a Congress worker,” Shivakumar said and walked away.Siddaramaiah has distanced himself from the statements but people aware of the developments said that the former was trying to mobilise support among party legislators.“The statements made by few of @INCKarnataka MLAs about the next @CMofKarnataka are their personal opinions & not our party’s stand. High command will decide after the elections based on Congress Legislature Party’s collective opinion. Any discussion now is unnecessary,” Siddaramaiah said in a post on Twitter.Siddaramaiah who was in Ballari, on Tuesday said that in a democracy, legislators are allowed to air their views but this is not the party’s opinion.“Have I said that I will become CM anywhere? Has it been decided in the party? There is no discussion in the party. There is no need to give it so much importance and is not even a point for discussion,” Siddaramaiah said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/despite-cong-warning-2-more-mlas-back-siddaramaiah-as-cm-101624390420236.html

23-06-2021||Bangalore||In report on 3rd wave, panel suggests reopening of schools||An expert committee led by noted cardiologist Dr Devi Prasad Shetty on Tuesday submitted a 91-page interim report to the Karnataka government in which it has recommended the reopening of schools and colleges in the state despite the looming threat of a third wave of Covid-19 infections. The government appointed technical advisory committee (TAC), in its recommendations, argued that education is the fundamental right of a child and stated that reopening physical schools would optimise learning, physical and mental health as well as for nutritional aspects of children. “Any further delay in school reopening may push children into malnutrition, child labour, child marriage, child trafficking, begging etc., making their condition further worse,” according to the report. According to the TAC, there are 23,838,995 people below the age of 18 in the state having an estimated population of 70,259,592, which accounts for 34%. However, Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa said that they are still yet to take a decision on the same and will review the recommendations. The report also said that the possibility of schools being areas of large transmissions has not been proved anywhere in the world, adding to uncertainty on the impact the third wave will have on children. In a statement from the chief minister’s office (CMO) on Tuesday, the government said that it was considering reopening colleges in the state after making arrangements to vaccinate all students above 18 years of age. “It is suggested to prioritize inoculation to students and teaching fraternity. The committee has suggested reviewing phase-wise reopening of schools and colleges,” according to the statement. After having neglected the advice of experts for the preparedness of the second wave, the BS Yediyurappa government is now attempting to ensure there are adequate preparations in place for any subsequent waves to minimize impact on health and economy of the state. The mismanagement of Covid-19 during the ongoing second wave, that began around the first week of March, had also stirred dissent within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators who, among other factors, used this to cite the incompetence of the chief minister and sought his removal from office. The committee has also advised to seek help of experts and make use of both human and financial resources to contain the impact of the third wave. “Among the total Covid-19 infections, children aged between 0-18years constituted around 8 to 10% during (the) 1st and 2nd wave. Most of national and international data indicated that a maximum of 5-7% of such children required hospitalisation. However, a recent data from the US suggests that children in the age group of 12-17 years requires almost around 31% ICU admission and among them 5% needed invasive ventilation, but no deaths were reported. To meet the surge in India, especially in Karnataka, we need to be ready for a little higher number to be requiring hospitalisation,” the report added. The TAC has also estimated that the bed requirement according to categories of moderate, best- and worst-case scenarios to estimate the rough requirement of hospital beds. According to estimates made by the TAC, the state government would require around 51,008 beds required, including 6,801 ICU/HDU beds in the best-case scenario. In the moderate case scenario, the TAC has calculated a requirement of 73,963 beds in total. And in the worst-case scenario, the TAC has estimated the bed requirement of 95,216, including 13,602 ICU/HDU beds. The report also emphasises the need for the presence and wide utilisation of mental health professionals in every hospital to boost the morale of Covid-infected children. “It is necessary to give priority to solve post Covid health issues and other health problems other than Covid,” the CMO added. For testing, the TAC has said that non-conventional methods like nasal and oropharyngeal swabs, gargle and salivary RT-PCR, which are ways that children are comfortable with. “We are working under tremendous uncertainty,” Dr Jagdish Chinnappa, pediatrician at Manipal Hospital and one of the 16 members of the TAC told Hindustan Times. He added that there is no enough data to indicate how the disease will impact children which is why there is a need to find a balance between “over preparedness and complacent”. He, however, said that Karnataka has around 3,000 pediatricians and the state’s healthcare infrastructure was far better than other regions in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/in-report-on-3rd-wave-panel-suggests-reopening-of-schools-101624390060222.html
23-06-2021||Bangalore||Nandi firm case: Gowda fined ₹2cr in defamation case||Bengaluru A local court in Bengaluru has directed former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda to pay ₹2 crore as damages for making defamatory statements against Nandi Infrastructure Corridor Enterprise Limited (NICE) in an interview to a Kannada TV channel in 2011.“The defendant is directed to pay damages of Rs.2,00,00,000/- to the plaintiff Company for the loss of reputation of the plaintiff Company on account of the defamatory comments made by the defendant in the interview telecasted in the ‘Suvarna 24/7’ Kannada news channel dated 28.6.2011...,” the VIII additional Civil and sessions Judge Mallanagouda, said in his order on June 17.The court ordered Gowda, who also accused Ashok Kheny, the promoter and managing director of the company of land grabbing and corruption, to be restrained permanently from making any defamatory statements against the firm on any media platform henceforth.Gowda, in the interview, said Kheny promoted the firm’s Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) project and added it was actually a “loot project”. He referred to Kheny as “land mafia”, according to the order copy.The court said Gowda did not have anything on record to prove the allegations.The MoU for the Bangalore Mysore Infrastructure Corridor project was signed in 1995 when Gowda was chief minister of Karnataka. The two parties had signed a contract to build a road between Bengaluru and Mysuru, around 111 kms, that was meant to be of international standards and reduce travel time by over half between two of Karnataka’s biggest cities.Gowda could not be reached for comment.A Janata Dal (Secular) party spokesperson also refused to comment on the development.The project proposed to acquire over 20,000 acres and during the later half of the 1990’s, allegations of kickbacks, land grabbing were levelled by both sides, leading to over two decades of delays. There were also allegations that Gowda had tried to get Kheny to alter the route of the expressway to avoid the lands of a few influential people, which the latter objected to.There are over 550 lawsuits filed in the case over the years.In 2012, the Lokayukta police filed an FIR against three former Karnataka chief ministers Dave Gowda, SM Krishna and BS Yediyurappa and 27 others, alleging irregularities in the project, PTI reported in November 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/nandi-firm-case-gowda-fined-2cr-in-defamation-case-101624390000202.html
23-06-2021||Bangalore||K’taka may have stockpiled jabs for record inoculations: Data||A record number of Covid-19 vaccine doses were administered in Karnataka on Monday compared to the previous days, official data shows, indicating the possibility that the BS Yediyurappa-led state government had stockpiled supplies to show a surge on the occasion of the nationwide Vaccination Maha Abhiyan. Data from CoWin shows that Karnataka administered 68,172 doses on Sunday as against a record 11,21,648 on Monday. Bengaluru, which topped the cities’ list in the country, administered just 25,054 on Sunday as against a record 1,68,958 on Monday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led campaign saw administration of 85,96,807 doses across all states as against 29,37,503 on Sunday, raising questions if similar exercise was followed in other places to show higher numbers and mark the success of the event. “Vaccination cannot be seen like a one-day fixture. Clearly, yesterday (Monday) was a pre-planned, image-booster. Today we have not sustained that level. We simply have to sustain at least 80 lakh a day for the next four-five months,” Rajya Sabha MP Jairam Ramesh said in a post on Twitter. Karnataka Congress president DK Shivakumar shared Ramesh’s views. “Instead of treating vaccination rates as a one-day event, Bengaluru and Karnataka need to increase vaccination rates day by day. If we can vaccinate 80% of adults in the next 3 months, we can prevent the third wave,” Shivakumar posted on Twitter. Senior government officials said Karnataka is among a handful of states that have been administering doses every day unlike several others who designate two or three days in a week. The allegations of stockpiling for the event added to challenges of the state government, which is already facing criticism for claiming a sharp decline in new infections by reducing the number of tests as well as charges of underreporting deaths. “If we get more vaccines, we will deliver more. Even in slumber we can deliver 5 lakh doses every day. With a little bit of effort, we can go up to 6-7 lakh per day,” said a senior government official, requesting not to be named. Karnataka crossed the 20-million vaccination mark and is among the highest in the country, as it administered 3,78,038 doses on Tuesday, according to CoWin data. Karnataka has also had a higher rate of vaccination compared to other states. The Yediyurappa government, like his counterparts in other states, is looking at higher vaccination to minimise the impact of a third wave of infections. Karnataka, which was among the worst Covid-hit regions in the country, has seen a sharp decline in cases over the last few days, prompting the Yediyurappa-led government to relax lockdown-like restrictions and allow some normalcy to return after almost six weeks. Karnataka registered 3,709 new infections in the 24-hour period, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department on Tuesday. There were 8,111 recoveries that brought down the active caseload to 118,592. The positivity rate was at 2.87% as the state conducted 129,099 tests, data shows. However, fatality rate saw a sharp spike to 3.74% as 139 more succumbed to the virus, taking the toll to 34,164. Bengaluru recorded 803 new infections and 1,745 recoveries that brought down its active caseload to 69,344. There were 26 more deaths reported, taking the toll to 15,499. The official quoted above said that the state received an additional 200,000 doses of Covishield and 25,000 of Covaxin on Saturday as part of the campaign. He said that the state can achieve a far higher rate of vaccination if it has adequate supply. There are around 13,000 vaccination centres in Karnataka of which around 6,700 are operational, which the official said would ensure around 1.3 million doses every day even if each centre administered just 100 doses. Karnataka has administered 100,000 to 300,000 doses per day, data shows. Of this, a majority are still the first dose. The state government has set a target of giving at least one dose to all eligible citizens of the state by the end of the year. However, a significant number of these vaccine doses in places like Karnataka are paid as people prefer the hassle-free experience in private healthcare providers. In Bengaluru, private hospitals account for more than 50% of all doses administered as these centres are inoculating even those categories of people not on the priority list of the state or the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/ktaka-may-have-stockpiled-jabs-for-record-inoculations-data-101624389940172.html

Also, waste processing is not being done in Chennai as of now.Apart from Sandhu, senior deputy mayor Sham Sundar Malhotra, MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal, councillors Jai Prakash, Sunny Bhalla and Yashpal Chaudhary; secretary Jasdev Sekhon, superintending engineers Rahul Gagneja and Rajinder Singh; nodal officer (health branch) Ashwani Sahota and Harpal Aujla were part of the committee, that went for a five-day visit to Chennai last week and returned on Sunday.Malhotra said they were mainly looking for a company to process the 1,100 tonnes of solid waste which is generated in the city daily. But the processing plant was not yet made functional by the company deployed in Chennai. The committee however appreciated the use of e-rickshaws for the door-to-door lifting of garbage, and installation of static compactors to stop open dumping of garbage, among other practices.Malhotra said that the scope of work in Chennai was bigger as around 5,500 tonnes of garbage is generated daily there. They have deployed around 3,000 e-rickshaws for the door-to-door lifting of garbage, and 38 road sweeping machines, which require a lot of funds. Their project cost is around ₹1,200 crore.Mayor Sandhu said, “MC will study different models before finalising the pattern for the city. The tender which was earlier floated to finalise a contractor for shifting of garbage from secondary dump points to the main dumpsite has been put on hold for now. A team will now visit Gurugram to study the waste processing model there.”The MC has been facing flak over its apathy in dealing with the solid waste in the city. The monitoring committee of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had also recently directed the PPCB to impose a penalty on the civic body for its failure to deal with over 16 lakh metric tonnes of legacy waste accumulated at the main dumpsite at Tajpur road. Over 1,100 metric tonnes of garbage, which is generated in the city daily, is getting added to the legacy waste due to MC’s failure to deal with the issue. The residents have also been raising hue and cry over the open dumping of garbage at different points in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-chennai-ludhiana-mc-team-to-visit-gurugram-to-study-solid-waste-mgmt-model-101624389882644.html

During the search, NCB sleuths found the drugs from a bedroom. “Kenjale is an alleged supplier of LSD and he has a team of peddlers working under him to supply drugs, for several months. It appears that he procured drugs through the dark web, but our investigation is on to find out the source and his buyers,” said NCB’s zonal director Sameer Wankhede.LSD is a hallucinogen – a synthetically created psychedelic drug that is known for its induction of a range of psychological effects. It has emerged as a popular drug in Mumbai, especially among youngsters and college students, and is mostly illegally imported from European countries through the dark web, said an NCB officer. In a second operation, the agency seized 9kg of charas (cannabis) hidden in a cavity near the petrol tanks of two bikes in Dadar. The arrests were made following the interrogation of Rajvinder Singh and Gurmit Singh, who were held last week allegedly with hashish. They had travelled from Punjab on a bike carrying 5kg of the contraband in a backpack. The agency raided a religious place in Dadar last week and arrested Singh, Gurmit, Kamlesh Gupta and Amit Patel. The four had booked a room in the lodge inside the religious place, where a drug deal was on. NCB recovered 2kg of charas and ₹2.2 lakh from the accused. The agency then raided an area in Chunabhatti and arrested Noor Mohmmad Jumman with 3.3kg of charas and cash ₹2.2 lakh. After questioning all the accused, NCB officers arrested two more persons – Shabir Usman Shaikh and Nizamuddin Ahmad Taza – and recovered 12kg of charas at Padga, Bhiwandi. “The drug recovered at Padga was brought to the city in trucks from Jammu and Kashmir,” said Wankhede.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ncb-arrests-son-of-retired-mumbai-acp-with-436-lsd-blots-marijuana-101624389701508.html

Instead of the natural slope, the water was drained into the Ganda nullah through pumps but due to the low capacity of the disposal point, the rain water now accumulates at old GT road, Dholewal chowk, Gill Road and adjoining areas.Iqbal Singh said that the width of the sewer line through which the water was currently drained into the Ganda nullah was 36 inches, but the old natural drain had more capacity as it is 3 feet wide and 7 feet deep. Around 100 tippers of waste have been pulled out of the blocked drain and the nullah is almost clean now. Special permission was sought from the railway department as the nullah runs below the rail lines near the Manjit Nagar railway shed.“Residents apprised me of the blocked drain. Mayor Sandhu conducted a meeting with the railway department following which the drain was opened. It is expected that the rain water, which used to get accumulated for around 7-8 hours after rainfall will be drained out in an hour or two,” said Singh.Mayor Sandhu said the movement of traffic is also hit due to rain water accumulation in the area. We are working to clean all the old natural drains of the city including Talab Bazar drain, which moves through different parts of the Old City area, to deal with water logging during the monsoon season.Mayor Sandhu and councillor Rakesh Prashar, among others, also inspected the ongoing work of installation of the storm sewer line from Rekhi Cinema Chowk to the Clock Tower. He said that the work will be completed by June 30. Shopkeepers and commuters are facing a lot of trouble as the road portion has been dug up at different points for installation of the sewer lines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-mc-reopens-drain-to-ease-water-logging-woes-101624389700994.html

The 36-year-old woman in her petition has complained of stalking and harassment by certain persons, allegedly at the behest of Raut and her estranged husband. HC also asked the woman to file a separate petition to deal with her contention of being arrested illegally on the allegations of using a fake degree to practice in a hospital at Bandra. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, was hearing the woman’s petition seeking directions to Mumbai Police to investigate three first information report (FIRs) lodged on her complaint in 2013 and 2018 against unknown persons and to initiate action against the deputy police commissioner (DCP), zone 8, for allegedly not taking action on her plaint despite directions by the National Women’s Rights Commission. The woman’s advocate, Abha Singh, submitted that after the petition was filed, the police arrested her client based on a complaint which alleged that she was practicing at a well-known hospital in Bandra (West) on a fake clinical psychologist degree for two years before being removed from the post. Singh submitted that her client was in jail for 10 days now and her personal liberty was at stake as the entire police machinery was unleashed on her after she filed the petition. Singh added that the police have acted in a mala fide manner, and hence, the bench should pass orders with regards to her original petition as well as the latest developments. The court, however, declined to deal with the two separate issues together and suggested that the woman file a separate petition to challenge her arrest. It then directed the police commissioner of to look into the grievances raised in the petition and take appropriate measures and submit a report by Thursday. In an earlier hearing on March 5, senior Raut’s advocate Prasad Dhakephalkar had opposed the plea and raised preliminary objections to it, stating that the allegations were false. Dhakephalkar had informed the court that the woman was like a daughter to his client and she made the accusations against him as she thought that he was siding with her husband in the couple’s matrimonial dispute. In April, Raut had also filed an application in a Mumbai court against the woman, seeking removal of some “offensive” posts put up by her on social media against him. HC will hear the plea on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-asks-mumbai-top-cop-to-take-action-on-woman-s-plaint-against-sanjay-raut-101624389640206.html

The RoB will be rebuilt at a cost of ₹5 crore and is expected to be ready by the year-end. The bridge was flagged as unsafe by a team of experts from Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B).The railways earlier had undertaken work of strengthening RoB structures, including the girders of the bridge. The bridge portion that crosses the railway tracks will be built by CR, while the road landing is expected to be constructed by the civic body. The zonal railway floated a tender for the construction of the approach road, deck slab and other work for rebuilding the Byculla RoB. “The work on construction will begin as the tender has been awarded. The bridge will be completed four months after awarding the tender. Vehicle speed restrictions had been imposed on the bridge after an IIT-B team had inspected it,” said a senior CR official.A speed restriction of 30 kilometres per hour (kmph) was also imposed on all the vehicles on the Byculla, Arthur Road and Currey Road RoBs. The institute had restricted heavy vehicles of more than 16 tonnes on Byculla, Ghatkopar and Arthur Road RoBs. The experts’ team had also asked for the closure of the footpath adjacent to the Byculla RoB near the market. Light vehicles, including cars and two-wheelers, were only allowed on the lane next to the footpath. A cable-stayed RoB is also being constructed between Byculla and Sandhurst Road stations.The construction and reconstruction work will be undertaken by Maharashtra Rail Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (MRIDCL). Experts from IIT-B, Central and Western Railways as well as civic body officials from Mumbai, Thane, Kalyan-Dombivli and Navi Mumbai had undertaken an audit of 445 bridges across the suburban railway tracks after the Gokhale bridge at Andheri railway station collapsed in July 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/work-to-reconstruct-road-overbridge-near-mumbai-s-byculla-station-to-begin-soon-101624389580141.html

To their embarrassment, however, it turned out that the plant didn’t even process dry waste.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) councillor Shakti Prakash Devshali said, “The Ambala plant only processes wet waste while Chandigarh requires technology for dry waste processing.”Criticising the BJP-led MC for the Ambala plant visit, Devinder Singh Babla, Congress councillor and leader of the opposition, said, “The visit was a total waste of time and energy. Thousands of MC funds were wasted on it. The MC is already processing its wet waste and only needs the technology for dry waste. Even then, we were taken to the Ambala plant, which only processes wet waste. The MC officials should have confirmed the status at the plant before they finalised the trip. When I asked them why it was not done beforehand, they replied ‘ab pata chal gaya (now we know)’.”Notably, councillors during the MC General House meeting in May had decided to visit the plants of the firms, who had offered technological solutions for upgrading of the garbage processing plant, Sector 25. The aim was to study which technology is to be adopted for processing dry waste in Chandigarh.The Ambala plant visit was the third such visit in these series of visits. Earlier, the councillors had visited two plants in Delhi.Mayor Ravi Kant Sharma, who was also part of the MC team that visited the Ambala plant, said, “In their presentation before the House and councillors, the firm had stated they were processing dry waste at the plant. We were not told that this was not the plant where they were doing it. There was also an impression created that this plant might process Chandigarh’s waste for the time being before our plant was upgraded. But this was also not the case.”More visits plannedNow, MC officials say more visits to other waste processing plants will have to be planned. Sharma said, “We may visit more plants before preparing the report regarding the visits.” He was confident that the visits would be completed in time so that an agenda on the issue could be tabled before the MC General House meeting scheduled for later this week.The MC has been delving on the issue of upgrading the waste processing plant for almost a year now. Earlier, 13 companies had made presentations for alternative technologies to be adopted for upgrading dry waste processing in UT, which was working at less than 10% of its capacity.As a result, most of the dry waste, around 250 metric tonnes daily, is being dumped at the dumping site without being processed. The MC had taken over the Dadumajra plant from Jaypee group in June last year.After the MC House finalises the technology to be adopted, the MC will float tenders to hire an agency to upgrade, maintain and run the plant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-team-makes-futile-visit-to-ambala-waste-plant-101624389461003.html

He was nabbed by the Government Railway Police (GRP) at Dahanu Road station after the nurse raised an alarm.“The complainant fought back the 22-year-old accused, Sukhram Jangu Ganva, and also retrieved her phone that he tried to snatch from her,” said senior inspector Yogesh Devre of Palghar GRP. The woman had boarded the train at Virar, and when the local reached Vangaon station around 11.35pm, she was alone in the ladies compartment. “The accused entered the coach through the vestibule while the complainant was on her phone and tried to snatch it. She fought back even and as the train approached the last station at Dahanu Road around 12.05am, raised an alarm and alerted the cops on platform number 4. The accused bit the woman on her hand and moved quickly through the vestibule but the GRP nabbed him from one of the coaches,” said Devre.The accused hails from Jhabua, Madhya Pradesh, and works as a casual labourer on Western Railway projects. “We have arrested Ganva under sections 354 (molestation) and 393 (attempt to robbery) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 162 (entering ladies coach)and 137 (travelling without ticket)of the Indian Railway Act.

23-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 2-day monsoon session to commence from July 5||The business advisory committee (BAC) of the Maharashtra legislature on Tuesday decided to curtail the upcoming monsoon session to two days starting July 5, in the backdrop of Covid-19 pandemic and new variants. The decision was taken amid opposition from the Bharatiya Janata Party. The Maharashtra government is likely to present supplementary demands for approval and a few bills are also likely to be discussed during the session. Election for the post of Assembly speaker may not be held and is likely to be postponed once again, the officials said. “Although Covid cases are in control, the pandemic has yet not ended and the state government is not in favour of giving any reason for its rise,” Anil Parab, state parliamentary affairs minister said after the meeting. The position of Speaker became vacant after Nana Patole resigned to become Maharashtra Congress president on February 4. “It is difficult for us to hold an election for the post of Speaker as the session is for a very limited period. It is likely to be postponed for this session as well,” said a senior official from the state legislature, requesting anonymity. The state had decided not to hold the election during the budget session of the state legislature held during March 1 and 10 despite a directive issued by Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari in February. In a letter, the governor had directed the legislative secretariat to hold the election in the first week of the budget session. Meanwhile, the BAC has decided to make RT-PCR tests mandatory for all those attending the session including ministers, legislators, officials and the staff. Only those having negative test reports will be allowed to enter. “A camp will be set up outside Vidhan Bhavan premises for free testing for those allowed to attend the session,” said a senior official. The seating arrangement of the legislators in both the Houses will also be made in order to maintain social distancing, he added. Leader of opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis slammed the state government for proposing to curtail the monsoon session. “We believe that the state government is using Covid-19 as a reason to curtail session period and avoid debates on major issues that are directly related to people. We walked out of the BAC meeting to express our displeasure on the government’s stand,” Fadnavis told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-2-day-monsoon-session-to-commence-from-july-5-101624389280170.html
23-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt files review plea for Maratha quota||The Maharashtra government on Tuesday filed a review petition before the Supreme Court, seeking reversal of its May 5 decision to scrap Maratha reservation. The petition was filed based on recommendations of a state-appointed committee led by retired chief justice Dilip Bhosale to examine the apex court judgment and suggest measures. Advocate Sachin Patil, counsellor for the state government in the Supreme Court, confirmed the development. He, however, refused to share details of the petition.A five-judge bench of the Apex court in its ruling on May 5 struck down the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018, which extended 12% and 13% reservation to the Maratha community in education and employment respectively in excess of the ceiling limit of 50% fixed by the Supreme Court earlier. The 50% cap in reservation was fixed in the Indra Sawhney judgment passed by a nine-judge bench. The bench had also ruled that only extraordinary circumstances would justify grant of reservation in excess of the 50% ceiling. The state, in its petition, has pointed out many reasons based on which they have requested the five-judge bench to hear the case once again. It has said that the reservation for the economically weaker section (EWS) passed by the central government also breaches the 50% ceiling in many states. It was also challenged before the apex court for the same reason of 50% ceiling and is still pending with it. Hence, the issue of 50% ceiling for reservation is yet not cleared, said a senior official requesting anonymity.As the Sawhney judgement passed by the nine-judge bench says that only extraordinary circumstances would justify grant of reservation in excess of the 50% ceiling, in that case the extraordinary circumstances have to be decided either by nine-bench judges or more than that. Thus, rejecting the state government’s prayers for referring the matter to the 11-judge bench was erroneous. In addition, the prayer was supported by 20-odd states such as Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Jharkhand, Rajasthan etc., said the official.The petition also pointed out that the apex court while quashing the SEBC Act also said that the states have no powers to grant reservation to socially and economically backward classes post 102nd amendment in the Constitution, following which was challenged by the central government through a petition. “The grounds of the apex court cannot sustain when the central government time and again has clarified that the rights of the states for providing reservation to a community have not been removed,” he informed.In response to the appeal made by CM Uddhav Thackeray last week, Maratha outfits from Monday have put their ongoing silent protest on hold for four weeks. The decision was taken, expressing satisfaction over the steps taken by the state government in relation to the six major demands put forth by the Maratha outfits. “Today, Maharashtra government has filed for the review petition in context with Maratha Reservation in the Supreme Court as per the primary demand raised by us,” tweeted Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati, Rajya Sabha MP, who is leading the protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-files-review-plea-for-maratha-quota-101624389220207.html
23-06-2021||Mumbai||Congress, CM remarks: Maharashtra’s ruling allies resolve to be careful to avoid friction||The three ruling parties of Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) — Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress — on Tuesday resolved to be careful and avoid saying anything, which may lead to friction between them. It was also decided to make appointments on the government boards and corporations in the next 15 days. Days after friction between Shiv Sena and Congress came to the fore over contesting polls, the issue was discussed in the state coordination committee of senior leaders. The leaders said that they don’t have the liberty to say whatever they want to disturb the coalition partners. “The Shiv Sena made it apparently clear that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is upset with state Congress president Nana Patole who started giving statements on contesting upcoming elections on their own. It was also said that they should avoid taking any such move which would harm the prospects of MVA government and their common objective is to keep the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) away from power,” said a senior minister, requesting anonymity. Earlier this week, Patole had said that his party would fight all forthcoming elections alone. The Congress will be the single-largest party in 2024 Assembly polls, he had said. Addressing the Shiv Sena’s 55th foundation day, Thackeray on Saturday said, “If we do not offer solutions to people’s problems, but only talk about going it alone in politics, people will beat us with footwear. They will not listen to our party-centric ambitious talk of contesting elections alone.” Though he chose not to name anyone, the remarks were clear that he is not happy with the stand taken by the Congress state unit. Shiv Sena minister Eknath Shinde after the meeting said there is no lack of coordination or miscommunication in MVA. “We have taken a decision on a few state-owned corporations in today’s meeting. However, the final decision has to be taken by the chief minister. The sharing will be done on the basis of the party’s strength in the state assembly. There is no miscommunication and misunderstanding among the three parties,” Shinde said. Patole said, “There is nothing new if one talks about contesting on its own. Every party has the right to get it strengthened. However, no one is upset and there is no dispute among us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/congress-cm-remarks-maharashtra-s-ruling-allies-resolve-to-be-careful-to-avoid-friction-101624389100181.html

If citizens are not registered on the CoWIN portal, the staff at the vaccination centres will help them in the process, an official said.“Since most of the population in the 45-plus age category has already been inoculated with the first dose, only people in the 18-44 age category are turning up at the vaccination sites. Also, our focus remains on vaccinating the targeted group, including the vulnerable sections of the society like shopkeepers, vendors, etc. We are getting a good response from people and we will soon vaccinate the eligible population,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director, UT health services.Dr Kang further added, “Our health teams are helping people to do on-the-spot registration as not every section of the society is aware about booking the slots online. Besides, people are also walking-in to mobile vaccination vans and with their help, we will be able to vaccinate people living in urban-clusters at the earliest.”So far, the health department has administered 4,67,343 vaccine doses, including 1,45,422 in the 18-44 age group. In the 45+ age category, 1,95,946 beneficiaries have received the first dose and 48,211 have been jabbed twice.UT to get supply of 2 lakh doses in JulyWhile giving details about the availability of the vaccine stock in Chandigarh, Dr Kang said, “At present, 40,000 vaccine doses are available in Chandigarh and we can get 50,000 more doses from the central government for the month of June. Besides this, the central government has allocated 2 lakh doses for Chandigarh for the month of July.”Of the 2 lakh doses, 1.5 lakh will be given to government hospitals while 50,000 will be for private hospitals in the city. Dr Kang said, “We have enough vaccines in store to vaccinate the eligible population at the earliest.”UT administrator VP Singh Badnore during a review meeting on Tuesday also advised director health services to form a vaccination team to administer doses at home for those senior citizens who cannot visit the vaccination centres owing to being bed-ridden or suffering from acute illnesses.

23-06-2021||Other||37-year-old arrested for attempt to murder in Dombivli||A 37-year-old man who allegedly tried to murder a Rajasthan-based businessman last week, was arrested from Dombivli in a joint operation between the Rajasthan Police and Thane crime branch. The accused harassed the businessman, Aditya Jain’s wife when the couple resided in Dombivli. Tired of the harassment, Jain, 49, shifted to Jaipur last year. This enraged the accused, Kamlesh Shinde, who hired two gunmen to kill Jain. According to police, on June 16, Jain was washing his car when two men on a motorcycle approached the spot and fired three rounds at him. The duo sped away from the scene and Jain, who sustained a gunshot wound to his hand, was rushed to the hospital. The Karni Vihar police subsequently started investigations into the matter. “The investigating team found out that the Jains used to stay in Dombivli between 2018 and 2020. During this time, Shinde fell in love with Jain’s wife Shefali and started harassing her. The harassment reached a point where the Jains decided to shift to Rajasthan,” senior police inspector Sanju John, Thane crime branch said. Based on this information, a team from the Rajasthan Police reached Dombivli on Monday and sought assistance from the Thane crime branch. Accordingly, personnel from crime branch units 3 and 4 were assigned and the joint team picked up Shinde from his residence in Devicha Pada, Dombivli (West) for questioning. “Inquiries confirmed that Shinde paid Rs5 lakh to the two gunmen to kill Jain and he was arrested by the Rajasthan police for attempt to murder. We are now working to trace and apprehend the gunmen, who are also from Dombivli. Shinde has been taken to Jaipur by the Rajasthan Police for further investigation,” John said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/37yearold-arrested-for-attempt-to-murder-in-dombivli-101624388560832.html

According to Central police, the incident occurred around 11pm on Monday in Subhash Nagar area at Ulhasnagar Camp No 3. The police said that the victim, Sachin Khedekar, 31, was a porter by profession, while his wife Shubhangi, 27, is a homemaker. Shubhangi’s brother Roshan Jadhav, who worked as a labourer, used to stay in the same locality. “Khedekar was an alcoholic and frequently assault Shubhangi on suspicions of cheating on him. Jadhav had argued with Khedekar on several occasions over this in the past, due to which relations were strained between the duo,” said senior inspector SC Suradkar from Central police station. Suradkar added that on Monday night, Khedekar started assaulting Shubhangi again after getting in an inebriated state and Jadhav, on learning about it, rushed to save his sister. Khedekar tried to attack Jadhav with a dagger and a scuffle ensued, during which Jadhav allegedly snatched the dagger from his brother-in-law and stabbed him repeatedly. “Jadhav left the blood-soaked body at the spot and went home.

23-06-2021||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: Bharadwaj seeks bail claiming illegal detention||While making submissions for Elgar Parishad accused lawyer Sudha Bharadwaj’s default bail, her counsel Yug Choudhary informed the Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday that the extension of her 90-day custody granted by the special court to Pune Police in November 2018 was not valid. He said that though there was a designated bench to hear matters under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), the state had got an extension order from a non-designated judge. In light of this, Bharadwaj’s counsel submitted that her detention of more than a year is illegal. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, while hearing the application of the activist, was informed that the accused was illegally detained since her arrest in November 2018 for more than a year. Choudhary submitted that though the Pune Police, which was initially investigating the case had secured an extension of 90 days after filing an incomplete charge sheet, it was not valid. Bharadwaj was arrested under UAPA on August 28, 2018. Choudhary further submitted that as the National Investigation Agency (NIA) was not in the picture at the time, the grievance was against the state, and Bharadwaj’s detention in Byculla women’s prison is illegal and hence, she deserved to be released on default bail. Choudhary drew the attention of the bench to the fact that though Bharadwaj was booked under UAPA, the extension of detention was granted by a judge who was not competent to hear such cases.Choudhary’s arguments were based on responses received by lawyers under the Right to Information (RTI) Act from the HC registry, which stated that sessions judge KD Vadane, who on November 26, 2018, had granted the 90-day extension to Pune Police was only a district and additional sessions judge at Pune and was not appointed as the special judge by the state government under section 22 of the NIA Act, 2008, for the period between January 2018 to July 2019.However, NIA – represented by advocate Sandesh Patil – opposed the application and said that as the agency had taken over the investigation, the grievance against the state at this stage was not maintainable. Patil also sought time of two weeks to file a reply. After hearing the submissions the bench directed NIA and the state to file their replies before July 3 and said that it would not allow any more adjournments. Bharadwaj had approached HC through her daughter last month, seeking bail on medical grounds or for providing medical treatment at a government hospital as she was suffering from various ailments and comorbidities. After the prison authorities got her the requisite treatment, the application had been disposed of.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-bharadwaj-seeks-bail-claiming-illegal-detention-101624388440219.html

23-06-2021||Lucknow||Yogi govt purchased more wheat in 4 yrs than SP, BSP did in 10 yrs: UP agriculture minister||Uttar Pradesh agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi on Tuesday launched a counterattack on the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Congress for questioning the ongoing wheat purchase at the minimum support price (MSP) in the state. He claimed that the total amount of wheat purchased from farmers during the last four years under the Yogi Adityanath government outstripped the amount of total wheat bought by the Congress-supported SP and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) governments together during their 10-year rule. “During their 10-year rule between 2007 and 2017, the SP and the BSP governments together purchased 221.07 lakh MT of wheat worth ₹26469.35 crore. Against this, the Yogi Adityanath government bought 218.86 lakh MT of wheat worth ₹39037.01 crore benefitting a record 46,34,828 farmers in just four years,” Shahi said. He said more than 56 lakh MT of wheat had already been purchased from farmers during the current procurement season alone. Former CM and SP national president Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday demanded the government to release a white paper on the wheat purchase in the state and a day later on Monday Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also raised the issue by writing a letter to CM Yogi Adityanath demanding him to ensure guaranteed wheat purchase from farmers till July 15. Accusing the SP and the Congress of doing drawing-room politics having no idea of ground realities, the minister said that the statistics clearly showed as to who was farmers’ real well-wisher. Adityanath government outperformed the SP and the BSP governments in paddy purchase as well as in payment of cane dues to farmers, he said. “Our government has purchased a record 214.56 lakh MT of paddy worth ₹37825.66 crore from 31,88,529 farmers in just four years against which the SP and the BSP governments together purchased only 238.49 lakh MT of paddy worth ₹28040.98 crore from 18,89,362 farmers in 10 years,” he pointed out. “Similarly, we have paid as much a ₹137820.96 crore to farmers as cane dues till last Saturday while SP and BSP governments paid only ₹95215 crore cane dues in 10 years,’ he added. The minister said in food grain production as well as productivity, the Adityanath government had been breaking its own record for last four years due to timely availability of good quality seeds, fertilisers and reliable power supply to farmers. Shahi said that this was because of a number of welfare measures taken by the government that the farmer’s agitation failed in UP despite all the efforts by the anti-Modi forces. “The opposition’s act of giving sermons to the Yogi Adityanath government on the issue of farmers is like showing light to the sun,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-govt-purchased-more-wheat-in-4-yrs-than-sp-bsp-did-in-10-yrs-up-agriculture-minister-101624387420174.html

But after due action with the Child Welfare Committe, all of them are converted to missing cases. It is encouraged that even for those cases that are reported to cops directly, information should be shared with us so that we can also use our resources to help these kids,” said Satya Prakash, chief operating officer, FXB India Suraksha, the NGO managing the district Childline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/20-police-teams-formed-to-probe-missing-children-cases-in-gb-nagar-101624387300777.html
23-06-2021||Noida||Noida: One more arrested in gold theft case||Noida: Police on Tuesday arrested a person in connection with the case of theft of gold bars and cash worth ₹40 crore from a flat in Greater Noida. Police said that the suspect, Pradeep, worked as a driver for the family of advocate Kislay Panday who earlier allegedly lived in the apartment.With Tuesday’s arrest, as many as seven persons have been arrested so far in the case, police said, adding that the mastermind in the case, Gopal, and his three accomplices are still at large. On Sunday, police had served a notice to the lawyer and his parents to join the investigation in the case. Police said that Pradeep knew Gopal and had shared the information of the gold consignment to him. Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, Noida, said that Pradeep had worked for Panday’s family till January 2021. “Pradeep’s interrogation revealed that his brother was known to the mastermind Gopal. Later Gopal and Pradeep also became friends. Pradeep had leaked the information of gold consignment to Gopal, who conducted the theft with other accomplices,” he said. According to police, Pradeep had received ₹5 lakh as his share from the stolen valuables. Police have recovered ₹1 lakh, two gold rings and one gold chain from his possession. Police had earlier said that the gold and cash belonged to advocate Panday, who completely denied having anything to do with the valuables. Meanwhile, police said that Panday has moved the Allahabad high court against the development. “The high court on Monday served the Noida police a notice in this case. We are going to reply to the notice in the court soon,” said the additional DCP. Panday refused to divulge details about the writ petition in the high court in this case. “I will not comment on that at this stage,” he said. He also said that he has no information about Pradeep’s arrest, and reiterated that the stolen property does not belong to him.The massive gold theft was unearthed on June 11 this year when the Sector 39 police first arrested two persons – Rajan Bhati and Arun alias Chatri – from Som Bazar in Noida. Police recovered some gold bars weighing one kilogram each from them, along with some cash. Based on information collected during their interrogation, four more suspects – Ajay Singh, Neeraj, Anil and Bittu Sharma – were arrested. In total, police recovered 13.09 kg gold and ₹57 lakh in cash from these six suspects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-one-more-arrested-in-gold-theft-case-101624387300110.html
23-06-2021||Noida||Noida groundwater table continues to deplete, over a100 tube-wells left defunct||Noida has to dig deeper to access groundwater, according to the Uttar Pradesh ground water department that completed its limited pre-monsoon assessment for the year.According to the data, which HT accessed, groundwater was deepest at the Government Degree College at 31.4 metres. Last year the same site had a depth of 30.3 metres and the year before that, it was 28.06 metres. In Sector 39, the decrease was less severe - from 30.14 metres last year to 30.82 metres.The data is limited as the department surveyed only 24 of the 84 sites in the district from where real-time data is available. This is a normal practice, and the full assessment is expected later this year. At all 24 sites, the groundwater depth showed an increase.But experts say that the data was consistent with practical experiences and showed that Noida was extracting far more water than what nature can replenish. Of the city’s requirement of 406 million litres per day, about 50% is now from the Ganga.We are extracting more, and conservation or harvesting is very less. We need to control the extraction, increase water use efficiency through technology and revive hundreds of ponds in the city. We need to use recycled water, treated water should be used for industrial and construction sector,” said city-based environmentalist Vikrant Tongad.Over the last five years, the average pre-monsoon depth increased from 9.95 metres in 2016 to 25.28 metres in 2020 - a change of 154%. For Greater Noida, the average groundwater level dropped from 6.66 metres to 12.75 metres during the same period - a change of 91.41%.The drop is visible in the number of tube wells going defunct.“Every year, we see a six to eight feet drop in the water levels in our tubewells. Of 430 tubewells we have, 120 are defunct. Out of 12 ranney wells in the city we have, only six are functional at present, rest have dried. Proper recharge, rainwater harvesting, and zero waste of water is the only way forward,” said RP Singh, deputy general manager (water), Noida Authority.There was, however, some silver lining.At Gulistanpur Primary school in Greater Noida, the groundwater level fell only by one metre to 20.5m against seven metres last year. At Greater Noida Delta-3, the level fell only by a metre against 3.59m last year.“This year, we are building water harvesting tanks at Sector 31 over 2,000 square metres, and over 2,200 square metres at Sector 2. Also, the work on rejuvenation of ponds in ongoing, and the depletion at some areas have also slowed,” Rahul Dev, junior engineer, UP Ground Water Department, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-groundwater-table-continues-to-deplete-over-a100-tube-wells-left-defunct-101624387181308.html

CCTV cameras installed on the street captured the big cat running out of a house and wandering frantically across the narrow, crowded streets. The leopard eventually made its way into a small fruit storage room and the locals managed to lock the animal inside.The incident was immediately reported to the forest department and Agra based NGO Wildlife SOS. Equipping themselves with safety nets, a trap cage and protective gear to carry out the rescue mission, a nine-member team from Wildlife SOS immediately rushed to the location accompanied by a team of forest officers. By the time the team reached the spot, over 200 people had gathered outside the storeroom. The rescue team drilled a hole in the wall of the store house to tranquilize the leopard without opening the gate. They inserted a camera through the hole to locate the leopard.The forest officers and police personnel implemented crowd control measures while Wildlife SOS veterinarian Dr S Ilayaraja immobilised the leopard using a sedative injection through the hole. The leopard was carefully transferred to a transit facility for temporary observation.Akhilesh Pandey, divisional forest officer, Agra said, “This is a densely populated area, so the leopard sighting caused a wave of panic among the residents. After deploying our team to assess the situation, we contacted Wildlife SOS for their assistance in the rescue operation. We were able to provide effective and timely intervention with their help. ”Dr Ilayaraja, deputy director of veterinary services at Wildlife SOS said “The leopard is a male, between 7 to 8 years old. Such rescue operations are highly sensitive and need careful planning in order to ensure the safety of the animal as well as of the people. With a huge crowd of over two hundred people gathered around, the rescue was extremely challenging.”“The depletion of natural prey base and habitat due to encroachment and deforestation is forcing wild animals like leopards to seek easily available prey such as poultry and livestock in human settlements. This often leads to human-leopard conflict which can have violent and brutal consequences for both humans and wildlife. We are grateful to the forest department and the police for making this rescue a success,” said Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder and CEO Wildlife SOS.Last year, Wildlife SOS assisted the forest department in the safe rescue and release of an adult leopard that was wandering across Govardhan city in Mathura.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/leopard-spotted-in-agra-s-residential-locality-rescued-101624387180771.html
23-06-2021||Noida||FASTag on Yamuna Expressway begins functioning||The FASTag system has been implemented on the 165-km long Yamuna Expressway from Tuesday. This has automated the toll collection resulting in shorter wait time at the gates.“Commuters can pay toll via FASTag in two of the three lanes on each side. One lane will be for those who do not have the system installed in their vehicles,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer (CEO) of the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida). Singh inaugurated the service at 4:30pm at the Jewar toll plaza. “The manual lane will be done away with once as per government rules and regulations.”The toll rates for two-and three-wheelers are ₹175. For cars and jeeps, it is ₹360 and for light commercial vehicles it is ₹565. FASTag was supposed to start from April 1, but the private operator Jaypee Infratech Limited (JIL) could not meet the deadline due to software issues. The system had already been implemented on all highways maintained by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). “Now the system has been integrated with NHAI server. We had installed all cameras, censors and other required equipment last week,” said a JIL spokesperson requesting anonymity.The NHAI has recently issued guidelines for toll plazas with FASTag facility which will not allow queues longer than 100 metres from the toll gates. The new guidelines aim to reduce time taken to process toll fees to just 10 seconds per vehicle, even during peak hours. The rules also say that in case a queue gets longer than 100 metres, the vehicles at the front of the queue will be allowed to pass the toll gate without having to pay toll charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/fastag-on-yamuna-expressway-begins-functioning-101624387180076.html
23-06-2021||Noida||Incidents of confusion, depression among post-Covid patients on the rise, say doctors||Sector 29 resident Nisha Jha has not been able to focus on her work even a month after she recovered from Covid-19. The 27-year-old works at an IT firm and tested positive for Covid on May 15. She underwent treatment in home isolation for about 20 days and, on June 5, she tested negative for the virus. But since then, she is plagued with confusion, forgetfulness and a lack of focus.“Not just work, I am unable to focus while driving as well. Often, I find myself forgetting familiar routes or even conversations that I may have only a couple of days ago. I told my doctor about this and was suggested to consult a psychiatrist,” said Nisha.But doctors say Nisha’s is not an isolated case. They say several people in Gautam Budh Nagar are dealing with psychological issues post recovering from Covid.Dr Abhay Tomar, psychiatrist at Government Institute of Medical Science (GIMS), Greater Noida, said his department is currently seeing at least hundred such people since mid-May.“Depression, anxiety, restlessness, sleeplessness, confusion, mood swings, forgetfulness and brain fog are some of the issues that people who recovered from Covid-19 recently have reported. Our department has seen over 100 such patients in the past one and half months,” said Dr Tomar.He said doctors are searching for a neurological correlation to such issues being reported in recovered patients. “Patients say that they find themselves lost and unable to understand what is happening around them. We are studying such patients and looking for neurological correlations to Covid-19,” he said.Dr Manu Tiwari, head and senior consultant psychiatrist, Fortis hospital in Noida, agrees that there has been a rise in such cases since May.“We have been seeing around four to five patients daily since May. While some cases are follow-ups who have been discharged from the hospital, others are those who come as new out-patients. We have seen that in such patients, the brain’s limbic system is inflamed due to which they face cognitive issues. Some patients have also reported panic attacks, trauma and anxiety spectrum issues,” said Dr Tiwari.Dr Kunal Kumar, professor and head, department of psychiatry, Sharda Hospital in Greater Noida, said many such patients do not realise that they need psychiatric care.“Often, it is the general physicians who treat such patients and when the patient complaints of psychological issues, they are referred to the psychiatric department. In some cases,there is resistance on the part of patients as they think they are being termed as ‘mentally unstable’. Whereas, they are in need of immediate attention,” said Dr Kumar. He added that their department has consulted at least 50 such cases since mid-May. “In post-Covid cases, psychiatric care is the second stage of follow-up after the pulmonological care to restore a patient’s respiratory strength,” Dr Kumar said.Dr DK Gupta, chairman, Felix Hospital, Noida, said some studies have shown that in a few recovered patients, there is a loss of grey matter. The hospital has seen around 20 such patients in the past 15 days.“Grey matter deals with the cognitive functions of a person such as memory and analysis. There have been studies that have found that brain neurons were damaged due to the coronavirus infection,” said Dr Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/incidents-of-confusion-depression-among-post-covid-patients-on-the-rise-say-doctors-101624387120769.html
23-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra administers record 552,921 Covid-19 vaccine jabs||Maharashtra on Tuesday achieved its highest single-day Covid-19 vaccination figure of 552,921 jabs after the state opened the drive for all adults. “Maharashtra is leading the nation, in terms of vaccinations, as it has administered more than 28,697,948 doses to its citizens till date,” said Dr Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary, state health department. The previous highest single-day total was 534,372 doses on April 26. Meanwhile, for a second consecutive day, more than 100,000 doses were administered in Mumbai, despite the drive not being for all above 18 years of age. The civic body said vaccination for 18+ will start in the city from today. Also on Tuesday, the state recorded 8,470 new Covid-19 cases, including 568 in Mumbai. The city witnessed 10 deaths with its toll reaching 15,315. There were 216,861 tests done on Tuesday, while the number of recoveries clocked was 9,043.Maharashtra’s tally of active cases currently stands at 123,340, while the total number of deaths has reached 118,795. Mumbai has 18,432 active infections, followed by Pune at 16,955 active cases. The state, which was allowing vaccinations for only those above 30 years of age, on Monday decided to widen the scope to 18+, starting Tuesday. Many social groups also joined in this drive as they set up vaccination centres across the state to aid the state in its drive. The Chandrakant Kotecha Trust organised camps in various places in Mumbai. “We plan to vaccinate at least 10,000 slum dwellers for free in Bhandup,” said Mihir Kotecha, president of the trust.Currently, the state has a stock of around 1,500,000 doses which will be enough for three-and-a-half days. “Till Monday, only those who are 30 years and above were allowed to get inoculated in Maharashtra, but to give a boost to the vaccination drive, we have approved vaccination for all adults,” said Rajesh Tope, Maharashtra health , on Monday. ““I want to urge the youths from Maharashtra to go to the nearest centre and get vaccinated as they are allowed to take it,” he added.The state government had started its drive for beneficiaries in the 18-45 age group on May 1 after it was allowed by the Centre. However, it was suspended owing to the non-availability of vaccine doses on May 12.Meanwhile, chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, while reviewing the functioning of the state education department, has asked officials to check whether it was possible to start classes for Classes 10 and 12 in those villages that are Covid-19 free. He said officials need to ensure that Covid-19 rules are followed in such places. Thackeray also agreed to the proposal of free education from Classes 1 to 10 for those children who lost their parents to Covid-19.(input from Mehul Thakkar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-administers-record-552-921-covid-19-vaccine-jabs-101624387120050.html

Officials said that over 80% eligible people in the block got Covid-19 jabs on Tuesday. District magistrate Suhas LY said that taking lessons from the shortcomings on the inaugural day of the trial run, which is a precursor to the mass vaccination drive from July 1, the health department officials on Tuesday properly informed the villagers about the near-to-home vaccination. Apart from Jewar, the trial run is also being conducted in Dadri block. “From a meagre turnout of 22% in Jewar block on Monday, we achieved over 80% of the target today as more than 1,600 people out of 2,000 received their jabs. Similarly, we vaccinated 2,700 people out of 3,000 in Dadri,” he said. On Monday, about 550 beneficiaries out of 2,500 had received jabs in Jewar. However, Dadri block had witnessed a decent turnout with 2,700 (target of 3,000) getting Covid shots. The DM also said that over 16,000 people were inoculated at 76 government vaccination centres working on Tuesday. “It was more than today’s target of 14,000. Overall 23,298 persons received their shots today at all vaccination centres, including 44 in private hospitals of the district. To take the mega vaccination drive beginning July 1 to the highest level, the officials have been asked to mobilise the villagers and coordinate with residents’ welfare associations, village pradhan, ward members, and anganwadi and accredited social health activist (ASHA) workers. In this drive, we’ll try to give at least one dose of vaccine to all eligible residents over 18 years in the district,” he said. Prasun Dwivedi, sub-divisional magistrate (Sadar), said a meeting of tehsil task force was held on Tuesday to chalk out a blueprint for vaccination of everyone over 18 years in Greater Noida from July 1. “We have properly coordinated with various residential bodies, village pradhans, ward members and anganwadi workers, among others, to increase numbers for upcoming vaccination,” he said. Health officials said that a total of about 1.04 million doses have been given in the district so far. “While 923,584 people have taken their first dose, 120,519 have taken their both the doses. The participation of women in the vaccination drive is also as per our expectations, which is nearly 45% of the total vaccinations,” said Dr Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer, GB Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/neartohome-vaccination-centres-in-jewar-see-over-80-turnout-101624387060067.html

23-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: 2,800 IIT-B students, staff get shots in campus Covid vax drive||Around 2,800 students, faculty and staff members have been inoculated in the Covid-19 vaccine camp held at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B).Following demand from the student community, IIT-B kicked off a three-day vaccination drive on Monday. “We are expecting another 1,400 people to be vaccinated on the third day,” said Tapanendu Kundu, dean, student affairs and chief organiser of the vaccination drive, which is being held in partnership with private hospitals.“Beneficiaries of the vaccine drive have to pay the government charges of ₹780. For students, the same is adjusted from the hostel fees paid by them,” Kundu added. The student community had been demanding free vaccines for all students on campus. There are around 3,000 students on campus currently. Last week the institute had informed students that a workplace vaccination drive would be held and students would have to pay ₹1,000 plus taxes.The institute had also sought help from its alumni network to fund the vaccination drive. While students are allowed to get their vaccine shots from any government centres outside the campus, they have to complete a 14-day quarantine upon their return to campus. This rule discouraged students from seeking vaccine appointments off-campus.While the institute’s hospital on campus is registered as a government vaccination centre for Covid-19 vaccines, it had initially not been able to procure vaccine doses. Now, the hospital vaccinates only those above 45 years of age.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-2-800-iit-b-students-staff-get-shots-in-campus-covid-vax-drive-101624386941255.html

We then tightly hold the two-inch thick plastic rope and slowly move towards the other side of the river,” said Sagar Bhawar, a student. In one trip, six students stand as they cannot sit without risking their balance. The students carry spare clothes in their bags in case their uniforms get wet, especially during the monsoon. The wet clothes are laid out in the school to dry. The distance between the two banks is 600m and it takes around 35 minutes to get from one side of the river to other on the makeshift boat.The boat trips sees the parents praying for the safe return of their children, even as the 21-year demand of the villagers for a bridge remains in limbo. The inaction has forced many villagers to send their children to other government schools. “Since 2000, the locals have been demanding a bridge, but the proposal has just gathered dust. We have to circumvent 25km on land to reach the other side and are forced to hire private vehicles at high rates as MSRTC buses are irregular,” said Shailesh Karmode, zilla parishad member.“I have sent countless reminders to the public works department (PWD), but till date I only got empty assurances. The cost of the bridge is ₹6 crore and till date the PWD has not sanctioned the proposal. The PWD has also done many surveys at the spot, but there is still no sign of the bridge till date,” said Karmode.Vinod Nikole, MLA from Dahanu, said, “I will again actively take up the bridge proposal during the next Assembly session and hopefully get the budgetary grant from the PWD.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dahanu-students-risk-lives-in-makeshift-boat-to-reach-school-101624386940714.html

Mayor Kishori Pednekar who visited the patient on Tuesday confirmed the development. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has ordered an inquiry into the incident.Srinivas Yellapa, a 24-year-old patient, was admitted to the hospital after complaints of respiratory issues. After being admitted to the hospital, he was also diagnosed with brain and liver damage and was then shifted to the ICU. Later, on Tuesday, his relatives noticed that the patient was bleeding from the eye. After examining his eyes, it was revealed that a rat had bitten the lower part of the eye.However, the doctors from the hospital claimed that the injuries were ‘superficial’ and the patient’s eye has not been affected.Dr Vidya Thakur, dean, Rajawadi Hospital, said that the patient has been treated. “The ward is on the ground floor where some garbage was disposed of, and rats might have come from there.” Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said they have ordered an inquiry in the rat incident and have asked for a report with immediate effect. “We have taken all required steps to prevent such incidents,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rat-nibbles-icu-patient-s-eye-mumbai-civic-body-orders-inquiry-101624386940101.html
23-06-2021||Noida||Work on oxygen plants may stretch to mid-August in Ghaziabad||The work on 10 oxygen generation plants to meet the medical requirement of the district may extend to the mid-August, the officials of the Ghaziabad district administration said on Tuesday. The plants are proposed to be set up with the help of local area development funds of legislators and also from the funds of corporate social responsibility (CSR). The officials after a review meeting said the oxygen plant at ESIC Hospital and the one at Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital will be ready by June 30, while the plant at MMG District Hospital is likely to be ready by July 7. Earlier, officials of the health department had said all plants were likely to be ready by June 30. “We have asked the respective agencies to expedite the construction/installation work. Two plants will be ready before June 30 while five will be ready in July. The work on the remaining three is likely to get over by mid-August. Since most of the plants are being set up using CSR funds, vendors have started the work, but face difficulties as they have several such orders coming in,” said RK Singh, district magistrate. The 10 plants are proposed at ESCI Hospital at Sahibabad , Combined District Hospital in Sanjay Nagar, District Women’s Hospital, one each at four community health centres of Loni, Muradnagar, Modinagar and Dasna, one at the primary health centre in Bhojpur and two at the MMG district hospital. The decision to set up new oxygen plants was taken after the city faced an oxygen crisis during the second wave of Covid-19 from mid-April to mid-May. Families of Covid and non-Covid patients had a tough time arranging oxygen cylinders and oxygen beds for their kin in hospitals. “Most of the plants are of a capacity of over 200 litres per minute. The orders that were placed before May 29 are as is -- they have a capacity of 150-200 litres per minute. The plants proposed after May 29 are of 300 litres per minute capacity. The new plants will boost our medical oxygen capacity,” Singh said. On May 29, the state officials sent a communication to all district magistrates and divisional commissioners directing that the quality of plants be maintained. The communication further added that if purchase orders for plants were sanctioned, they should be fitted with equipment of 150 lites per minute, or more, capacity. The health department officials said one oxygen bed requires about 10 lites per minute of oxygen while one bed (with ventilator) requires about 24 litres per minute of oxygen supply. “With 10 new plants, we will be able to fully oxygenate 364 beds in government facilities at MMG district hospital, ESIC Hospital, Sanjay Nagar combined district hospital and the women’s hospital. The new oxygen plants will be of great help in case a third wave hits the country,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. The Ghaziabad district at present has 3,410 beds for Covid-19 patients, which include 2,674 oxygen beds in 50 private and eight government hospitals. The overall bed availability also includes 769 ICU beds and 229 ventilator beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/work-on-oxygen-plants-may-stretch-to-mid-august-inghaziabad-101624386880665.html
23-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Covid vax scam: Beneficiaries got fake Covid shots, say cops||The Kandivli police, investigating the vaccination scam, believe that what was administered to 390 members of Hiranandani Heritage society, 150 employees of Matchbox Pictures, employees and students of Aditya College and several others Covid at the unauthorised vaccination camps were not Covid vaccines at all, but something else said police officers.“We really cannot say what it was, in absence of forensic laboratory reports, but we are certain that those were not Covid vaccines,” said a police officer privy with the investigation.The police officer said the main accused Mahendra Singh, who got alerted after the scam was reported to us, has destroyed his mobile phone and other evidence, which might have revealed what the bottles contained.“We have just found the broken screen of Singh’s mobile. We are now looking for other evidence like the vaccination vials and bottles which were reported to be opened during the camp at Hiranandani Heritage.The officer added that they were also surprised by the fact that none of the 390 members of Hiranandani Heritage reported any symptoms or side effects after getting the purported Covishield shots.“The civic body (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) has denied providing any vaccination to the arrested accused, however, we believe that if the bottles had the actual vaccine, it was procured by Dr Manish Tripathi who is the sixth accused and is still absconding,” added the officer.Mahendra Singh had approached Hiranandani Heritage Residents Welfare Association (HHRWS), a managing body representing three buildings in the residential complex at Kandivli (West), and offered to set up a vaccination camp aided by Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, Andheri.On May 30, 390 members were administered the vaccines. But they weren’t registered on the centralised Co-WIN portal, as per the rules. After seven-eight days, the residents started getting messages about their vaccination certificates. But to their surprise, they were issued certificates from two private hospitals— Nanavati Max Super Speciality and Lifeline hospitals — and the civic-run NESCO jumbo centre, Goregaon, which does not even hold vaccination in societies.The society members got suspicious about the camp after they got certificates from different hospitals, other than Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, and reported the matter to the police.The police have so far arrested five persons in connection with the vaccination scam. The five men are identified as Mahendra Kuldip Singh, 39, Sanjay Gupta, 34, Chandan Singh, 32, Nitin Mode, 32 and Karim Ali, 21. Police officers said they have confessed to having organised such camps in nine other societies before holding a camp at Hiranandani Heritage.The Khar police on Monday night registered the third FIR in the vaccination scam. Based on a complaint lodged by Tips Industries Ltd. police have booked Rajesh Pandey, Sanjay Gupta and four others. According to the police 206 employees of Tips Industries and their family members were administered alleged fake vaccines by the group by charging them ₹2,84,696. The Khar police have booked the six men for cheating and endangering the lives of the beneficiaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-covid-vax-scam-beneficiaries-got-fake-covid-shots-say-cops-101624386880035.html
23-06-2021||Mumbai||Consider marking homeless mentally ill with vaccination tattoos, HC tells Maharashtra govt||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the state government to consider marking mentally challenged, homeless persons with a permanent tattoo after vaccinating them, to identify them as inoculated. The suggestions came after the petitioner informed the court that such persons neither have any identity document nor are mentally sound to inform the concerned authorities on whether they have been vaccinated or not. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) of actor and model TJ Bhanu, was informed by advocates Sarosh Bharucha and Shrey Fatterpekar that the petition was filed to ensure that homeless persons including those suffering from mental illness are given vaccines along with related post-vaccination care which is in line with the Central government’s guideline. The counsels submitted that the homeless, especially, those who suffered from mental illnesses were not aware of their condition and are usually seen roaming around aimlessly on the streets. The advocates averred that as such persons did not have any identification document on themselves nor were they in a position to give consent for vaccination, hence it was up to the state and Centre to come up with some mechanism to ensure that these persons are vaccinated. The advocates also suggested that a biometric system should be put in place so that a record of whether such persons were vaccinated and if vaccinated when and where they received the jab is maintained. Additional government pleader for the state informed the bench that the state was following the guidelines laid down by the centre in this regard. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh also confirmed that the state was required to follow the guidelines for vaccination issued with regards to the homeless, pavement dwellers and people with an unsound mind. After hearing the submissions the bench concurred with the submissions of the petitioner and said that it was usual to see mentally unsound persons wandering on the streets and as they were wont to wander from one area to another it was difficult to keep track of them. The bench however observed that it was the state’s responsibility to have a system to maintain a record of the jabs administered to such persons and hence rather than putting a mark with marking devices would be useless as the same would get wiped off after a few days. The court suggested that instead, the state should think of some tattoo that would not only show whether the person has been vaccinated or not but also the number of jabs received by them.The bench then asked the state to submit data of the number of such persons already vaccinated in the state and posted a hearing of the PIL after two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/consider-marking-homeless-mentally-ill-with-vaccination-tattoos-hc-tells-maharashtra-govt-101624386820612.html
23-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: 1.5 lakh beneficiaries give second dose a miss||Almost 1.5 lakh beneficiaries in the state, including 40,000 in Mumbai, have not taken their second vaccine jab. A majority comprise healthcare workers (HCWs) and frontline workers (FLWs) who were the first to be vaccinated at the beginning of the mass immunisation programme in January, said public health officials. Doctors said giving the second dose a skip could hamper efforts to protect the populace from Covid-19.Both vaccines — Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII) have two shots. The trial phase for each of the two-dose vaccines showed that after a certain time, the rate of immunity to Covid-19 plateaued with just one dose but the second dose helped boost the immunity further.However, lack of awareness and fear among citizens is holding back many first time beneficiaries from taking the second shot, which is mandatory as per the Union Health Ministry’s guidelines.“Almost 1.5 lakh beneficiaries who took the first dose and were scheduled to take the second dose have missed their appointment dates. We are trying to reach, counsel and motivate them to take the second shot which will boost their immunity further,” said Dr Archana Patil, director of Maharashtra health and service.The second dose of Covishield is given after 12 weeks of the first jab and the second dose of Covaxin is given after four-six weeks after the first dose.In the state, so far, 2.8 crore people have been vaccinated of which 37 lakh have taken the second dose on their scheduled time. But it has been observed that most of the defaulters are HCWs and FLWs. “We are also taking help from ASHA workers to reach these defaulters and talk to them. We need to understand the reason why they aren’t taking the second dose,” said Dr Dilip Patil, state immunisation officer.In Mumbai, around 40,000 beneficiaries haven’t taken the second dose. The Covid-19 ward war rooms are contacting the defaulters.Various reasons have been cited for the default—the presumption that one dose is adequate, fear of side effects from the second dose.“As known, after inoculation, some develop minor side effects like fever and body ache. This often discourages them from taking the second shot. But having minor health issues are good signs which indicate that the vaccine is effective,” said Dr Mohan Joshi, dean of Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital, also known as Sion Hospital.Witnessing a low turnout among HCWs and FLWs for the second dose, recently, the central government has directed all the state government and union territories to speedily vaccinate these groups.With multiple mutations of Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, doctors insist on taking the second dose as, at present, it is the only protective shield to fight against the pandemic.“No vaccine provides 100% protection but, it has been observed that infection among people with two shots has been mild. The death rate among fully immunised beneficiaries is limited across the state. Though, we still don’t know how the present vaccines would be effective on the mutated viruses, but, skipping the second dose won’t do any help,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, part of the Covid-19 task force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-1-5-lakh-beneficiaries-give-second-dose-a-miss-101624386820060.html
23-06-2021||Lucknow||State rivers breach banks, flood waters cut off 70 villages||Some 70 villages in the north-western part of the state have been cut off from the district headquarters due to the rising water levels in rivers following heavy rainfall in recent days.Most of these villages fall in the districts of Moradabad, Sambhal, Amroha, some parts of Rampur, Pilibhit and areas of Lakhimpur, bordering Nepal. “My house has been submerged under nine feet of water. All our belongings have been destroyed. We somehow managed to leave the village,” Sadiq Khan of Khaddar area said that Amroha has been hit worst by the flood. Khan and his family of five are currently putting up with relatives in Amroha city.In the Moradabad region, at least 30 villages have been cut off due to the flooding of connecting roads. “Some villages in Thakurdwar, Kanth and Bilari have been affected largely by the rise in the level of the Ram Ganga, which flows through the district,” Shailendra Kumar, district magistrate, Moradabad, said. Likewise, the rise in the level of the Sharda, which passes through some parts of Pilibhit and Lakimpir Khiri, has caused flooding in surrounding low-lying areas.In Pilibhit, some 14 villages located in the north and east of the district have been cut off from the district headquarters. The number of such villages is double in Lakhimpur Kheri district.The districts are yet to compile the damage caused by the flooding. However, flood water has submerged large swathes of farmland with the paddy crop standing in the districts. Several hectares of land near river banks has also eroded due to strong flow of water.In wake of a possible disaster, the respective district administrations have sprung to action. “We have set up around 20 flood relief posts in the areas susceptible to flooding. These posts are coordinating with the district administration on how to provide relief to people in affected villages,” said Pulkit Khare, district magistrate, Pilibhit.The district administrations have also set up relief camps where inhabitants are provided food, shelter and medical care.“Teams of the State Disaster Management Authority have also been pressed in to conduct relief operations. The teams are working in tandem with other departments. Additional personnel can also be called if needed but the situation is being handled well by our current staff,” Khare said.Rivers flowing over the danger markFour major rivers – Ganga, Ram Ganga, Sharda and Kuawno – were flowing close to the danger mark on Tuesday, updates from the Flood Management Information System Centre (FMISC) revealed. According to these updates, the Sharda in Palia, Lakihmpur was recorded to be flowing 0.1 metre above the danger mark. The river is followed by the Ghaghra and the Ram Ganga which were recorded to be flowing 0.8metres and 0.5 metres above danger mark in Barabanki and Moradabad, respectively.Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Bijnor districts on alert as Ganga threatensExcess water released from the Bijnor barrage, into the Ganga, flooded fields of standing crops in many villages of the Meerut, Muzaffarnagar and Bijnor districts. Many villages were put on alert due to the release of excess water into the Ganga.FMISC data put the water level of the Ganga at Kachala, in Badaun, 0.1 metre above the danger mark.Irrigation department chief engineer Mahesh Chand said that 4.2 lakh cusecs of water was released in the Ganga from the Bijnor barrage after heavy rainfall in the hills. Bijnor, Meerut and Muzaffarnagar districts were put on alert.He said that though the water entered the fields in a large area in district Bijnor, no loss of life was reported, adding that officials were on alert and motorboats and divers were ready to meet any eventuality. “The excess water released from the barrage has now passed downstream, therefore, the level of water in the river is returning to normal,” he said. “Only 40,000 cusecs of water was released from the Hardwar barrage on Tuesday,” he added.Excess water in the river damaged embankments near village Sirjopur, in Hastinapur area of Meerut district on Sunday, flooding fields in many villages.Meerut district magistrate K Balaji visited the villages situated on the banks of the Ganga and reviewed preparations to control the flood-like situation.”Receding level of water in the river has resulted in decrease of water in the fields at some places and the situation is under control,” Balaji said, and added that officials have been put on alert to ensure safety of villagers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/state-rivers-breach-banks-flood-waters-cut-off-70-villages-101624386702399.html
23-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Vaccination for all above 18+ from today||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Tuesday said that vaccination for all above the age of 18 years will restart on Wednesday in the city, over 40 days after the drive was suspended owing to the shortage of vaccine doses.The Maharashtra government has allowed vaccination for all above 18 years of age from Tuesday. However, the BMC on Tuesday said it will start vaccination from Wednesday or Thursday owing to the arrangements required for the same.According to civic body officials, to start vaccination for all above the age of 18 years, crowding will be a major concern, hence the BMC did not start vaccination for all above 18 from Tuesday to undertake preparations for the same. The civic body officials said that daily 50% of slots will be available through online booking and the rest slots will be for walk-in. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC said, “Vaccination for all above 18 years of age will start in the city from Wednesday. We have given around 150 doses in each centre for the 18-45 age group. Initially, it will be limited for now and going ahead we will increase the doses as the response increases and we get more stock.”Kakani added, “Vaccination across all age groups will be conducted at all vaccination centres to ensure there is no crowding. We had initially thought to designate centres on basis of age groups but we think this might result in crowding.” However, according to BMC officials, if there is crowding at centres, they will develop a mechanism to control the same. As of Tuesday, BMC says they have vaccine stock that will last for around five days.Every vaccination centre is given 200 to 300 vaccine doses as per the demand and usage. Currently, there are 380 active vaccination centres in the city, of which, 268 are active civic-run centres, 20 centres are of state and Central government, and the remaining 92 are private vaccination centres.The BMC had from Saturday started vaccination for the 30 to 44 age group based on getting permission from the state government. On the second consecutive day, more than 100,000 vaccine doses were administered in the city. On Tuesday, 113,135 vaccine doses were administered in the city. Overall, since January 16, 4,684,050 vaccine doses have been administered in the city. The BMC had suspended vaccination for the 18 to 45 age group on May 12, around 12 days after the drive was started on May 1. At that time, the reason for the suspension of the vaccination was owing to the shortage of vaccine doses. However, now as the Central government has announced to supply 75% of the vaccine requirement, the civic body hopes to resume drive for all above 18 years of age in the coming days.Meanwhile, the BMC has also decided to vaccinate on priority “potential super spreaders” or those who are in touch with multiple people daily, to control the spread of Covid-19, amid the threat of a third wave. This category includes autorickshaw and taxi drivers, hawkers, delivery executives, restaurant staff, daily wage workers, among others. However, with the decision to allow vaccination for all above 18 years of age, the plan to vaccinate potential super spreaders will be put on hold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-vaccination-for-all-above-18-from-today-101624386701847.html
23-06-2021||Other||Doyens of medical service: BJ Medical College in Pune celebrates 75th foundation day||The Byramjee Jeejeebhoy Medical College (BJMC), which is attached to Sassoon General Hospital, is celebrating its 75th foundation day on Wednesday, June 23. The hospital has played a pivotal role in providing tertiary care to not just residents of Pune, but also to districts in the state. Students from BJMC are recognised internationally for their published work in international journals and medical services provided by them at the hospital.The hospital had played a crucial role during the 2009 Swine flu outbreak and even now, before PMC could upgrade its hospitals with ventilators and tertiary care, Sassoon was the only government hospital providing tertiary care to Covid-19 patients. Dr Shashikala Sangle, aged 64, retired on May 31. She has been associated with the hospital for the past 45 years since she was a student and headed the department of Medicine. Dr Sangle said, “BJMC has definitely carved its niche as being reputed for generating the most honest and hardworking alumni and staff. I had a student who wanted to study further in the US and her examiners who saw her report and saw the BJMC name, without any further questions admitted her. The decades of hard work has earned this name. BJ has produced many important medical research works.”Dr Sangle also describes the Swine flu outbreak period. She said, “When we look at it in retrospect, Swine flu was not as big as Covid-19. We were able to manage it in just one building. However, with Covid-19, the sheer numbers and the complications and also the post Covid-19 complications are a bigger challenge. However, even during the pandemic our cardiac catheterisation lab was functioning smoothly and also chemotherapy of cancer patients continued. We took all due precautions and tests and ensured that other vital routine treatments are not hampered.”While the hospital was founded in 1867, the BJ Medical school was founded in 1871, after completing 75 years, the school was expanded to BJ Medical College in 1946. Right from its foundation till now the hospital has been supported through charities and CSR funds form the community and philanthropists. On June 23, 1946, BJ Medical College was founded and Dr B. G Kher, head of the Bombay government, laid the foundation stone. The college has been named after Parsi philanthropist Byramjee Jeejeebhoy who donated the land in 1871. The medical course of MBBS was affiliated to the University of Poona (Pune) in 1949.Some of the historic moments in the hospital include the birth of Avtar Meher Baba who was born in the old maternity ward in the hospital, and the father of the nation, Mahatma, Gandhi who was operated upon for emergency appendectomy in 1924 by a British surgeon Col Murdoch with an Indian anaesthetist Dr Datey in attendance. The main building of BJMC was inaugurated by Dr Radha Krishnan in 1952. The first Principal of the BJ Medical College, which started with 50 students, was Dr BB Dikshit, a renowned academicianAnnually 200 students are admitted for MBBS and 143 for post-graduation. At any given time, now, 1,700 students are on the campus with more than 2,000 staff including 268 faculty members. Presently, courses of MBBS, MD, MS, PhD, Diplomas, MCh (CVTS), MSc, GNM, BSc Nursing, DMLT, PGDMCH, and PGDGM are offered here.Some of the path-breaking research works by the college are Dr Dikshit’s work on the role of acetylcholine in sleep and Dr Bhende’s discovery of the Bombay blood group. The hospital also has its name in the Jablonski’s Dictionary of syndromes, for the syndrome discovered, by Dr Ganla and Dr MJ Narsimhan.In the last two decades, the colleges has been sought out by many research institutes including Department of Science & technology (DST), Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Outreach services in mental health, preventive medicine, human reproduction research, tribal research, through national agencies like ICMR, and international agencies like WHO and UNICEF got underway. With the initiation of large-scale research projects the Institutional Ethics Committee was born. The Infosys super speciality building on the campus is catering to super speciality services for patients.A six-week extended nevirapine (SWEN) study was conducted with this grant over the period of 2002-2007 for prevention of mother to infant transmission of HIV. This landmark study was published in Lancet (2008), which led to modification of guidelines by WHO for prevention of mother to infant transmission of HIV in breastfeeding population in resource poor areas. This gave BJMC the capability of international grade research.After this successful demonstration of research capability, NIH USA granted Clinical Trial Unit to BJMC in collaboration with JHU for 2008-2014. BJMC-JHU application in response to RFA of NIH was among the first five amongst applications from all over the world.In 2005, through the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) the HIV treatment center (ART) was started giving treatment free of charge. Presently more than 24,000 HIV infected patients are registered in the ART centre and 12,000 are on free ART. BJMC is recognised Government TB treatment centre with 4,000 tuberculosis patients/suspects per year.BJMC and Sassoon helped fight the 2009 H1N1 (Swine Flu) outbreak in Pune and Maharashtra. In February 2010, BJ also promptly handled the casualties of German Bakery bomb blast. Prominent community donations include food for all patients prepared by donation from the Shrimant Dagadusheth Halwai Ganapati Trust and the hospital has also contributed when it provided complete medical coverage to the athletes who participated in 30th Asian Athletics Games at Balewadi, Pune.Dr Murlidhar Tambe, dean BJMC said, “Unfortunately, due to Covid-19, we cannot celebrate it as a grand event. However, the hospital has proven its worth in time. For our 2025 vision board we had proposed a Cancer hospital, a dental college, physiotherapy college and multiple super-specialities, for which we have submitted our proposal to the government. Hopefully, we get approval for some. The research work of students from BJMC has been recognised globally and also the care provided by our staff and students is noteworthy. Now is the time to expand and introduce new courses of UG and PG in various faculties.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/doyens-of-medical-service-bj-medical-college-celebrates-75th-foundation-day-101624386701228.html
23-06-2021||Lucknow||Another teacher who used papers of Anamika Shukla to get job arrested||Yet another teacher, who got the job of a science teacher at the government-run Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBV) chain by using the name and academic records of Anamika Shukla, was arrested from Lucknow by Rae Bareli police on Monday after a chase of over 12 months, said senior police officials here on Tuesday.A senior police official privy to the investigation said one Manjesh Kumari alias Anjali was arrested on connection with an FIR lodged against her for getting job in the KGBV at Bachhrawa, Rae Bareli on June 6, 2020. He said Manjesh Kumar was among the many imposter teachers who misused record and identity of one Anamika Shukla to get job at KGBVs.The official said as many as six women had been arrested for impersonating as Anamika Shukla in the matter so far. He said the UP Special Task Force (STF) investigation had earlier revealed that a woman having name of Anamika Shukla found enrolled in 25 KGBV schools in different districts across the state.He said the racket was exposed after the arrest of a woman posing as Anamika Shukla working as a teacher at Faridpur KGBV in Kasganj district for the past 13 months in January 2020.Interestingly, the probe revealed that several proxy teachers using the identity of Anamika Shukla are employed in KGBVs in different cities and was drawing salaries accordingly.The state basic education department had later registered nine FIRs in as many districts on suspicion that proxy teachers were using the documents of Anamika Shukla to obtain jobs.The official said Manjesh Kumar went missing after resigning from the job on May 26, 2020, when the basic education department sent notice to present her documents. He said the department thereafter lodged the FIR against her. She was missing since then. He said the Rae Bareli police had even announced the reward of ₹15,000 on her arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/another-teacher-who-used-papers-of-anamika-shukla-to-get-job-arrested-101624386700662.html

The civic body announced that around 53 centres would be operational for 18-plus age group beneficiaries. Each centre will have 100 doses.Announcing the restart of the drive, which was shut down shortly after it began in May, Pune Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “The vaccination for 18-year olds will be done in a comprehensive manner. As announced by PM Modi, corona vaccination will be started in the city and the campaign will be implemented on a large scale. All the systems of PMC are ready for this.”Mohol said that vaccination for citizens above 18 years of age is an important step for Pune. He added, “The city of Pune is at the forefront of vaccination, but the new vaccination policy will give a big boost to the fight against corona. Considering the number and prevalence of citizens above 18 years of age in the city, the corporation has planned the vaccination.”Mohol added, “On the first day, we are vaccinating at 53 centres and 100 Covishield vaccines have been made available at each centre. At each of the centres, 70 per cent doses have been made available to the citizens who have made online appointment bookings, while 30 per cent doses have been made available for on-spot registration. Online registration will start at 8 am on Wednesday.”While the vaccination at government centres was stopped shortly after it was started on May 1 for those aged above 18 years, private hospitals continued with the drive and have vaccinated thousands till now. “On April 26, 0.534 million people were vaccinated on the same day,” said additional chief secretary of the Health Department, Dr Pradip Vyas.Meanwhile, the state saw more than 0.552 million citizens vaccinated on Tuesday, which is the highest so far, said Tope. Till date, more than 28.5 million people have been vaccinated. Today, 0.552 million citizens were vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/53-vax-centres-operational-for-18-plus-age-group-with-100-doses-each-101624386700103.html

Residents and an NGO filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in the Bombay High Court on the issue of pollution at Vaikunth crematorium.The PMC Standing Committee approved a proposal to conduct a study and audit of the crematorium and give recommendations to minimise the pollution. The committee has approved ₹17 lakh for the project involving NEERI.Hemant Rasane, chairman, standing committee, said, “PMC requested CSIR-NEERI to inspect and perform amn assessment of the air pollution control system at Vaikunth crematorium and suggest if any modification is needed to improve the air quality. We have set a six-month deadline for them to submit the report to the PMC.”Shriniwas Kandul, additional city engineer, electrical department of the corporation, said, “The corporation has taken precautions to control pollution at Vaikunth crematorium, however, due to PIL filed, the court has given directives to take necessary measures to control pollution. So, the corporation has taken the decision to appoint NEERI to conduct a study and submit a report with recommendations.”He added, “The recommendations will be implemented at Vaikunth crematorium as well as at other crematoriums in the city to control the air pollution.”Of the 24 cremation facilities in the city, 10 are electric and 13 are operated on gas. Three crematoria have both electrical and gas facilities.Meanwhile, residents in the neighbourhood of Vaikunth crematorium have registered complaints of air pollution due to a spike in cremations of Covid fatalities.

However, the compulsion of RT-PCR tests and different protocols at different tourist sites is making people looking for a holiday cautious.With Covid positive cases declining every day, citizens have already started planning holiday. Along with tourists allowed in Lonavla, Khandala, Panchgani, and Mahableshwar, states like Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan are also allowing tourists to enter their states.“Leh-Ladakh is receiving too many inquiries and the package rate has also gone down as flight rates are cheaper. Many people are also preferring weekend trips to Lonavala and Mahableshwar, both of which are sold out,” said Ashwin Kardekar, director, My Travelogue Holidays. Packages to Ladakh, which generally cost ₹50,000 for a couple, are now ₹40,000.“Many people are also not planning to travel immediately, but they doing booking for July and August,” added Kardekar.Uttrakhand, Goa, Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir have still banned the entry for the tourists.“My most preferred is road trip to Goa, but with restrictions in place we are planning a trip to Rajasthan. My family has taken the first dose of the vaccination, but Rajasthan allows entry to tourists who are fully vaccinated (both doses), or you need to carry a RT PCR negative report. We will get the RT-PCR test done,” said Sanjay Jadhav, a Nigdi resident.Most of the tourist spots are asking for RT-PCR negative reports. Travelling agents are informing clients about dos and don’ts of respective tourist spots before completion of bookings.“Our Andaman trip is long pending and we have planned it in the first week of July. I feel an island is safer than other destinations. RT-PCR test negative report is mandatory,” said Rucha Shah, Kothrud resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tour-bookings-to-tourist-spots-increase-as-second-covid-wave-wanes-101624386641192.html
23-06-2021||Other||1,600 on waiting list for donation of kidneys in Pune: ZTCC||PUNE As many as 1,600 patients are on the recipients’ waiting list for donation of kidneys alone. A drastic drop in organ donations is being registered so far, this year.Doctors and patients have been wary of accepting organs from cadavers for fear of the Covid infection. This year, there have been 13 donors until June 2021. In 2018, there were a total of 61 cases of organ donations, and 63 in 2019.Despite the efforts of the Zonal Transplant Coordination Centre (ZTCC), Pune, to raise awareness using social media and an interactive website, lockdown has made it difficult to find organ donors.“The ongoing pandemic has exacerbated the crisis further, as it instils fear in the minds of people who come forward to donate their organs. Organ donors, as well as receivers, are a bit hesitant due to additional tests whereupon even the smallest speck of a shadow over a lung can cause the organ to be rejected,” said Dr Shailesh Kakade, nephrologist and consultant with Jupiter hospital.According to Arti Gokhale, central co-ordinator, ZTCC, Pune, “In 2020 from January to December we had 41 organ donors, but this year from January 2021 till today, we have had only 13. This is the impact of the second wave of covid. There is a distinct drop in the number of patients in hospitals. Usually, organ donations come through if it is a traffic accident, or intracranial bleeding or a sudden brain injury,” said Gokhale.According to ZTCC, there are 1,600 patients waiting for a kidney transplant, 75 for a liver transplant, 50 for heart and lung transplants, and 70 patients in waiting for multi-visceral organs.Though the figures seem drastic, ZTCC is hopeful that with this unlock, things will improve. “In February this year, as Covid cases started rising, our transplant programme was put on hold. For the last two weeks we have started the programme again. Norms have been set for transplants with precautions, so that patients don’t get infected by Covid. Covid rates will further go down with vaccination,” Dr SM Ambike, nephrologist, Jehangir Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/1600-on-waiting-list-for-donation-of-kidneys-in-pune-ztcc-101624386640603.html
23-06-2021||Pune||Expert concerns leave Rajgad fort ropeway project in knots||PUNE Environment experts, fort conservationists, and trekking experts have raised doubts about the proposed ropeway to be built on Rajgad fort. They fear that this plan may affect the eligibility of Rajgad, and other 13 forts, to be marked as world heritage sites by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (Unesco). Experts have also raised concerns about the ecological impact of this project and the threat to the historic structure of the fort. On June 12, the state department of tourism and the Indian Port Rail and Ropeway Corporation Limited (IPRCL) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to build a ropeway at Rajgad fort in the Pune district. Rajgad fort, which is located in Velhe tehsil, is a historically important fort as it was the capital of the Maratha empire under the rule of Chhatrapati Shivaji, until the capital was moved to Raigad fort. It is also a popular tourist destination and a favourite spot for trekkers on an overnight stay. The state tourism department has proposed the ropeway project for easy accessibility to the fort. “A few years back the state tourism department had sent a proposal to nominate Rajgad and 13 other forts for the world heritage tag. Now they are advancing with the ropeway project. This will jeopardise the efforts to get a world heritage tag for Rajgad. Also, there are currently four access points to the fort on foot. There is no need for a fifth. The fort is already overburdened with an overwhelming number of tourists and trekkers. This project will just increase the crowd. It will pose a threat to the historic structure of the fort,” said Prasad Dangat, president, Fort Conservation Committee, an NGO involved with fort restoration and conservation. Saili Palande-Datar, an environmentalist and history researcher, also opposes the project, citing archaeological and environmental concerns. “The administration should do a feasibility report of this project. Its environmental and archaeological impact needs to be studied. This area is a sensitive zone in the Western ghats. So before going ahead with this project all of these documents should be in the public domain. There should be a public hearing on the objections related to this project,” said Palande-Datar Some experts have claimed that there is not enough space on the Rajgad to construct a ropeway. “Unlike Raigad, Rajgad doesn’t have enough space. So the administration might want to rethink the location. It can be built on a nearby plane surface from which Rajgad is accessible,” said Umesh Zirpe, head of Giripremi. Activists have threatened to go to court if their concerns are not addressed by the government. Earlier, speaking in Pune, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar strongly defended the project and claimed that a ropeway would increase accessibility to the fort for all age groups. “Those who are opposing it now are young.

23-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt directs authorities to triple Covid-19 shots||The Delhi government has directed all the districts in the Capital to triple the number of Covid-19 shots being administered each day from Wednesday, by increasing the number of centres for those in the 18-45 age group, opening up centres that immunise only those above the age of 45 years to the younger age group as well, and using the vaccine doses provided by the Central government for all categories.On Tuesday, most of the vaccination sites also opened up walk-in facilities for those between the ages of 18 and 45 years, with half the slots at each centre being reserved for unscheduled vaccinations.“The number of vaccination centres will be increased by around 25% across Delhi from tomorrow (Wednesday),” said a senior district official.Currently, there are 1,040 vaccination sites across Delhi, of which only 30% are meant for those between the ages of 18 and 45 years. “By tonight, we should also get an order from the state government to use all vaccine doses – whether sent by the Centre or purchased by the state – across age groups,” said the official.So far, the free doses provided by the Centre were meant for only those above the age of 45 years, while the state government procured separate doses to vaccinate the young. The policy changed on Monday with Centre now providing all vaccine doses for free.Even as the number of shots given on the first day of the new vaccination drive soared to 8.5 million across the country on Monday, Delhi recorded lower than usual with 76,062 doses. Delhi administers over 84,000 shots on an average every day, with nearly 67% of it for those in the 18-45 age group.“The number of vaccinations go down in the city whenever doses for the youth are unavailable because more than 50% of those above the age of 45 years have already been immunised, with many still not eligible to get the shot after being infected during the previous wave. The Centre’s guideline states that vaccine should be administered only three months after an infection. Also, some people are of course hesitant,” said AAP MLA Atishi.Akriti Sagar, district magistrate (central), said they started walk-in for everyone from Tuesday in vaccination centres run by the Delhi government. “We have started walk-in vaccination for 18-45-year-olds now. Officers at session sites have now been directed to keep 50% of the vaccine stock for those who walk-in and the other half for those who have registered through the CoWin portal,” she said.Ankita Chakravarty, south Delhi DM, and Isha Khosla, DM (north), also confirmed that walk-in vaccinations for those above 18 years of age started in their district from Tuesday.The centres in South district, where this has begun, include Gargi Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya, Green Park extension, Government boys senior secondary school, Malviya Nagar, and Government co-ed school, Masjid Moth. All these centres are using vaccine stocks for walk-ins and pre-registered beneficiaries on a 50:50 basis.Some districts were yet to allow walk-ins at their vaccination sites. “We will begin walk-in vaccination for 18-45-year-olds tomorrow (Wednesday). We have been given the mandate to increase vaccination three folds. Currently, we are immunising around 4,000 people a day; tomorrow we expect to immunise at least 10,000,” said a senior official from South east district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-directs-authorities-to-triple-covid-19-shots-101624385320058.html
23-06-2021||Delhi||AAP, Union ministers spar over vaccination drive||Union ministers Hardeep Singh Puri and Harsh Vardhan on Tuesday criticised the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi for allegedly not participating actively in the nationwide Covid-19 vaccination drive, drawing sharp criticism from the AAP with Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia suggesting the central ministers to focus on providing sufficient vaccines instead of “just abusing” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal “all the time”.The political war of words began with the housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Puri tweeting, “On a day India vaccinated more than 84 lakh people, Delhi administered only 76,259 out of more than 11 lakh doses available. Why? Instead of focusing on the health & welfare of people of Delhi, Kejriwal Ji is busy in Punjab searching for a Sikh CM face for his party.”Sisodia responded to his tweet, alleging “flip-flops” by the central government on Covid-19 vaccination. “Hardeep ji: pls focus on providing enough vaccines for the youth, rather than just abusing Arvind Kejriwal all the time. Central government’s vaccination flip-flops have created a crisis situation all over the country,” he tweeted.Also read | At 5.4 million doses, Day 2 of Covid-19 vaccination drive records declineLater, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan also joined in and accused Sisodia of lying. On Monday, the deputy chief minister in a press briefing claimed that no vaccine doses were provided to Delhi by the Centre in the current month for the 18-45 years category. Citing a Ramcharit Manas verse, Vardhan tweeted in Hindi: “Some people accept only lies, offer lies to others and feed and chew lies only. This Ramcharit Manas chaupai fits Arvind Kejriwal and his ministers.”In his response, Sisodia said that at the current pace of distribution of doses to Delhi, the city would take 15-16 months to vaccinate its entire adult population. “Doctor sir, is the Central government going to give any fresh supply of vaccines to Delhi after June 21 or will it get only those many doses, which the Delhi government procured for the month of June? For the month of July also the Centre has allocated only 15 lakh vaccines for Delhi. You yourself think, at this pace it will take 15-16 months to vaccinate everyone,” he tweeted.AAP MLA Atishi who presents daily vaccination bulletin of the Delhi government said the Centre refused to let the city administration use vaccines meant for 45+ category for 18+ group, and on Tuesday, it “slyly” clarified the same through press releases.“Today, when the Delhi government has raised its voice saying that it has not received the free vaccine stock and that the Centre is running a fake vaccination campaign, they have slyly started issuing clarifications. Puri via a tweet and the Central government via a press release, are now telling us to use the 45+ stock for everyone. When the Delhi government was asking to do the same, the central government disapproved. It is our request to the central government to drop this abusive politics of press conferences, press releases, and Twitter. The country will not be safe from Covid-19 just by insulting Arvind Kejriwal. The country will be safe from Covid-19 only through vaccination,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-union-ministers-spar-over-vaccination-drive-101624385260500.html
23-06-2021||Delhi||Charred remains found in Delhi shoe factory gutted in major fire||A charred body was found in the early hours of Tuesday from a large shoe godown in Udyog Nagar near Peeragarhi in outer Delhi which went up in flames on Monday morning, fire department officials said.At least five more persons are still missing as the search operation continued for nearly 40 hours since Monday morning.Delhi fire services chief Atul Garg said the assistant divisional officer Rajesh Kumar Shukla suffered fracture in his ribs when he slipped from the staircase of the building. He is undergoing treatment at Balaji Action hospital, Garg said.Police as well as fire department personnel on Monday said that four families have come forward, claiming one of their members worked in the factory and was missing. Late on Monday night, two more families reached the godown and claimed their kin were also missing, they said.While Garg confirmed that the charred remains of a human body was found on the second floor of the godown at 3am on Tuesday during their search operation, police officials said they would confirm it only after the an examination by the forensic experts.“We have not been able to retrieve the remains that the fire officials found early Tuesday morning. Nothing can be said until we get the forensic report,” said deputy commissioner of police (outer) Parvinder Singh.Police said the remains will be sent for DNA profiling to ascertain the identity and to know if they belong to one person or more. The missing persons have been identified by their families as Sonu, Vikram, Shamshad, Abhishek, Ajay and Neeraj. Sonu and Vikram, in their early 20s, were brother who lived in Ghazipur in east Delhi, their family members told the police.DCP Singh a case of attempt to commit culpable homicide has been registered under Indian Penal Code’s section 308. The owner of the godown, Pankaj Garg, is absconding. “We may add more relevant sections of IPC in the case once it is confirmed that the charred remains are of a human body,” he added.On Monday around 8.30 am, the fire control room was informed about a fire in a godown that is spread in nearly 1,000 square metres and consists of two buildings, each having a basement, ground and first floor. More than 100 fire fighters and 35 fire tenders worked for nearly eight hours to douse the flames. However, the cooling and search operations were on till Tuesday night.The entire premises had a tin ceiling and was packed with shoes, slippers, and packaging materials such as boxes and adhesives. The tin roof collapsed while cracks have developed in the buildings and were declared dangerous by the municipal authority.Initially, the fire and police department were told that there were at least 10 people inside the building when the blaze started. While six of them were rescued, four are still missing. Later on Monday night, families to two more workers informed about their missing.“There is still extreme heat inside the building which is causing hindrance for officials to examine. Once the cooling operation is complete, we will use sniffer dogs to search the bodies,” said DCP Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/charred-remains-found-in-delhi-shoe-factory-gutted-in-major-fire-101624385200813.html
23-06-2021||Delhi||DDA ropes in pvt agencies to help residents of unauthorised colonies||To expedite the process to give ownership rights to residents of 1,731 unauthorised colonies in Delhi under PM-UDAY scheme, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has decided to rope in private agencies that will go door-to-door and help beneficiaries register on the agency’s portal, a senior DDA official said.As a pilot project, DDA has roped in a private firm that will carrying out registration and application filling process in 250 unauthorised colonies in Delhi. “We are in the process of finalising the list of 250 unauthorised colonies where the the firm is likely to start work from July 1. The private agency will go door-to-door and assist people in registering on our portal. It will also create awareness and clear people’s doubts. We have also empanelled seven firms to assist people in uploading all the relevant documents online to expedite the process,” the official said.“This is in addition to the ongoing process of people registering directly on our portal. If this pilot project is successful, then we plan to do it in all 1,700-odd unauthorised colonies,” said a senior DDA official.Ahead of the Delhi assembly elections in 2020, the BJP-led central government announced the Pradhan Mantri Unauthorised Colonies in Delhi Awas Adhikar Yojana (PM-UDAY) which is aimed at benefiting four million people living in 1,731 unauthorised colonies in the Capital. For this, the National Capital Territory of Delhi (Recognition of Property Rights of Residents in Unauthorised Colonies) Act, 2019, was passed in the Parliament in November 2019, to allow residents of these colonies get ownership rights to their property.The implementation of the scheme, for which registration process started in December 2019, has been marred due to the coronavirus pandemic and procedural and land-related issues. Almost one-and-a-half-years later, only 6,372 property owners could get final documents of property ownership (authorization slip or conveyance deed) from DDA.According to a senior official, 4.15 lakh property owners have registered on DDA’s portal for ownership rights. Of these, a GIS survey of 3.06 lakh property has been done. “So far, we have received 73,180 complete application forms along with all the necessary property documents,” said the official.Explaining the reason for the slow pace of work, a senior DDA official said, “Immediately after the scheme was launched, there were assembly elections in Delhi. By the time work picked up pace, lockdown was announced due to the Covid-19 pandemic. While people were registering on our portal, work on the ground couldn’t be done due to the lockdown. This year, again, the work got affected due to the lockdown. Now, we are planning to expedite the work and clear all the pending applications by July 10,” said the official.The change in DDA’s strategy is aimed at increasing the number of complete application forms. “In a lot of cases, we have to reject the application forms as the documents are not in order. This is why we have empanelled agencies to help people upload all relevant documents. We have also simplified the process,” said the official.In some cases, property owners got the GIS survey done and uploaded the documents only to find out that their properties were falling on Master Plan roads, parks or spaces earmarked for various utilities in the zonal plan. “To avoid such problems, we have developed a mobile application using which people can find out whether their property is falling in zones where ownership can’t be given,” said the official.Of the 1,731 unauthorised colonies, ownership process in 76 colonies has been put on hold as these fall in the O-zone (Yamuna floodplains). The DDA is preparing a proposal to demarcate the boundaries of Zone O -- the land planning zone which encompasses the Yamuna floodplains -- to provide ownership rights to 76 unauthorised colonies that have come up along the river. The proposal will be submitted to the principal committee of the National Green Tribunal.But a large number of people living in unauthorised colonies in Jaitpur, Badarpur, Okhla, Karawal Nagar, etc had applied for ownership rights. But due to the O-zone issue, their applications couldn’t be processed.The draft Master Plan of Delhi-2041, which was recently put in public domain for feedback and suggestions, has proposed that the floodplain will be delineated. The O zone will be split in two—the floodplain and the riverfront.Anil Sharma, a resident of Meethapur in south east Delhi, has formed an association to push the demand for removal of the colony’s name from the restricted zone. He said the colony was situated more than 1.5km away from the floodplain. “Effort has been made to resolve the issue. But we are not sure whether it will address our issue or not. It’s going to be almost a year since the issue came to light.,” said Sharma.Brij Mohan Somani, a resident of Badli, said, “There are so many people who have paid for the GIS survey and applied for ownership. DDA is taking a lot of time to process the files.”Sabyasachi Das, former planning commissioner with the DDA, said, “This is a tricky issue as there are multiple problems in implementation of the scheme. What happens to properties which are falling on master plan roads or areas earmarked in the zonal plans? In a lot of unauthorized colonies, people have purchased properties floor-wise. The DDA needs to clarify whether it will give floor-wise ownership or not. One of the biggest concerns of people in these colonies is regarding getting their building plans sanctioned. Property ownership documents don’t help in getting building plans sanctioned. The DDA has to clarify these things to people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dda-ropes-in-pvt-agencies-to-help-residents-of-unauthorised-colonies-with-paper-work-101624385140568.html
23-06-2021||Delhi||Man held for creating ruckus at Delhi airport||A 36-year-old businessman was arrested at the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) airport for allegedly creating a ruckus after being denied boarding by airline officials for not carrying the mandatory RT-PCR report.“We registered a case under Sections 92, 93 and 97 (punishment for obstructing or annoying passengers in the street and misbehaviour with intent to provoke a breach of the peace) of Delhi Police (DP) Act and arrested the passenger, identified as Suraj Pandey,” said deputy commissioner of police (IGI Airport) Rajeev Ranjan.DCP Ranjan said that Pandey, a businessman from Deoria in Uttar Pradesh, was arrested based on a complaint received from Deepak Chadha, Deputy Manager of Vistara Airlines. In his complaint, Chadha alleged that the passenger had come to the Delhi airport’s T3 terminal to board a Vistara Airlines flight to Mumbai without the mandatory RT-PCR report -- mandatory for any air travel -- following which he was denied permission to board the flight.The airline official said that Pandey allegedly turned violent, started shouting and even started walking on the baggage conveyor belt, thereby obstructing the airline staff and other passengers.The airline staff alerted the CISF personnel who caught Pandey and handed him over to the police, the DCP said.“We checked the CCTV footage that verified the allegations of the complainant. Accordingly, a case was registered and Pandey was arrested. His medical examination was also conducted. He was later released on bail,” he said.An official statement issued by the Vistara spokesperson said the passenger was not carrying an RT-PCR report.“He behaved badly with our staff and other customers, and his acts threatened the safety of ground operations. We have provided a full refund of the booking to the customer and notified the authorities of the incident,” the spokesperson added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/man-held-for-creating-ruckus-at-delhi-airport-101624385080684.html
23-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi opens special vaccination centre for transgender persons and sex workers||Delhi has started special vaccination drives for transgender persons and sex workers in the city as part of its efforts to inoculate such people, who have been categorised as ”high risk groups” by the ministry of health and family welfare. One such dedicated vaccination centre for transgender persons opened on Tuesday at the DUSIB Flats, opposite the Sultanpuri bus terminal, in north-west Delhi, while another one was launched for sex workers in the central district on Monday, officials said. A third one, in the west district, is in the process of being launched, they said.Delhi has at least 55,633 female sex workers and 9,496 transgender persons in the high risk groups, according to the National AIDS Control Programme of the Union ministry of health and family welfare.Cheshta Yadav, district magistrate (DM), northwest, said the Sultanpuri centre vaccinated at least 45 beneficiaries till 4pm on the first day. The district administration shared posters of the drive to spread awareness about the programme and also provided transportation to persons in these groups, who were identified with the help of NGOs in the area. The centre will function from 9am to 5pm till Friday.Samaira (19), a social worker and a transgender person, took her first vaccine dose from the centre on Tuesday. “I cannot tell you how relieved I am to finally get access to a vaccination centre. The best thing is that this is a walk-in centre and it is exclusively for people from my community. One of my transgender friends, who was bold enough to go to a general vaccination centre, did not return happy; she had to face eyeballs and murmurs while waiting in queue. We feel safer in set-ups that are exclusively meant for people of our community,” she said.On June 8, Hindustan Times first highlighted how Delhi lacked special vaccination centres for transgender persons and sex workers. Several activists and NGOs, working for transgender persons and sex workers, also demanded easier access to vaccines in “community friendly settings” and assistance in booking slots.Masoom, a sex worker who wanted to be identified only by her nickname, said the problem she and many of her friends faced was the lack of identity cards. “The Co-WIN portal asks for Aadhaar or other IDs and most of us don’t have any. Registration was a problem. I hope walk-in centres are opened for us soon,” she said.A senior Delhi government official said the Union government has allowed vaccination of people in high risk groups even if they do not have any of the seven acceptable ID proofs. “District administrations have to identify one key facilitator in each such group and that person must have an active mobile number and at least one valid identification proof. The Co-WIN system now provides the facility to create special vaccination sessions -- facilitated cohort registration -- that allows the registration of as many beneficiaries as are to be covered (subject to the limit prescribed), without the mandatory capturing of mobile number and photo ID of each,” the official said, asking not to be named.Akriti Sagar, district magistrate (central), said her district just completed one round of the special vaccination drive for sex workers and the second round is scheduled for Wednesday. “We are conducting a multipronged outreach programme for marginalised communities. GB Road (a red-light district) falls under our jurisdiction. So, today (Tuesday), we conducted a special medical camp and counselling session for sex workers by sending our mobile vans there. Tomorrow, we will hold the second round of vaccination for them at Mata Sundari school,” said Sagar.The district has identified at least 800 trans persons, who will be vaccinated in two phases, the DM said. “The first phase will be held on Thursday at Happy School, Daryaganj. We will also provide them with ration kits on the day of vaccination, as an incentive for others to take the jab. More vaccination centres will be set up for trans persons and other marginalised sections in the coming week,” Sagar said.Kriti Garg, district magistrate (west), said the district administration is currently identifying such beneficiaries in the area. “We are in touch with a few representatives of these groups (transgender and sex worker) and we will have a session site for them as soon as we get some data on the number of beneficiaries. We have deployed mobile teams and their roster will be confirmed soon,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-opens-special-vaccination-centre-for-transgender-persons-and-sex-workers-101624385021336.html
23-06-2021||Delhi||Rise in pass percentage of Class 9, 11 students in Delhi govt schools||The Directorate of Education (DoE) on Tuesday announced the results of students enrolled in classes 9 and 11 in its schools, recording a spike in overall pass percentage in both the classes from last year. While the pass percentage in Class 9 increased by 15 percentage points, Class 11 pass percentage saw a marginal spike of under one percentage point, in comparison to last year.The students of these classes were promoted on the basis of their performances in mid-term exams and internal assessments since their final exams could not be held in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The mid-term exams for these classes were underway when the second wave of the pandemic hit the country in April.Delhi government schools usually follow a strict assessment process in classes 9 and 11. For instance, according to a 2019 Praja Foundation report, around 55% of Class 9 students in the 2016-17 academic year did not pass their annual exams.With the pass percentage in classes 9 and 11 rising due to the alternative assessment policy adopted since last year in view of the pandemic, principals of several government schools have also expressed concern over how their students will perform in the CBSE board exams for classes 10 and 12 next year.“The increase in passing percentage might affect the Class 10 and 12 board exam results of government schools next year. We just hope CBSE comes up with an alternative evaluation criteria for board classes for next year as well,” said a principal of a government school in Rohini.According to a statement issued by the Delhi government on Tuesday, mid-term exams of Social Studies, Sanskrit, and the third language for Class 9 students, and exams for Geography and Business Studies for class 11 students, could not be conducted in 2020-21. “The average marks of the students’ two best performing subjects, out of the five main ones, have been given in subjects where the exams could not be conducted or the student was absent for some reason,” the statement read.Going by the government data, of the 2.58 lakh students enrolled in Class 9 across 1,030 government schools in the 2020-21 academic session, 2.45 lakh appeared for their mid-term exams. “The final results of students were collated based on the mid-term and internal assessments. Based on this evaluation criteria, 1.97 lakh students (80.3%) in Class 9 passed in Delhi,” the statement added. Last year, the overall pass percentage in Class 9 in Delhi government schools was around 65%.While around 1.7 lakh students were enrolled in Class 11 for the academic session 2020-21, only 1.69 lakh students appeared for the mid-terms, out which 1.65 lakh students passed. Last year, the pass percentage of Class 11 was 96%, which increased to 99.25% after the compartment exams.According to the government data, during the mid-term exams held in April, as many as 12,500 Class 9 students and 3,500 class 11 students did not appear. “All those students who have not appeared for any exams will be eligible for re-assessment. The re-assessment will be based on class-based assignments, project work, and other assessments. Guidelines regarding re-assessment will be released soon by the Directorate of Education,” the statement added.The results were declared on DoE’s official website and schools also sent results to students via SMS and WhatsApp messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rise-in-pass-percentage-of-class-9-11-students-in-delhi-govt-schools-101624385020122.html
23-06-2021||Delhi||Mason took 5 hours to steal ₹55 lakh from East Delhi bank; arrested||A 34-year-old mason single-handedly cut through a wall and floor of the Union Bank of India’s branch, broke open the iron vault and stole a little over ₹55 lakh cash – all in five hours – on Sunday, the police said on Tuesday, after arresting the prime suspect and recovering ₹54.48 lakh from him.About ₹49,000 was recovered from the mason’s 39-year-old friend, who has also been arrested on the alleged charges of receiving stolen money, while they together spent ₹5,400 on gambling, the police said.Ironically, before his arrest, the mason, Hari Ram, who lives in a lane close to the bank, was called in by the bank officials on Monday afternoon to patch up the holes that he had drilled the previous day for executing the heist. The bank officials entrusted Ram for fixing the drilled holes because they knew him and had hired him in the past for some repair work. Ram patched up the holes after the forensic teams lifted evidence from the crime scene, said deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Satiyasundaram.Six months ago, Ram carried out repairs for fixing seepage in the strong room in the basement, where the bank’s lockers and vault are located, police said. As Ram was familiar with the layout and design of the bank’s building, he planned the heist three months ago. He needed money to pay off ₹10 lakh that he borrowed from various people and lost them in gambling, police said.Investigators said Ram chose an under-construction building adjacent to the bank to enter the premises because he knew it has been abandoned. Also, three months ago, he had replaced the lock on the building so that he could enter without any signs of break-in. Police said the building was locked for the past two years because of some dispute over the property. Ram had first worked there as a mason, and then caretaker till the owner sold it to someone two years ago.Ram wanted to execute the plan sometime around April but had to drop it because he couldn’t buy tools to cut through a wall and the vault as all shops were closed due to the lockdown, said the DCP.Last week, the DCP said, Ram purchased a grinding machine, its blades, a hammer and a chisel from a shop in Shahdara. Ram decided to execute the plan on Sunday because he knew that the cash transactions of Friday and Saturday were kept in the bank’s safe and that the bank is closed for weekend.“He carried out a detailed reconnaissance of the areas around the bank to check the position of CCTVs around the bank building,” said an investigator, who asked not to be named.On Sunday around 2pm, Ram went to the first floor of another building and changed the focus of a CCTV camera that could have captured his entry to the under construction building. Then, he opened the lock of the vacant building, went inside, drilled a hole and entered the bank’s ground floor. He disabled the CCTV cameras and then drilled his way into the basement through the floor, said DCP Sathiyasundaram.“Once inside the basement, Ram cut open the vault, took out the cash and fled. He put the cash in a plastic sack, went to the roof of a building near his house where he worked as a guard and cleaner, and hid it in a blue drum. He took out around ₹55,000, and gave ₹50,000 to his friend Kali Charan (now arrested) and spent the remaining ₹5,000 in gambling,” added the DCP.The DCP said investigators scanned nearly 50 CCTV cameras, including the one that Ram tampered with. That camera had captured Ram entering the building before it went out of focus.“We showed the footage to some people working in that building. Two of them identified him as Hari Ram and told us that he had worked in the under construction building two years ago. We checked the other CCTVs and found Ram carrying a bag in the adjacent lane around 7 pm on Sunday. Ram was interrogated and confronted with the video footage. He broke down and confessed to the crime. He took us to his employer’s building from where the stolen cash was recovered,” added the DCP.Originally from Madhya Pradesh, Ram came to Delhi for livelihood seven years ago. His wife and two children live with him in Delhi but they were unaware of his crime. His friend, Kali Charan, runs a small business, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mason-took-5-hours-to-steal-rs-55-lakh-from-east-delhi-bank-arrested-101624384900535.html
23-06-2021||Delhi||Administrative hurdles delay annual revision of power tariffs in Delhi||The schedule for the annual revision of electricity tariffs in Delhi has been delayed by nearly three months, and so has the process of selecting a new chairperson for the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC), senior government officials said on Monday.“The tariff order is ready, but some verification process is going on currently. Also, the process coincided with the selection of the DERC chief which too has not been completed till now,” said a senior official, on condition of anonymity.On April 1 this year, the Union ministry of power wrote to all state power regulators to mandatorily issue the tariff orders before April every year. “It has been brought to the notice of the government that despite explicit legal provisions, there are significant delays in the issuance of tariff orders by some of the state commissions. Regulatory assets are being created by some of the state electricity regulatory commissions (SERCs) as a matter of routine. This is against the letter and spirit of the law and not only negatively impacts the financials of the distribution licensees and their business sustainability but is also prejudicial to the public interest as the discoms do not have enough money to buy power or maintain the distribution system,” read the letter written by Ghanshyam Prasad, joint secretary, government of India. HT has seen a copy of the letter.The delay could persist for several weeks because the current DERC chairperson, Justice (retd) Satyendra Singh Chauhan, will retire on July 4. “While the tariff order is ready, the problem is that selection of the next chairperson has not progressed and now one of the members of the commission has recused from signing anything. The first committee under Justice (retd) Sarvesh Gupta of Uttarakhand high court was formed in March this year, but the panel’s tenure got over and the selection could not happen,” said a second senior government official.Now, a second committee headed by Justice (retd) GP Mittal has been formed and has even received the approval of the lieutenant governor, but the Delhi government is yet to constitute the screening committee which is supposed to ask the public to send in applications, various documents seen by HT showed.Last year also, the DERC issued the tariff order as late as August. In its 2020 order, the power regulator had increased electricity bills of all consumers marginally by 1.2 percentage points from September 1 through a hike in the surcharge. It , however, did not change the per unit and fixed rates.This year, discoms BSES Rajdhani and BSES Yamuna have projected a revenue gap of ₹1,703 crore and ₹1,148 crore respectively for 2021-22, while Tata Power expected a gap of ₹1,108 crore. The companies have put the cumulative revenue gap (till 2019-20) at ₹28,623 crore (BRPL), ₹19,123 crore (BYPL) and ₹3,810 crore (TPDDL). Discoms have been demanding a power tariff hike over the last six years.However, the Delhi government is unlikely to increase tariffs in the national Capital as it is one of the key models of its governance which the Aam Aadmi Party plans to showcase in the upcoming MCD elections in Delhi and the assembly elections it intends to fight in six states such as Gujarat, Punjab, Goa and Uttar Pradesh in two years.The DERC is an autonomous quasi-judicial body, but the selection of the commission which has a chairperson and two members are done with some involvement of the Delhi government. Besides, the Delhi government, from time to time, can also send policy proposals to the commission by invoking Section 108 of the Electricity Act.The annual power tariff announcement is important because the traders are demanding that the Delhi government waive off the fixed charges in power bills as the city was put under a strict lockdown for 6-7 weeks with the Capital reeling under a brutal fourth wave of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/administrative-hurdles-delay-annual-revision-of-power-tariffs-in-delhi-101624384899993.html
23-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt plans check dams on major drains to trap pollutants||The Delhi government is working on creating low-cost check dams in at least 20 “strategic locations” on major drains to reduce the pollutant load being released into the Yamuna by 70-80%, senior officials said.While two such check dams have already been installed -- on the supplementary drain near Rithala and Rohini sewage treatment plant and on the Shahdara drain -- on a pilot basis, officials said the project will be expanded to the rest of the locations once its tested during the monsoon when water level in the drains rise.A senior official privy to the developments explained that the idea behind installing these check dams or weirs is to increase the travel time of drain water so as to allow solid pollutants, primarily sewage from nearby unauthorised colonies, to settle down before the water is released into the river. Officials said it will also strengthen the biological treatment process.“The primary idea behind constructing these weirs is to increase the time taken for the drain water to reach the river. For instance, if it took eight hours for the drain water to reach the river earlier, now we will increase it to 24 hours, by blocking the flow of the drains at these strategic locations. What we are achieving by this is that, first, when a wall is created, the solid pollutants settle down before the water overflows from the weirs, and second, the time for microbial treatment or the natural treatment process of drain water increases,” the official explained.He said that these weirs will act as checkpoints, beyond which untreated wastewater will not move forward.Delhi Jal Board (DJB) data shows that the Capital generates around 720 million gallons of wastewater per day, of which around 525 million gallons is treated by sewage treatment plants. While there are five major drains — at Najafgarh, Shahdara, Barapullah, Delhi Gate and Mori Gate -- carrying wastewater to the Yamuna, the 20 check dams will be installed only on the drains at Najafgarh, its supplementary channel and the one at Shahdara. Curiously, apart from local polluting sources, the Najafgarh and Shahdara drains also gets waste from Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.Government estimates show that with these check dams, the pollutant load entering the Yamuna from these drains will drop by nearly 70-80%.Officials explained that these weirs are based on “in-house designs”, each of which cost the government ₹4-5 lakhs. Going by this figure, the construction of around 20 weirs, which is the government target, will be completed with a budget of under ₹1 crore.“The cubes used for the weirs have all been constructed and assembled on site. We have also taken into consideration that in case of emergency, when Delhi receives extremely heavy rainfall, these cubes can be lifted and kept aside. However, the design of the weirs has taken into consideration the fact that during monsoon, water level will rise and can easily overflow,” the official explained.Bhim Singh Rawat, from South Asian Network on Dams, Rivers and People, said that bioremediation is a known method to clean water bodies, but it’s success depends on how polluted the water body is. “For instance, the Najafgarh drain is highly polluted and carries discharge from industries and household. The check dams may not have a visible effect but it is a promising start,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-plans-check-dams-on-major-drains-to-trap-pollutants-for-a-cleaner-yamuna-101624384840026.html
23-06-2021||Pune||Labourers to be flown in from U.P., Bihar for Pune metro, PMC projects||Maharashtra which saw agitations on the streets against labourers from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar a decade ago, is now offering a red carpet by flying them in. After Maha Metro, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to bring back 100 workers by air next week. Due to Covid -19 pandemic and lock down, labourers working at various places travelled back to their home state, however, as cases have fallen, work has begun at most places. In order to boost the economy and get infrastructural works done, government agencies and private organisations are flying migrant labourers in from their home state. Both government authorities and private establishments are facing the problem of worker shortage. PMC water department head Aniruddha Pavaskar said, “The work of water tanks is going on, but contractor is facing a manpower shortage. The contractor is only carrying out the work with 40 per cent work force. Now to speed up the work, it is decided to bring workers by air. Next week the contractor decided to bring 100 workers who have expertise in water tanks. Even after opening up of first lock down, PMC had flown in some labourers by air.” Maha Metro’s director work Atul Gadgil said, “It is true that there is shortage of workers. We are trying to bring them back. Last time, we provided air travel for bringing back the labourers.” Sambhaji Bhosale, hotel owner said, “As government allowed to open restaurants, we are facing a man power shortage. The staff is mainly from the northern state. They are not getting railway tickets so I asked them to travel by air, without them it is tough to start operations.” Private contractor Sandeep Shah said, “I asked the labours to hire a bus or small cars from their locality and return back. I promised them to bear the cost of their travel.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-faces-manpower-shortage-labourers-flown-in-from-u-p-bihar-101624378179846.html

The ATS claimed that the racket was allegedly funded by international organizations, including Pakistan’s intelligence agency ISI, for the conversion of specially-abled children and other vulnerable groups of society. The accused were involved in conversion of over 1,000 people in the last 18 months, claimed police.Officials said Umar Gautam’s original name was Shyam Prakash Singh Gautam, son of Dhanraj Singh Gautam. He was the fourth among six siblings — Udai Raj Singh Gautam, Udai Pratap Singh Gautam, Udai Nath Singh Gautam, Shyam Prakash Singh Gautam, Shri Nath Singh Gautam and Dhruv Singh Gautam.“Family members had no relations with Shyam Prakash after he embraced Islam nearly 37 years ago,” said his second eldest brother Udai Pratap Singh Gautam, who stays in Fatehpur. He said their father had disowned Shyam Prakash after coming to know that he had accepted Islam and changed his name.Udai Pratap said his family had no idea about Shyam Prakash’s working as he remained completely disconnected with them for years. Shyam Prakash, his wife and two children stayed in New Delhi. He said Shyam Prakash even made his wife Rajesh Kumari embrace Islam and changed her name to Razia.A senior ATS official said Umar Gautam alias Shyam Prakash looked for vulnerable people for conversion and influenced them by narrating his own story of being a Thakur who embraced Islam.He said Gautam used to highlight “caste discrimination” among Hindus to influence vulnerable people and instilled hatred among them towards other religions. Udai Pratap said the group even lured people into conversion with a promise of jobs and other avenues. “Shyam Prakash was suspected to be lured into conversion with a promise of job,” he added. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/religious-conversion-racket-born-as-a-hindu-umar-gautam-embraced-islam-under-influence-of-muslim-friends-101624373319564.html

According to the petitioners, the UP Sunni Central Waqf Board and the management committee of Shahi Masjid, Eidgah should accept the offer to resolve the matter amicably.One of the petitioners, Mahendra Pratap Singh, an advocate, moved an application to this effect in the court of civil judge (senior division) at Mathura on Tuesday. He is also the president of Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi Mukti Andolan Samiti and claims that his organisation will make the land available to Muslims, if they accept the offer.The court of civil judge (senior division) in Mathura has fixed July 5 as the next date of hearing.Tanveer Ahmed, secretary and counsel for Shahi Masjid Eidgah in Mathura, denied that a copy of the application has been provided to them. “No copy of such application was handed over to us. We will examine the averments made therein after receiving the copy,” said Ahmed.”The Supreme Court, in its judgment in Ram Janmabhoomi case of Ayodhya, stated that Babri structure was built after bringing down Ram Janmabhoomi temple in Ayodhya over the same land. The court passed the order holding the disputed place as that owned by ‘Ramlala’ and in lieu of it, Muslims were provided land to have their place of worship across river Saryu in Ayodhya,” stated Singh.“We have made an offer to the opposite parties (UP Sunni Central Waqf Board and management committee of Shahi Masjid Eidgah) to give up their claim on the land originally belonging to the temple where the Eidgah was built. And in lieu thereof, they (Muslims) would be offered land more than one and a half times anywhere beyond 84 kos of Braj,” it added.A suit was filed in 2020 on behalf of deity Lord Krishna seeking removal of the Shahi Eidgah (mosque), adjacent the temple complex in Mathura. Ahmed, however, said that suit itself has been challenged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sri-krishna-janmabhoomi-case-muslims-offered-land-elsewhere-by-petitioners-101624372899671.html

They had met his wife Shashibala who said that Jyoti had come to Meerut with her son and handed over the baby to the couple and took ₹1.50 lakh cash from them.As of now, police is yet to trace the couple Vishal Shrivastav and Neha Shrivastav who had adopted the baby. Officials in the women and child welfare department said that the process of adoption is illegal and in violation of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act.The protection officer had also issued notices to the couple earlier but they had not joined the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/illegally-adoption-karnal-police-yet-to-bring-back-karnal-woman-s-child-101624371160868.html
23-06-2021||World||Facing criticism, Kamala Harris to visit US-Mexico border area over migration||Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday will make her first visit to the US-Mexico border, her office announced, after she has faced criticism from members of both parties for failing to go there despite her role leading the Biden administration’s response to a steep increase in migration.Harris will visit the El Paso area, accompanied by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, according to a statement Wednesday from Harris senior adviser Symone Sanders.The visit comes as Harris has faced months of attacks from Republicans, and even some frustration from those in her own party, for declining to visit the area. Harris has been tasked by President Joe Biden with taking on the root causes of migration from Central America to the United States.So far she has focused her efforts on improving economic and living conditions in the region. Her aides have repeatedly insisted her focus is distinct from the security issues that plague US officials trying to handle a spike in border crossings.But Republicans have seized on failures by both Harris and Biden to paint the administration as absent on what they’ve described as a crisis at the border. The issue overshadowed Harris’ first foreign trip earlier this month, to Guatemala and Mexico, where she met with both nations’ presidents and local officials and advocates to discuss economic and humanitarian solutions to the significant outmigration from both countries.But Harris and White House aides in Washington were forced to parry repeated questions from the press about why she left a border visit off the trip.Harris has noted that as a senator from California, she has visited the border in the past, and she has asserted that unless the root causes of migration are addressed the situation at the border will never be fixed.On her visit to Guatemala and Mexico this month, she urged Central Americans not to try to reach the US border. She tried to give people a sense of hope that would encourage them to stay home.US Customs and Border Protection recorded more than 180,000 encounters on the Mexican border in May, the most since March 2000. But the numbers were boosted by a pandemic-related ban on seeking asylum, which encouraged repeated attempts to cross the border because getting caught carried no legal consequences.Harris’ trip will come just days before former President Donald Trump is set to visit the border next week with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. Republican Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana and about a dozen members of the conservative Republican Study Committee he leads will also be joining the trip, another sign of how closely the party continues to align itself with Trump and the extent to which they see the border as a winning campaign issue.Trump immediately took credit for Harris' trip, speculating in a statement that the vice president would not have made plans to go if Trump hadn't been headed there himself.Republicans have tried to make Harris the face of the administration's policies, charging that she and Biden were ignoring the issue because both had yet to visit the border. Harris, during her trip to Latin America, told reporters she was focused on “tangible” results “as opposed to grand gestures.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facing-criticism-kamala-harris-to-visit-us-mexico-border-area-over-migration-101624471513514.html
23-06-2021||World||China blames India for border tension||China has deployed troops at the border to prevent India from encroaching its territory, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Wednesday, adding that New Delhi’s aggressive policies are to blame for the ongoing tension along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The overall Sino-India ties should not be linked to the boundary dispute either, the ministry also said, reiterating its opinion that the disagreements on the border should be kept at its right place in the range of aspects in the relationship.The Chinese foreign ministry was reacting to a question on Indian external affairs minister, S Jaishankar’s comments on Tuesday where he said that the Chinese military deployment at the border and uncertainty if Beijing will fulfil its promise on troop reduction remain challenges in bilateral ties.New Delhi has also repeatedly said that complete disengagement at all friction points on the LAC and peace and tranquility in the border areas alone can lead to normalisation of ties in other spheres such as trade and investment - especially in context of Beijing’s repeated statements that the border question should be kept in its right place.In an interview with Bloomberg at the Qatar Economic Forum on Tuesday, Jaishankar said that the issue there is whether China would live up to the commitments it has made - written commitments it has made - about both countries not allowing a large armed force at the border.China’s “close-up deployment still continues, especially in Ladakh”, the Indian minister said.Beijing, however, stuck to its narrative of blaming New Delhi.“The military deployment by China in the western sector along the border is a normal defensive arrangement. It is meant to prevent the encroachment or threat against China’s territory by relevant country,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said on Wednesday.“For quite some time the Indian side has been increasing its military along the border and encroaching upon the Chinese territory. This is the root cause of the tense situation along the borders,” Zhao added. “We advocate that we should address the boundary issue through peaceful negotiations, and we don’t think that the border issue should be linked up to our bilateral ties.”India has earlier said that People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops had transgressed across the LAC, triggering the friction in eastern Ladakh.New Delhi has told Beijing that given the seriousness of the Galwan Valley incident, it cannot be business as usual - and the border dispute cannot be swept under the carpet - until full disengagement is completed at friction points.India’s external affairs ministry has also spelt out the Indian government’s position on the disengagement process, saying the LAC “must be strictly respected and observed as this is the basis for peace and tranquility in the border areas”.More than a year after the ongoing tension began, disengagement of troops is yet to be completed despite 11 rounds of military and seven rounds of diplomatic talks - under the Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination on India-China Border Affairs - having taken place.China’s PLA has continued deployment of troops and military equipment along the LAC and has even inducted the army’s air defence units in its command chain in Western Theatre Command, establishing joint air defence system along the border for the first time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-blames-india-for-border-tension-101624471664659.html
23-06-2021||World||Delta plus in 11 countries, 197 cases: What we know about Covid variant so far||Delta plus variant of coronavirus in its further mutated form has sent a wave of alert and caution among health authorities across the globe.The mutated variant, experts point out, has increased transmissibility, higher binding capacity to the lung cells and resistance to monoclonal antibody treatment. The variant has mutated from Delta, termed as a 'variant of concern' by the World Health Organization (WHO), and is known to have driven the deadly second wave in India in April and May this year.In a widespread crisis triggered by the Delta variant, lakhs were infected and thousands died in the country as families scrambled to procure drugs like Fabiflu and Remdesivir and oxygen cylinders.The SARS-CoV-2 virus causing Covid-19 disease is mutating continuously with an increase in the number of infections both across the world and in India.Health experts have already said the Delta plus variant could be a concern. The variant calls for a high watch and containment of the affected zone should be done to reduce the transmission.India on Wednesday confirmed 40 cases of the highly transmissible Delta coronavirus variant and advised states to increase testing.All Delta sub-lineages are treated as variants of concern and properties of AY.1 are still being investigated. Delta plus is also known as 'AY.1' variant or B.1.617.2.1The variant frequency of AY.1 is low in India. Cases with AY.1 have been mostly reported from nine countries of Europe, Asia and America.WHAT IS DELTA PLUS?First reported in India, the variant "Delta Plus" was cited in the Public Health England bulletin on June 11.The variant is a sub-lineage of the Delta variant first found in India and also carries the spike protein mutation called K417N which is also found in the Beta variant first identified in South Africa.Scientists fear that the mutation combined with other existing features of the Delta variant could make it more transmissible."The mutation K417N has been of interest as it is present in the Beta variant (B.1.351 lineage), which was reported to have immune evasion property," Union health ministry said in a statement.The Delta plus variant is known to reduce the effectiveness of a cocktail of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, Shahid Jameel, a top Indian virologist told Reuters.WHERE ALL IT HAS BEEN FOUND?As of June 16, at least 197 cases has been found in 11 countries -- Britain (36), Canada (1), India (8), Japan (15), Nepal (3), Poland (9), Portugal (22), Russia (1), Switzerland (18), Turkey (1), the United States (83).In India alone, around 40 cases of the Delta plus variant have been detected sporadically in Maharashtra, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh, the Union health ministry said on Wednesday.Britain said its first 5 cases were sequenced on April 26 and they were contacts of individuals who had travelled from, or transited through, Nepal and Turkey.No deaths were reported among the UK and Indian cases.MAJOR CONCERNS AROUND THE VARIANTMultiple studies are ongoing in India and globally to test the effectiveness of vaccines against this mutation."WHO is tracking this variant as part of the Delta variant, as we are doing for other Variants of Concern with additional mutations," the World Health Organization (WHO) told Reuters."For the moment, this variant does not seem to be common, currently accounting for only a small fraction of the Delta sequences ... Delta and other circulating Variants of Concern remain a higher public health risk as they have demonstrated increases in transmission," it said.But India's health ministry warned that regions where it has been found "may need to enhance their public health response by focusing on surveillance, enhanced testing, quick contact-tracing and priority vaccination."Authorities have spotlighted that Delta Plus can likely inflict another wave of infections on India after it emerged from the world's worst surge in cases only recently."The mutation itself may not lead to a third wave in India - that also depends on Covid-appropriate behaviour, but it could be one of the reasons," Tarun Bhatnagar, an Indian Council for Medical Research scientist told Reuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-plus-in-11-countries-197-cases-what-we-know-about-covid-variant-so-far-101624450918846.html
23-06-2021||World||India Walton defeats Buffalo mayor in Democratic primary||India Walton, a socialist community activist, has defeated the four-term mayor of Buffalo in a Democratic primary, putting her on track to become the first woman to lead New York's second-largest city.The 38-year-old nurse and union leader captured a major political prize for the party's left wing with her victory over Mayor Byron Brown.The Associated Press called the race Wednesday after it became clear there weren’t enough absentee ballots for Brown to overcome Walton’s lead. She had declared victory Tuesday night.As her apparent upset win sunk in, Walton paced on a darkened Buffalo street, putting her hand to her forehead and bowing in disbelief in a moment captured on camera.“Mommy!” the 38-year-old nurse and union representative shouted into her phone. “I won! I’m the mayor of Buffalo!”Walton is all but assured to win the general election in November. There is no Republican candidate in the race.Walton was born in Buffalo’s economically depressed east side and became a working mother at 14. After earning her GED while pregnant, she went on to become a nurse in the same hospital where her twins were born.On the campaign trail, she said Buffalo’s much-talked-about renaissance of recent years, marked by the transformation of the city’s waterfront and medical campus, has passed too many residents by.“All that we are doing in this moment is claiming what is rightfully ours,” Walton told cheering supporters inside a city nightclub. “We are the workers. We do the work. And we deserve a government that works with and for us.”The victory in her first run for office came with the backing of the Democratic Socialists of America and the progressive People's Action in a campaign focused on affordable housing, health care and criminal justice reform.Asked by reporters if she identified as a socialist, she said, “Oh absolutely."“I’m just excited to be a part of this movement that is ushering progressive politics into Buffalo,” she told reporters. “Being the third-poorest mid-sized city in this country, we should be considering how we begin to eradicate concentrated poverty and disadvantage, and Democratic socialist leanings are a big step in getting us there.”Brown, who matched the record for Buffalo's longest-serving mayor and was endorsed by the Erie County Democratic Committee, did not immediately concede following a low-key campaign in which he largely ignored his challengers and declined Walton's request to debate.Both Brown and Walton are Black.A third candidate, Le’Candice Durham, finished last.Brown was a city council member and state senator before becoming mayor.Chris Kutalik Cauthern of DSA USA called Walton's victory “hugely significant” and the first mayoral victory of the growing and more focused “new DSA.”“(It's) the strength of Walton herself, her steady emphasis on working class politics, and the many volunteers in Buffalo who allowed a first-time candidate to beat a four-term incumbent,” he said in an email.One potential opponent for Walton in the general election, Scott Wilson, filed paperwork to appear as a candidate on an independent line, Better Buffalo, but his designating petitions are being challenged for falling short of signatures.Election officials are expected to rule on the matter Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-walton-defeats-buffalo-mayor-in-democratic-primary-101624470318422.html
23-06-2021||World||Heart issues after Covid-19 shots spike to 1,200 cases, says CDC||More than 1,200 cases of heart inflammation have been reported in people who received messenger RNA Covid-19 vaccines, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The numbers were reported at a Wednesday meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which is weighing heart risks from the vaccines. The meeting is expected to be wide-ranging, with discussion of heart inflammation, booster shots and the use of mRNA vaccines in adolescents.More than 130 million Americans have been fully vaccinated with mRNA shots, according to the CDC, and there have been few reports of serious adverse effects. Two-dose Covid-19 vaccine regimens made by Moderna Inc. and partners Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE rely on the technology.Pfizer and BioNTech’s shot was cleared for those 12 to 15 years old in May. About 2 in 10 adolescents among that age group are now fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. Initial safety findings from the U.S. health agency suggest real-world data is consistent with the results from the companies’ clinical trial prior to authorization.Shares of Pfizer were down 1.1% at 12:57 p.m. in New York trading, and BioNTech shares fell 5.2%. Moderna shares were also down 6.7%.The risk of heart inflammation following mRNA vaccination in adolescents and young adults age 12-39 is notably higher a few days after the second dose of the vaccine and in men. More data are needed to understand risk factors, treatment and long-term outcomes, according to the advisory committee.Since April, the CDC has seen a spike in reports of myocarditis along with pericarditis, an inflammation of the membrane around the heart. The cases, while rare, have occurred mostly in male teens and young adults.“We’re observing this in younger age groups, mainly teens and early twenties,” said Tom Shimabukuro, a safety expert of CDC’s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, at the meeting. “This largely disappears when you get to older age groups.”Still, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Wednesday that mRNA vaccines have been successful in preventing severe illness and death among young people.Speaking at the Milken Institute Future of Health Summit, Walensky added that the data presented at the advisory committee meeting will “overwhelmingly demonstrate that the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heart-issues-after-covid-19-shots-spike-to-1-200-cases-says-cdc-101624469922408.html

A further six charges were subsequently added.He pleaded guilty to five counts of dissemination of terrorist publications and 11 counts of possession of a document containing information likely to be useful to a person preparing or committing an act of terrorism.Nugent pleaded not guilty to two counts of encouraging terrorism. The judge however ruled that even though there was sufficient evidence for a prosecution there was no public interest in proceeding on those charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-man-jailed-for-sharing-christchurch-mosque-videos-101624468380752.html
23-06-2021||World||'Likely link' between rare heart inflammation and Pfizer, Moderna vaccines: CDC||Rare cases of heart inflammation in adolescents and young adults is likely linked to vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 shots, a group of doctors advising the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a presentation released on Wednesday.The Covid-19 Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) Work Group said in their report that the risk of myocarditis or pericarditis following vaccination with the mRNA-based shots in adolescents and young adults is notably higher after the second dose and in males.The CDC said in another report that the patients with heart inflammation following vaccination generally recover from the symptoms and do well.The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is meeting on Wednesday to assess the possibility of a link between the heart condition and the mRNA vaccines. VaST is a sub-group of ACIP.The CDC has been investigating cases of heart inflammation mainly in young men for several months. The Israeli health ministry earlier this month said it saw a possible link between such cases and Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine.The CDC earlier this month said it was still evaluating the risk from the condition and did not confirm a causal relationship between the vaccines and the heart issue.The agency, however, said a higher-than-expected number of young men have experienced heart inflammation after their second dose of the mRNA Covid-19 shots, with more than half the cases reported in people between the ages of 12 and 24.Dr. Tom Shimabukuro, deputy director of the CDC's Immunization Safety Office, said in a presentation that data from one of the agency's safety monitoring systems - Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) – suggests a rate of 12.6 cases per million in the three weeks after the second shot in 12- to 39-year-olds.ACIP will discuss the benefits of the mRNA vaccines versus the potential risk to adolescents and young adults from the heart condition, according to the agency's agenda. Although health officials in Israel have determined that there is likely a link between vaccination and the heart inflammation, concerns about the more infectious Delta coronavirus variant have prompted the country to urge 12-to 15-year olds get vaccinated.Pfizer, whose vaccine has been authorized for use in Americans as young as 12, previously said it had not observed a higher rate of heart inflammation than would normally be expected in the general population.Moderna had said it could not identify a causal association with the heart inflammation cases and its vaccine.Over 138 million Americans have so far been fully vaccinated with one of the two mRNA vaccines, according to CDC data as of Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/likely-link-between-rare-heart-inflammation-and-pfizer-moderna-vaccines-cdc-101624468801298.html
23-06-2021||World||Member of Oath Keepers to plead guilty to role in US Capitol attack||An alleged member of the right-wing Oath Keepers militia is due to plead guilty on Wednesday to charges related to the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol by then-President Donald Trump's supporters.The man, Graydon Young, is one of 14 members of the Oath Keepers group charged with crimes including conspiracy and obstruction of an official proceeding for taking part in the assault on Congress, which left five people dead, including a Capitol Police officer.A court filing said a "plea agreement hearing" is scheduled for Wednesday, but did not specify what charges to which the 54-year-old resident of Engelwood, Florida, will plead. Young is the brother of Laura Steele, 52, of Thomasville, North Carolina, who also faces charges in the case.More than 480 people have been arrested and charged with taking part in the unrest, which saw rioters smash windows, battle police inside and outside the Capitol and sent lawmakers and then-Vice President Mike Pence into hiding.The riot followed a fiery speech in which Trump repeated his false claims that his election defeat was the result of widespread fraud and disrupted the formal count by Congress of electoral votes in the race.Federal prosecutors said in court papers that on Dec. 3, Young emailed a membership application to the Oath Keepers' Florida chapter saying he was "looking to get involved in helping."Then, on Dec. 22, the indictment says, Young made plans to fly from Florida to North Carolina on Jan. 4, with a return trip on Jan. 8. On Dec. 26, prosecutors said, he wrote to a Florida company engaged in firearms and combat training: "I have joined Oath Keepers. I recommended your training to the team. To that effect, four of us would like to train with you."The indictment says Young and eight other indicted Oath Keepers, as well as others "known and unknown," pushed their way in a "stack" up the steps on the east side of the Capitol building.His plea hearing is scheduled for 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT) on Wednesday.As described by federal investigators, the Oath Keepers are a loosely organized group of activists who believe that the federal government is encroaching on their rights, who "explicitly focus" on recruiting current and former police, emergency services and military members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/member-of-oath-keepers-to-plead-guilty-to-role-in-us-capitol-attack-101624468365408.html

The Chinese Academy of Sciences reportedly nominated the Wuhan Institute of Virology for conducting "the most comprehensive and systematic identification research on the aetiology of Covid-19.""The project's results have laid an important foundation and platform for the follow-up research on the origin, epidemiology, and pathogenic mechanism of the Covid-19 virus," the Chinese Academy of Sciences was quoted as saying in multiple reports.Shi Zhengli, who directs the Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, also received a special mention from the academy. Last year, Shi, known as batwoman for her work on coronaviruses in bats, said that Sars-CoV-2 was just “the tip of the iceberg” and called for an advanced study of the unknown viruses. However, the virologist has repeatedly dismissed the claims of a possible lab leak.Also Read | What the world wants China to disclose in Wuhan lab leak probeThe hypothesis of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 through a laboratory incident has gained credence in recent weeks, with a renewed demand for a new “transparent” investigation into the virus origin. According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report, the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, which moved a laboratory on December 2, 2019, denied disruptions or incidents caused by the move.China has now been trying to put blame on the United States for the devastating pandemic after the US National Institutes for Health (NIH) published a study that showed at least seven people in five states were infected with Sars-CoV-2 weeks before the country reported its first official cases. Zeng Guang, the chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, has demanded the second phase of investigation into the origins of Covid-19 should be conducted in the United States."All bio-weapons related subjects that the country has should be subject to scrutiny," state-run Global Times quoted Zeng as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-lab-nominated-for-top-science-award-in-china-amid-virus-leak-suspicion-101624464991592.html

23-06-2021||World||UK high court rejects Nirav Modi’s appeal against extradition to India||The UK high court has turned down diamantaire Nirav Modi’s appeal against his extradition to India, leaving him with five days to mount a further appeal in what is expected to be a protracted legal process. In February, the Westminster Magistrates’ Court cleared Nirav Modi’s extradition, finding him guilty of fraud and money laundering in the Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam and dismissing his claims that he wouldn’t get a fair trial in India. UK home secretary Priti Patel subsequently approved the extradition in April. Nirav Modi had approached the UK high court to ascertain if there were any grounds for an appeal against Patel’s decision or the Westminster Magistrates’ Court order. This appeal was rejected by a high court judge on Tuesday. A UK high court official told PTI the permission to appeal was “rejected on paper”, leaving Nirav Modi with the option of making his case at an oral hearing in the high court through a renewed “leave to appeal” application that has to be filed within five days. It is believed Nirav Modi plans to make such an application, and a judge will then determine if the matter should proceed to a full appeal hearing. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Tuesday’s decision by the UK high court was just one step in what is set to be a protracted legal process. There is also speculation that Nirav Modi will have the option of approaching the European Court of Human Rights after exhausting all his legal options in the UK. The 50-year-old businessman has been held at Wandsworth Prison in southwest London since March 2019, when he was arrested on the basis of India’s extradition request. He is the second high-profile economic offender, after former liquor baron Vijay Mallya, whose extradition has been cleared by a trial court in the UK. Mallya lost his appeal against extradition in April 2020, though the British government has said his extradition is being held up by a “confidential legal issue”. Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought the speedy extradition of both economic offenders during a virtual summit with his British counterpart Boris Johnson in May. In its judgement in February, the Westminster Magistrates’ Court had asserted that Nirav Modi has a case to answer and said that he, along with his brother Nehal Modi and others, had defrauded PNB, laundered the money taken from the bank and conspired to destroy evidence and intimidate witnesses. Nirav Modi’s argument that India has poor prison conditions was rejected by Westminster Magistrates’ Court, with the judge saying that conditions at Barrack Number 12 in Arthur Road Jail in Maharashtra, where he will be held, “are far less restrictive and far more spacious than the current regime he is being held in within the prison estate in our own jurisdiction”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-high-court-rejects-nirav-modi-s-appeal-against-extradition-to-india-101624459543637.html

At first, Jillian Cannan thought her business partner had ordered them but the packages were inundated with items that she didn’t want.The woman contacted Amazon to inform them about the mistake so that they can take those packages back. She even posted the situation on her Facebook page to get the attention of the community and local media, thinking it was either a scam or someone was trying to clear their warehouse."When I first started receiving the packages, I called Amazon to try and give them back, but they explained to me that they were officially mine to keep since they had been delivered to my home," NBC News quoted Cannan as saying.Cannan wrote on Facebook that a woman had accused her of staging empty packages for “[five] minutes of fame”, adding that the woman must be fuming after a local news channel covered the story and showed the packages were full of silicone support frames to use inside face masks in both adult and children's sizes.Cannan said that her kids took packs of brackets to the school for their classmates and “found a use for 50 out of the 50,000 brackets.”Also Read | India e-commerce rules cast cloud over Amazon, Walmart and local rivalsAmazon was finally able to trace the original owner and told Cannan that she would have to keep the items already delivered along with over 1,000 boxes that were already in transit.

Among the injured were several policemen manning a checkpoint near the house of Saeed, currently serving a sentence in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail after his conviction for involvement in terror financing. The site of the blast was near Saeed’s residence at BOR Society in Johar Town neighbourhood. A building was severely damaged by the intense explosion, which blew out the windows of nearby structures and hit several cars. The windows and walls of Saeed’s house too were damaged. “As far as the question of the house of a high-value target is concerned, you would have seen there is a [police] picket near the house, and the car couldn’t get close to that house only because of the picket,” Punjab province’s police chief Inam Ghani told reporters at the site of the attack when he was asked if the blast was in any way aimed at Saeed’s house. “If there was no picket, the car could have gone anywhere. You should appreciate that they couldn’t get to any target because of the presence of the police. Our view is that the target was the police and they wanted to undermine law enforcement agencies,” he added. Ghani said there could have been a “major loss” if there had been no police post near Saeed’s house. There was no claim of responsibility for the blast and Ghani said officers were trying to ascertain whether the car bomb was triggered by a suicide attacker or detonated remotely. Ghani confirmed three deaths, and a police spokesman subsequently said a four-year-old child had succumbed to his wounds. Some of the injured, including children, were in critical condition, a spokesman for Jinnah Hospital said. Officials said many of the injured were hit by ball bearings packed into the bomb. Fahim Ahmad, a witness, told reporters that a car parked close to a house had exploded, setting ablaze other cars and motorcycles. Images and footage aired by TV news channels showed badly damaged vehicles and homes, including one building whose walls had collapsed. Additional police forces and bomb disposal teams reached the site soon after the incident. Saeed has for long had a residence in Johar Town. However, he is currently in jail after he was arrested and convicted last year in a string of terror financing cases. Last November, he was sentenced to 10 years in jail after being found guilty of terror financing. Saeed has been designated a terrorist by the UN and the US, which has offered a $10 million bounty for him. The Lashkar-e-Taiba carried out the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people but Saeed was never charged in connection with the carnage. Punjab province chief minister Usman Buzdar sought a report on the incident from the police chief. Pakistan’s interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed also sought a report on the incident from Punjab’s chief secretary and police chief. He said in a tweet that federal agencies were assisting the Punjab government in the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/4-killed-in-car-bomb-attack-short-distance-from-hafiz-saeed-s-house-in-lahore-101624454983331.html

As of Wednesday, the Delta variant raised concerns in countries like France, Germany and Norway.The highly transmissible variant which the experts have termed to be more infectious than other variants is responsible for at least 9-10% of the total new confirmed cases in France, officials said. This is in sharp contrast to 2-4% of the cases seen last week in France.Government spokesman Gabriel Attal on Wednesday said that France is on a watch for countries that can prove to be risky, adding Russia to the list.Russia had been added to the list of countries considered by France as “high-risk” Covid zones, along with Namibia and Seychelles, Attal said.Germany is the second country on Wednesday to have upped its guard against the Delta Variant as Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the country should not risk what it has achieved in its fight against the virus amid a rise in Delta variant cases."Germany's coronavirus infection levels are encouraging but cases of the Delta variant are rising and the country should exercise sound judgment so as not to risk what it has achieved," Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday."The pandemic is not over yet. We are still on thin ice," she told lawmakers in the Bundestag lower house of parliament.The third country on a lookout for cases driven by Delta variant is Norway. The health minister Bent Høie on Wednesday said the Covid-19 variant can become dominant in Norway next month.Hawaii in the US has signalled trouble due to the variant on Wednesday, confirmed the community spread of Covid-19 Delta variant.The island state has recorded two cases on Oahu and one on the Big Island involving travel from the US mainland. One case involves an Oahu resident with no travel history. The state Department of Health said it is “investigating to determine the extent of household and community transmission.”Acting State Epidemiologist Dr Sarah Kemble said of the four cases, only one person was vaccinated.

In a tweet, he called for NATO to cooperate with Ukraine in the Black Sea.Russia seized and annexed the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 and considers areas around the peninsula's coast to be Russian waters. Western countries consider the peninsula part of Ukraine and reject Russia's claim to the seas around it.Russia's defence ministry, quoted by Interfax news agency, said the British ship had left Russian waters soon after the incident, having ventured as much as 3 kilometers (2 miles) inside. It said the confrontation occurred near Cape Fiolent, a landmark on the southern coast of Crimea near the port of Sevastopol, headquarters of the Russian Navy's Black Sea fleet."The destroyer had been warned that weapons would be used if it trespasses the border of the Russian Federation. It did not react to the warning," it said.A Russian bomber dropped four high explosive fragmentation bombs as a warning in the British destroyer's path, according to the Russian ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-forces-reportedly-fire-warning-shots-at-british-destroyer-in-black-sea-101624450496560.html

Google said that in the post-pandemic work model 60% of its employees will meet in offices on a few days of the week and 20% of its workers will be in new office locations. The rest of the ‘Googlers’ will be expected to work from home, according to the report. Google has close to 140,000 employees across the planet.Google chief executive Sundar Pichai reflected on the need for flexibility regarding remote work and changes of location as tech companies reopen their office premises abandoned during the pandemic.“We’ll move to a hybrid work week when most Googlers spend approximately three days in the office and two days wherever they work best. Since in-office time will be focused on collaboration, your product areas, and functions will help decide which day's team will come together in the office. There will also be roles that may need to be on-site more than three days a week due to the nature of the work,” Pichai said in an email addressed to employees, according to a report by technology news website CNET.(with inputs from AFP)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/googles-new-tool-shows-employees-projections-on-salary-based-on-location-101624448287376.html
23-06-2021||World||Biden to launch gun crime strategy, steer Covid funds for police||President Joe Biden will launch a comprehensive plan to curb gun crime, including by allowing states and municipalities to tap into coronavirus relief funding to hire police officers under certain circumstances.Biden will unveil the strategy in a speech on Wednesday, officials familiar with the plan said, speaking on condition of anonymity before the announcement. Measures include toughening rules for gun dealers, expanding summer programs for teenagers and doing more to hire people released from prison.Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland will also lead a meeting Wednesday at the White House on crime prevention. Among those scheduled to attend are New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, Baton Rouge Police Chief Murphy Paul and the mayors of Baltimore, Maryland, and Miami-Dade County, Florida.Biden is initiating the effort as data show a continued increase in violent crime, one that carried through the pandemic, and as Congress continues to negotiate over police reform. Polls have also signaled growing unease over crime, a potential liability for Biden and Democrats in next year’s midterm elections.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday that Biden’s strategy on community safety goes hand-in-hand with the effort by allies to reach a deal on police reform.‘Bully Pulpit’“Yes, there needs to be reforms of police systems across the country; the president is a firm believer in that,” she said. “But there are also steps he can take, as president of the United States, to help address and hopefully reduce that crime. A big part of that, in his view, is putting in place gun safety measures, using -- even as Congress is not moving forward currently -- using the bully pulpit, but also using levers at his disposal, as president.”Cities across the U.S. have experienced increases in violent crime, a trend that Biden’s White House says has been unfolding for years.The plan that the president will discuss on Wednesday has five pillars, the officials said:Some progressive Democrats have also amplified calls to “defund the police,” or redirect money from law enforcement to other community programs. That movement has prompted Republican attacks, which Biden has tried to deflect by instead calling for more money for targeted policing programs.Biden had hoped for a deal on a police reform bill by late May. Senator Tim Scott, the South Carolina Republican who has been heavily involved in the talks, said he thinks it’s “June or bust” to get an agreement.Psaki argued that Biden can move to quell crime without roiling the police reform talks. “Communities across the country who advocate and support police reform, they don’t see it as a mutually exclusive issue; neither does the president,” she said.A Yahoo News/YouGov poll released in May found that 36% of respondents at least somewhat approved of Biden’s handling of crime, while 44% at least somewhat disapproved. Nearly 50% of respondents said crime is a very big problem in the U.S.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-launch-gun-crime-strategy-steer-covid-funds-for-police-101624440441461.html

It said the case was “under investigation.”When asked for comment, an Iranian official referred to the Nournews report. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as they did not have authorization to discuss the matter with the media.Iran's semi-official ISNA news agency said the building was located near Karaj City, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) west the capital of Tehran.The website of state-owned IRAN newspaper published the same report without offering the location or other details.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sabotage-attack-on-nuclear-building-foiled-says-iran-media-101624439385476.html

Xi congratulated the Chinese astronauts and told them that the project is an “important milestone” in the country’s ambitious space exploration programme. He asked after their health and living situation aboard the space station, to which the astronauts answered in affirmative.“We are all very happy to see you are in good shape and the work is going well,” Xi told the astronauts, speaking from the Beijing Aerospace Control Center. “The building of the space station is an important milestone in China’s space industry and it will make a pioneering contribution to the peaceful use of space by mankind.”“We in Beijing await your triumphant return,” he added.The main section of the space station was launched into orbit on April 29 and the space agency has planned a total of 11 launches through the end of 2022 to deliver two additional modules. For the next three months, Chinese astronauts Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo will carry out science experiments, carry out spacewalks and prepare the station for receiving two laboratory modules next year.Also Read | Chinese crewed spaceship Shenzhou-12 docks with new space station module TianheThe astronauts are expected to set a new record for China's longest crewed space mission to date, exceeding the 33 days kept by the Shenzhou-11 crew in 2016.

23-06-2021||World||Rap turns ‘100%’ patriotic in China for Communist party’s 100th birthday||Rap music, usually known for its anti-establishment lyrics and artistes’ rage against society, has turned 100% patriotic in China. The occasion is rather heavy, of course - marking the upcoming 100 years of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC).The song is called 100%, a 15-minute long single, meant to be an ode to China’s history under the CPC.The title, not unexpectedly, refers to both the 100th anniversary of the CPC and the 100 rappers who collaborated to release it, local media said. The idea behind releasing a patriotic rap song was to arouse patriotism among the Chinese youth through pop culture.Hip-Hop Fusion, the music company behind 100%, told the website SixthTon that the song “expresses the patriotic soul of each rapper”.State-run media highlighted the work of rappers from the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR) and Tibet in the song, the remote provinces where the Chinese government has been accused of large-scale human rights violation of minority ethnicities especially, the Uighurs and Tibetans.“Max Ma Jun, an artiste from northwest China’s XUAR expressed “loyalty to the country” and “respect for different voices” in his verse, whereas Buttons, a rapper from Qamdo in southwest China’s Tibet Autonomous Region wrote in the song that ‘the spirit of five stars is imprinted on my chest’,”, the Global Times reported.“From impoverishment to brilliance, I have no regrets that I grew up in a Chinese family in this life,” raps one of the artistes JR Fog.“We used to look forward to the Red Army, a spring breeze all over the Earth. Keep tradition in mind, achieve socialism, as the red flag stays in my heart,” another artiste Colan sings.“New China must get lit,” sings another rapper HEAT J.Many of China’s best-known rappers are missing from the song’s list of collaborators.“Perhaps the biggest (artiste) is Jiang Yunsheng, one of the rising stars in the reality show Rap for Youth in 2020 and who now boasts a legion of over 2 million fans on the microblogging platform Weibo,” reported SixthTone.This is not the first time China’s propaganda apparatus has tried rap to reach out to the youth.In 2019, China’s official news agency, Xinhua, co-produced a rap video entitled Two Sessions: To the World from China to mark the annual session of the parliament - the National People’s Congress - and the country’s top political advisory body.In 2018, the CPC mouthpiece, the People’s Daily, released an animated rap video on Two Sessions, which included vox pop-style interviews with citizens and even a few foreigners.A series of events are being held across China to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the CPC including an ongoing party-wide campaign on CPC history learning and education.On July 1, President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, will deliver an important speech.Xi will also present the July 1 Medal and certificate to party members on the day for contributing to the CPC’s cause.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rap-turns-100-patriotic-in-china-for-communist-party-s-100th-birthday-101624437882730.html

Foreign visitors are banned."We decided that it would be better to do the best preparations we can for a Games with spectators," Hashimoto said at a media roundtable attended by Reuters on Tuesday, saying the decision was in line with the medical experts' recommendations."Of course, I understand that holding the event without spectators would lower the risk, but there is evidence that there have been no clusters at other events and tournaments," Hashimoto said.LIMITING CELEBRATIONSOrganisers said on Wednesday they would decide on whether to allow spectators at night sessions, taking infections into account, by July 12 when virus curbs are due to be lifted in Tokyo and some other areas.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has still not ruled out holding the Games without spectators if Tokyo is put back under a state of emergency, from which it only emerged on June 21. The Games' opening ceremony is set for July 23."The major challenge at the Tokyo Games is to curb a flow of people and limit a sense of celebration," Hashimoto said on Wednesday. "We are striving to make the Tokyo Games safe and secure, so it won't be full of celebration."Many Japanese remain sceptical about the possibility of holding even a scaled-down Games safely during a pandemic.In another blow to organisers' pledge that the Games will be safe, a member of the Ugandan delegation who arrived in Japan on the weekend tested positive for coronavirus despite having been vaccinated and testing negative for Covid-19 before arrival.The nine-strong delegation cancelled their plans to train and are currently quarantining in a hotel, local media reported.Hashimoto said the incident was proof of the effectiveness of the coronavirus measures in place."We were able to identify this person at the border precisely because we have the proper border measures in place," she said.But the arduous preparations for the Olympics also appeared to have taken its toll on organisers.Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike was hospitalised on Tuesday after the metropolitan government said she would take the rest of the week off due to fatigue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/olympics-organisers-ban-alcohol-defend-allowing-spectators-to-curb-covid-spread-101624436298050.html

Over a 1,000kg of illegal drugs were seized, including 444kg of cocaine, 182kg of crystal meth, 427kg of marijuana, and 300 oxycodone pills. Police also seized 21 vehicles, including five tractor-trailers, 966,020 Canadian dollars in cash and a firearm.The tractor-trailers were being used to transport drugs between Mexico, the United States and Canada. Multiple law enforcement agencies participated in the operation, including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Ontario Provincial Police, York Regional Police, Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), Windsor Police Service, Montreal Police, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, while Canadian police collaborated with the United States Department of Homeland Security and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration.Of those arrested, nine are of Indian-origin: Gurbakhash Singh Grewal, 37, of Brampton, Amarbir Singh Sarkaria, 25, of Caledon, Harbaljit Singh Toor, 46, of Caledon, Harwinder Bhullar, 43, of Caledon, Sarjant Singh Dhaliwal, 37, of Kitchener, Gurveer Dhaliwal, 26, of Kitchener, Gurmanpreet Grewal, 26, of Kitchener, Sukhwant Brar, 37, of Brampton and Parminder Gill, 33, of Brampton.“The removal of this quantity of drugs destined for the streets of our respective communities has without question prevented countless overdoses, acts of drug-related violence like shootings, and other occurrences that diminish the quality of life for our citizens,” Toronto Police chief James Ramer said.“When such networks are operating across three countries, Canada, the US and Mexico, ongoing collaboration between agencies, including CBSA is vital,” York Regional Police chief Jim MacSween said.The name for the operation was derived from the first seizure, when Toronto police’s drug squad raided a tractor-trailer carrying a consignment of hair dryers.This follows another major bust announced in April this year. In an operation dubbed Project Cheetah, law enforcement led by the York Regional Police arrested and charged over two dozen people and seized about 2.3 million Canadian dollars ($1.86 million) worth of drugs which included 10kg of cocaine, 8kg of ketamine, 3kg of heroin and 2.5kg of opium.

23-06-2021||World||Bitcoin bounces back after tumbling below $30,000 threshold||woBitcoin extended gains in Asia trading Wednesday, bouncing back after earlier whipsawing investors with a dip below the $30,000 level.The largest cryptocurrency rose as much as 4.5% and was trading at $33,837 as of 9:38 a.m. in Hong Kong. The coin plunged 12% at one point during U.S. trading hours Tuesday to hit $28,824, which briefly took it into negative territory for the year. Prior to that, it hadn’t fallen below $30,000 since January.Bitcoin has lost more than 50% from its mid-April high of almost $65,000. The coin started 2021 trading around $29,000 following a fourfold increase in 2020.Such trading signals “that Bitcoin traders could find themselves in choppy waters for weeks to come,” said Sean Rooney, head of research at crypto asset manager Valkyrie Investments.Chart-watchers said Bitcoin, which failed to stay above $40,000 last week, could have a tough time finding support in the $20,000 range following its drop below $30,000. Still, Bitcoin had prior to Tuesday breached $30,000 during at least five separate instances this year but recuperated to trade above that level each time.“Any meaningful break below $30,000 is going to make a lot of momentum players to throw in the towel,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist for Miller Tabak + Co. “Therefore, even if Bitcoin is going to change the world over the long-term, it does not mean it cannot fall back into the teens over the short-term.”It’s a remarkable comedown for the digital asset which just weeks ago was trekking higher amid a warmer embrace from Wall Street as well as retail investors. But negative attention about its energy use, brought on largely by Tesla Inc.’s Elon Musk, as well as a clampdown from China have pushed it lower in recent weeks.China’s latest broadside came Monday, when the nation’s central bank said it had summoned officials from the biggest lenders as well as AliPay to reiterate a ban on cryptocurrency services. Chinese officials are already trying to root out crypto mining operations.“Bitcoin’s continued sell-off has contributed to a negative outlook by traders driven by bearish news out of China,” said Nick Mancini, research analyst at crypto sentiment analytics provider Trade The Chain. “The mood among traders is now continuing to sour.”Exuberant rallies and quick drawdowns are not uncommon for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin underwent a renaissance in 2017, rising more than 1,000% that year, only to lose roughly 75% in the following year. And last year, it advanced 300%.“The most speculative part of the market is cryptocurrency,” said Eric Diton, president and managing director of The Wealth Alliance. “At the end of the day, what determines the value of Bitcoin is acceptance and more demand and supply. When you have a country like China come out against Bitcoin, that really hurts it’s global acceptance and that’s why you’re seeing the value deteriorate as much as it has.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bitcoin-bounces-back-after-tumbling-below-30-000-threshold-101624414613796.html

The training included “safe marksmanship” and “countering an attack”, according to the NYT report, which quoted the company to say that it was devised to better protect Saudi leaders.The news report further points out that the American officials who approved the training knew the Saudis were involved in the crackdown.Responding to the NYT report, state department spokesperson Ned Price said the department cannot comment "on any of the licensed defence export licensing activity alleged in media reporting". Price also said US policy towards Saudi Arabia "will prioritise the rule of law and respect for human rights."Cerberus senior executive Louis Bremer confirmed his company's role in the training of four members of the Khashoggi kill team last year in written answers to questions from members of Congress as part of his nomination for a senior Pentagon job in former President Donald Trump's administration, according to NYT.But, NYT said, the lawmakers never received the answers because the Trump administration does not appear to have sent them to Congress before withdrawing Bremer’s nomination.Khashoggi, a US resident who wrote opinion columns for the Washington Post critical of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed and dismembered by a team of operatives linked to the prince in the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. A US intelligence report in February said the crown prince had approved an operation to capture or kill the journalist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudis-who-killed-jamal-khashoggi-received-paramilitary-training-in-us-report-101624414318964.html
23-06-2021||World||Indian-American Kiran Ahuja to head US Office of Personnel Management||US Vice President Kamala Harris has cast her tie-breaking vote in the bitterly divided Senate to confirm the nomination of Indian-American Kiran Ahuja as the head of the Office of Personnel Management, a federal agency that manages the country's more than two million civil servants.Also Read: Joe Biden names Indian-American Kiran Ahuja to head key agencyAn American lawyer and activist, Ahuja, 49, is the first Indian-American to serve in this top position in the US government. Harris announced to cast her vote in favour of Ahuja on Tuesday after the Senate vote on this resulted in 50-50 votes on party lines."The Senate being evenly divided, the Vice President votes in affirmative,” Harris said. With this, she has so far cast the 6th tie-breaking vote as the Vice President this year.Also Read: Who is Kiran Ahuja, Biden's choice for the US Office of Personnel Management?Senator Dianne Feinstein said Ahuja has more than two decades of experience in public service and the philanthropic sector, including a senior role in OPM under former president Barack Obama.“She has a breadth of knowledge and experience that will serve her well in the role,” she said.“In particular I’m looking forward to working with her to resolve a critical pay disparity issue between state and federal wildland firefighters. State firefighter salaries can be as much as double that of their federal counterparts, making it difficult to hire and retain skilled federal wildland firefighters,” she added.Representing the view of the opposition Republicans, Senator James Lankford said he did not believe the head of HR of the federal government should be so outspokenly in favour of abortion and pushing the need for critical race theory training.“OPM has been plagued with paperwork backlogs, survivor benefit delays, cyber-security issues, and more. The leader of OPM should focus on addressing those issues, not divisive social justice policies and abortion,” he said.Ahuja served as the Chief of Staff to the Director of the US Office of Personnel Management from 2015 to 2017. She currently serves as the CEO of Philanthropy Northwest, a regional network of philanthropic institutions.She began her career as a civil rights lawyer at the US Department of Justice, litigating school desegregation cases, and filing the department’s first student racial harassment case. From 2003 to 2008, Ahuja served as the founding executive director of the National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum, an advocacy and membership organisation.During the Obama-Biden Administration, she spent six years as executive director of the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, leading efforts to increase access to federal services, resources and programs for underserved Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs).Ahuja grew up in Savannah, Georgia, as a young Indian immigrant in the wake of the civil rights era, and earned a bachelor’s degree in political science from Spelman College and a law degree from the University of Georgia.“Throughout her career, Kiran Ahuja has built a tremendous record of championing federal personnel matters & remains a strong advocate for women of color,” said Senator Raphael Warnock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kiran-ahuja-confirmed-as-head-of-us-office-of-personnel-management-101624413621753.html
23-06-2021||World||Great Barrier Reef downgraded: Other UN World Heritage sites in danger||The World Heritage Committee under UNESCO has proposed to downgrade the status of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, recommending it to be added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger. The committee said it's recommendation is based on the detrimental impact of climate change.Irked by the decision, Australia said it will challenge UNESCO's draft recommendation. "For us to be singled out in a way that completely distorts the normal process was something we were very strong about. And we made the point that we will challenge this decision when it comes before the full committee later on in July," Environment minister Sussan Ley said, noting that the authorities were "blindsided by a sudden late decision".UNESCO's proposal also sparked an outcry among representatives of tourism businesses, as they fear the inclusion in the list of sites in danger will affect the industry.Here are the other places that risk losing their treasured heritage site status:VeniceUNESCO said that the city in Italy has been damaged by "overtourism", and recommended adding Venice to its endangered heritage list.The UN body acknowledged that the number of tourists have "drastically decreased" during the Covid-19 pandemic, but the damage has already been done and called for more sustainable tourism.BudapestThe Hungarian city, bisected by river Danube, has been put on the endangered list because of a major renovation of the Buda Castle quarter. The move is aimed at restoring the city's pre-World War 2 glory.But UNESCO argues that the reconstruction flouts international conservation norms and called for the work be halted.LiverpoolThe maritime city in England has faced the greatest fury of UNESCO, which has recommended taking Liverpool off the World Heritage list altogether.The reason for the harsh decision is the redevelopment of Liverpool's historic waterfront and northern dock area. UNESCO chided the city for failing to cap the heights for new buildings.Tanzania game reserveThe granting of logging rights inside the Selous Game Reserve has landed it in hot water with UNESCO. The UN had recently expressed alarm over the construction of a dam on the Rufiji river, the country's largest.Lamenting Tanzania's decision to forge ahead with the project, despite the ecological threat to the floodplain, UNESCO says the reserve's "outstanding" character has suffered "irreversible" damage and recommended that it be taken off the World Heritage list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/great-barrier-reef-downgraded-other-un-world-heritage-sites-in-danger-101624413178187.html

23-06-2021||World||US blocks websites linked to Iranian disinformation||The U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday it seized 36 Iranian-linked websites, many of them associated with either disinformation activities or violent organizations, taking them offline for violating U.S. sanctions.Several of the sites were back online within hours with new domain addresses."Today, pursuant to court orders, the United States seized 33 websites used by the Iranian Islamic Radio and Television Union (IRTVU) and three websites operated by Kata’ib Hizballah (KH), in violation of U.S. sanctions," the department said in a statement.Also spelled Kataib Hezbollah, KH is one of the main Iran-aligned Iraqi militia groups and has been designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the United States.The sites seized included Press TV, the Iranian government's main English-language satellite television channel, and Al Alam, its Arabic-language equivalent. Both came back online using Iranian domain addresses Alalam.ir and Presstv.ir.The Justice Department said the 33 domains used by IRTVU are owned by a United States company and that IRTVU did not obtain a license from Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control prior to utilizing the domain names.KH also did not obtain a license.Notices appeared earlier on Tuesday on a number of Iran-affiliated websites saying they had been seized by the United States government as part of law enforcement action.Iranian news agencies said the U.S. government had seized several Iranian media websites and sites belonging to groups affiliated with Iran such as Yemen's Houthi movement.The notices appeared days after a prominent hardliner and fierce critic of the West, Ebrahim Raisi, was elected as Iran's new president and after envoys for Iran and six world powers, including Washington, adjourned high-stakes talks on reviving their tattered 2015 nuclear accord and returned to capitals for consultations.The website of the Arabic-language Masirah TV, which is run by the Houthis, read:"The domain almasirah.net has been seized by the United States Government in accordance with a seizure warrant ... as part of a law enforcement action by the Bureau of Industry and Security, Office of Export Enforcement and Federal Bureau of Investigation."The site quickly opened up a new, working website at www.almasirah.com.Iran's Arabic language Alalam TV said on its Telegram channel: "U.S. authorities shut down Al-Alam TV's website."Notices also appeared on the website of Lualua TV, an Arabic-language Bahraini independent channel that broadcasts from Britain.U.S. prosecutors in October seized a network of web domains they said were used in a campaign by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to spread political disinformation around the world.The Justice Department said then it had taken control of 92 domains used by the IRGC to pose as independent media outlets targeting audiences in the United States, Europe, Middle East and Southeast Asia.The semi-official Iranian news agency YJC agency said on Tuesday the U.S. move "demonstrates that calls for freedom of speech are lies."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-blocks-websites-linked-to-iranian-disinformation-101624412155076.html
23-06-2021||World||Australia hits out at threatened UN downgrade of Great Barrier Reef||Australia said Tuesday it will strongly oppose a UNESCO plan to list the Great Barrier Reef as being "in danger" over deterioration caused by climate change.The UN body released a draft report on Monday recommending the reef's World Heritage status be downgraded because of its dramatic coral decline, after years of public threats to do so."It's a warning to the international community and all of humanity that the coral ecosystem is in danger," Fanny Douvere, the head of UNESCO's World Heritage marine programme, told an online press briefing.The reef is one of seven sites threatened with being added to the endangered heritage list over ecological damage, overdevelopment, overtourism or security concerns.The Italian city of Venice, which has been overrun with tourists, and the waterfront of the English city of Liverpool, which is undergoing a major redevelopment, are among the other listings in UNESCO's sights.Environmental campaigners said the threat to the Great Barrier Reef's heritage status highlight Australia's lack of action to curb the carbon emissions which contribute to global warming.Environment Minister Sussan Ley said Australia would challenge the move, accusing UN officials of backflipping on their assurances ahead of the World Heritage Committee's 44th session in China next month, where the recommendation will be formally considered."Politics have subverted a proper process and for the World Heritage Committee to not even foreshadow this listing is, I think, appalling," she told reporters in Canberra.The UN body did not consider the billions of dollars spent attempting to protect the world's largest coral reef, she added.- 'From poor to very poor' -The committee's draft report did commend Australia's efforts to improve reef quality and its financial commitment.But it noted "with the utmost concern and regret... that the long-term outlook for the ecosystem of the property has further deteriorated from poor to very poor," referring to Australia's move to downgrade the reef's health status after back-to-back mass bleaching events in 2016 and 2017.Ley said she had spoken to UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay overnight Monday to express "very clearly our strong disappointment, even bewilderment".Placement on the UN body's in-danger list is not considered a sanction. According to UNESCO, some nations have their sites added to gain international attention and help to save them, but it is seen as a dishonour by others.UNESCO has recommended that a total of seven sites be added to the endangered list and that two sites -- Liverpool's waterfront and Selous game reserve in Tanzania, where poachers have run amok -- be stripped of their World Heritage status altogether.Australia has resisted calls to commit to a target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison saying the country hoped to reach carbon neutrality "as soon as possible" without harming its commodity-dependent economy.The downgrade recommendation for the Great Barrier Reef prompted environmental groups to take aim at the Australian government's reluctance to take stronger climate action.- 'Shame' -The Climate Council said it brought "shame on the federal government, which is standing by as the reef declines rather than fighting to protect it"."The recommendation from UNESCO is clear and unequivocal that the Australian government is not doing enough to protect our greatest natural asset, especially on climate change," said WWF head of oceans Richard Leck.UNESCO's Douvere acknowledged that Australia had made "tremendous efforts" to shore up the reef."The Australian government cannot save the Great Barrier Reef by itself," she said, while adding that Canberra could act to improve water quality at the reef, which would increase its resilience to climate change.Aside from its inestimable natural, scientific and environmental value, the 2,300-kilometre-long (1,400-mile-long) reef was worth an estimated US$4.8 billion a year in tourism revenue for the Australian economy before the coronavirus pandemic.In December, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) said climate change had pushed the reef into critical condition.Australian Marine Conservation Society environmental consultant Imogen Zethoven said the UNESCO report made clear that limiting global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels was critical for the reef."Australia's climate record is more consistent with a 2.5-3.0 Celsius rise in global average temperature -- a level that would destroy the Great Barrier Reef and all the world's coral reefs," she said.The Great Barrier Reef has now suffered three mass coral bleaching events in the past five years, losing half its corals since 1995 as ocean temperatures have climbed.The reef has also been battered by several cyclones as climate change drives more extreme weather and outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish -- which eat the coral -- in recent decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-hits-out-at-threatened-un-downgrade-of-great-barrier-reef-101624411864389.html

23-06-2021||World||US betting on antiviral pills to treat Covid-19; to spend $3.2B on treatments||The United States is pouring $3.2 billion to speed development of antiviral pills to treat coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and other dangerous viruses that could turn into pandemics.The new program will invest in “accelerating things that are already in progress” for Covid-19 but also would work to come up with treatments for other viruses, said Dr Anthony Fauci, US' top infectious disease expert.“There are few treatments that exist for many of the viruses that have pandemic potential. Vaccines clearly remain the centerpiece of our arsenal,” he said, including Ebola, dengue, West Nile and Middle East respiratory syndrome.The US has approved one antiviral drug, remdesivir, specifically for Covid-19 and allowed emergency use of three antibody therapies that help the immune system fight the coronavirus.Health experts have increasingly called for a convenient pill that patients could take themselves when symptoms first appear. Some drugmakers are testing such medications, but initial results aren’t expected for several more months.Last week, the US said it would purchase 1.7 million doses of an experimental antiviral pill from Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, if it is shown to be safe and effective. Early research suggests the drug may reduce the risk of hospitalization if used shortly after infection by stopping the coronavirus from quickly reproducing. It did not benefit patients who were already hospitalized with severe disease.Several other companies, including Pfizer, Roche and AstraZeneca are also testing antiviral pills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-betting-on-antiviral-pills-to-treat-covid-19-to-spend-3-2b-on-treatments-101624409937319.html
23-06-2021||World||Hunger, drought, disease: UN climate report reveals dire health threats||Hunger, drought and disease will afflict tens of millions more people within decades, according to a draft UN assessment that lays bare the dire human health consequences of a warming planet.After a pandemic year that saw the world turned on its head, a forthcoming report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), seen exclusively by AFP, offers a distressing vision of the decades to come: malnutrition, water insecurity, pestilence.Policy choices made now, like promoting plant-based diets, can limit these health consequences -- but many are simply unavoidable in the short term, the report says.It warns of the cascading impacts that simultaneous crop failures, falling nutritional value of basic foods, and soaring inflation are likely to have on the world's most vulnerable people.Depending on how well humans get a handle on carbon emissions and rising temperatures, a child born today could be confronted with multiple climate-related health threats before turning 30, the report shows.The IPCC's 4,000-page draft report, scheduled for release next year, offers the most comprehensive rundown to date of the impacts of climate change on our planet and our species.It predicts that up to 80 million more people than today will be at risk of hunger by 2050.It projects disruptions to the water cycle that will see rain-fed staple crops decline across sub-Saharan Africa. Up to 40 percent of rice-producing regions in India could become less suitable for farming the grain.Global maize production has already declined four percent since 1981 due to climate change, and human-induced warming in West Africa has reduced millet and sorghum yields by up to 20 and 15 percent respectively, it shows.The frequency of sudden food production losses has already increased steadily over the past 50 years."The basis for our health is sustained by three pillars: the food we eat, access to water, and shelter," Maria Neira, director of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health at the World Health Organization, told AFP."These pillars are totally vulnerable and about to collapse."- Emerging hotspots -Even as rising temperatures affect the availability of key crops, nutritional value is declining, according to the report.The protein content of rice, wheat, barley and potatoes, for example, is expected to fall by between six and 14 percent, putting close to 150 million more people at risk of protein deficiency.Essential micronutrients -- already lacking in many diets in poorer nations -- are also set to decline as temperatures rise.Extreme weather events made more frequent by rising temperatures will see "multi-breadbasket failures" hit food production ever more regularly, the report predicts.As climate change reduces yields, and demand for biofuel crops and CO2-absorbing forests grows, food prices are projected to rise as much as a third at 2050, bringing an additional 183 million people in low-income households to the edge of chronic hunger.Across Asia and Africa, 10 million more children than now will suffer from malnutrition and stunting by mid-century, saddling a new generation with life-long health problems -- despite greater socioeconomic development.As with most climate impacts, the effects on human health will not be felt equally: the draft suggests that 80 percent of the population at risk of hunger live in Africa and Southeast Asia."There are hotspots emerging," Elizabeth Robinson, professor of environmental economics at the University of Reading, told AFP."If you overlay where people are already hungry with where crops are going to be most harmed by climate you see that it's the same places that are already suffering from high malnutrition."- Water crisis looming -It doesn't end there.The report outlines in the starkest terms so far the fate potentially awaiting millions whose access to safe water will be thrown into turmoil by climate change.Just over half the world's population is already water insecure, and climate impacts will undoubtedly make that worse.Research looking at water supply, agriculture and rising sea levels shows that between 30 million and 140 million people will likely be internally displaced in Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America by 2050, the report says.Up to three quarters of heavily tapped groundwater supply -- the main source of potable water for 2.5 billion people -- could also be disrupted by mid-century.The rapid melting of mountain glaciers has already "strongly affected the water cycle", an essential source for two billion people that could "create or exacerbate tensions over water resources", according to the report.And while the economic cost of climate's effect on water supply varies geographically, it is expected to shave half a percent off global GDP by 2050."Water is one of the issues that our generation is going to confront very soon," said Neira."There will be massive displacement, massive migration, and we need to treat all of that as a global issue."- 'Fault lines' -As the warming planet expands habitable zones for mosquitoes and other disease-carrying species, the draft warns that half the world's population could be exposed to vector-borne pathogens such as dengue, yellow fever and Zika virus by mid-century.Risks posed by malaria and Lyme disease are set to rise, and child deaths from diarrhoea are on track to increase until at least mid-century, despite greater socioeconomic development in high-incidence countries.The report also shows how climate change will increase the burden of non-communicable illnesses.Diseases associated with poor air quality and exposure to ozone, such as lung and heart conditions, will "rise substantially", it says."There will also be increased risks of food and water-related contamination" by marine toxins, it adds.As with most climate-related impacts, these diseases will ravage the world's most vulnerable.The Covid-19 pandemic has already exposed that reality.The report shows how the pandemic, while boosting international cooperation, has revealed many nations' vulnerability to future shocks, including those made inevitable by climate change."Covid has made the fault lines in our health systems extremely visible," said Stefanie Tye, research associate at the World Resources Institute's Climate Resilience Practice, who was not involved in the IPCC report."The effects and shocks of climate change will strain health systems even more, for a much longer period, and in ways that we are still trying to fully grasp."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hunger-drought-disease-un-climate-report-reveals-dire-health-threats-101624410392258.html

Beijing must allow UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet and other independent observers “immediate, meaningful and unfettered access” to Xinjiang, and end the “arbitrary detention” of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities, it said.“Credible reports indicate that over a million people have been arbitrarily detained in Xinjiang and that there is widespread surveillance disproportionately targeting Uighurs and members of other minorities and restrictions on fundamental freedoms and Uighur culture,” it said.The statement cited reports of torture or cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment or punishment, forced sterilisation, sexual and gender-based violence, and forced separation of children from their parents. China denies mistreating the Uighurs and insists it is simply running vocational training centres designed to counter extremism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/concerns-raised-about-china-at-un-101624410111587.html
23-06-2021||World||Nations relying on Chinese Covid-19 vaccines now see spike in cases: Report||Countries like Mongolia, Seychelles and Bahrain relied on Covid-19 vaccines made by China to combat the coronavirus pandemic, but are now battling a surge in infections, according to a report in New York Times (NYT).Examples from several countries suggest that the Chinese vaccines may not be very effective at preventing the spread of the coronavirus, particularly the new variants, the NYT report said.In Seychelles, Chile, Bahrain and Mongolia, about 50 to 68% of the populations have been fully inoculated with Chinese vaccines, outpacing the United States, according to Our World in Data, quoted by the NYT. However, they are also among the top 10 countries with the worst Covid-19 outbreaks."If the vaccines are sufficiently good, we should not see this pattern. The Chinese have a responsibility to remedy this," Jin Dongyan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong, told the leading US daily.Seychelles, which relied mostly on Sinopharm, reported more than 716 Covid-19 cases per million. Mongolia, relying on Chinese aid, quickly rolled out an inoculation program and eased restrictions, vaccinating 52 per cent of its population. However, it recorded 2,400 new infections on Sunday, a quadrupling from a month before.Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates were the first two countries to approve the Sinopharm shot, even before late-stage clinical trial data was released. Since then, there have been extensive reports of vaccinated people falling ill in both countries, NYT reported.In a statement, however, China's foreign ministry said it did not see a link between the recent outbreaks and its vaccines. It cited the World Health Organization (WHO) as saying that vaccination rates in certain countries had not reached sufficient levels to prevent outbreaks, and that countries needed to continue to maintain controls, according to NYT."Relevant reports and data also show that many countries that use Chinese-made vaccines have expressed that they are safe and reliable, and have played a good role in their epidemic prevention efforts," the ministry said.While the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have efficacy rates of more than 90%, China's Sinopharm vaccine has an efficacy rate of 78.% and the Sinovac vaccine has an efficacy rate of 51%.Despite the spike in Covid-19 cases, officials in both the Seychelles and Mongolia have defended Sinopharm, saying it is effective in preventing severe cases of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nations-relying-on-chinese-covid-19-vaccines-now-see-spike-in-cases-report-101624408699575.html
23-06-2021||World||EU launches antitrust probe against Google||The EU launched a wide-ranging antitrust probe against internet giant Google on Tuesday over concerns that it is using its technology to keep out rivals in the lucrative online advertising market.The case opens yet another front by the European Commission against the search engine giant, which has already received eight billion euros ($9 billion) in fines for its anti-competitive practices.The investigation will “assess whether Google has violated EU competition rules by favouring its own online display advertising technology services”, a statement from the EU executive said.The probe narrows in on an important component of Google’s profit-making machine: more than 80% of the giant’s revenue in 2020 came from advertising, or $147 billion.“We are concerned that Google has made it harder for rival online advertising services to compete” in display ad technology, said EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager.At issue is Google’s largely unnoticed, but highly dominant technologies that serve as an intermediary or broker between advertisers and publishers online.Google owned technologies include services such as AdX, Doubleclick or AdSense that power much of the EU’s display advertising market for web pages and apps, which the commission estimated to be worth about 20 billion euros in 2019.The business was at the heart of a recent case in France - brought by News Corp, French daily Le Figaro and Belgium’s Groupe Rossel - that saw Google fined 220 million euros ($267 million).It is also central to blockbuster cases in the US where state prosecutors accuse the company of rigging the ad-tech market and snuffing out rivals.As in the other cases, the EU will try to determine whether Google gave preferential treatment to its own ad inventory technologies AdX and Doubleclick, but will also look at other aspects of the ad-tech business.Crucially, the probe will also look into Google’s announced plans to prohibit the placement of third party “cookies” on its Chrome browser, a move that has angered some publishers and advertisers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-launches-antitrust-probe-against-google-101624408135081.html

In proportion to its population, Colombia is reporting the fourth worst death toll in Latin America and Caribbean, and the sixth for the number of cases.US set to miss July 4 goalThe administration of US President Joe Biden on Tuesday conceded it won’t meet its goal of administering one or more doses of a Covid vaccine to 70% of American adults by July 4. “We think it’ll take a few extra weeks to get to 70% of all adults with at least one shot,” said Jeffrey Zients, head of the White House Covid response team.North Korea has told the WHO that it has tested more than 30,000 people for the coronavirus through June 10, but has yet to find a single infection. Health experts doubt North Korea’s claim that it has not had a single case of the coronavirus.Abu Dhabi has reportedly started offering free coronavirus vaccines to tourists flying into the emirate, a move that could help revive the UAE’s struggling tourism industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/poorest-countries-out-of-jabs-who-101624407883913.html
23-06-2021||World||China’s bid to join trade pact raises alarms, says US lawmaker||China’s efforts to join a regional trade deal that originally aimed to exclude Beijing “should set off alarm bells” in Washington, where a growing number of lawmakers are calling for the U.S. to re-assert its influence in Asia, according to a key U.S. senator overseeing trade.“If you aren’t at the table, you may well end up on the menu,” Senator Tom Carper, a Delaware Democrat who chairs the Senate finance subcommittee on international trade, told a hearing on Asia-Pacific trade policy Tuesday. “We need to take China’s interest seriously and begin the hard work of developing a comprehensive policy toward re-engagement with our allies in this part of the world.”The U.S. had originally envisioned the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership as an economic bloc to balance China’s growing power, with then-President Barack Obama saying in 2016 that Washington, not China, should write the regional rules of trade. His successor Donald Trump pulled out of the deal in 2017, describing it as a “potential disaster” for the U.S., and Japan led the revised and renamed pact to a conclusion the following year.Bloomberg News reported last month that officials from Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and possibly other nations have held technical talks with Chinese counterparts on details of the CPTPP. China announced in February it had held informal talks with some of the members, but didn’t release details.Carper and John Cornyn, a Texas Republican who is the committee’s ranking member, in May wrote to U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai asking her to provide direction on engaging with allies in the Asia-Pacific region -- and calling Trump’s decision to withdraw from the trade pact a “missed opportunity” to strengthen U.S. leadership there.“Our national security must come first,” Cornyn said at the hearing. “We have to identify smart, democratic measures that take into account the unfair trade practices, the human-rights and censorship abuses deployed by our adversaries, while making targeted investments in trade relations with our allies that abide by rules-based international trading system.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-bid-to-join-trade-pact-raises-alarms-says-us-lawmaker-101624404619325.html
23-06-2021||World||US likely to miss July 4 Covid-19 vaccination target||The White House on Tuesday acknowledged that President Joe Biden's administration is likely to fall short of his stated goal of vaccinating 70 per cent of American adults with at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine by July 4."We set 70 per cent of adults as our aspirational target. We have met or exceeded it for most of our population. This is a remarkable achievement... Today, nearly 80 per cent of people 65 and older are fully vaccinated... For Americans who are 40 years old and over, 75 per cent have received at least one shot. For Americans 30 and older, we have met the President's goal of one shot. That's right, we have met the President's 70 per cent goal of all Americans 30 and over," he said.Zients added that the nation has much to do in the age group of 18-26 as they have been less eager in receiving the jab. "However, with the Delta variant now spreading across the country and infecting younger people worldwide, it's is more important than ever that they get vaccinated," he added.The White House Covid-19 response coordinator further said that it will take "a few extra weeks" to get 70 percent of all adults 18 and over with at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, adding that the administration would meet Biden's second July 4 goal of getting 160 million Americans fully vaccinated "no later than mid-July."According to The Hill, Biden has received much more positive ratings for his coronavirus response than his predecessor, former President Donald Trump. He had announced last week that 300 million coronavirus vaccine shots had been administered in his first 150 days.Meanwhile, the White House is planning a large outdoor gathering on July 4 for military members, first responders and essential workers that will mark the progress against the deadly pandemic."The virus is in retreat in communities across the country. We are entering a summer of joy, a summer of freedom. This is cause for celebration and that's exactly what Americans will be able to do on July 4. Celebrate independence from the virus," said Zients during the briefing.According to the Covid response coordinator, 16 states and Washington have already met Biden's target for adults 18 and above, but some red states have lagged behind in vaccination rates.On Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that vaccine rates for younger Americans have not reached those for older adults. All adults age 18 and up became eligible to receive coronavirus vaccines in mid-April, The Hill reported.The new Delta variant has also added urgency to the White House's efforts to get more Americans vaccinated."It's a variant that is more easily transmissible, potentially deadlier, and particularly dangerous for young people. But the good news is, we have the solution. The science and the data are clear: The best way to protect yourself against these variants are to get fully vaccinated," Biden said in remarks from the White House last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-likely-to-miss-july-4-covid-19-vaccination-target-101624404631218.html
23-06-2021||World||Nearly 900 Secret Service employees caught Covid-19: Officials||Roughly 900 US Secret Service employees tested positive for the coronavirus, according to government records obtained by a government watchdog group.Secret Service records show that 881 people on the agency payroll were diagnosed with Covid-19 between March 1, 2020 and March 9, 2021, according to documents obtained by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. More than 11% of Secret Service employees were infected.Secret Service spokesperson Justine Whelan said Covid-19 testing of employees was pro-active with more than 25,000 tests being administered."The Secret Service’s essential law enforcement mission required agency employees to remain in continuous contact with the public during the pandemic," Whelan said. “Now and throughout the pandemic, the Secret Service was fully prepared and staffed to successfully meet these challenges.”The records received through a Freedom of Information Act request did not include the names or assignments of those who tested positive. But more than half — 477 — worked in the special agent division, which is responsible for protecting the president and vice president, as well as the families of these leaders and other government officials.CREW noted that the Trump administration took actions that risked exposure to Secret Service workers, but it could not verify a direct connection to possible infections because the identities of those infected remains private.After President Donald Trump contracted Covid-19, he took a drive in his presidential vehicle as Secret Service personnel drove and protected him. The former president also held multiple large rallies and events, including the announcement of Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court, despite restrictions on public gatherings.The Secret Service employs approximately 3,200 special agents, 1,300 Uniformed Division officers, and more than 2,000 other technical, professional and administrative support personnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-900-secret-service-employees-caught-covid19-101624392775766.html
23-06-2021||World||American Airlines cut hundreds of flights as summer season starts||American Airlines will cut hundreds of flights over the next three weeks to avoid overloading its operation as demand for summer air travel rises faster than once expected.Spokeswoman Sarah Jantz said Tuesday that the cuts could average 50 to 60 flights a day the rest of June and between 50 and 80 a day in the first half of July. That is potentially more than 1% of its schedule.On Tuesday, the airline had scrubbed 130 flights and more than 200 others were delayed by afternoon Central time, according to tracking service FlightAware.Jantz said the cuts are “building in additional resilience and certainty to our operation.” She said American is making the most cuts on routes where it has multiple flights to provide backup options for rebooking passengers on other planes.Leisure travel is picking up as more Americans get vaccinated against Covid-19 and states continue to ease travel restrictions. More than 2 million travelers passed through airport security checkpoints Sunday and again Monday, with Sunday’s crowds marking the highest number in 15 months, although still below 2019 levels.American and other US airlines have been barred from furloughing workers during the pandemic as a condition of billions they received in federal aid to help cover payrolls. However, American encouraged thousands of workers to quit or retire and now finds itself with a smaller staff as travel demand approaches pre-pandemic levels.Jantz said American has employees on reserve, but bad weather at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina can cause crews to exceed federal limits on how long they can work. She said the airline is also affected by labor shortages at vendors that provide catering drivers and people who push wheelchairs.The cutbacks come after American moved aggressively to restore service that was cut during the pandemic. American had scheduled around 5,800 flights a day through July, about 87% of its schedule for the same period in 2019, according to data from aviation researcher Cirium.The airline industry’s difficulties this month haven’t been limited to American, which is based in Fort Worth, Texas. Last week, technology problems caused Dallas-based Southwest Airlines to delay several thousand flights and cancel hundreds more. More than 400 Southwest flights were running behind on Tuesday, according to FlightAware.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/american-airlines-cut-hundreds-of-flights-as-summer-season-starts-101624392677698.html
23-06-2021||World||Nursing home deaths up 32% in 2020 amid pandemic: Watchdog||Deaths among Medicare patients in nursing homes soared by 32% last year, with two devastating spikes eight months apart, a government watchdog reported Tuesday in the most comprehensive look yet at the ravages of Covid-19 among its most vulnerable victims.The report from the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services found that about 4 in 10 Medicare recipients in nursing homes had or likely had Covid-19 in 2020, and that deaths overall jumped by 169,291 from the previous year, before the coronavirus appeared.“We knew this was going to be bad, but I don't think even those of us who work in this area thought it was going to be this bad,” said Harvard health policy professor David Grabowski, a nationally recognized expert on long-term care, who reviewed the report for The Associated Press.“This was not individuals who were going to die anyway,” Grabowski added. “We are talking about a really big number of excess deaths.”Investigators used a generally accepted method of estimating “excess” deaths in a group of people after a calamitous event. It did not involve examining individual death certificates of Medicare patients but comparing overall deaths among those in nursing homes to levels recorded the previous year. The technique was used to estimate deaths in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria in 2017 and in New York City after the first coronavirus surge last spring. It does not attribute a cause of death but is seen as a barometer of impact.Death rates were higher in every month last year when compared with 2019. The report documented two spikes with particular implications for government policy and for protecting the most vulnerable in future outbreaks of life-threatening illnesses. In April of last year, a total of 81,484 Medicare patients in nursing homes died. Then eight months later, after lockdowns and frantic efforts to expand testing — but before vaccines became widely available — nursing home patients accounted for a staggering 74,299 deaths in December.“This is happening long after it was clear that nursing homes were particularly vulnerable,” said Nancy Harrison, a deputy regional inspector general who worked on the report. “We really have to look at that. Why did they remain so vulnerable?” Federal investigators are still drilling down to try to document the chain of causes and effects.Responding to the report, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said that nearly 80% of nursing home residents and more than 55% of staff are now vaccinated, and the agency is working to protect health and safety. CMS sets standards for nursing homes.The two main nursing industry groups, the American Health Care Association and LeadingAge, said the grim statistics reflect the consequences of society and government not placing a high enough priority on the needs of frail elders. That “showed once again how ageism can result in policies that treat older people as expendable,” said Katie Smith Sloan, president of LeadingAge, which represents nonprofit homes.Tuesday's report was the most comprehensive yet from the government because it included statistics for the early part of last year, during the initial coronavirus surge. Medicare did not require nursing homes to report Covid-19 cases and deaths occurring before May 8, more than four months into the pandemic year.In another new finding, the report showed that cases and deaths among Asian American patients tracked with the more severe impacts seen among Blacks and Latinos. Indeed, Asian Medicare enrollees in nursing homes saw the highest increase in death rates, with 27% dying in 2020 compared to 17% the previous year. For whites, the death rate grew to 24% in 2020 from 18% in 2019, a significant increase but not as pronounced.Death rates for Hispanic and Black patients were 23% last year, up from 15% in 2019.The inspector general's office based its analysis on Medicare billing data. It also included patients in Medicare Advantage plans sold by private insurers. Although Medicare does not cover long-term care, the vast majority of nursing home patients are elderly, and Medicare does cover their medical needs. The report included both patients who live in nursing homes as well as those temporarily at a facility for rehabilitation.Health economist Tamara Konetzka of the University of Chicago, who also reviewed the report for AP, said building an estimate from individual death certificates would have faced another set of challenges. Especially in the first wave of the pandemic, many who died would not necessarily have been tested for Covid-19, for example.“By looking at excess deaths you can get away from some of the measurement issues and say how much worse things were in 2020 than in 2019,” explained Konetzka, who has testified before Congress on the impact of Covid-19 in nursing homes.The inspector general's findings about Asians highlight a riddle for researchers, said Konetzka. The reasons for higher cases and deaths among Blacks, Hispanics and Asians may not necessarily be tied to race and ethnicity. Instead, minority patients may be clustered in homes located in communities with more severe outbreaks.The report also found that low-income nursing home patients covered by Medicare and Medicaid together were much more likely to have gotten Covid-19. The infection rate for that group reached 56%, and 26% died.Some states suffered worse impacts. By the end of December more than half of the Medicare patients in nursing homes in Connecticut, Illinois, Louisiana and New Jersey had or likely had COVID-19.Although nursing homes locked down in March of last year, government efforts to help were haphazard. The industry complained of chronic shortages of protective gear, including basics like masks and gowns.The Trump administration initially delegated responsibility for testing to states before belatedly marshaling more federal resources. HHS later laid the groundwork for vaccinations under the Trump administration, and the Biden administration followed through. As vaccination rates rose, nursing home cases plummeted, allowing facilities to again permit family visits.The country can't move on yet, said deputy inspector general Harrison. “Hopefully, Covid-19 will go away,” she said. “But once that happens, there will always be infectious diseases, and we all need to ask ourselves what we can do to protect vulnerable nursing home residents going forward.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nursing-home-deaths-up-32-in-2020-amid-pandemic-watchdog-101624392148740.html
23-06-2021||World||UK, EU close to truce in Brexit trade dispute: Official||British and European officials are increasingly optimistic they will avert a post-Brexit trade war, believing the two sides will strike a truce in the dispute over checks on goods moving into Northern Ireland.The British government has asked the European Union to extend the grace period before a ban comes into force on the sale of chilled meats and fresh sausages into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.No deal has been done yet and European officials wants to hear how the British government will use any extension to the June 30 deadline, with EU diplomats due to discuss next steps at a meeting Wednesday, people familiar with the matter said.The issue of trade rules for Northern Ireland sparked heated clashes between the two sides in recent weeks and overshadowed the Group of Seven summit in Cornwall, southwest England, this month.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has threatened unilaterally to suspend the rules if the EU refuses to back down, and the EU has warned it will respond with legal action if he does.Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron argued face-to-face about the transport of sausages within France and the UK, and British media have labeled the clash the “sausage wars.”Last week, UK minister David Frost said the government was becoming increasingly concerned that the dispute could undermine fragile political stability in Northern Ireland at a highly sensitive time.In recent days, the EU has been reviewing the UK’s formal written request for an extension to the grace period. Officials on both sides now believe it’s likely that an extension to the current grace period will be granted.The UK has opted not to introduce some checks on goods crossing into Northern Ireland, saying the EU’s strict approach to enforcing the rules is hurting local communities. The EU, which is Britain’s largest trading partner, says the UK is failing to implement the terms of the Brexit deal Johnson signed less than two years ago.Under the terms of the Brexit accord, Northern Ireland -- unlike the rest of the UK -- remained under the EU’s customs and single market rules to avoid creating a visible border with the Irish Republic, a move that would risk reviving sectarian conflicts.The EU wants a permanent settlement and is keen to avoid rolling grace periods becoming the norm. European officials say grace periods were designed to allow time for businesses and authorities to come into compliance with the Northern Ireland protocol, which was part of the UK’s separation agreement with the bloc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-eu-close-to-truce-in-brexit-trade-dispute-official-101624392137761.html
23-06-2021||World||Joe Biden says will 'bring every resource' to manage busy storm season||President Joe Biden said Tuesday that his administration needs to “bring every resource to bear" to deal with natural disasters as huge swaths of the country have already endured extreme weather with the summer season just starting.The president said he plans to meet next week with western governors to discuss preparation for heat, drought and wildfires.“I insist on being ready for whatever comes our way," Biden told reporters ahead of an emergency preparedness briefing from Deanne Criswell, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, the White House homeland security adviserThe White House was spotlighting preparedness as the Western US has experienced extreme heat and wildfires and the Atlantic Ocean has already seen three named storms, including Tropical Storm Claudette. The storm killed at least 14 people in Alabama.A tornado swept through communities in heavily populated suburban Chicago late Sunday, damaging more than 100 homes, toppling trees, knocking out power and causing multiple injuries.Biden announced in May that he’s doubling US emergency spending to help communities prepare for hurricanes and other extreme weather events, while launching a new effort at NASA to better understand and track the impact of climate change.The $1 billion in spending is a small fraction of what the weather-related disasters cost the US. Last year alone, the nation endured 22 weather and climate-related disasters with losses greater than $1 billion each. The disasters, including wildfires, hurricanes and snowstorms, had a cumulative price tag of nearly $100 billion.This year has already had significant winter storms that caused a deadly blackout in Texas and other states, and officials expect that an ongoing severe drought in the West will fuel another destructive summer of wildfires following one of the worst fire years on record in 2020.Forecasters predict a busy hurricane season along the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, but perhaps not as severe as 2020’s record-shattering year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-says-will-bring-every-resource-to-manage-busy-storm-season-101624391913845.html
23-06-2021||World||Microsoft joins Apple in exclusive $2 trillion club||Microsoft Corp. took its place in the history books as just the second US public company to reach a $2 trillion market value, buoyed by bets its dominance in cloud computing and enterprise software will expand further in a post-coronavirus world.Its shares rose as much as 1.1% to $265.64 on Tuesday in New York, enough for the software company to join Apple Inc. as one of only two companies trading at such a lofty value. Saudi Aramco eclipsed that threshold briefly in December 2019, but currently has a market value of about $1.9 trillion.Since taking the reins in 2014, Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has reshaped the Redmond, Washington-based company into the largest seller of cloud-computing software, counting both its infrastructure and Office application cloud units. Microsoft is also the only one of the biggest U.S. technology companies that has so far evaded the recent wave of scrutiny from increasingly active American antitrust regulators, giving it a freer hand in both acquisitions and product expansion.Microsoft has gained 19% so far this year, outperforming Apple and Amazon.com Inc., as investors piled into the stock on expectations of long-term growth for both earnings and revenue, and expansion in areas like machine learning and cloud computing. The company’s third-quarter results, released in late April, topped expectations and demonstrated strong growth across its business segments.The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index outperformed the S&P 500 Index on Tuesday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated his view that inflation will be short lived. Both benchmarks rose to session highs after Powell’s comments with the Nasdaq 100 up 1.1% and the S&P 500 up 0.7%.“Microsoft checks all the boxes: it is in the markets that investors favor, it offers strong and sustainable growth, and it remains very well positioned to capitalize on the long-term secular trends we see in technology,” said Logan Purk, an analyst at Edward Jones. A $2 trillion valuation “is warranted, given how it has pivoted toward the cloud, and it remains attractively valued even given the strong performance.”Co-founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen, Microsoft created the personal-computer software industry and dominated the market for PC operating systems and Office software for years. As internet browsers like Netscape grew in importance in the 1990s, Microsoft raced to introduce its own product that it bundled with Windows software. That led to a bruising antitrust lawsuit, filed in 1998 by the US government, with a federal judge finding the company guilty in 2000.Though Microsoft avoided a breakup of its business, the penalty the government originally sought in the antitrust case, the next decade saw the software maker largely miss the advent of mobile software, social media and internet search, falling behind newer rivals such as Google and nimbler ones like Apple. With a series of strategic shifts, in the past seven years Nadella has restored Microsoft to the vanguard of technology with a focus on cloud, mobile computing and artificial intelligence.While it took Microsoft 33 years from its IPO to reach its first $1 trillion in value in 2019, the next trillion only took about two years amid a surge in popularity in tech stocks before the Covid-19 pandemic and during the health crisis. Apple made Wall Street history when it reached $2 trillion last year.Among US names, the pair are trailed by Amazon, which has a market cap of nearly $1.8 trillion, and Alphabet Inc., which is valued around $1.6 trillion.According to data compiled by Bloomberg, more than 90% of analysts recommend buying Microsoft, while none has the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock. The average price target points to upside of about 11% from current levels.Growth DriversMicrosoft’s cloud-computing business has been a central force behind the advance. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, the Intelligent Cloud business accounted for 33.8% of Microsoft’s 2020 revenue, making it the largest of the three major segments for the first time, and up from 31% in 2019. The division showed revenue growth of 24% last year, compared with the 13% growth in Productivity and Business Processes, and the 6% growth of Microsoft’s More Personal Computing unit.Nadella’s strategic moves had put Microsoft in a position to benefit from business trends that arose during the global pandemic. Lockdowns and remote work accelerated a shift to the company’s meeting software and pushed clients to speed up modernizations of software networks and applications around the cloud. The software maker’s Xbox gaming subscriptions also lured users looking for diversion during months stuck at home.As workers return to the office, Microsoft has tried to push new ideas for managing meetings where some attendees are in person and some remote, and has been hawking features to boost wellness and productivity for workers that the company says are burned out by the tribulations of the past year.“At a high level, the two core pillars of Microsoft’s bull narrative — Microsoft 365 and Azure — are well understood by the investment community,” William Blair analyst Jason Ader wrote in May. “What is perhaps less appreciated is how over the last 15 years Microsoft has expanded its IT wallet share through expanding into new product areas” and taking market share. The wallet share doubled from 2006 to 2020, and “we believe it can double again over the next decade,” it wrote.Wall Street is also positive on the company’s M&A strategy. It recently announced that it is buying speech-recognition pioneer Nuance Communications Inc. The company also tried to acquire Discord Inc. for $12 billion, but the video-game chat company rejected Microsoft’s offer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/microsoft-joins-apple-in-exclusive-2-trillion-club-101624391043393.html

23-06-2021||World||Covid-19 Delta variant gains steam in undervaccinated US counties||Early evidence suggests that the highly contagious delta variant, which has prompted concern worldwide as it leads to new surges of Covid-19 across the globe, is spreading in undervaccinated pockets of the US.The genomics firm Helix analyzed about 20,000 samples from Covid-19 tests across more than 700 US counties. It found that cases of the variant first documented in India appear to be growing far faster in counties with lower vaccination rates than in areas that have higher rates.The ongoing spread of the variant in pockets of low vaccine uptake are troubling because they create more opportunities for the virus to thrive and mutate. The longer the virus spreads, the more chances it has to create easier inroads into human cells, and potentially take on deadlier forms.“Delta is driving surges around the world, and I suspect it’s going to be the same here,” said William Lee, the vice president of science at Helix. Delta is growing more than twice as fast as gamma, the variant first seen in Brazil, in undervaccinated communities.Meanwhile, the gamma variant, which appears better at evading vaccines, was found to be more prevalent in counties with higher inoculation rates. The Helix research, which hasn’t yet been subject to peer review, is to be published in an upcoming pre-print online.So far, more than 45% of the US population has been fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But a recent Bloomberg News analysis found that broad, national numbers often obscure more troubling patterns at the local level.Less than 25% of the population is fully vaccinated in at least 482 counties, Bloomberg found in an analysis of 2,700 US counties.Helix, which has been working to track the spread of variants through its Covid-testing program, looked at samples collected through its testing program prior to mid-June that it then sequenced. It then compared the county of residency of the patient against the CDC’s county-level vaccination data, dividing its samples into two roughly equal groups based on the vaccination rates of the counties they are from.In one group, the number of fully vaccinated people in the county was above 28.5%, in the other it was below. By doing that, the company found that delta cases was rising faster among people who live in counties with lower vaccination rates.The alpha variant, first found in the U.K., has been the dominant strain in the US But the “gamma and delta have gained a strong foothold and may soon push alpha out,” Helix’s Lee said.Younger AmericansIn a new report issued by the CDC on Monday, the agency found that among those 18 to 39 years old, vaccine safety and effectiveness were both commonly cited barriers to vaccination.The agency said it is especially important to reduce hesitancy among younger Americans, who have been among the demographic groups least likely to take the vaccine. Polling has also suggested that there is significant hesitancy among rural populations, Republican voters and people of color.Polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation suggests that there are still a large number of holdouts in the US, with about 13% of Americans planning to avoid the vaccine no matter what, another 12% saying they are waiting before making a decision, and 7% saying they’ll get vaccinated only if required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-delta-variant-gains-steam-in-undervaccinated-us-counties-101624389096097.html
23-06-2021||World||India calls for UN-led ‘comprehensive and permanent’ ceasefire in Afghanistan||India on Tuesday called for a UN-led “permanent and comprehensive ceasefire” in Afghanistan in view of a recent escalation in violence, saying peace talks have not delivered the desired result and the country has witnessed targeted attacks on religious and ethnic minorities, women, journalists and civil rights activists.“It is therefore crucial that the international community and, in particular, this council presses for a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire to ensure immediate reduction in violence and protection of civilian lives,” India’s external affairs minister S Jaishankar said during a UN Security Council debate on the situation in Afghanistan.“We support a leading role for the United Nations, since that would help improve the odds for a lasting and durable outcome,” he said.The minister reiterated India’s calls for immediate dismantling of terrorist safe havens and disruption of terrorist supply chains. “There needs to be zero tolerance for terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including its cross-border one,” Jaishankar said.The UN secretary general’s report on the situation in Afghanistan submitted last week noted that “security incidents remained at high levels, with the number of civilian casualties increasing by 29% in the first quarter of 2021 in comparison with the same period in 2020”. The report said that though Afghanistan has continued to try to “foster unity around the peace process”, efforts to reinvigorate the negotiations have slowed following the postponement of talks scheduled to take place in Istanbul because the Taliban want to wait until US and Nato troops have left the country.Foreign troops are in the process of exiting Afghanistan with a deadline of September 11 announced by US President Joe Biden for complete withdrawal. Biden is scheduled to meet Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, who leads the High Council for National Reconciliation, at the White House on Friday amid growing concern about the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan.“As we’ve said from the very beginning, while there is a schedule, we are mindful that that schedule could fluctuate and change as… conditions changed too,” Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said on Monday in response to a question about the Taliban’s advances in Afghanistan. He added, “It is a dynamic situation and we said from the outset that we’re going to treat it as such… if there need to be changes made to the pace or to the scope and scale of the retrograde on any given day or in any given week, we want to maintain the flexibility to do that.”As a key stakeholder in the reconstruction of Afghanistan, India has been concerned about the post-withdrawal situation and has called for urgent efforts to ensure that the gains made over two decades of the presence of foreign troops are not squandered.Reiterating India’s longstanding support for an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled peace process, Jaishankar said, “If the peace process is to be successful, then it is necessary to ensure that the negotiating parties continue to engage in good faith, eschew the path to find a military solution, and fully commit towards reaching a political solution. A tangible demonstration of this commitment is required.”The minister recalled the development work done by India in Afghanistan since 2001 - more than 550 community development projects; a recent MoU to build the Shatoot dam; operationalisation of the Chabahar Port in Iran; and humanitarian assistance of 75,000 MT of wheat to Afghanistan via that port.Also, India sent across Covid-19 vaccines to Afghanistan, bilaterally as well as through the Covax global distribution facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-calls-for-un-led-comprehensive-and-permanent-ceasefire-in-afghanistan-101624387903610.html

The drug's efficacy against Kappa, another variant found in India, has also been proven, the official said. A study by Oxford University investigated the ability of monoclonal antibodies in Sera from recovered people and from vaccinated people to neutralize the Delta and Kappa variants, a statement from the company said.Drugmakers across the world are rushing to test the efficacy of drugs against the emerging variants of Covid-19 which are proving to be deadlier than the first strain of virus found to have infected humans. An analysis by the Public Health England (PHE) showed that vaccines made by Pfizer Inc and AstraZeneca offer high protection of more than 90% against hospitalization from the Delta variant.The latest Oxford study results are built on the recent analysis by PHE, the company said.The Delta variant is becoming the globally dominant version of the disease, the World Health Organization's chief scientist said on Friday.A World Health Organization epidemiologist on Monday pointed out how Covid-19 vaccines are showing signs of reduced efficacy against the Delta variant of coronavirus variant. However, the vaccines are still found to be effective at preventing severe illness and death.The WHO official added that in the future, there might be a "constellation of mutations" which means vaccines are likely to lose their potency against fighting the coronavirus.The Delta plus variant has been formed due to a mutation in the Delta or B.1.617.2 variant, first identified in India and considered one of the drivers of the second wave in the country and also in several others including the UK.The highly transmissible variant of the virus is listed as the fourth variant of concern by the WHO. The variant, as latest as Monday, poses a threat to the United Kingdom where the daily cases have shot up to more than 10,000 again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-effective-against-delta-variant-found-in-india-101624387169002.html

This milestone comes close on the heels of the US falling short of reaching the July 4-goal of vaccinating all American adults by Independence Day.The US administration under Biden is now eyeing to vaccinate 70% of Americans above 27 with at least one dose by July 4. In a revamped strategy, the White House will now focus on vaccinating younger Americans in 18-26 age group, who have proved to be least likely to get a vaccine when it's available for them.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Monday pointed towards the reluctance among younger American adults for getting vaccine doses, as they are turning to Covid-19 vaccines at a slower rate than older adults. This is likely to hamper the Covid-19 vaccination coverage trajectory in the United States. If the reluctance continues in the pace of vaccination till the month of August, the vaccine coverage among younger adults will not reach the level seen in older adults, the CDC pointed out.About 45% of the US population has been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. Over 53% of Americans have received at least one dose of vaccine. But US demand for shots has slumped, to the disappointment of public health experts.Biden's vaccination goal, the White House said, is less important than the pace of the nation's reopening. The US is exceeding by its own internal projections as the major push to vaccinate every citizen which is visible in the overwhelming majority of the nation's most vulnerable people who are fully vaccinated. In another marker, fresh infections and deaths in the US are at their lowest rates since the earliest days of the pandemic.However, the nationwide rate of new vaccinations has dropped off precipitously over the past month even as shots have become more available, with fewer than 300,000 Americans now getting their first dose per day on average.A report from US CDC, Americans at the highest risk for complications from Covid-19 are overwhelmingly vaccinated. Only 53% aged 25-39 have received one dose. Among those 18-24, it's 47%.“What we’ve seen, as we’ve dug into the data, is that there is a big gap between individuals 25 and over, and 18 to 25,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday. “That means that’s an area we need to continue to work on."Vaccine hesitancy is a global problem nations have encountered but the health experts and scientists have underlined how crucial vaccines are in the race against time with mutating viruses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/70-americans-of-above-30-partially-vaccinated-white-house-101624375692317.html
23-06-2021||India||Amit Mitra says GST council meetings 'almost toxic', urges Nirmala Sitharaman for course correction||Stating that GST council meetings have become "almost toxic" with the erosion of trust between the Centre and states, West Bengal minister Amit Mitra on Wednesday urged Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to consider a "course correction" to rebuild faith.In a letter to Sitharaman, the state's finance minister also claimed that the central government comes to GST council meetings with a "predetermined conclusion".Mitra on June 13 alleged that his voice was "muzzled" during the GST Council meeting on that day and his opposition to levy taxes on Covid essentials like vaccines, masks, PPE kits and anti-viral drug Remdesivir, was not heard."What pains me most is the fact that GST Council meetings have become acrimonious, vexing and almost toxic with erosion of mutual trust that had held fast between state and the Centre since the inception of the GST Council," he said in the letter.Many have observed a steady breakdown of the spirit of cooperative federalism and the erosion of the commitment to work out a consensus in the GST Council meetings, Mitra claimed.Mitra recalled several instances where sharp differences cropped up between the states and the Union government but then there was no "bitterness or antagonism"."But, now I am afraid that arriving at such a consensus, even for much simpler matters, has become elusive," he said.It is a dangerous time for the GST regime as the states own resources are in dire distress, the state finance minister said.The gap between projected revenue and revenue collected has ballooned to ₹2.75 lakh crore and the actual compensation due to the states for 2020-21 has reached ₹74,398 crore, he said adding that fraudulent transactions hit a peak of ₹70,000 crore, as per Nandan Nilekani's presentation to the GST council."An undercurrent has emerged in recent times that while the Chair hears the submissions of all States very patiently, indeed, there is a predetermined conclusion with which the Government of India, aided by top bureaucrats, comes to the GST council meetings," the letter read.He said that the issues were brought to her attention with utmost sincerity and frankness so that she may consider a course correction in the manner of functioning of the GST Council."I assure you that we will respond in equal measure if you bring back a consensual atmosphere that had defined the GST council since its inception," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-mitra-says-gst-council-meetings-almost-toxic-urges-nirmala-sitharaman-for-course-correction-101624470963428.html
23-06-2021||India||India seeks concerted action to tackle terror, radicalisation across Asia||India on Thursday sought concerted action to tackle terror, radicalisation, drug trafficking and organised crime across Asia, and said its vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific is aimed at ensuring the shared pursuit of progress and prosperity. Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla outlined India’s position while addressing a virtual meeting of senior officials of member states of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA), a grouping established by Kazakhstan in 1992. “In Asia, we face the challenges of terrorism, radicalisation, drug trafficking and organised crime. To face these diverse challenges, we need to undertake concerted action,” he said. “India’s vision of the Indo-Pacific as a free, open and inclusive region underpinned by international law is premised on the common pursuit of progress and prosperity. In this direction, India has traditionally maintained close and friendly cooperation with regional organisations in Asia, including CICA,” he added. CICA was created to boost cooperation to promote peace, security and stability in Asia. The grouping also promotes dialogue and confidence-building across Asia. The 27 members of CICA include Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, India, Iran, Israel, Pakistan, Russia, Sri Lanka, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. A regular meeting of CICA foreign ministers will be held this year, while the next summit of the grouping is slated for 2023. Shringla also told the meeting that India’s call for reformed multilateralism reflects contemporary geopolitical realities and is a “pressing need now more than ever before”. He said, “Multilateral institutions must be made more accountable to their membership, they must be open and welcoming to a diversity of viewpoints and cognisant of new voices, especially those from Asia.” The UN Security Council must be made more representative of developing countries to build trust and confidence in its ability to provide leadership, and India backs a multi-polar global order that respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries and works to resolve international disputes through peaceful negotiations, he said. Describing CICA as an important vehicle for advancing peace, progress and prosperity in Asia, Shringla welcomed the grouping’s recent decision to set up a new confidence-building measure on epidemiology and healthcare. “As co-coordinators of CICA confidence-building measures on transportation corridors and energy security, we are interested in contributing to CICA’s efforts,” he said. India has deputed a diplomat of the rank of second secretary to CICA, who is based in Nur-Sultan. Under the energy security track, India organised a virtual seminar on “renewable energy and energy security” on June 18. Wednesday’s meeting of senior officials discussed the growing role of Asia, the revision of the draft CICA catalogue of CBMs, and mechanisms for enhanced dialogue, including a think tank forum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-seeks-concerted-action-to-tackle-terror-radicalisation-across-asia-101624470523904.html
23-06-2021||India||Assam CM misled people on Niti Aayog report, says Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi||Congress MP from Assam Gaurav Gogoi on Wednesday alleged that chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma misled people on the state’s poor performance in Niti Aayog’s sustainable development goal (SDG) report of 2020-21. “The CM claimed Assam had progressed from being in the aspirant category in 2018 to the performer category in 2020. In fact, Assam’s progress from 2019 to 2020 was of barely 2 points (55 to 57), making it the slowest overall progress among all states. Assam’s overall rank in the recent survey dropped from 23rd to 26th,” Gogoi said in Guwahati, and indicated that there were “clear cut contradictions” between what the Niti Aayog report said and the CM’s claims. “In the field of health, Assam has the lowest score of 59 among all states. It also dropped by 3 ranks from 25th to 28th place. Percentage of adolescents aged 10–19 years who are anaemic is 36.9, higher than India’s score. Assam also has the highest maternal mortality rate among all states with a score of 215, almost double of India’s score,” he added. Gogoi pointed out that in the education category, Assam has ranked 24th out of 28 states and its score has actually dipped this year from 44 to 43. Assam’s dropout rates in classes 9 and 10 are the second highest among all states. It also has one of the lowest pupil teacher ratios of 11 among all states and almost half of India’s score of 21. “The CM tried to justify Assam’s poor performance saying the data was based on the National Family Health Survey 4 (NFHS4) and not the recent NFHS survey 5. The justification does not hold because there’s no significant difference between NFHS 4 and the Phase 1 factsheet of NFHS 5,” said the MP. “Overall, Assam figures in the bottom rankings of all the essential categories of economy, healthcare, education and gender equality and there hasn’t been any significant growth since 2018. The BJP government should be honest about its shortcomings instead of misleading the people,” added Gogoi. Leaders from BJP and the CM’s office didn’t respond to calls for reactions on Gogoi’s assertions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-cm-misled-people-on-niti-aayog-report-says-congress-mp-gaurav-gogoi-101624468543954.html
23-06-2021||India||PM Garib Kalyan Yojana: Government approves additional grain allocation till Nov 30||The Centre approved the allocation of additional foodgrain to National Food Security Act (NFSA) beneficiaries under the fourth phase of Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PM-GKY) till November 30, a release issued by the Union ministry of consumer affairs read.The decision was taken during a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday.In his address to the nation on June 7, PM Modi had announced that the scheme will be extended by five months, till Diwali. The PM-GKAY was initially announced for a period of two months, May and June, with an estimated expenditure of ₹26,602 crore."An additional 204 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) of foodgrains will be provided to around 80 crore NFSA beneficiaries with an estimated financial implication of up to ₹67,266 crore," the release read, adding that this additional, free-of-cost allocation of food grains, will be over and above the regular monthly food grains allocated.The allocation in terms of wheat or rice shall be decided by the Department of Food and Public Distribution, news agency ANI reported. The department may also decide on the extension of the distribution period under phases 3 and 4 of the scheme, in view of adverse weather conditions and the coronavirus pandemic.Reacting to the decision, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said that it is a "big relief" for the underprivileged. "Welcome the Cabinet decision of further extending the PM Garib Kalyan Yojana till November. Will provide free food to 800 million people- a big relief for the underprivileged in these challenging times," he tweeted.Last year, the Centre announced the scheme for all beneficiaries covered under National Food Security Act for the period of April-November. Under this, around 80 crore people were allocated an additional 5 kg of foodgrains for a period of eight months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-approves-extension-of-pm-garib-kalyan-yojana-from-july-2021-to-november-2021-101624455816170.html
23-06-2021||India||‘Waiting for nod from PM’: Mamata on delay in dates for bypolls in Bengal||The Election Commission of India is waiting for the Prime Minister’s instructions to hold by-elections in seven assembly seats in West Bengal, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said taking a swipe at the BJP-led Union government on multiple fronts on Wednesday.“I got to know that when the Prime Minister gives instructions, only then they (ECI) will announce the dates for by-polls. If it is so, then I would request the Prime Minister to give the nod,” said Banerjee. By-polls in at least seven assembly constituencies are pending including Bhawanipore in south Kolkata from where the chief minister is expected to contest.Earlier elections in two seats in Murshidabad were cancelled when the candidates died of Covid-19 in April. Later, two BJP MPs Nisith Pramanik and Jagannath Sarkar who won the assembly polls resigned. Two other TMC legislators died after contracting the Covid-19 infection, while TMC MLA from Bhawanipore, Sovan Deb Chatterjee, resigned so that Banerjee could contest from the seat in the by-polls.“By-elections should be held as early as possible. The Covid-19 situation is under control. If the third wave comes then you can’t do anything. A week’s time for the election campaigning would be enough,” she added.Senior officials in the ECI’s office in Kolkata refused to comment on the chief minister’s statements.The daily count of Covid-19 cases had shot up from around 200 on February 26, when the eight-phase elections were announced by the poll panel to more than 27,000 on April 29 when the elections ended. Health experts linked the surge in infections to political rallies that violated all Covid-19 protocol.“I think BJP is a big disease for everybody. They were only interested in Bengal polls. Even now they want to divide Bengal. They did nothing for six to eight months and because of them we had the second wave. Even when the second wave came they did little to vaccinate citizens equally. Two weeks were lost after PM’s announcement of giving free vaccines,” she added.She also said that the Centre should immediately take steps so that Covaxin gets recognition from the World Health Organisation (WHO).“Students, who took Covaxin from private hospitals, are facing a very serious problem while going abroad to study. The Prime Minister had asked people to take this vaccine,” the chief minister added.The chief minister further said that the state government would give full support to former chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay, against whom the Centre has initiated disciplinary proceedings for missing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting in the aftermath of Cyclone Yaas. Bandopadhyay has been given a month’s time to respond.“Our government will give full support to him. We will fight the battle. They (BJP-led Union government) are trying to show their might like a selfish giant. But law will take its own course. The officer (Bandyopadhyay) will take his own decisions and we will support him all out,” the chief minister said, while accusing the centre of behaving in an irresponsible manner.The BJP, on the other hand suggested that bypolls should be held in West Bengal only when the law and order situation in the state improved. “The post-poll violence suggests why there was a need to conduct the assembly elections in eight phases. Had it been conducted in one-phase, the death toll would have been eight-fold. The TMC is trying to score when the field is clear. BJP workers are being attacked. They are yet to return to their houses. The TMC is not allowing them to take relief material after Cyclone Yaas. We will move the EC and we hope that our voice will be heard. Elections should only be held when there is peace,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/waiting-for-nod-from-pm-mamata-on-delay-in-dates-for-bypolls-in-bengal-101624466323878.html

Villagers complained to police last week about a gang that broke into the storehouse in Dhurena village on the intervening night of June 8 and June 9 and fled with their pungent plunder estimated to be worth ₹1,600.According to assistant sub-inspector Suresh Kuma of the Dipka Police station, a case against unidentified persons was lodged on June 15 for stealing eight quintal cow dung worth ₹1,600.Local police officer Harish Tandekar told news agency AFP on Wednesday that they have questioned some suspects but no arrests have been made yet. Tandekar said that it was not clear how the suspects had been able to transport such a large amount of faeces, or why they had stolen it."Investigations are continuing and every effort is being made to find the culprits," he added.The Chhattisgarh government had earlier announced that it would purchase cow dung at about ₹ 2 per kilogram under the 'Godhan Nyay Yojna' scheme for the production of vermicompost at gauthans, making it more valuable for villagers. People of Dhurena village say that they have been collecting cow dung in exchange for some money after the scheme was announced, reported ANI.In recent years, several states have been encouraging farmers to sell cow poo for organic farming. There has also been an increased demand for cattle waste for eco-friendly products such as earthen lamps and for religious purposes. Apart from its use for such eco-friendly products and organic farming, some Hindus use the animals' dung and urine for medicines and other holy practices.In 2019, the Union government had proposed to set up Rashtriya Kamdhenu Aayog for the effective implementation of law and welfare schemes for cows with a corpus of ₹500 crores.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manure-hunt-underway-in-chhattisgarh-after-thieves-steal-800-kg-cow-dung-101624458659040.html

The loss incurred due to the robbery would impact the bank and not the general public, Chennai city police commissioner Shankar Jiwal said.The group is said to have taken advantage of a technical flaw in the bank's ATMs. A special team has been constituted to investigate the group’s modus operandi. Police have alerted other banks but so far no there haven’t been any such complaints."A group of four reportedly stole 48-lakh from several SBI ATMs across the state. Police suspect them to be from another state. The loss has been for the bank and not the public. A special team was formed to crackdown on this modus operandi which took advantage of a technical flaw in the bank's ATMs. Police have alerted other banks but no other bank has complained so far," Jiwal told Hindustan Times. SBI chief general manager R Radhakrishna told reporters that as a preventative measure to curtail any further loss all atm machines have been disabled across the state. “As a measure to curtail further loss, we have disabled all machines which have problems. Currently, these machines will not dispense cash. The theft took place only through one type of cash deposit machine,”Jiwal also told reporters that the group targeted an automatic cash withdrawal machine and used a single card to withdraw the stolen amount.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sbi-halts-atm-operations-in-tamil-nadu-after-48-lakh-101624459284789.html

The apex court last year had permitted the Rath Yatra to be held on the condition that there is no public attendance and all entry points into Puri remain closed. It also said each of the three chariots, would be pulled by not more than 500 people who were required to test negative for Covid-19.Recently, 10 servitors engaged in the construction of chariots in Nilagiri of Balasore district were arrested for violating the Odisha government’s order. In Baripada town, known as second Srikhetra, people had staged a protest urging the state government to allow the celebrations of the annual Rath Yatra without devotees like Puri.Deba Snana Purnima-- the grand bathing festival of Lord Jagannath that marks the prelude to the Rath Yatra is all set to be held on Thursday morning at the Jagannath Temple. Only select servitors and support staff like government officials, police who have undergone RT-PCR tests and tested negative will be allowed to participate in the rituals.During the Snana Purnima, Lord Jagannath and his siblings are bathed with 108 pitchers of aromatic and herbal water following which they fall sick.

The apex court relieved Hajela of his duty in 2019 and transferred him to his home state of Madhya Pradesh, where he served as the commissioner of health services in the Shivraj Singh Chouhan led government."The inclusion of a very high percentage of illegal and doubtful persons' names in the NRC, leads to the suspicion that there have been manipulations in the family tree verification,” APW president Aabhijeet Sarma wrote in his complaint, reported PTI."The software for 'Family Tree Matching' was prepared by the then NRC State Coordinator in such a way that no superior officers could make any quality check," he added.Hajela who graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi was removed from his duties by the Madhya Pradesh chief minister on ground of his ‘dereliction of duty during the Covid-19 pandemic,’“Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan instructed immediate removal of Prateek Hajela from the post of commissioner, health services on his extreme carelessness towards his duties amid the Covid-19 pandemic”, said an official statement from the directorate of public relations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ngo-files-complaint-against-assam-nrc-coordinator-prateek-hajela-101624455809250.html

They have been asked to report to the ED headquarters in New Delhi on Thursday and Friday.The probe agency wants clarifications from them regarding a few cash payments they received, officials familiar with the developments said.In March 2021, the ED had raided Khaira's properties in connection with a 2015 Fazilka drug smuggling case, against which the MLA had moved Punjab and Haryana high court. Following the raids, ED had claimed that in about 12 years, Rs4.86 crore were deposited in his bank accounts but his declared income to the income tax department stood at Rs99 lakh.The ED had also moved before the agency’s adjudicating authority on April 4, seeking its permission to open Khaira's electronic devices, including his phones, against which the MLA filed a fresh plea in the court.The authority had then issued show-cause notice to Khaira on April 12, asking him why the agency should not be allowed to examine his electronic devices.

23-06-2021||India||Nusrat Jahan should resign or TMC should sack her, says Dilip Ghosh||West Bengal BJP president on Wednesday raked up the controversy over Nusrat Jahan's marital status and said the Trinamool Congress should sack her or she should resign as an MP because she has shamed the Indian culture by applying sindoor and then denying her marriage. "Nusrat Jahan is a woman MP. She has shamed the Indian culture by applying sindoor, addressing a man as her husband and inviting the CM to her 'boubhat' (reception) and now she says she is not married," Dilip Ghosh told news agency ANI.This comes a day after Uttar Pradesh BJP MP Sanghamitra Maurya wrote to Lok Sabha speaker, demanding the Lower House to disqualify Nusrat Jahan for giving a false affidavit regarding her marital status in Parliament.On June 9, the Trinamool MP issued a statement revealing her marital discord with Nikhil Jain. In her statement, she said that since the wedding took place in Turkey under Turkish marriage regulation and was never registered in India, her marriage with Nikhil Jain was not valid in India. She has been living separately from her husband since last year, Nusrat clarified and brought charges of financial irregularities against Nikhil Jain and his family.Nusrat and Nikhil got married in 2019 after Nusrat Jahan won the Lok Sabha election from Basirhat. Though the wedding took place in Turkey, a reception was held in Kolkata which chief minister Mamata Banerjee attended. Trinamool versus BJP over Nusrat JahanNusrat Jahan's relationship with Nikhil became political fodder after BJP's Amit Malviya first questioned the veracity of Nusrat's Parliament record as she is shown as married in the records. Nusrat also took her oath as the MP as Nusrat Jahan Ruhi Jain — Jain being Nikhil's surname. After Malviya, BJP MP Sanghamitra Maurya raised questions as in her letter to the Lok Speaker, she wrote, "Her media statement regarding her marital status controvert her oath for Lok Sabha membership wherein she took oath as Nusrat Jahan Ruhi Jain. This effectively renders her membership as non-est in law."The Trinamool Congress did not take the criticisms seriously and denied to comment on this issue saying this is Nusrat's personal matter. Nusrat too has not addressed these criticisms. In the first week of June, as she made the announcement, she took a break from the social media, but now the actor-turned-politician is back on Instagram and Twitter. On Instagram, she posted her recent photos where she can be seen with her baby bump. Speculations over her pregnancy about which Nikhil Jain claimed to be in dark triggered the entire controversy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nusrat-jahan-should-resign-or-tmc-should-sack-her-says-dilip-ghosh-101624450132337.html

And now there’s a new addition. Soon-to​-be-wed couples want vaccinated guests only at their wedding and are sending out invites asking friends and relatives to timely plan inoculation.Simran Ahuja, 32, an IT professional who is getting married in New Delhi in November this year sent out save-the-date invites with the message, ‘Get your shot before we tie our knot.” She says, “We’ll be shifting to a hotel where we are hosting our ceremonies and we’ll have senior citizens staying with us so we can’t be taking any risk. Therefore, we have asked those wanting to join us for the celebration to plan both the vaccine shots accordingly. This will help us create a safe environment.”Another groom-to-be Akash Lal Bhardwaj, 30, an engineer from Noida who plans to have an intimate wedding affair says, “Only vaccinated guests are allowed to the wedding and we have decided to mention this on our wedding invites, too.” For his engagement ceremony last year, Bhardwaj took the creative route as well with e-vites that stated, “Be a superhero, wear your mask.”Marriages scheduled in the coming months follow the same protocol. Wedding planner Akshay Chopra from Designer Events Inc. says, “For July weddings and even with restricted number of guests, at least one shot has become mandatory as hosts and the couple wants to make it a safe zone for everyone to attending.”Some planners are already getting requests for year-end marriages to make arrangements and check vaccination certificates of guests beforehand arriving for destination weddings. “For November weddings, especially destination weddings in India, families are extremely particular about wanting only vaccinated vendors and guests. It’s becoming almost like a mandate now on save-the-date invites,” says wedding planner Kaveri Vij from Designer Events Inc.Moreover, some are going the extra mile by tying up with hospitals, setting vaccination booths and booking slots for guests to get the jab. “We have partnered with few hospitals in metropolitan areas and have sent out timelines to guests to get the first vaccine latest by August end for a wedding to be attended in November,” says, luxury wedding planner, Manvir Singh, founder and managing director, Shanqh Luxury Events.Singh who is also gearing up internation destination weddings being planned from November 2021 to March 2022 also adds, “For a person to be able to travel internationally, they’ll in any case have to get vaccinated and also show negative Covid-19 certificates on arrival at the airport and hotels.” Apart from the guests at the weddings, vendors are also getting teams inoculated to be able to sail through the peak season smoothly. “Clients want wedding planners and vendors to be vaccinated prior to their work on the big day. Having said that, the RT-PCR test is still required [at hotels and while travelling], so it’s not like someone who has been vaccinated doesn’t have to undergo it,” says Namha Malhotra, founder, Castles & Coasters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/soontobewed-couples-only-want-vaccinated-guests-to-be-present-at-their-wedding-101624450303127.html
23-06-2021||India||Delta Plus in India: 40 cases, 1st specimen found in April sample | What we know so far||The Centre on Wednesday confirmed 40 cases of Delta Plus variant in the country, a day after it alerted Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala about the new variant. Variants are natural for mRNA viruses as these viruses are prone to errors in their replication. Owing to such errors, the virus acquire a new character. On June 16, the Union health ministry for the first time mentioned the name of this variant as a variant of interest. Within a week, the status has been changed to a variant of concern. The Centre also made additional info about the variant public on Wednesday.1. States in India: Delta Plus has been found in three states, which have already been asked to tighten their containment measures. The areas where the Delta Plus variant has been found include Ratnagiri and Jalgaon of Maharashtra, Palakkad and Pathanamthitta of Kerala and Bhopal and Shivpuri of Madhya Pradesh.2. 1st Delta Plus case in Karnataka: Mysuru reported the first Delta Plus variant of Covid-19 in Karnataka.3. Goa-Maharashtra border under watch: The Goa government on Wednesday decided to increase surveillance along the Maharashtra border as Maharashtra has already reported over 20 Delta Plus cases.4. Where did Delta Plus come from? Delta Plus is a variant of Delta which, as India said, was observed in Europe in March. But it has been notified and brought into the public domain on June 13, two days after Public Health England mentioned the variant on its bulletin. It said that the new variant was present in six genomes from India as of June 7.5. More damaging for lungs? According to government data, Delta Plus has a characteristic of a stronger binding to receptors of lung cells. The variant is more transmissible and can potentially reduce in monoclonal antibody response therapy.6. Delta Plus was present in India in April: According to the statement released by the Centre on Wednesday, the sample in which India's first Delta Plus was found was collected on April 5 in Maharashtra.7. Can Delta Plus infection be resisted? There is no specific weapon to resist the infection of any Covid-19 variant. Covid appropriate behaviour and vaccination remain the two pillars of fighting the pandemic — be it any variant. No variant can pierce the mask, Dr VK Paul, Niti Aayog (health) member has said.8. Antibody resistance: Delta Plus is known to be resistant to monoclonal antibody cocktail therapy, but that does not mean it has more virulence than Delta, the Cente has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-plus-in-india-40-cases-1st-specimen-found-in-april-sample-what-we-know-so-far-101624448444003.html
23-06-2021||India||50 tumultuous days of Mamata Banerjee’s government 3.0||The Trinamool Congress (TMC) in West Bengal, which swept the assembly polls for the third consecutive time in May, will complete 50 days in power on June 24.While the battle for the state witnessed a high-pitched election campaign, the first six weeks following the TMC’s victory were as turbulent politically, with allegations of post-poll violence, the arrest of TMC ministers in the Narada scam, the controversy around cyclone Yaas and the sudden retirement of state chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay. West Bengal has witnessed dramatic political developments in this period, and political experts say this is just a trailer of what lies ahead in the run-up to 2024 for the eastern state.Here’s a look at the tumultuous first 50 days of Mamata Banerjee 3.0:The arrest of TMC leadersOn May 17, less than a fortnight after Banerjee took oath as chief minister (CM), sleuths from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested two ministers, a legislator and a former mayor in connection with the Narada sting operation case, in which the leaders were allegedly seen accepting bribes.The incident prompted Banerjee to hold a dharna at the CBI office demanding that the agency also arrest her. This, while state law minister, Moloy Ghatak, led a 3,000-strong crowd of supporters to the lower court.However, this backfired as the CBI cited these incidents to tell the court how influential the accused are. While they are out on interim bail, a five-judge bench is still hearing the bail plea.The TMC alleged that this was the work of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which, after a humiliating defeat in the assembly elections in the state, had grown vindictive. The BJP said that the law was simply taking its course.Post-poll violence deepens divisionsIncidents of post-poll violence erupted soon after the results. On May 6, one day after taking oath, Banerjee said that at least 16 persons were killed in post-poll violence.The Union ministry of home affairs was quick to send a four-member team to assess the situation and sought a report from the Governor.Also Read | Now, SC judge recuses from hearing pleas in Narada caseThis left the TMC government seething. “The BJP is not able to digest the defeat in the assembly polls. I would appeal to them to accept the people’s mandate and allow us to work to tackle the Covid situation. We are not interested to quarrel with you now,” Banerjee said at the time.The BJP, however, continued to sharpen its attack with allegations of political violence, even as Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar took a tour of some of the alleged trouble-torn areas. He even went to Assam where some people were believed to have taken shelter to escape violence.“With a heavy heart, I am constrained to observe your continued silence and inaction over post-poll retributive bloodshed, violation of human rights, outrageous assault on the dignity of women, wanton destruction of property, perpetuation of untold miseries on political opponents... worst since independence... and it ill augurs for democracy,” Dhankhar wrote in a letter to Banerjee in June.Meanwhile, the Calcutta high court directed the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to examine cases of human rights violations. Families of victims of post-poll violence have also moved the Supreme Court.“Our workers are being murdered and thousands of them still can’t return home because of the violence. The court can see this, central agencies can see this, people can see this but the TMC government can’t see this,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson.The return of the turncoatsEven though more than two dozen legislators abandoned the TMC ahead of the assembly elections to join the BJP, the former got a shot in the arm after Mukul Roy, BJP’s national vice-president, returned to the TMC on June 11. He had earlier left the TMC to join the BJP in 2017.After Roy’s return, the BJP filed a petition before the assembly Speaker, seeking his disqualification under the anti-defection law.But Roy — a legislator from Kishnanagar North constituency in Nadia district — is not alone. Senior leaders of the Bengal ruling party have said that several former TMC leaders, who had sided with the BJP, are prepared to return to the TMC.Also Read | Bengal forms 10-member expert committee to tackle possible third Covid wave“We are the largest party in the world and there is a democracy in the party. We are not a family-centric party. We have some ideologies which run the party. If someone feels stifled here and feels would be able to serve the people by moving to another party, then BJP respects it,” said Jay Prakash Majumdar, BJP’s vice-president in West Bengal.TMC chief, Banerjee, however, asserted that the party will not accept all the turncoats who are willing to return.“Those who had betrayed the party ahead of the elections to strengthen the BJP and had bitterly attacked the TMC party during campaigns will not be taken back. Mukul never attacked the TMC. There are, however, some leaders who may have gone with Mukul and may want to come back. The party will take a decision on this,” said Banerjee.Other defectors such as Sonali Guha, Dipendu Biswas and Sarala Murmu have openly said that they want to return to the party. They even sent apologies to Banerjee, while others have sent “feelers” by criticising the BJP.All eyes on 2024Banerjee is now setting her eyes on the TMC playing a bigger role on the national stage. Poll strategist Prashant Kishor, credited for his earlier role in the BJP’s Lok Sabha win in 2014 as well as the TMC’s 2021 assembly election win, has officially quit the Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC). Despite this, Banerjee has renewed her contract with the firm.The CM’s nephew and TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, seen as the driving force behind the party’s national expansion plan, has announced that the TMC will set up units in other states with the sole purpose of winning elections and putting up a formidable front against the BJP.Also Read | NIA to probe links between Maoists of Bihar, Bengal, JharkhandFor the record, the TMC projected Banerjee as the next prime minister before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, but stitching together an alliance of regional forces to defeat the BJP proved to be unsuccessful.Meanwhile, Sharad Pawar of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Kishor met twice in two weeks amid buzz about a national coalition against the BJP. The TMC also went for a major rejig by activating a younger, more versatile leadership and eradicating centralism in the ranks of the 23-year-old party.Centre-state relations take a hit Centre-state relations took a nosedive after CM Banerjee and the state’s chief secretary Alapan Banerjee skipped a review meeting held by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take stock of the damages caused by cyclone Yaas, even though they met Modi for a few minutes to hand over a report of the damage on his arrival in the state.Alapan Banerjee, who was to retire on May 31, was given an extension of three months and was asked by the Centre to report to Delhi. The state, however, refused to release him calling the Centre’s order “unprecedented” and “unilateral.” The chief secretary retired on May 31 and was appointed as special adviser to the CM.However, the battle had only just begun. The Centre sent a show-cause notice to Alapan Banerjee on May 31, insisting that his decision to miss the meeting convened by Modi was a violation of the Disaster Management Act 2005. Banerjee responded to it.Also Read | Centre begins action against ex-chief secy of BengalOn June 21, following up on its show-cause notice, the Centre warned of major penalty proceedings against him. Banerjee has to respond within 30 days.CM Mamata Banerjee, soon after coming to power, raised allegations of the Centre depriving West Bengal. She had even sent a barrage of letters to the Centre almost every day.“No breathing space to the ruling party” The BJP, which had suffered a blow in the elections, decided to go on the political offensive too. This became clear when the party’s president in the state, Dilip Ghosh, said that they won’t give any breathing space to the ruling party.Ghosh said, “We have 75 seats in the assembly. We will not allow any breathing space to the ruling party in the assembly even as protests would continue outside. The TMC won so many seats but there was no victory rally. It is because the people don’t want to be a part of their sins.”.If the first 50 days are any indication, the Bengal election result has only sparked the next round of political confrontation between the national and regional, Centre and the state, and the BJP and TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50-tumultuous-days-of-mamata-banerjee-s-government-30-101624448444462.html
23-06-2021||India||Kerala on high alert as 3 villages report cases of Delta Plus variant||Nearly three villages in Kerala have been put under lockdown after a genome sequencing study detected the presence of the highly infectious Delta Plus variant in some Covid-19 patients. Experts have warned that the new variant is very infectious, displays strong binding to receptors of lung cells and affects monoclonal anti-bodies rapidly. The detection of the new variant occurred at a time when cases have dipped and the government has just started opening up several sectors that were under lockdown for more than 40 days. One case was reported from Pathanamitta and two others from Palakkad district. “In Pathanamitta it was found in a four-year-old boy in Kadapra village and he’s tested negative now. We have cordoned off the area and all residents are undergoing RT-PCR tests. We have examined the travel history of the family and it seems mutation might have taken place locally,” said district medical officer Dr A L Sheeja. She said many patients from the area were earlier infected with Delta variant and mutation might have taken place locally. ALSO READ | Delta plus a Covid-19 ‘variant of concern’ in India: Health ministryIn Palakkad, the variant was detected in two women in their 50s and both of them tested negative later. Palakkad DMO K P Reetha said their primary contacts tested negative and a massive testing drive was going on in the area. District collector Mrunami Joshi said two villages Parali and Pariyari will be closed for a week and all residents will have to undergo RT-PCR tests. India is among ten countries where the Delta Plus variant has been found so far. There are over 40 cases of the new variant in the country, which has been tagged as a “variant of concern” by the Union health ministry. The states which have so far reported cases of the Delta Plus variant include Maharashtra with nearly 21 people infected, Kerala and pockets of Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.The Centre has advised the chief secretaries of these states to take up immediate containment measures in the districts where the new variant has been found, including preventing crowds and intermingling of people, widespread testing, prompt tracing as well as vaccine coverage of the local population on a priority basis.Very little is known about the virus currently. Head of the national experts group on vaccination and Niti Aayog member VK Paul said on Tuesday that the affected states have been sent advisories and asked to step up vigil. According to experts, the new variant is a mutant version of the B. 1.617. strain but there is little evidence on how virulent the strain is. After some preliminary studies in Maharashtra, experts found that the transmission rate was extremely high and the new strain reduces monoclonal antibody response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-on-high-alert-as-3-villages-report-cases-of-delta-plus-variant-101624448443332.html
23-06-2021||India||WhatsApp, Facebook widely used for news, trust in television low: Report||Online platforms like WhatsApp, YouTube, and Facebook are widely used for news consumption in India, according to an annual report by Reuters Institute. According to the global survey, India has emerged as one of the strongest mobile focussed markets, with 73% of users accessing news through smartphones and only 37% using computers.The reason behind the relatively greater use of smartphones than computers for news consumption is because many of the 600 million active internet users access the internet only through mobile phones, aided by low data charges and cheap devices, as per the survey. More than half of the respondents said they use WhatsApp and YouTube for news consumption.About 59% of the respondents, mainly English-speaking online users in India, used television for news while 82% of them said they consume news through online platforms, including social media. The report noted that the increased dependency on social media platforms for news consumption has also caused “serious problems with misinformation and hate speech.”“Facebook is seen as the main channel for spreading false information almost everywhere but messaging apps like WhatsApp are seen as a bigger problem in parts of the Global South such as Brazil and Indonesia,” Nic Newman, senior research associate, Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, said in the report.Also Read | HC refuses to stay CCI notice to Facebook, WhatsApp in privacy policy matterWhile television remains the most popular news source overall, print brands are more trusted than television which, according to the Digital News Report 2021, are “far more polarised and sensational in their coverage.” Citing the recent Television Rating Point (TRP) case, the report suggested that Republic TV has lower trust scores than legacy print and television brands despite its popularity.“Respondents are generally more affluent, younger, have higher levels of formal education, and are more likely to live in cities than the wider Indian population. Findings should not be taken to be nationally representative,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whatsapp-facebook-widely-used-for-news-trust-in-television-low-report-101624446993188.html

It is understood that Nirav Modi plans to make such an application.“We are waiting to see if they do apply for permission to appeal. If they are allowed to appeal then we would contest any appeal proceedings on behalf of the GOI (government of India),” the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which appears in court on behalf of the Indian authorities, said last month.Meanwhile, Nirav Modi remains behind bars at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London since his arrest over two years ago on 19 March 2019.In his ruling in February, District Judge Sam Goozee concluded that the diamond merchant has a case to answer before the Indian courts and that the bars to extradition under UK law do not apply in his case.As part of a very comprehensive judgment, the judge concluded that he was satisfied that there is evidence upon which Nirav Modi could be convicted in relation to the conspiracy to defraud the PNB.Also Read: 'Woman in question part of team that abducted Mehul Choksi', claims his lawyer“A prima facie case is established,” he said, in relation to all counts of charges brought by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) – including money laundering, intimidation of witnesses and disappearance of evidence.The court had also accepted that while Nirav Modi's mental health had deteriorated due to the lengthy incarceration in a London prison, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, his risk of suicide did not meet the high threshold to conclude that it would be "unjust or oppressive" to extradite him.Nirav Modi is the subject of two sets of criminal proceedings, with the CBI case relating to a large-scale fraud upon PNB through the fraudulent obtaining of letters of undertaking (LoUs) or loan agreements, and the ED case relating to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.He also faces two additional charges of "causing the disappearance of evidence" and intimidating witnesses or “criminal intimidation to cause death”, which were added to the CBI case.As witnessed in the extradition case of former Kingfisher Airlines chief Vijay Mallya – who remains on bail in the UK while a “confidential” matter, believed to relate to an asylum request, is resolved – there is still some way to go before Nirav Modi can be moved from Wandsworth Prison in London to Barrack 12 Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai and face trial in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-high-court-rejects-nirav-modi-s-extradition-plea-101624445614753.html

23-06-2021||India||On TRIPS waiver, Jaishankar says Covid is a calamity that requires 'last resort'||As Portuguese foreign minister Augusto Santos Silva on Wednesday said that Europe is philosophically against waiving intellectual property rights and this should be the last resort, foreign minister S Jaishankar said the pandemic has presented a situation that needs this "last resort". Both the ministers took part in an online session organised by the Observer Research Foundation on the "Future of India-EU relations".The Portuguese minister said that the European Union is deliberating the waiver proposal brought by India and South Africa and the EU is also waiting for a proposal from the United States. "Waiving IPR is a last resort kind of solution. We are discussing it. There are different views and we are still waiting for a proposal from the US, which said it would back a temporary IPR waiver. But no concrete proposal has been presented before the EU in the right framework," the minister said.Patent waiver proposal on Covid vaccines gets widespread support at G7: MEAReplying to the minister Jaishankar said that Europe is key in this proposal as many supply channels go through Europe. "When India and South Africa brought up the proposal, we were speaking for the larger global interest. We believe others too share that thinking," Jaishankar said.On ChinaThe two foreign ministers spoke elaborately on China where Augusto Santos Silva mentioned that China is a challenge and not a threat but on human rights issues, the EU considers India, not China, as its partner. Europe can't be silent on China squeezing domestic space in Hong Kong, its aggression in the South China Sea, its relations with Taiwan, or what China is doing in Xinjiang. But it is also a partner as without China the global targets of the Paris Agreement will not be fulfilled, Portugal foreign minister said.A new chapter for the TRIPS waiver proposal"We come from very different places and India shares its border with China. I have my military which is right up there in the border. I think my situation is very different from Europe," Jaishankar said.On India-EU tiesJaishankar also thanked the Portugal foreign minister for the remarkable six months of India-EU ties."We had a very important virtual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and all the EU leaders. We made some important decisions. One is the resumption of negotiations on the Trade and Investment agreement," Jaishankar said adding that it was not a capricious or purely diplomatic decision. "A lot of work went into it. We reached a stage, where we felt confident to do so," Jaishankar said.What is TRIPS waiver? TRIPS is a global agreement covering all member nations under the World Trade Organization. It is an agreement on patent, intellectual property rights etc. India and South Africa sought a waiver so that procuring vaccines and drugs made by developed countries become easy for developing countries. The European Union has so far opposed the proposal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-trips-waiver-jaishankar-says-covid-is-a-calamity-that-requires-last-resort-101624443642790.html

Shiva Subramanyam, Priya Mukherji, Shivendra Muldhekar and Ranjit Waltkar are the other four besides Goswami. The remaining two are linked to Maha Movie channel.

The complainant accused certain TV channels of rigging TRP via some of their relationship managers.According to the police, the Times Now channel's ratings were reduced and the ratings of the Republic channel were artificially increased by the accused due to which Times Now suffered a loss of ₹432 crore. Additional evidence has been submitted against Goswami and other accused in the second supplementary charge sheet, said police.Police claimed that some of the households with BARC Bar-o-Meters for measuring TRP were bribed by Republic TV and others Hansa Research Group’s relationship managers, who were directly in touch with the households.The first charge sheet against the 12 accused was filed on November 24, 2020, after the case was transferred to the CIU and the first supplementary charge sheet against three more accused on January 11 this year.The CIU officers said that the investigation revealed three modes of manipulation of TRPs--inducing the panel homes with Barc-o-Meters, paying money to watch certain TV channels for a particular amount of time, dual LCN.A case has already been made out against the representatives of all the channels involved in TRP manipulation - Box Cinema, Fast Marathi, Mahamovie, Republic TV and Republic Bharat, the police officers said.Police recovered a long WhatsApp chat between Goswami, who is the accused no.19 in the case and former BARC CEO Partho Dasgupta, during the course of the investigation.

23-06-2021||India||Ramdev moves Supreme Court over cases filed against him for his remarks on allopathy||Yoga guru Ramdev on Wednesday moved the Supreme Court challenging multiple first information reports (FIRs) against him for his comments on efficacy of allopathy in treatment of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). He has also sought protection from 'coercive actions' in the FIRs lodged by Indian Medical Association's Patna and Raipur wings.Ramdev had stirred controversy with his remarks that he was enjoying the dual protection of yoga and Ayurveda and that is why he didn’t opt for vaccination. He also claimed that the fatalities caused by Covid-19 showed that allopathy was not 100% effective.“For decades, I have been practicing yoga-Ayurveda doses so I didn’t feel the need to get vaccinated. Over 100 crore people of India as well as in foreign countries are in reach of these ancient therapies. In the coming time, Ayurveda will be globally accepted. A section of society is deliberately ignoring or deeming it inferior in comparison to allopathy,” Ramdev said.It all started when a video of the yoga guru surfaced last month, in which he was seen calling allopathy a ‘stupid science’ and alleging that thousands of doctors had died despite taking the Covid-19 vaccine. As calls for his arrest over the remarks were made, he challenged them and said "even their baap (father) cannot arrest Swami Ramdev". He later retracted those comments following the IMA and Union health minister’s objections. The IMA have, however, said they would drop the cases against him only if he withdrew his comments against allopathy in entirety.In what seemed like a damage control move, Ramdev described doctors as "God's envoys on earth" and said that he would soon get the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ramdev-challenges-in-supreme-court-cases-filed-against-him-over-his-remarks-on-allopathy-101624439505382.html

Then why should it stop him from getting vaccinated against Covid-19? According to reports, Gulshan went to a healthcare centre on Tuesday to get vaccinated. Covid-19 vaccines are generally administered in the arm muscle. But Gulshan said he can take the vaccine in his thigh muscle. After getting the jab, he reported no side effects, reports said.The existing vaccines against Covid-19 are to be administered through muscles as they are intramuscular vaccines. One nasal vaccine, which is believed to make vaccination hassle-free, is on its way.According to experts, there is a reason why the arm's deltoid muscle makes a good location for Covid-19 vaccines. Muscle tissues contain immune cells which carry the message (antigen or blueprint for producing antigen) to lymph nodes located just under the armpit. From deltoid muscle, they don't have to travel long. But if the vaccine is injected into the thigh muscle, it coordinated with the lymph nodes on the groin. Hence, it is not a challenge to get vaccinated in the thigh. But as it's inconvenient, Covid-19 vaccines are administered in the arm.From June 21, India has entered a new phase of vaccination in which the Centre is procuring 75 per cent of the vaccines from the manufacturers and distributing them among the states. On the very first day, India achieved record-breaking vaccination numbers with all states putting up the maximum efforts.The vaccination drive in India began on January 16 with healthcare workers. In the following phases, frontline workers, people above the age of 45 and then the population above the age of 18 were brought under the ambit of vaccination coverage. In rural areas, vaccine hesitancy is an issue that the administration is fighting as people are doubtful about the vaccine. In such a scenario, Gulshan Lohar's example is being seen as an exemplary one — to many.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhands-gulshan-lohar-lost-both-his-arms-gets-covid-19-jab-in-thigh-101624440517448.html

The All Indian NR Congress (AINRC)-led alliance, in which the BJP is a key constituent, won the elections in the Union Territory following the collapse of the then Congress-led regime earlier this year in February. The delay in Cabinet formation was caused by multiple factors and more recently, by infighting in the BJP as supporters of all the six elected MLAs were lobbying for Cabinet posts. “The list has five ministers--three from AINRC and two from the BJP,” said a senior AINRC leader not wishing to be quoted. Also Read | Odisha to reduce syllabus for class 9 and 10 by 30% for 2021-22 sessionFormer Congress heavyweight, A Namassivayam who moved to the BJP, is likely to be one of the ministers. His exit had led to a spate of resignations from the Congress. Though the BJP drew a blank in the 2016 assembly elections, it was the Congress turncoats who aided the party in winning six out of the nine seats they contested this time.Besides Namassivayam, senior BJP leader Sai Saravanan Kumar, who was elected from Oussudu, a reserved constituency for scheduled castes, is also likely to be inducted in the Cabinet.Initially the process was delayed as chief minister N Rangaswamy was down with Covid-19, a day after he took oath on May 7. The newly elected MLAs were sworn in almost three weeks later, on May 26. Later, negotiations were hard between the AINRC and BJP over the number of Cabinet berths.

23-06-2021||India||Rajesh Tope says officials asked to closely monitor Delta Plus variant in Maha||Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday said that he has directed officials to closely monitor the Delta Plus variant of SARS-CoV-2 causing Covid-19 disease, and that information about these cases should be collected and recorded for study. “We are taking 100 samples from every district,” ANI quoted him as saying.India has reported as many as 40 cases of Delta Plus variant, ANI reported on Wednesday citing government sources. “As of now among the samples sequenced (45,000+) in India, this variant has been observed sporadically in Maharashtra, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh with around 40 cases identified so far and no significant increase in prevalence,” a statement by the government read.Retrospective analysis of samples revealed the first occurrence of the Delta Plus variant from a sample collected from Maharashtra on April 5 this year, the statement further read.The Centre has advised Maharashtra, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh for strengthening surveillance and appropriate public health measures. “Currently, the number of such Delta Plus variants in India are only few but the distribution or detection in various states during past two + months indicate that [it] is already present in some states and [they] may need to enhance their public health response by focusing on surveillance, enhanced testing, quick contact-tracing and priority vaccination,” the official statement added.On Tuesday, the Union ministry of health and family welfare, in a statement, called Delta Plus a “variant of concern” (VoC). The ministry cited an analysis by a consortium of genomic sequencing labs that purportedly found the mutated virus to spread more readily. Addressing a press conference earlier that day, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan had called Delta Plus a “variant of interest” (VoI), implying that it is being studied.This comes after India achieved the highest single-day vaccination against coronavirus on Monday with 8.6 million vaccine doses administered across all states and Union territories. Speaking to the media, Bhushan on Tuesday said that the achievement was “not sudden” but a result of “coordinated planning”.Maharashtra on Tuesday reported 8,473 new Covid-19 cases, over 2,000 more than Monday, state health bulletin data showed. Following this, the overall tally of the state climbed up to 5,987,521, the bulletin added.Meanwhile, India on Wednesday reported a surge in daily caseload with 50,848 new cases in the last 24 hours, up from 42,640 cases on the preceding day.

Our government has approved their regularisation and has created regular posts kept in abeyance,” state law minister Ratan Lal Nath said on Tuesday. These teachers were appointed in 2012 on fixed pay scale during the erstwhile Left Front government in the state. Following their regularisation, their salaries will also stand revised. “Now, these science teachers get a salary of ₹20,475 a month and after they become regulars, their salary will be hiked to ₹33,853 a month including all benefits,” said the minister. The state has also introduced New Promotion Policy, 2021, under which employees will get a one-time promotion on an adhoc basis. “If any scheduled tribe, scheduled caste and general candidates are deprived of their promotion, we will give them promotion after creating supernumerary posts”, the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-nine-years-over-900-teachers-in-tripura-to-be-regularised-101624436562695.html

23-06-2021||India||What is the difference between Covid's Delta and Delta Plus variants?||Delta and Delta Plus variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have emerged as new threats to India's fight against the ongoing pandemic which witnessed several milestones of success with new infections nosediving and the number of vaccinations going up. Delta, first detected in India, is a global concern while Delta Plus — with 40 cases in India — requires more research. Delta Plus is a variant of Delta.Difference between Delta and Delta PlusDelta (B.1.617.2) was first detected in India. It is a variant of concern and a variant of interest.As Delta Plus (B.1.617.2.1/(AY.1) is a variant of Delta, it is also treated as a variant of concern. But the properties of the variant detected in India (AY.1) are still being investigated. According to India's Covid genome sequencing consortium, AY.1 cases have mostly reported from nine countries of Europe, Asia and America.Also Read | Delta, Delta Plus: Which vaccines are effective against Covid-19 new variantsThe two is differentiated by the K417N mutation in Spike protein which Delta Plus variants have.While Delta was first reported in India, Delta plus first reported by Public Health England on its June 11 bulletin. It said that the new variant was present in six genomes from India as of June 7.How many Delta and Delta Plus cases are there across the world?Delta has rapidly spread in the United Kingdom and reports said that Delta variant is responsible for 99 per cent of the UK's cases. In the UK itself, the number has surpassed 33,000 in a week. This variant is spreading to other countries as well.According to the Centre, as of June 18, 205 Delta Plus cases were detected worldwide, with the USA and the UK reporting more than half of the known cases.What is Ay.2 another variant of Delta?There are other Delta Plus variants with other mutations. Ay.1 has been found as the most common, but another mutant AY.2 has also been found in the United States. This has not been found in India yet.Is Delta Plus more transmissible, virulent than Delta?Delta variant of coronavirus has been held responsible for the second wave of the pandemic in India. Several other countries too consider Delta as the factor behind a sudden surge of cases. Experts in India have said Delta Plus, already detected in Maharashtra, can be the reason behind the third wave.Delta Plus resists monoclonal antibody cocktail therapy in which artificial antibodies are produced in the body. But India's expert committee has confirmed that resistance to this does not mean that this variant is more virulent.Delta Plus was already present in IndiaThe government on Wednesday clarified that after Public Health England reported Delta Plus on June 11, experts conducted a retrospective analysis of samples and found Delta Plus in a sample collected on April 5.The government has said that the number of Delta Plus variants in India are very few but the variant is already present in some states for the last two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-is-the-difference-between-covid-s-delta-variant-and-delta-plus-variant-101624435169704.html
23-06-2021||India||Rajasthan all set to get its 4th tiger reserve||Rajasthan is all set to get its fourth tiger reserve in Bundi as the state government has received the go-ahead for it from the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), officials aware of the matter said on Wednesday.Chief wildlife warden Mohan Lal Meena said the NTCA’s technical committee has approved the proposal for converting Ramgarh Vishdhari Sanctuary in Bundi, which is spread across 1,071 square km, into a tiger reserve. He added the state will soon issue a notification in this regard.Officials said a 302 square km area in the proposed tiger sanctuary will be left as critical habitat for big cats and the rest of the area will be the buffer zoneThe Rajasthan government last year first announced the plan to develop the Bundi sanctuary as a tiger reserve to provide a second habitat to Ranthambore tigers and to boost tourism.Ranthambore Tiger Reserve in Sawai Madhopur, Alwar’s Sariska Tiger Reserve, and Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve in Kota have over 100 big cats.A second forest official said NTCA is now expected to send a committee to review the Bundi sanctuary. He added the population of big cats at the Ranthambore Tiger Reserve is increasing and they need more space. This space crunch would get resolved by upgrading the Bundi sanctuary, which was earlier a natural habitat of tigers.Meena said tigers from Ranthambore could be translocated to the new sanctuary after NTCA’s approval.Officials also hope to connect Ranthambore to Ramgarh and Mukundra.“To strengthen the prey base, the state has already approved shifting of chital (spotted deer) from Ghana Bird Sanctuary (Karauli) to Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve, Keoladeo National Park, and Ramgarh Vishdhari,” said Meena.A third official said the fourth proposed sanctuary has been known as a breeding place for tigers. As per a 1985 census, there were nine tigers there. At least three cats have strayed out of Ranthambore to Ramgarh since 2013. This shows that tigers are migrating there naturally, the third official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-all-set-to-get-its-4th-tiger-reserve-101624434822697.html

23-06-2021||India||Minister Dharmendra Pradhan now blames Congress for petrol, diesel prices hike||Union minister of petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan on Wednesday linked the recent fuel price hike with the Congres rule and, citing economists, the minister said that the Congress had left oil bonds worth crores for repayment, which is why the current Bharatiya Janata Party-led government has to pay both its interest and principal price. “This is also a big reason for the rise in fuel prices,” he told news agency ANI.Pradhan further said that there has been a hike in crude oil price in the international market. “One of the main reasons behind the rise in fuel prices in India is that we have to import 80 per cent of the oil we consume,” he added to ANI.His remarks come after petrol and diesel prices in the country witnessed the 28th surge in 50 days on Tuesday after remaining unchanged for a day. The fuel prices were increased by 25 to 28 paise per litre at 6am on Tuesday. Following this recent surge, a litre of petrol in Mumbai – where prices are at the highest among the metros, is priced at ₹103.63, while the same quantity of diesel is priced at ₹95.72. The prices of one litre of petrol and diesel were ₹103.36 and ₹95.44, respectively. In Delhi, petrol and diesel are priced at ₹97.50 per litre and ₹88.23 per litre, respectively.In Kolkata, fuel prices are one of the lowest among the metros, with petrol priced at ₹97.38 per litre and diesel priced at ₹91.08 per litre. In Chennai, petrol now costs ₹98.65 per litre while diesel costs ₹92.83 per litre.A few days before, the minister said that the price could not be brought down because the government was saving money to spend on welfare schemes. "I accept that current fuel prices are problematic for people but be it central/state government, over ₹35,000 crore is being spent on vaccines in a year. In such dire times, we are saving money to spend on welfare schemes," Pradhan said.According to the latest price hikes, petrol now costs over ₹100 per litre in at least eight states and Union territories, including Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Maharashtra.Fuel prices remain most expensive in Rajasthan’s Sri Ganganagar where petrol costs ₹108.67 per litre and diesel is priced at ₹101.4 per litre.Notably, Congress staged a nationwide protest earlier this month against the increasing fuel prices. “Due to wrong policies of the Centre, inflation has become uncontrollable in the country and the prices of all essential commodities, including petrol, diesel and cooking gas, are increasing at an unprecedented rate,” Congress president in Rajasthan, Govind Singh Dotasra said.Petrol and diesel prices have been seeing hikes since May 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/minister-dharmendra-pradhan-now-blames-congress-for-petrol-diesel-prices-hike-101624431576427.html

Other issues like Bihar’s battle with the Covid-19 pandemic and floods are also likely to be addressed in the talks.Kumar arrived in the national capital on Tuesday. He, however, downplayed the reports linking his visit to the possible cabinet expansion. "I have no reaction to this. It is their internal matter," the JD(U) leader said, adding that he is in Delhi for eye checkup.Kumar said the expansion of cabinet is the privilege of the prime minister, and there is no issue over it.The JD(U) had decided to stay out of the Union Cabinet in 2019, when Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government began its second term. Kumar had decided against having a symbolic representation in the cabinet with just one minister and demanded that it would have been better had all NDA allies got proportional representation.The JD(U) has 16 Lok Sabha members, but the BJP had offered it just one berth.This time, there is expectation that the JD(U) will get more berths, considering the growing expectation within the party and BJP not in a position to upset its crucial ally at this stage.JD(U) president RCP Singh has already said that the party should get respectable representation in the Union cabinet and that the party should be consulted in this regard. “JD-U is part of the NDA and the allies should get respect in a coalition,” he had said just a few days ago.There is also the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) factor. Kumar may not prefer Chirag Paswan, who has been openly critical of the Bihar chief minister. The JD(U) leader is still upset with Paswan for reducing his party to third position in Bihar polls by fielding candidates against it.A senior JD(U) leader told Hindustan Times on condition of anonymity that the party is expecting a better share as the BJP would like the infighting within the LJP to settle before inducting anyone from the party.This wil be Kumar's second meeting with PM Modi after he took over as chief minister last year. Kumar had last met the Prime Minister in February this year, when he had backed the farm laws, describing them in the interest of farmers in the face of protests by the farmers’ bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitish-kumar-expected-to-meet-pm-modi-today-amid-buzz-around-cabinet-reshuffle-101624431615178.html

However, it is not possible for each and every student to avail online education. Hence, we have decided to reduce the syllabus,” said Dash.Last year too, the Odisha government reduced the syllabus for classes 1-10 by 30% following the closure of schools and suspension of classes due to Covid-19 outbreak. The government also promoted all the students up to class 9 and also of class 11 since holding examinations was not possible due to the threat of infection.From Monday, the state government started online teaching through YouTube for classes 1-8 in eight select districts and for classes 9 and 10 in all the districts. However, due to lack of digital connectivity, less than 1/3 of the total students are able to take part in the online classes, as per initial official estimates.Dash added that a decision regarding reopening of schools in Odisha was yet to be taken while the second wave of the disease shows signs of abating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-to-reduce-syllabus-for-class-9-and-10-by-30-for-2021-22-session-101624431822653.html

If approved, it will be the world's first DNA-based vaccine and the number of available vaccines in the country will rise to four.So far, India is administering Serum Institute's Coveshield, Bharat Biotech's Covaxin and Russia's Sputnik V."The analysis of the phase-three trial data is almost ready and the company has informed the government that it could apply for emergency use licensure for its Covid-19 vaccine next week," PTI quoted an official as saying.Also read: India could get Covid vaccine for kids, Zydus Cadila set to seek nod for ZyCoV-DAll you need to know about Zycov-D:The second indigenous vaccine after Bharat Biotech's Covaxin is a three-dose vaccine. According to Zydus Cadila, the three doses of Zycov-D are to be administered at day 0, day 28 and day 56. However, the company is also working on a two-dose vaccine.The data made availabe by the company shows that the vaccine candidate can be stored at temperature between two to eight degrees Celsius for long term and 25 degrees Celsius for the short term.This vaccine carries the genetic code for that part of a virus that triggers the immune system of the body. Like Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines use m-RNA to increase immunity, in the same way, it uses plasmid-DNA. The plasmid is a small DNA molecule present in human cells. This DNA is different from the common chromosome and is commonly found in bacterial cells and has the ability to replicate independently. m-RNA, also called messenger RNA, is said to enter the body and give messages to create antibodies against the coronavirus.The plasmid-DNA is converted into a viral protein when it enters the body, developing an immune response to the virus, stopping the virus from multiplication. If the virus mutates, the vaccine can be changed in a few weeks.The jab is also being tested on children in the age group of 12-18 years, apart from adults, according to Zydus.ZyCoV-D is said to be administered through a needle-free injection system (NFIS). Usually, in an NFIS, a jet of fluid is accelerated to the high speed that provides it significant penetrating power through a fine diameter nozzle when placed against the skin. Sharvil Patel, managing director of Cadila Healthcare, said that the vaccine might have higher acceptance among children scared of needles, according to a report in Business Standard.The Indian vaccine producer claimed to produce over 240 million doses in a year. The preparation of the company is such that the vaccine will be launched in the market just a few days after approval. The company plans to manufacture 20 million vaccines every month. The company will make 10 million does in the first month, after this, the production will be doubled, according to a report in Dainik Bhaskar.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zydus-cadila-to-seek-emergency-approval-for-its-covid-vaccine-all-you-need-to-know-101624427514740.html

Developed at the Kerala-based Rubber Research Institute of India (RRII), the sapling was planted by Rubber Board chairman and executive director KN Raghavan at the board’s farm in Sarutari near Guwahati. The GM rubber plant, the first of its kind developed exclusively for the northeast, is expected to thrive in the climatic conditions of the region. Also Read | Genetic Engineering: Tech that can alter living beingsThe plant, which has additional copies of gene MnSOD (manganese containing superoxide dismutase) in it, is expected to revolutionise natural rubber production in India. Raghavan said the plant is expected to tide over severe cold conditions during winters, a major factor affecting the growth of young plants as natural rubber is a native of warm humid Amazon forests and is not naturally suited for cold conditions in the northeast. Commercial planting would be taken up later, depending on the results of the experiments conducted at the farm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/worlds-first-genetically-modified-rubber-planted-in-guwahati-101624429542403.html

The three fugitives cheated the public sector banks of ₹22,586 crore, out of which 80.45% ( ₹18,170 crore) has been attached/seized by the ED, the agency said in a release.With the latest transfer, assets worth ₹9,371 crore have been handed over to the banks so far, which amounts to 40% of their losses, the agency said. These include assets worth ₹329.67 crore that were confiscated, the agency further said.ED not only attached/ seized assets worth of Rs. 18,170.02 crore (80.45% of total loss to banks) in case of Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi under the PMLA but also transferred a part of attached/ seized assets of Rs. 9371.17 Crore to the PSBs andCentral Government.The ED said that it unearthed the money trail by exposing a web of domestic and international transactions and stashing of assets abroad. The investigation revealed that the three accused used dummy entities controlled by them for rotation and siphoning off the funds provided by the banks, it said.The agency also said that extradition requests have been sent to countries where the three accused are living. While Mallya and Modi live in London (the UK), Choksi chose Antigua and Barbuda after running away from India.Mallya has been denied permission to file appeal in the UK Supreme Court, which has made his extradition to India almost final. While Modi's extradition to India has also been cleared, Choksi is fighting a legal battle in Antigua to stop the court from sending him to India.Mallya and Modi have been declared fugitive economic offenders by PMLA court in India, which looks after cases of money laundering.While Mallya is accused of defrauding a consortium of banks of over ₹9,000 crore involving his defunct Kingfisher Airlines, both Modi and his uncle Choksi are wanted in the Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud worth ₹14,500 crore.Modi was arrested on March 19, 2019, and was lodged at London's Wandsworth Prison. From the prison, he appeared on the hearings via video link as the case went on for years. Once extradited, Modi will be kept at Mumbai's Arthur Road Jail, which kept a special cell ready for him at barrack 12. If lodged in this barrack, earlier prepared for Vijay Mallya, Modi is likely to get three square meters of personal space, where a cotton mat, pillow, bedsheet and blanket will be provided, reports said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/banks-cheated-by-mallya-modi-and-choksi-get-rs-9-371-crore-from-ed-101624428568557.html

The song was uploaded on YouTube and quickly became popular. It got over 120,000 views within a few days.Dias first filed a police complaint accusing the singer of hurting religious sentiments and forced Gomes to apply for anticipatory bail. Gomes was granted bail before the lawmaker filed the civil defamation suit.Also Read | Tourism activities can resume only after everyone gets Covid-19 vaccine: Goa CMDias said he was forced to file the suit as Gomes accused him of destroying shrines--particularly crosses, prominent symbols of Catholicism in the state-- and then rebuilding them to show himself as the community’s saviour.“I do not mind singers, or theatre actors accusing me of corruption, or of amassing wealth or of indulging in illegalities. Such accusations are common against politicians... But he has said I break the shrines, so I have an excuse to repair them the following morning,” Dias said.Gomes said he has the freedom of speech and accused Dias of targeting him because “his misdeeds were being exposed”.“He did not want his misdeeds to be exposed. In the song, I said the dongui (hypocrite) MLA of Curtorim. I did not take anyone’s name. This is an attempt to stifle one’s freedom of speech. After making the complaint, he sent the police to my home to search my house,” said Gomes. “He said I was hurting religious sentiments. I have sung about only what has been reported in the media. I have all the proof. He can go ahead with whatever case he has.”Elvis Gomes, a former convener of the Aam Aadmi Party in Goa, said the lawmaker should understand that criticism from the stage is nothing new in the state. “It has been going on for years and it is considered as one of the powerful ways to give vent to the voice of the people. If a tiatrist (Goan theatre personality) or a singer from a stage says something, he can always counter it with his viewpoint either through the same medium or a press conference.”Elvis Gomes said the important question is whether police should be used against artists or anybody for that matter. “The MLA needs to understand that criticism from the public is the hallmark of democracy. I think they have become too sensitive because of the mistakes they are committing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-mla-files-rs-5-crore-defamation-suit-against-singer-in-goa-101624429062299.html

Addressing a recent public meeting in Warangal, KCR said he was given a Vitamin D tablet too, but he recovered within a week."As prescribed by a doctor, I used paracetamol and antibiotic medicines and was able to recover from COVID within a week. Media is trying to spread misinformation and create fear among people, KCR said, urging media to not sensationalise health issues.On black fungus, white fungus infections during Covid-19 recovery, on the greater risk of children contracting the infection in the possible third wave, the chief minister again asked whether Covid told all these to media and blamed media for inflating the fear.According to reports, he also recounted a story of a sorcerer who asked cholera why it was destroying so many lives. Cholera told the sorcerer that it killed 50 people while the rest died from panic. The same is the situation with Covid, the chief minister said.Telangana which recorded 1,175 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday and 10 deaths from the infection at present has no restrictions as the government has lifted all lockdown-like curbs and said that the decision has been taken in consultation with medical experts.In April, the chief minister tested positive after he reported mild symptoms like uneasiness. He quarantined at his farmhouse and a team of doctors was deployed to monitor his health. At that time, he was attending election meetings for the Nagarjunasagar by-election.Covid-19 infection can come with mild, moderate and severe symptoms. Experts have reiterated that while mild and many moderate cases can be treated at home, severe cases need hospitalisation.

After checking out their monthly basic salary, they are advised to check their existing DA. Currently, it's 17 per cent. Post-DA restoration, the DA will go up to 28 per cent. So, monthly DA will go up by 11 per cent. So, the DA allowance per month of a central government employee will go up to 11% of their basic salary from July 2021," he added.He further said that the same formula is applied while deciding the dearness relief (DR) benefit of a central government pensioner.7th pay commission DA calculatorKeeping the 7th pay commission salary calculation, if a central government employee's monthly basic pay is ₹20,000, then its monthly DA will go up to 28% of ₹20,000. This means a rise in monthly DA will be 11% of ₹20,000 or ₹2,200. Similarly, other central government employees who have different monthly basic salary mentioned in their 7th CPC pay matrix can check how much their salary will go up after the DA restoration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/da-benefits-to-central-govt-employees-from-july-1-how-to-calculate-101624424416881.html

The doctors say that many patients with coronavirus disease (Covid-19) come to hospitals with severe diabetic crisis just like that of childhood or type 1 diabetes. “Many Covid-19 patients initially show type 1 diabetes-like symptoms – extremely high sugar levels, ketoacidosis (a complication where blood turns acidic because of excess ketones produced), and need insulin injections. But, these are not true cases of type 1 diabetes as we have seen that they convert to normal type 2 diabetes, dependent on oral medicines three or four weeks after the infection,” said Dr Anoop Misra, chairman, Fortis-CDOC Centre for Diabetes, Metabolic Diseases and Endocrinology. He said seven of every 10 new diabetes patients who consulted him last month had been infected with Covid-19. This happens in around 5% of the hospitalised Covid-19 patients, he said. Also Read | Covaxin likely to be approved for children by Sept: Dr Randeep GuleriaType 1 diabetes, which is usually diagnosed in childhood (hence the name), happens because the body stops producing the glucose-digesting hormone insulin. Type 2 diabetes, on the other hand, happens because the body’s cells become resistant to the insulin produced. Dr Misra added, “The diabetes could be triggered by the stress to the body during the Covid-19 infection. Now, there is also a discussion of Covid-19 directly affecting the beta cells in the pancreas as they have the ACE II receptors used by the Sars-CoV-2 virus.” Dr M Ashraf Ganie, professor of endocrinology at Sher E Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, said, “The new onset of diabetes can be because of two reasons – stress due to the infection (cytokine storm is also known to make the body insulin-resistant), or the infection destroying the beta cells in the pancreas as shown by lab studies. It’s too premature to say what is happening.” “We need to follow up with patients and administer a beta cell panel test to see what is happening. We might get results in couple of months.The sheer number of people who had Covid-19 since last year would speed up the diabetes epidemic,” said Dr Ganie. Theoretically, those who are predisposed to diabetes, such as the obese and those with family history, might not return to their baseline blood sugar levels before Covid-19 , he said. Just after the April-May deluge of Covid-19 cases in Delhi, 90% of the new diabetes patients coming to Dr Misra’s clinics were those who got it after being administered steroids for the treatment of moderate and severe Covid-19. Last year, he had seen an increase in diabetes because of the sedentary lifestyle of the people due to the lockdown resulting in on average 2 to 4kg weight gain. This year, he said, people have adapted and have either been exercising at home or stepping out for walks. “The high numbers are also because many people who were unaware of their diabetic status got diagnosed when they reached hospitals with Covid-19. Around 30% of the diabetics with Covid-19 were unaware that they had the condition,” said Dr Misra. Will the people with new onset of diabetes after Covid-19 become lifelong diabetics? The doctors do not know for sure, yet. “The use of corticosteroids leads to blood glucose levels to shoot up not only in diabetics but even those without history. But, we will need long-term follow-up data to see whether this is hyperglycaemia (high sugar levels) after the infection or whether it converts into diabetes. Various infections like mumps and measles are known to trigger diabetes due to the stress on the body. But now people are talking about Covid-19 directly impacting pancreas, leading to diabetes,” said Dr Ambrish Mithal, chairman, department of endocrinology and diabetes, Max Healthcare. What is encouraging is that he has seen most of his patients return to their baseline blood sugar levels before Covid-19 within few weeks. “We are tracking some of the patients who haven’t. We have to see how much of this goes on to become permanent diabetes,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doctors-report-increase-in-new-cases-of-diabetes-during-covid-19-pandemic-101624425822134.html

A new mutant of the variant has already been found in India, in Maharashtra's Jalgaon and Ratnagiri, following which the health ministry has asked Maharashtra, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh to be exercise caution.Covid-19 variants have emerged as a cause of concern across the world as experts deliberate on the effectiveness of the vaccines to prevent the infection by the variants.Covaxin and CovishieldBharat Biotech's Covaxin and Serum Institute of India's Covishield are effective against the Delta variant, the health ministry has recently said. "Both the vaccines being administered in India, Covishield and Covaxin, (Sputnik joined later) are effective against Delta. But to what extent and what is the proportion of antibody titers produced by these vaccines will be shared soon," Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan has said.Sputnik VThe Russia-made vaccine, which became a part of India's vaccination drive, is effective against all variants of Covid known today, Gamaleya Centre head Alexander Gintsburg has said. "Antibodies developed after vaccination with Sputnik V protect from all variants of COVID known today, starting from the UK variant to the so-called Delta variant, first detected in India," he said. Sputnik has claimed better protection against new variants and that is why its marketer Russian Direct Investment Fund has proposed a booster shot to other vaccine makers, which will be the third shot after the regular two doses of vaccines."Antibodies developed after vaccination with #SputnikV protect from all variants of COVID known today, starting from the UK variant to the so-called Delta variant, first detected in India" - Head of the Gamaleya Center academician Alexander Gintsburg. pic.twitter.com/upaornSbEGPfizerPfizer which is finalising the agreement in India to supply its vaccines is also known to be effective to some extent against Delta variants. But the protection is against hospitalisation; the jury is still out over whether it can protect against the infection. A recent analysis by Public Health England has recently revealed that Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines offer high protection of over 90 per cent against hospitalisation from the Delta variant.Not much is known about the effectiveness of vaccines against Delta Plus as it is only an emerging variant. It has been found that Delta Plus is resistant to the monoclonal antibody cocktail treatment for covid-19, which was recently authorised in India. But this does not tell anything about its response to Covid-19 vaccines yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-delta-plus-which-vaccine-are-effective-against-covid-19-new-variants-101624422921159.html

We also need a big data pack. We have broadband [connection] at school which is good enough to watch YouTube classes being streamed live,” said Payal Majhi, a student of class 9. She is among the many students who were carrying their mobile phones to school to be able to join the online classes since Monday.The state government kicked-off online YouTube live streaming of lessons for classes 1-10 from Monday since schools have been closed for months due to the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier this month, the school education authority asked all district education officers and district project coordinators to make necessary arrangements to ensure smooth and successful implementation of the programme.The online teaching for classes 1-8 is being held in only 8 districts, sessions for classes 9-10 are being organised in all the 30 districts. The classes are being streamed from 9 am to 10 am for class 1 to 3 students, 9 am to 10.30 am for class 4 to 8 and 10.45 am to 1 pm for classes 9 and 10. The class are currently scheduled till July 2, but are likely to be extended as there is uncertainty over reopening of the schools.Koraput district education officer Ramachandra Nahak admitted that network connectivity was an issue in several blocks like Narayanpatna, Bandhugaon, Lamtaput and Boipariguda. “We can do little about improving network connectivity,” he said.The state has a great digital divide with the school and mass education minister Sameer Dash admitting that of the 6 million students, just about 2.2 million or roughly 33% could attend the online classes last year.As per Odisha Economic Survey, 2018-19, report, more than 20% of the 51,311 villages in the state did not have mobile phone connectivity. The internet subscription in rural areas stood at 16 per 100 where as in urban areas it was 83.3 per 100.Retired professor Sushil Dutta, who funds the education of several kids in Mayurbhanj district, said the YouTube live streaming was a good intentioned but unworkable idea. “Whole [of] Odisha is not a city. There are thousands of schools at extremely remote locations, where kids or parents can’t dream of having a phone or TV,” he said.Odisha Secondary School Teachers’ Association said the idea was too expensive.“Students of class9 and 10 will remain on-line for around six-eight hours a day for which a big data pack is required for uninterrupted internet connectivity. Where would they (students and guardians) get money to recharge data packs during the pandemic times?,” asked OSSTA general secretary Prakash Chandra Mohanty.Mohanty said classes through television were cost effective and better than the other modes of teaching during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-students-travel-to-school-to-attend-youtube-classes-in-absence-of-internet-connectivity-101624422882493.html

23-06-2021||India||New ethanol targets reshape India’s food policy||The Union government has prepared a blueprint to enable it to rapidly scale up ethanol blending to cut costly oil imports, reworking the country’s food policy that will focus on sucking out excess food stocks to produce fuel. Officials say this would achieve multiple goals, while some experts suggested the country ought to move cautiously, balancing its food-security needs.On June 5, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the advancing of the target year for 20% ethanol-blending by five years to 2025. The Union food ministry has prepared a blueprint towards achieving this goal, which HT has reviewed in the form of a presentation.“The new ethanol-blending targets will fuel an agricultural turnaround, result in better farm incomes and save precious foreign exchange while cutting down on unsustainable fossil fuels,” an official said, requesting anonymity.Also Read | Hunger, drought, disease: UN climate report reveals dire health threatsMixing petrol with ethanol, which is made from molasses, a byproduct of sugar, will help lessen the amount of oil India imports. Ethanol can also be produced from rice and maize. India is the third-largest oil consumer in the world after the US and China. Its crude oil import bill was well over $100 billion in 2018-19 and 2019-20.The plan shows the trajectory of a gradual increase in the quantity of sugar to be shifted towards ethanol. The country will also sell grains, such as rice and maize, held by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) for the purpose, setting a nominal price for the current year at ₹2000 a quintal (100 kgs) for rice. At that price, millers can produce cheaper ethanol at ₹56.87 a litre.In January, the Union government notified a modified scheme to incentivise ethanol production in the country, which allows sugar mills cheaper loans to set up ethanol-blending factories. Such ethanol projects would be viable because oil-marketing companies would be assured buyers for the next 10 years under the scheme, according to the official.India has seen a surplus production of sugar since 2010-11, except in 2016-17, when drought cut output. In a normal sugar season, about 32-33 million tonne of sweetener is produced, making India the second-largest producer. India is also the largest consumer of sugar globally at 26-27 million tonne.“It is a welcome step as it will have multiple benefits. Countries such as France, Denmark and the US have already made large gains from biofuels,” said PK Joshi, the president of the Agricultural Economics Research Association, New Delhi.Food security experts point to a cautionary tale. Developments in the West show there has been fierce competition between food and fuel crops for land, which is fixed in supply. The current spell of high edible oil prices is partly due to high demand from the biofuel industry, according to an FAO analysis this month.“If we are going to increase cash crop, which is for fuel, not food, the transition may create a certain tension. There is always a fine line. You can say this is right and wrong. Moving judiciously is the answer,” said Samrat Sengupta, an energy expert at the Centre for Science and Environment, New Delhi.Sengupta welcomed the move saying: “Renewables have at last moved to the centre of the political agenda.”In 2020-21, an estimated 3% of the ethanol blending programme was grain-based, mainly through federal stocks. According to the food ministry, two million tonne sugar (or 6 % of total) would be diverted to ethanol in the current season, going up to 6 million tonne (or 18%) by 2025.Excess sugar stocks have affected the ability of millers to pay farmers, a long-standing issue. Official data show that millers owed farmers an amount totalling ₹22,900 crore for cane purchased till March 1.“We are shocked to see FCI food grains being used to make ethanol and hand sanitisers when there is so much hunger in the country,” said Dipa Sinha, a food security expert who teaches at Ambedkar University, New Delhi. India ranked 94 out of 107 nations according to the Global Hunger Index 2020, which found a serious level of hunger, whose definition covers malnutrition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-ethanol-targets-reshape-india-s-food-policy-101624419942244.html

23-06-2021||India||What leads to formation of Covid-19 wave? Govt expert lists 4 elements||Amid concerns over a possible third wave of coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, a government expert has listed the factors or elements that lead to the formation of a wave. NITI Aayog Member (Health) Dr VK Paul, while addressing a press conference on Tuesday, said there are four such elements.The first, according to the health expert, is behaviour of the virus which has the capacity and ability to spread. Then, a susceptible host which the virus keeps looking for to survive.Dr Paul said transmissibility is also one of the leading factors. The virus can become smart enough where it mutates and becomes more transmissible, he said. The fourth element is opportunity, "which we give to the virus to infect" said Dr Paul. "If we sit and eat together, crowd, sit in closed areas without masks, then the virus gets more opportunities to spread. A call to do what is in our hands," he added.Dr Paul said that out of the four, two elements - susceptibility and opportunities for infection "are totally under our control", whereas the other two - behaviour of the virus and transmissibility cannot be predicted or controlled.Speaking on the overall Covid-19 pandemic situation in the nation, Dr Paul said there is a consistent improvement but stressed that people must continue to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and avoid crowds and parties. He also stressed on increasing the uptake of vaccination.The Niti Aayog member also mentioned that the coronavirus is suppressed at present due to discipline and restrictions prevalent in many states, and if restrictions are eased and schools opened, then it gets opportunities to infect.This comes as the health officials are rallying to prepare for the Covid-19 third wave, predicted by many researchers and doctors.A group of medical experts surveyed by news agency Reuters has projected that India’s next Covid-19 wave would arrive by October, adding that though this third wave would be handled better than the second wave, the Covid-19 pandemic would remain a public health concern for at least one more year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-leads-to-formation-of-covid-19-wave-govt-expert-lists-4-elements-101624416949384.html

23-06-2021||India||Congress leader alleges Odisha district collector took bribe to award tender||A senior Odisha Congress leader has alleged several irregularities in the tender process to award seven stone quarries for mining in Malkangiri district and accused the district collector of taking a bribe of ₹1 crore for awarding the rights to a favoured bidder. He has sought the officer’s suspension and a probe into the matter. The collector has however rejected the allegations.Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee working president Pradeep Majhi has alleged that the district collector, Yeddula Vijay, kept and manipulated tender applications at his home against the rules to help a businessman. He also claimed that the collector also erred in inviting the tenders for stone quarries at his office by bypassing the tehsildar, who was the competent authorities to deal with it. He also alleged that the district treasury confirmed that the collector didn’t deposit the tenders on time on March 20 as was claimed in an RTI reply by his office.“However, a second RTI filed with [the] district treasury said the sealed tender boxes were kept in the district treasury on March 23 at about 1.40 PM. We suspect that the tender boxes were taken to the residence of the district collector and kept there between March 20 and 23, when he opened the sealed boxes and manipulated the tender papers in favour of the businessman, enabling him to win all 7 stone quarries,” alleged Majhi.Majhi alleged that Venugopal was given ₹1 crore, while the minimum guaranteed quantity (MGQ) of the allocated seven stone mines was worth ₹2.38 crore.“The collector took ₹1 crore as bribe and a luxury SUV worth ₹19 lakh to allocate the stone quarries. That vehicle is being used as his official vehicle without a valid contract carriage permit. The finance department has issued clear instruction that district collectors can hire SUVs only with valid contract carriage permits. But the district collector of Malkangiri is using a vehicle which does not have a valid contract carriage permit. This is a clear violation of govt guidelines,” he alleged.Majhi demanded that the district collector be suspended, the tender was quashed and the process be probed.However, Malkangiri collector has rubbished the allegations levelled by the Congress leader and claimed that the tendering process was above board. “The tender has been done as per the procedure. I took the tender boxes home because of security concerns at the office. I hired a vehicle after my car broke down,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-leader-accuses-odisha-district-collector-of-taking-bribe-to-manipulate-tender-process-101624416881839.html

One Nation One Ration Card: This first reform required state governments to ensure that all ration cards in the state under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) were seeded with Aadhaar numbers of all family members, wrote Prime Minister Modi. The main benefit from this, according to the PM, is that migrant workers can draw their food ration from anywhere in the country. Another financial benefit from this is the elimination of bogus cards and duplicated numbers.Seventeen states completed this reform and were thus granted additional borrowings amounting to ₹37,600 crore.(2.) Improving ease of doing business: This second reform, wrote PM Modi, required states to ensure renewal of business-related licenses is made automatic, online and non-discretionary on mere payment of fees. Another requirement was to implement a computerised random inspection system to reduce harassment and corruption. This reform, covering 19 laws, is most beneficial to small and medium businesses, and also promotes an improved investment climate, greater investment and faster growth.Twenty states completed this reform and got additional borrowings worth ₹39,521 crore.(3.) Notifying floor rates of property tax, water and sewage charges: PM Modi wrote that this third reform was to enable better quality of services to the urban poor, middle class, as well as to support better infrastructure and to stimulate growth. He added that this reform would benefit poor living in urban areas the most, and also help municipal staff who often face delay in payment of wages.Eleven states which completed this reform were granted additional borrowings of ₹15,957 crore.(4.) Direct Benefit transfer (DBT): This fourth and final reform has 0.15% of gross domestic product (GDP) linked to it, wrote Prime Minister Modi. He added that the addition of a component for reduction in technical and commercial losses, and another for reducing the gap between revenues and costs, improved the finances of distribution companies, promoted conservation of water and energy and improved service quality.From this, 23 states got additional borrowings of ₹1.06 lakh crores out of a possible ₹2.14 lakh crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reforms-under-aatmanirbhar-bharat-improved-ease-of-living-writes-pm-modi-101624405750184.html

At the same time, we're also witnessing infiltration of weapons and ammunition, using drones. It doesn't augur well for peace as these drugs and weapons are meant to disrupt the internal peace process," Rawat told news agency ANI.Asserting that India wants peace in the entire Jammu and Kashmir region, Rawat said, "If the internal peace process is disrupted, then we can't really say that the ceasefire is holding. The ceasefire doesn't mean that you ceasefire along borders, but you at the same time create trouble in the hinterland."India and Pakistan had in February agreed to a strict observance of all agreements, understandings and cease firing along the LoC and all other sectors.Speaking on theaterisation of forces, Rawat said that the process is going on well and it is making satisfactory progress."Amongst the three services, we have been able to resolve most of the issues. There is a better understanding that if the three services integrate, they can bring about jointness and carry out transformation. Then I think, we will ensure better efficiency and utilisation of our existing services. I think we'll be better prepared for combat in the future," he said.He added that the final structure will only be decided after the initial organisation is created."Of course, we have to look at the land-based theatres which will be Eastern and Western Theatres...How the final structure will evolve will only happen after we have created the initial organisation and it will take some time...There is a requirement for one agency to control and ensure that air management doesn't lead to fratricide. Then we have a large border along the coastline and high sea in the Indian Ocean Region. We need to ensure that we have one organisation looking after that," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-using-drones-to-infiltrate-weapons-drugs-to-disturb-internal-peace-rawat-101624407497341.html

It also said that the neighbouring country should be held "accountable for aiding and abetting terrorism".The remarks were made by Pawankumar Badhe, first Secretary, Indian Permanent Mission in Geneva at the 47th Session of the United Nations Human Right Council (UNHRC). Exercising India's right to reply following Pakistan's remarks, Badhe highlighted the systematic persecution of minorities in Pakistan through draconian blasphemy laws, forced conversions and marriages and extrajudicial killings."The scourge of terrorism is the gravest violation of human rights and must be dealt with in strongest terms in all its forms and manifestations," he said.The remarks came after Khalil Hashmi, permanent representative of Pakistan to the UN in Geneva, tried to raise the Kashmir issue at the interactive dialogue on the annual report of the high commissioner.Badhe accused Islamabad of distracting the Council's attention from the "deplorable human rights situation in Pakistan".Also Read: 'China one of the greatest friends’, Imran Khan says on Uighur Muslims genocide"Forced conversions have become a daily phenomenon in Pakistan. We have seen reports of minor girls belonging to religious minorities being abducted, raped, forcibly converted and married. More than 1,000 girls, belonging to religious minorities, are forcibly converted in Pakistan every year," the Indian official said."Journalists are threatened, intimidated, taken off air, kidnapped and in some cases killed, mainly to silence critics of the Establishment. While families of victims continue to struggle for justice, the perpetrators of these acts have enjoyed complete impunity," Badhe added.This comes days after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan sought the intervention of the US to settle the Kashmir issue with India, during an interview with the news programme Axios on HBO.Khan acknowledged he hasn’t spoken to US President Joe Biden since the latter assumed office in January and said he would raise the issue of Kashmir if there was a meeting between the two leaders.In the past, India has ruled out intervention or mediation on the Kashmir issue by any third party. New Delhi has also maintained that the region is an integral part of India, in the wake of statements from Islamabad opposing any possible changes in Jammu and Kashmir. India said such moves amounted to interference in the country’s internal matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-providing-pension-to-terrorists-must-be-held-accountable-india-101624407217871.html

23-06-2021||India||Now, SC judge recuses from hearing pleas in Narada case||Supreme Court judge justice Aniruddha Bose recused himself on Tuesday from hearing a case involving the West Bengal government, withdrawing from a matter on the appeals of chief minister Mamata Banerjee and the state’s law minister Moloy Ghatak linked to the Narada tapes case.In less than a week, two Supreme Court judges hailing from Kolkata have now withdrawn themselves from two politically sensitive cases involving the state government. On June 18, justice Indira Banerjee expressed “personal difficulties” in taking up a clutch of petitions related to post-poll violence in the state. Judges are not obligated to give reasons while opting out of hearing cases.On Tuesday, three petitions were listed for hearing before a bench of justices Hemant Gupta and Bose to consider appeals by Banerjee, Ghatak and the state against a Calcutta high court order of June 9. The HC refused to accept their affidavits in opposition to the Central Bureau of Investigation’s petition to transfer the Narada case.The case pertains to a sting operation, allegedly showing Trinamool Congress leaders accepting bribes. The TMC leaders have denied the charges.The batch of cases was called out in the apex court on Tuesday and Justice Gupta passed the order releasing it from the bench. The order said the matters needed to be listed before another bench, of which justice Bose is not a member. It also requested Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana to assign the cases to a different bench.“These matters will be listed before some other bench. Justice Bose has some reservations in hearing them,” justice Gupta told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who represented CBI.Justice Bose, who did not specify the reason behind his recusal, completed his education in Kolkata before he began practising there as a lawyer in 1985 and was elevated as a judge to the Calcutta high court in 2004. He became a judge in the Supreme Court in May 2019.In 2015, when a Constitution bench struck down the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC), one of the members of the bench, justice Kurian Joseph penned down a separate judgment to hold that judges must disclose reasons when they decide not to hear a case.Another judge on the NJAC bench, justice Madan B Lokur also said that questions over recusal were quite significant and it was time that some procedural and substantive rules were framed in this regard.Former CJI KG Balakrishnan said: “It is up to the judges to decide whether they want to give reasons for recusal or not. There may be some embarrassing situations or facts that they may not be interested in explaining... Somebody could have a personal relationship with a party or some judge could have appeared as lawyers for someone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/now-sc-judge-recuses-from-hearing-pleas-in-narada-case-101624394256927.html
23-06-2021||India||‘BJP’s silence hurts me; have faith in PM’: Chirag Paswan||President of the Lok Janshakti Party and Lok Sabha MP from Jamui in Bihar, Chirag Paswan is caught in a family feud with his uncle Pashupati Paras and cousin Prince Raj over the control of the party. A former NDA ally, his relations with the Bharatiya Janata Party also came under a cloud after he attacked the other ally, the Janata Dal United and Bihar chief Minister Nitish Kumar. In an interview to HT he said he feels hurt by the BJP not supporting him and will look for alternatives if pushed to do so. Edited excerpts:Were you blindsided by what you uncle and cousin did?Yes, while I was fighting with outsiders, I did not know that I will have to fight insiders as well. And there was no way for me to know this was building up because on September 27, 2020, just 11 days before my father’s death Paras wrote a letter that there are reports of some party members taking part in antiparty activities and his name has also been dragged into this, which he thinks is a conspiracy by the opposition. He extended support to the party president.What do you think is responsible for this rift?This is a betrayal. This is a betrayal of not just me but the party as well. Throughout his life my father took his brothers along, but I have been left alone by them. I will have no one by my side when I observe the first anniversary of my father’s death. I know that people from the JDU are involved in this but it’s my own people who have betrayed me.How did you feel when Paras refused to meet you?I was very sad. I was most upset when I saw how sad this made my mother. I saw her sitting and crying alone. She spent all her life keeping the family together and they used to treat her well, but after my father‘s death they did not speak to us, nor do they visit. And when my mother found out about what was happening, she called up everyone from the driver to the office staff attempting to speak to them (uncle and cousin). I was put on an antibiotic drip, but when I saw her, alone and shattered, that is when I lost it all. Soon after my father’s death, they stopped talking to us, only my cousin used to talk.What do you say to the allegations that you were running the party in a very autocratic manner.Had I been autocratic why would 95% of the party members stand by me. I don’t know what was offered—money or power—to these people who are speaking against me.In hindsight do you think breaking away from the NDA and attacking Nitish Kumar was unwise?Not at all. Rather if I were to redo it, I would have done it exactly the way I’ve done it. And why shouldn’t I. My father’s and my politics, our party’s policies have been against Nitish Kumar. Ever since my father formed the party in 2000, our fight has been against Kumar. Whether it was the 2005 (state) elections or the 2009 general elections we always contested against the JDU. Even the 2015 (state) election we contested as opponents. The only exception was the 2019 general election, when Kumar overnight became a part of the NDA alliance, and we were helpless since we had to contest elections together. Even then my father was uncomfortable about the idea of working together with Kumar. Because throughout Kumar has tried to pull him down, destroy his party and finish him politically. And this is not the first time he has tried to break our party.In 2005, he tried to break away our MLAs and district presidents. Then again, he tried to poach our MLCs. Even now we had one elected legislator (from Maithani), they took him too. And now he has tried to break my party as well as my family. The whole concept of Dalit and Mahadalit was created to finish my father‘s politics.In 2014 our alliance was with Bharatiya Janata Party not the JDU. And that time Kumar had snapped ties with the BJP and raised questions on Narendra Modi’s claim to premiership. On many issues the Nitish Kumar government did not support the Modi government, whereas we have been steadfastly standing with the BJP and supporting them even on issue such as the Citizenship Amendment Act CAA and the (proposed) national population register (NRC). Now if the home ministry wants to implement NRC in Bihar what will they do, because the Bihar assembly has passed a resolution against it.Do you feel the BJP did not address your concerns.I told them very categorically right before the assembly elections began (about my concerns)….I had a meeting at the residence of BJP president JP Nadda, where the BJP organisational general secretary BL Santhosh and home minister Amit Shah were also present that there are two points that I cannot negotiate on. One was the number of seats that they were offering me; they were giving us only 15 whereas we wanted at least six seats per MP. The second issue was that I did not believe that Nitish Kumar had any policy that could bring about development in Bihar. I do not agree with his Saat Nishchay scheme. I said we should have a common minimum programme because that is how coalition governments work. He overlooked the vision document that my father had drafted when he was hospitalised. I even told the BJP president that they should not work on his agenda.I don’t know if BJP understood my concerns or not but I was very clear. And my father’s last words to me were no matter what do not align with Nitish; contest alone otherwise he will try to finish you as he tried to do with me. And the support that I got from people in Bihar is the reason why I contested elections alone.Do you feel the BJP has left you on your own?I am hurt. My father and I stood by the BJP when nobody was there with them. And today when I need them, I expect their support. I still have faith in the Prime Minister. He is the only reason why we joined the NDA, especially me. I forced my father to join the NDA because of him. But if I am pushed and cornered then I am left with no option but to look out for alternatives.So is the Mahagathbandhan the other alternative?That is for my party to decide. If we are pushed away, then my party and I will sit together and decide on the next step.Have they reached out to you?That is a general practice. When such things happen then the opposition tends to reach out. I have a lot of friends in the opposition too. My father was a very friendly person he was liked by people across party lines. Same goes with me. We are in touch but on a personal level nothing official. But then yes, pushed beyond a point we will have to think about the future course.Has anybody in the BJP tried to reach out to you?Not yet. And their (BJP's) silence hurts me. Like I said, I still have faith in my PM. I did expect that he will intervene and mediate and try to solve the problem. Everyone from the opposition has reached out to me. I do have friends in the BJP, on the personal level I have spoken to several people and even ministers. But officially, my expectations were not met. My father stood with the PM till his last breath. I have stood by him in every decision. When you needed me, I was with you, today when I need you, if you don’t support me and keep cornering me then I will have to look for alternatives.You are talking about the party taking a decision but right now the party is in trouble. There are two groups fighting for control. How will you scotch the differences?I don’t know how I’m going to do that, but I am very proud that my party has stood by me. A party is not only about MPs and MLAs; they all come and go. And this is not happening just to my party it has happened to parties across the world. This is the reason why we have rules and regulations because elected members come and go or change affiliation. Today, we have six members in Lok Sabha, and these were not there in 2014.These people cannot discuss the future of the party, that is based on the organisational structure and the soul of the party is the Constitution. I’m happy the whole organisational set up strongly stands with me. We have a minimum of 75 national executive members of which 66 are with me and have given sworn affidavits. Of all the state presidents only the ones from Jammu and Kashmir and Delhi and not with me, the rest support to me.Have you approached the election commission with these supporting affidavits to stake claim to the party symbol?Yes, we have. We told them we have terminated these people from the party and if anyone stakes claim they should inform us. They (Paras and others) told the EC, that a new president was appointed because after the passing away of Ram Vilas Paswan, the LJP did not have an election. What they are forgetting is that the election was conducted in 2019 when my father resigned as president on health grounds and because he had ministerial responsibility. And as per our constitution, the president has a term of 5 years, unless he passes away or resigns. I was elected president on November 5, 2019, and four days later the EC was informed. Incidentally, the main proposer for my election was Pashupati Paras and Suraj Bhan Singh seconded it.I have told the Lok Sangh speaker Om Birla the same thing. MPs cannot decide the leader of the party, it is the call of the party leadership. He is yet to get back to me.I am ready for a long fight. I am ready to go to court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjps-silence-hurts-me-have-faith-in-pm-chirag-paswan-101624393525980.html

However, people have to be careful that they don’t visit crowded areas, maintain social distancing, wear a mask, and observe hand hygiene. If all these measures are strictly adhered to, and there is no comorbidity, then elderly can also lead normal lives to some extent. Yes, of course, they can go for a walk; but no, they can’t go to markets like Sarojini Nagar during festival season as that is high risk situation.

Edited excerpts:You have decided to attend the all-party meeting. What makes you trust Prime Minister Narendra Modi again?Mr Narendra Modi is not just an individual. He is the Prime Minister of the country, and I am putting my faith in the post of the Prime Minister. Our special status was given to us by the Constitution of India, not by Pakistan or China or the United Nations, or an individual.You were incarcerated for over a year, and even denied a passport. What do you think New Delhi will be willing to offer?We have been invited for talks. I don’t know what is on their plate. I can tell you that we, the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), are very clear about our agenda. What happened in August 2019 is unacceptable. Article 370, which gave the state its special status, was unconstitutionally removed. It was a bridge that also connected us emotionally to the rest of India. We will not settle for less. We want Article 370 to be restored. We are fighting within the Indian Constitution, of which 370 was a part. Jammu & Kashmir was referred to as the crown of India. Delhi should have been proud of this crown, but they’ve dismantled it because it was a Muslim-majority area.Also read | Gupkar leaders to be part of PM’s J&K meetThe Modi government has said time and again that there is no question of restoring Article 370. Are you willing to settle for statehood?Nothing is cast in stone. [Atal Bihari] Vajpayee and other tall leaders, like Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel, understood the importance of Article 370. The BJP’s (Bharatiya Janata Party’s) manifesto cannot rule this country, the Constitution will. We will not settle for anything other than the restoration of Article 370.Will you contest an election if polls are held?I am very clear that I will not fight an election till Article 370 and 35A are restored. That is final. My party, the PDP, will contest, but I will not; not till I can also hold the flag of Jammu & Kashmir again.Your constituents will be watching closely. What would you say to those who see you and other mainstream politicians as traitors? All of you were blamed after the special status was withdrawn in August 2019.Mainstream politicians are seen as Delhi’s agents. It is a bitter pill I have learnt to swallow. Always remember that the mainstream parties in J&K held the Tricolour for the last 70 years — not out of fear of being called anti-nationals, but out of their conviction. My father, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, had a political vision not only for J&K but also for the country, and he believed dialogue was the way to break the cycle of bloodshed.The Centre promised development, jobs and a violence-free Kashmir but some youth are still picking up the gun. Do you think they should be engaged with as well?Where are the jobs? All sections need to be engaged. There is so much suppression here. As soon as you open your mouth, we are booked under the Public Safety Act. If the government can travel to Doha to engage with the Taliban, why can’t it talk to its own people? In Kashmir, even the common person is treated like a terrorist. So many people are still under detention. Elsewhere, prisoners have been given relief because of Covid, but not here. Why these double standards?You were dumped by the BJP in June 2018. What is the least you expect from the all-party meeting?There is no question of least. The Gupkar alliance was set up to fight for the restoration of Article 370. We will continue this fight.What happened in August 2019 is completely unacceptable and should be reversed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wont-settle-for-statehood-art-370-must-be-restored-mehbooba-mufti-101624390871470.html

Article 370, which gave the state its special status, was unconstitutionally removed. We will not settle for less. We want Article 370 to be restored,” Mufti said in an interview to HT, referring to the Centre’s controversial decision to strip Jammu & Kashmir of its special status under Article 370 of the Constitution on August 5, 2019, and split the erstwhile state into two Union territories.“We are fighting within the Indian Constitution, of which 370 was a part,” she said. “Our special status was given to us by the Constitution of India, not by Pakistan or China or the UN, or an individual,” she added.The meeting between Modi and mainstream parties from Jammu & Kashmir on June 24 is the first such meeting after August 2019. In the past, the Union government has said it was open to restoring Jammu and Kashmir’s statehood but ruled out reinstating Article 370When asked if PAGD will accept if full statehood is restored, Mufti said the alliance will not settle for anything less than full restoration of Article 370. “Nothing is cast in stone. [Atal Bihari] Vajpayee and other tall leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel understood the importance of Article 370. The BJP’s (Bharatiya Janata Party) manifesto cannot rule this country, the Constitution will. We will not settle for anything less,” she said.Mufti, the last serving chief minister of the erstwhile state whose alliance with the BJP broke in 2018, also reiterated her commitment to not fight the elections unless the changes of August 5, 2019, were rolled back.“I will not fight an election till Article 370 and 35A are restored... My party, the PDP, will contest, but I will not,” she said. Article 35A empowered the state legislature to define permanent residents and bestow special privileges to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wont-settle-for-statehood-want-restoration-of-article-370-mehbooba-mufti-101624389993533.html

23-06-2021||India||Outrage over alleged dowry-related deaths of 2 Kerala women, husbands in custody||The deaths of two women in Kerala related to alleged dowry harassment in two days have provoked outrage and prompted calls for changes in the law to prevent such incidents. A 24-year-old woman was found dead in Kollam on Monday. Another woman allegedly died after she set herself ablaze on Tuesday in Thiruvananthapuram. In the Kollam case, the husband was booked under Sections 498 (domestic violence) and 306 (abetment to suicide). of the IPC. In the second case, arrest was not formally recorded so far.State police chief Loknath Behra has constituted a special investigation team under IG Harshita Attaluri to probe the cases. Police said they were waiting for post-mortem reports for both cases and will interrogate the in-laws as well. In the Kollam woman case, her parents said she was continuously harassed over the car gifted during the marriage. In the video chat just before her death, she sent photos of injury marks and scars allegedly inflicted by the husband over this. They said he told the daughter that he was entitled to a luxury car, and the one gifted by her parents was only worth ₹10 lakh. He also complained frequently about the low mileage of the vehicle. Parents said during the marriage last year, they gifted their daughter over 100 sovereigns of gold, one-acre land, a car, among other things. “He did not like the car I gifted and always used to argue with my daughter over this. When he came here last time, he sought ₹10 lakh, which I refused. His torture aggravated after this,” the victim’s father, also a leader of Communist Party of India in Kollam district, lamented. He said hanging marks were not there on the body of his daughter. In another case, a 24-year-old woman allegedly committed suicide after setting herself on fire in Vizinjam. Her husband was later detained by the police. Her parents said he used to harass their daughter for dowry. The father said when the husband came home on Monday to pick his wife, he was carrying a bottle of diesel. When he asked about this, the husband reportedly told him that it was for the ants. He alleged his daughter would never commit suicide, and she was set on fire while she was sleeping. She was married off last year.“Both incidents are heart-rending. It is sad despite a good education and economic background many are succumbing to the dowry menace. We need stricter provisions to curb this,” said state women commission member Shahida Kamal. Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala and animal husbandry and dairy development minister Chinchu Rani called on the bereaved family on Tuesday. “Both incidents are shocking. We have to ensure such ugly incidents will not recur,” said PCC president K Sudhakaran in his post. “Both cases cause real pain. Attitude towards women remains unchanged. Educated and empowered, they should have severed their relations and led a life without them rather than embracing death like this,” wrote public health activist Dr Shimna Azeez in her Facebook post. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has condemned both incidents. “Such incidents are a setback to the progressive society of the state. We will ensure proper punishment to perpetrators,” he said. Later the state police released two toll-free numbers to help women to register such complaints.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/outrage-over-alleged-dowry-related-deaths-of-2-kerala-women-husbands-in-custody-101624388380121.html
23-06-2021||India||HC orders inspection at Renault-Nissan unit, sets July 3 deadline||Chennai: The Madras high court on Tuesday directed automobile major Renault Nissan’s manufacturing facility to strictly enforce Covid-19 guidelines, as recommended by the Directorate of Industrial Safety, by July 3. The court also directed that a team of the Directorate of Industrial Safety inspect the manufacturing unit on the same day and submit a report. The first bench, comprising Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, passed the order in the case filed by the workers’ union of Renault against the management. In the previous hearing, the management had appealed to the court that a level-playing field be ensured so that the same standards should apply to all automobile manufacturing units without singling out the Renault-Nissan because of its more vociferous workers. The court had then directed officials of the Directorate of Industrial Safety to visit the automobile manufacturing units on the outskirts of Chennai and ensure that uniform guidelines were imposed. Hyundai Motor India Limited, also represented in the case, submitted that its workers have no grievance. The court observed that the main bone of contention between the management and the workers of Renault-Nissan has been the maintenance of a pitch ratio in the assembly lines. The pitch ratio would ensure that after every third car there would be a gap for a fourth car, so that the workmen can get some breathing time and social distancing can be ensured. “What the workmen seem to want is that the workload should be reduced to ensure that distancing norms are maintained,” the court said in its orders. After its previous inspection at the facility, the directorate recommended nine uniform guidelines on June 18, so that social distancing can be practised. The management submitted that they already follow most of the recommended guidelines and that steps are being taken to adhere to the remaining by July 3. “During such time when the inspecting team visits the manufacturing facility of Renault-Nissan on July 3, 2021, such team will be entitled to interact with the members of the workmen’s union or the individual workmen for the purpose of assessing whether the guidelines are being adhered to,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-orders-inspection-at-renault-nissan-unit-sets-july-3-deadline-101624388320207.html
23-06-2021||India||Stalin urges coastal states’ CMs to reject new ports bill||Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin Tuesday wrote to his counterparts in nine coastal states asking them to object to the draft Indian Ports Bill. He wrote to chief ministers of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal and Puducherry, saying that it dilutes the power of states.“You will agree that the present system has led to the good development of minor ports, under the states,” Stalin said in his letter. “This move of the Central government to bring a new Bill will have long term adverse implications on the management of minor ports since the state governments will not have any major role anymore if the bill is passed.”The ministry of ports, shipping and waterways has framed a new draft to modify the current management model of minor ports, and a meeting of the Maritime State Development Council (MSDC) has been called with the state ministers on June 24 to discuss this bill. Stalin added that as per the existing Indian Ports Act, 1908, the powers to plan, develop, regulate and control the minor ports vests with the state government. However, the new draft bill proposes to change this and transfer many of these powers to MSDC, which has, so far, been only an advisory body, he said. Stalin said that they have already taken this up with the Union ministry and would ‘strongly oppose such steps to reduce the autonomous role of states in the regulation and management of minor ports.’“I propose that all the coastal states and union territories should express their objection to this new draft, the Indian Ports Bill 2021, and take a joint action to prevent any move to dilute the powers already vested with the states,” he said, requesting all states to communicate along similar lines during the MSDC meeting on June 24.Stalin had previously, on June 8, written to chief ministers in 12 states -- Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Telangana and West Bengal --, urging them to write to the Union finance minister and the Reserve Bank of India on the need for a moratorium on loan repayment for MSMEs and small businesses. He urged them to come together once again as the states’ collective effort in asking for vaccines to be procured centrally and distributed free of cost to states led to the Union government revising its position.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalin-urges-coastal-states-cms-to-reject-new-ports-bill-101624388260095.html
23-06-2021||India||Why India can shed its population obsession||That population control is crucial for making India a prosperous nation is an entrenched stereotype. To be sure, India is not the only country which has embraced this idea. China, currently the world’s second largest economy and a one-party state since 1949, enforced a one-child norm in the 1980s. That it was not a democracy, helped in imposing such a policy. Four decades later, the same state is now encouraging couples to have three children (more on this later).Modern capitalism, as we know it, has developed in relatively less densely populated regions of Western Europe and North America (with the exception of Japan). It is no wonder that low population was seen as a virtue for economic growth. It is only recently that densely populated countries with very large populations such as China and India have placed themselves among the world’s largest economies. The world is yet to come to terms with this economic churning.What makes population control an even more vexed issue in India is the religious polarisation around it. The bogey of population explosion is often used (directly or indirectly) to politically target Muslims, the largest religious minority group in the country. For example, while stressing on the need for controlling population to reduce poverty, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma recently asked stakeholders of the minority community to speak to the members to work towards effective population control measures.Following Assam, now Uttar Pradesh is talking about introducing a two-child norm for entitlement to government benefits. “Population is nearing an explosive stage. It is causing other issues too — related to hospitals, foodgrains, houses, or employment. We believe that there should be a check on population. Population control is different from family planning,” Uttar Pradesh Law Commission chairman, Aditya Nath Mittal was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. Mittal further said that his statements are not targeted towards any community nor does he want to challenge human rights’ of citizens. “We don’t want to give a message in Uttar Pradesh that we are against any particular religion or anyone’s human rights. We just want to see to it that the government resources and facilities are available to those who are helping in and contributing towards population control,” Mittal further added.Here are nine charts which show why India should stop obsessing about population growth and linking it to religion.India’s population growth peaked long time ago India will overtake China as the most populous country by 2025 or perhaps sooner. However, this should not be inferred to assume that India is undergoing a proverbial population explosion. Population statistics show that India’s population growth peaked decades ago and it is already on a downward trajectory. According to the United Nation’s population projections, India’s population will increase by a multiple of 1.09 between 2021 and 2031. This number was 1.25 between 1981 and 1991. From 2060 onwards, India’s population will start falling, which happens when fertility rate falls below replacement levels. By 2100, which is as far as UN population projections go to, India’s population will be 1.45 billion after having peaked at 1.65 billion in 2059 (See Chart 1).A high population is not necessarily a bad thing for the economy What the proponents of the high-population-is-bad-for-the-economy theory do not realise is that an economy needs workers to contribute to output growth. So, a low population, which means fewer workers, also means a scarcity of productive hands in the economy. This actually generates headwinds, rather than tailwinds for economic growth. An increasing share of older people in its popualtion, thanks to its one-child policy, is what has forced China to abandon the old policy and encourage couple to have more children.A simple comparison of India and China brings out this point clearly. The ratio of per capita GDP of China and India is much higher than the ratio of per worker GDP of the two countries. This means that if India were able to gainfully employ more people, it would actually help to bridge its economic gap with China. That labour force participation of women is significantly lower in India than China is an obvious area which needs to be acted upon in this regard (see Chart 2).India needs to focus on exploiting its demographic dividend rather than worry about it India is poised at a unique moment in history, where it can exploit its demographic advantage to realise its economic goals. According to the government’s population projections, 53.6% of India’s population in 2021 is under the age of 29. More than a quarter of India’s population is 14 years or younger. This young cohort can become extremely productive or unproductive depending on the skill sets it acquires.We are nowhere close to guaranteeing the best possible opportunities to young Indians. For example, an HT analysis of the latest All India Survey on Higher Education data found that India’s higher education sector is mired in deep structural inequalities. Our policy makers will do well to focus on exploiting India’s demographic dividend rather than worrying about it (Chart 3).Fertility rates are higher among the poor and uneducated women The macro numbers on India’s population do not mean that a high number of children is not a problem . The evidence at hand, from the 2015-16 (latest available all-India data) findings of National Family and Health Survey (NFHS) points to what is well established in the theory of demographic transition. Total fertility rates (TFR) are higher among the poor and they come down as incomes increase. TFR is the average number of children a woman bears in her lifetime. Education of women also plays a role, both in case of fertility rates as well as age of mother at the time of birth of first child. This clearly shows that any policy which seeks to exclude families with more than two children from government welfare programmes will end up hurting the poor, who need such help the most (See Chart 4 and 5).Patriarchy driven preference for a male child is an important driver of higher fertility rates To be sure, India’s entrenched cultural beliefs -- patriarchy is among the strongest of them -- also plays a role in driving up fertility rates. According to the 2015-16 NFHS findings, the desire to have a third child was strongly influenced by whether or not one of the two existing children was a son. 89% women and 92% men with two children did not want a third child if they had two living sons. This number came down to 63% and 64% for men and women with two children but no living son. Such preference is believed to have had an adverse effect on the sex ratio of the population through practices such as female foeticide etc. Many studies have shown that this attitude tend to be higher in the relatively well-off, especially in northern states (See Chart 6).Muslims do have higher fertility rates, but they are a minority when it comes to total families with more than two children There is an element of truth to the assertion that Muslims tend to have higher fertility rates in India. While some of this can be explained by their relative socio-economic backwardness, an HT analysis using NFHS data had found that Muslims have a higher share of married women with more than two children than Hindus, even in same education and wealth cohorts.Perhaps, it is this fact, which encourages a mixing of political rhetoric around population control and religion. However, what the proponents of such politics do not realise is the fact that in case the government were to formulate any policies which exclude families with more than two-children, 83% of the affected families would be Hindus. Not only is such a policy regressive; it will hurt the ‘have-nots’ more than the ‘haves’, it will also fail to achieve its communal design as more Hindus will suffer than Muslims (See Chart 7 and 8).Total fertility rate differential for Muslims and the Hindu-Muslim TFR ratio has been falling While Muslims to have a higher fertility rate than Hindus, the former are not an outlier when it comes to the trend of falling TFR. Data from successive rounds of NFHS clearly prove this point. TFR for Hindus and Muslims was 3.3 and 4.41 in the first round of NFHS which was conducted in 1992-93. It has come down to 2.13 and 2.62 respectively in the fourth round which was conducted in 2015-16. This means that TFR has fallen by 40.6% for Muslims during this period, more than 35.5% decline for Hindus. Even the ratio of Muslim-Hindu TFR has come down from 1.34 in 1992-93 to 1.23 in 2015-16. We now have fifth round of NFHS data from 2019-20 for some states. Assam is one of them. It shows that the trend of falling TFR among Muslims and Hindus continues to hold. The TFR for Hindus was 1.8 and 1.6 in the 2015-16 and 2019-20 NFHS rounds. These numbers were 2.9 and 2.4 respectively for Muslims (See Chart 9).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-india-can-shed-its-population-obsession-101624388140227.html
23-06-2021||India||PM hails India’s new model of ‘reforms by conviction, incentives’||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said India adopted a new model of “reforms by conviction and incentives” to successfully implement several long-term welfare measures while encouraging states to raise ₹1.06 lakh crore additional money in 2020-21 when the world was facing severe resource crunch due to the Covid-19 pandemic.This significant increase in availability of resources was made possible by an approach of Centre-state ‘bhagidari’ (partnership), Modi said in a post titled ‘Reforms by Conviction and Incentives’ posted on Linkedin.“In this backdrop of financial crunch seen across the world, do you know that Indian states were able to borrow significantly more in 2020-21? It would perhaps pleasantly surprise you that states were able to raise an extra ₹1.06 lakh crores,” he wroteReferring to the government’s economic stimulus plan announced in May last year to protect lives and expeditiously revive the pandemic-ravaged economy, he said: “When we formulated our economic response to the Covid-19 pandemic, we wanted to ensure that our solutions do not follow a ‘one-size-fits-all’ model.”In order to protect lives, India imposed a 68-day national lockdown from March 25, 2020, which saw the economy plunging into technical recession (negative growth for two subsequent quarters). This led to a 24.4% contraction of the economy in the first quarter, and 7.3% contraction in the second quarter of 2020-21. The ₹20.97 lakh crore stimulus package , Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-reliant India Initiative) , was announced by the government in May. The economy expanded by 0.5% in the third quarter and 1.6% in the fourth quarter ended March 31.Modi said the stimulus package announced in May 2020 enhanced borrowing limit of states by an additional 2% of gross state domestic product (GSDP), of which 1% was made conditional on the implementation of four broad economic reforms. Under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, states are required to keep their fiscal deficit at 3% of GSDP.“This nudge for reform is rare in Indian public finance. This was a nudge, incentivising the states to adopt progressive policies to avail additional funds. The results of this exercise are not only encouraging but also run contrary to the notion that there are limited takers for sound economic policies,” PM Modi wrote in the blog.As part of the stimulus, on May 17, 2020 the Centre allowed states to borrow additional 2% of the GSDP, amounting to ₹4,27,300 crore.Explaining the purpose behind the conditional extra borrowing, PM said: “The four reforms to which additional borrowings were linked (with 0.25% of GDP tied to each one) had two characteristics. Firstly, each of the reforms was linked to improving the Ease of Living of the public and particularly the poor, the vulnerable, and the middle class. Secondly, they also promoted fiscal sustainability.”The first reform , ‘One Nation One Ration Card’ policy was to ensure that “migrant workers can draw their food ration from anywhere in the country,” he added, pointing out that 17 states completed this reform to access additional borrowings of ₹37,600 crore.Talking about the second reform related to improving ease of doing business, PM Modi said: “This reform (covering 19 laws) is of particular help to micro and small enterprises, who suffer the most from the burden of the ‘inspector raj’. It also promotes an improved investment climate, greater investment and faster growth.” This was availed by 20 states with additional borrowing of ₹39,521 crore.The third one was based on recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission and other experts who propounded sound property taxation. ; 11 states completed these reforms to borrow ₹15,957 crore , he said.The fourth condition was to introduce direct benefit transfer (DBT) of power subsidy to farmers. “This improves the finances of distribution companies, promotes conservation of water and energy and improves service quality through better financial and technical performance,” the PM said. At least one of the three components were implemented by 13 states, while 6 states implemented the DBT component to get additional borrowing space of ₹13,201 crore, he said.“Overall, 23 states availed of additional borrowings of ₹1.06 lakh crores out of a potential of ₹2.14 lakh crores. As a result, the aggregate borrowing permission granted to states for 2020-21 (conditional and unconditional) was 4.5% of the initially estimated GSDP,” he said.Modi said this was a “unique experience” for a large nation like India. “We have often seen that for various reasons, schemes and reforms remain un-operational often for years. This was a pleasant departure from the past where the Centre & States came together to roll out public friendly reforms in a short span of time amidst the pandemic,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-hails-india-s-new-model-of-reforms-by-conviction-incentives-101624388080110.html
23-06-2021||India||Arnab named in new TRP case charge sheet||Mumbai crime branch on Tuesday filed its second supplementary charge-sheet in the television rating point (TRP) manipulation case, naming seven more people including Arnab Goswami, editor-in-chief of Republic TV and R Bharat news channels among the accused.The 1,912-page charge-sheet filed by crime branch’s criminal Intelligence Unit (CIU) also names four others connected the Republic TV group, Shiva Subramanyam, Priya Mukherji, Shivendra Muldhekar and Ranjit Waltkar apart from two persons connected to Maha Movie channel - Amit Dave and Sanjay Verma.The Mumbai police started investigating the case in October last year on a complaint by Hansa Research Group, a contractor employed by the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC), a joint industry company set up by stakeholders to manage television audience measurement systems.It was alleged that some channels have manipulated the TV ratings. TRP is measured by recording viewership data at sample households and is considered crucial for attracting advertisers.Police claimed that some of the households, where BARC Bar-o-Meters were installed for measuring TRP, were bribed by Republic TV and a few other channels through Hansa Research Group’s relationship managers who were directly in touch with the households, for illegally enhancing their TRP.In the charge-sheet filed on Tuesday, investigators have annexed long WhatsApp chats between Goswami, named as accused no. 19 in the case, and former BARC CEO Partho Dasgupta, which were allegedly recovered during the course of investigation. Police claimed that Gupta and Goswami were in constant touch for the news channel’s benefit and Dasgupta shared huge confidential information of BARC with Goswami.There was no statement by Republic TV on Tuesday. The channel has, however, denied on several occasions that it had gamed the system to boost its ratings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arnab-named-in-new-trp-case-charge-sheet-101624388021230.html
23-06-2021||India||Congress white paper warns of Covid-19 third wave||The Congress party, in a white paper on the Covid19 pandemic has sought free, universal vaccination for all Indians in the shortest possible time frame and compensation for those who died after contracting the viral disease, claimed that nine of every 10 deaths in the brutal second wave of the pandemic in India were avoidable, and blamed the Modi government for its failure to handle the pandemic. The document, released by Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday asked the government to invoke compulsory licensing provisions under the Patents Act 1970 to ramp up domestic vaccine production.The paper, prepared by the party’s research cell also asked for a minimum income support scheme for the poor and most vulnerable, wage subsidies to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and more funds for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.Releasing the paper, Gandhi said 90% of Covid19 deaths in the second wave were “needless” as they could have been saved if oxygen or drugs were available, and demanded a commission to look into “what went wrong” in the government’s strategy .In a series of tweets, Union minister Smriti Irani hit back asking Gandhi to introspect. “Where did second wave start?ruled states. Which states had huge percentage of India’s cases and deaths? Congress ruled states”She also said Congress-ruled states have higher case fatality rates and recorded high positivity rates during the second wave. “Who demanded decentralization (in vaccine sourcing) & then did a U-turn? Congress. Which states did the worst in terms of vaccination yesterday even as the country created a world record? Congress ruled states.” Irani tweeted.Her reference is to the high vaccination numbers registered by BJP-ruled states on Monday, the start of a new phase of the vaccine drive. Madhya Pradesh, for instance, administered 1.7 million doses. However, the state administered only 68,370 till 10pm on Tuesday. Overall, doses administered from from around 8.5 lakh; till 9 pm, India had administered 5.4 million doses on Tuesday.. As for deaths, reports based on the government’s own data from the Civil Registration System have shown that many states, including some ruled by the BJP such as Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Assam and Madhya Pradesh, but also others such as Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have seen a huge number of excess deaths in 2020 and 2021, a spike that can be explained only by Covid.Interestingly, the government has, in separate affidavits filed in the Supreme Court already weighed in on two of the demands raised in the white paper: it has said it does not make sense to take the compulsory licence route with vaccines, and, more recently, over the weekend, said that the ₹4 lakh compensation as mandated under the national disaster management law will not be paid to the families of those who died from Covid-19. “The Centre is making 4 lakh crore through cess on petrol and diesel. It has taken money from the people. They can give any name they want but a compensation plan is required,” Gandhi said.In his comments while releasing the document, Gandhi also targetted the Prime Minister, and said he was busy campaigning during the second wave of the pandemic.Gandhi acknowledged India’s feat of administering 8.5 million doses on Monday as “good work” but cautioned that vaccination is a process, not a series of events. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala quickly added that Manmohan Singh government had administered pulse polio doses to 120 million children on a single day in 2012. To be sure , a comparison of the two is out of place given the significant complexities involved in administering Covid vaccines.The Congress leader maintained the White Paper is aimed at giving suggestions to the government to keep itself ready for any possible third wave and that “the government should not repeat the mistakes”.The document labelled the vaccination campaign as “ad-hoc, short-sighted, unscientific, and inequitable” and alleged that the Union government “did not intend to vaccinate all Indians.” It further accused the government of “ignoring multiple warnings to the contrary, and thereby committed the critical error of not placing sufficient orders in advance, cascading to the vaccine shortages.”“Among the major impact of policy failures was that India was forced to break away from its 17-year-long tradition of not accepting foreign aid to deal with domestic crises. The Union government then delayed the distribution of the foreign aid it received and is yet to make public the details of donations,” the White Paper added.India has never stopped accepting foreign aid, as pointed out in an article in this paper by academics Manjari Chatterjee Miller and Vidhu Priya Mukundan. After 2004, “the terms of receiving aid” changed, they pointed out, and aid was “requested on a long-term basis, accepted only from G8 countries, from donors who would agree to give more than $25 million per year, or accepted by the state governments rather than the Centre.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-white-paper-warns-of-third-wave-101624388020706.html

I accompanied SIT on the request of the SIT head, who wanted me to be there in case of any legal assistance,” he said.A senior government official clarified that Singla was attached with the SIT through an order dated May 19, as per orders by the Punjab Government orders dated May 7 that said: “The SIT may seek assistance of experts for the purpose of the investigation.”Badal was the chief minister when incidents of the desecration of a religious text and police firing at people protesting against it took place in Faridkot in 2015.The Punjab government had formed the SIT, led by Additional Director General of Police L K Yadav, to probe the Kotkapura police firing incident following the directions of the Punjab and Haryana High Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/policequiz-badal-over-2015-firing-ex-cm-objects-to-questions-by-non-sit-member-101624388020132.html
23-06-2021||India||Rashtra Manch meets at Pawar’s home, calls for ‘alternative vision’||Prominent Opposition leaders and civil society members assembled at Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar’s residence in Delhi on Tuesday and discussed issues of fuel price rise, unemployment and the need for creating an alternative vision for India.But the discussions at the two-hour meeting didn’t mention the formation of a third front to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) because no Congress leaders attended the meeting, said leaders present at the event.“The broader purpose of the meeting was to discuss people-centric issues. Attendees stressed on the need for an alternative vision for the country and a team will be formed to realise that vision,” said Samajwadi Party leader Ghanshyam Tiwari .The meeting was called by Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Yashwant Sinha on behalf of Rashtra Manch, an anti-BJP platform that he co-founded in 2018, Three leaders of the Congress were invited for the event but none showed up, and Pawar made it clear that no discussion of a third front could take place without involving them, said leaders who attended the meeting.“Narendra Modi wasn’t mentioned even once, nor was a third front,” said former Rajya Sabha member Pavan Varma. “There can be no discussion of a third front without the Congress. Mr Pawar felt that the forum should be broadened with the inclusion of other parties and personalities.”The meeting sparked political speculation on Monday as it was announced soon after Pawar met election strategist Prashant Kishor. Kishor denied the two events were linked, but NCP’s Nawab Malik declared that the meeting reflected how Pawar will be working to unite Opposition parties.“Yashwant ji said this meeting was taking place in a restrictive pandemic environment, that’s why many leaders like Manish Tewari, who usually attend all meetings, didn’t turn up,” said Tiwari, also a founding member of Rashtra Manch.Apart from Tiwari, the meeting was attended by National Conference’s Omar Abdullah, Rashtriya Lok Dal’s Jayant Chaudhary, NCP’s Praful Patel, Aam Aadmi Party’s Sushil Gupta, Communist Party of India’s Binoy Viswam and Communist Party of India (Marxist)’s Nilotpal Basu. They discussed issues such as fuel price rise, unemployment and the need for social stability and harmony in the country.Another attendee said on the condition of anonymity that Kashmir also figured in the discussion but not in detail. “It was a general discussion about how to improve the state of the nation,” he said.When asked if there was any mention of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee as a potential prime ministerial candidate for the third front, Tiwari said no individual leaders were discussed.The meeting was also attended by civil society members, including former Delhi high court chief justice AP Shah, former ambassador K C Singh and lyricist Javed Akhtar. Neither the Congress nor the BJP reacted to the meeting.NCP leader Majid Menon said it was not a meeting for forming an anti-BJP front or a non-Congress front. “It was not an anti-BJP political front meeting called by Sharad Pawar. It was a meeting of Rashtriya Manch held at his residence. Like-minded individuals or people with the same ideology attended the meeting and there were several apolitical personalities present in the meeting,” Menon said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rashtra-manch-meets-at-pawar-s-home-calls-for-alternative-vision-101624387904074.html

In next two month we will be starting production in two of our facilities in Ankleshwar, Gujarat, and Bengaluru, Karnataka. These facilities are being repurposed and the production is likely to start in next two months,” said a company executive, Bharat Biotech International Ltd.The executiveadded that starting July, Bharat Biotech will sell 25% of its production to private hospitals, as against the 10% it does now. And the company is hoping to get a better price from the government, than the ₹157.50 it currents does per dose. the price per dose for private hospitals is ₹1200.“There are future orders that central government is discussing with us; we are looking at requesting for a better price. It is not just the cost of vaccine but also distribution cost of supplies to states that we have to take care of that increases the overall cost, which is there needs to be better price. For the private market we don’t see any changes for now,” the executive said.Also read | Covaxin submits Phase 3 data to expert panel, claims 78% efficacyThe government has so far bought 85 million doses of Covaxin (10 through the PM Cares Fund and 75 directly), and placed advance orders (paying 30%) for an additional 190 million doses.Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin is one of the three vaccines currently in use in India. The others are Covishield, the Indian version of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, made by Serum Institute of India, and Sputnik V, the Russian vaccine currently being imported by Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, which will also market the doses locally made by a clutch of Indian companies starting August. SII makes around 100 million doses of Covishield a month. India is expected to import around 18 million doses of Sputnik V till the end of July, after which domestic manufacturing is expected to kick in. It isn’t known how many doses will be made, although Russian Direct Investment Fund, which manages the commercial aspect of Sputnik V has said 850 million doses will be produced by local tie-ups in a year, with the production likely to start at around July-August .Explaining the production scale-up the executive said: “We actually see annualized production, and it is going to reach 800 million mark by the end of this year. We have initiated technology transfer with three institutions through department of biotechnology, and these companies are also preparing their facilities for the purpose, especially setting up a bio safety level- 3 laboratory, and should start production in some time.”The three are Haffkine Biopharmaceutical Corporation Ltd, Indian Immunologicals Ltd, Hyderabad, and Bharat Immunologicals & Biologicals Ltd, Bulandshahar, Uttar Pradesh.He also added that the manufacture of Covaxin takes anywhere between 90 to 120 days for a batch, and that, as a result, there is no scope for any ad hoc changes to be made to supply plans. Exports, he said, are not on the horizon yet. “Our doses are committed well in advance; there is no possibility of making sudden changes. Same goes for exporting as government has clearly indicated that priority is Indian citizens. Even though the list of countries that have requested for vaccine doses is piling up continuously but exports will depend only on government approvals.”At least eight countries have requested Bharat Biotech for Covaxin supplies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monthly-output-of-25mn-doses-to-continue-till-aug-bharat-biotech-101624387840098.html
23-06-2021||India||Govt tags Delta+ as a ‘variant of concern’||The “Delta Plus” is a variant of concern (VOC) in India, the Union health ministry said on Tuesday, citing an analysis by a consortium of genomic sequencing labs that has purportedly found the mutated virus to spread more readily, affect the lungs more strongly, and possibly reduce the ability of some antibodies to neutralise it.The Delta Plus, scientifically known as the AY.1 variant , appears to be a further evolution of the Delta variant (or B.1.617.2, which was first seen in India) with a particular mutation known as K417N, which has separately demonstrated properties that could make it more resistant to vaccines as well as immunity from a past infection.The government has now alerted the states where the VOC has been found. “The Union health ministry has advised Maharashtra, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh that the public health response measures, while broadly remaining the same, have to become more focused and effective. Chief secretaries have been advised to take up immediate containment measures in the districts and clusters (as identified by Insacog) including preventing crowds and intermingling of people, widespread testing, prompt tracing as well as vaccine coverage on a priority basis,” the health ministry said in a statement.Also read | At 5.4mn doses, Day 2 of vaccination drive records declineThe statement came within hours of Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan saying at press briefing that AY.1 was a variant of interest -- a classification used when a variant is being studied. Bhushan said Delta Plus was found in nine countries and that in India, there were 22 cases.“In India, 16 samples have been found in Ranagiri and Jalgaon in Maharashtra. Some cases have been seen in Madhya Pradesh and Kerala. Today, Union health ministry has sent them an advisory to advise them on how to address this,” he said.At present, there are four VOCs recognised by the World Health Organization (WHO): Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta. Each of these has a unique constellation of mutations that separately or collectively make the virus more transmissible, virulent or resistant. The Delta variant is the first that is believed to do all three.Delta Plus is the addition of a mutation identified as K417N, which has also been found in the Beta variant. Beta, or B.1.351 seen first in South Africa, is regarded as one of the most resistant variants of the coronavirus till now.The health ministry statement said an analysis by Insacog showed Delta Plus “has the following characteristics: increased transmissibility; stronger binding to receptors of lung cells; potential reduction in monoclonal antibody response”.The statement did not give more details about the analysis but suggests the authorities may now be moving with abundant caution, especially since India’s government drew criticism for not spotting the Delta variant on time.Of the six districts identified by the government on Tuesday, Ratnagiri and Jalgaon in Maharashtra, Palakkad and Pathanamthitta in Kerala, and Bhopal and Shivpuri in Madhya Pradesh , the trajectory of cases in Ratnagiri has been more or less flat, with new cases reducing by 5% over the last two weeks. In case of the others, this reduction is in the high double digits.Over the course of the coming weeks, a number of indicators will help determine the nature of the threat Delta Plus poses. These are indicators India has missed in the past, most recently with the Delta variant.Also read | Positivity rates at two private labs 450 times lower than average during Kumbh melaCASE NUMBERSThe Delta variant began driving up case numbers in Maharashtra in late February, which the trajectory becoming particularly sharp in the second week of March. By March 17, cases in the rest of the country began tracking a similar path as Maharashtra.HOSPITALISATION RATESTypically, only a small proportion of positive cases require hospitalisation. An analysis by Public Health England of infection and hospital admission rates in the UK, particularly in areas where the Delta variant took hold, showed the risk of hospitalisation doubled as compared to the Alpha variant.Authorities across India in general, and those in districts identified as Delta Plus-affected by the government in particular, will need to keep a close watch on hospitalisation rates, which is one of the first proxies for virulence.BREAKTHROUGH INFECTIONSStates will need to leverage the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) test reporting mechanism to track new infections and whether these include people who have already been infected or vaccinated previously . The PHE study cited above has, for instance, shown that a VOC like the Delta could lead to a sharp drop in protection among people who have just one dose of vaccine.“The interpretation should be based on sequence data and biological data both. Clinical correlation is important, and backed by lab data to show why we see what we see in people,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, physician-scientist, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.Most crucially, India will need to improve its genome surveillance infrastructure -- a stand also taken by Anurag Agrawal, the head of CSIR Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology (IGIB) and one of the key officials of Insacog.In a column for medical journal Nature published on June 1, Agrawal said: “India urgently needs to intensify sequencing of unusual outbreaks, reinfections and cases in which vaccinated people become infected, while maintaining ‘sentry sequencing’ of a constant number of representative samples nation-wide.”The country did not do this in the case of the Delta variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-tags-delta-as-a-variant-of-concern-101624387780698.html
23-06-2021||India||Punjab CM meets Cong panel amid infighting||Amid growing tension in the ruling Congress, Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh met for almost three hours with the three-member committee set up to end dissidence in the party’s state unit ahead of next year’s assembly polls even as some ministers and MLAs conveyed to former party president Rahul Gandhi their strong displeasure over former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu’s spate of interviews bad-mouthing SinghSingh met the committee headed by Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge at the latter’s Parliament House office in Delhi. The committee which also has general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat and former Delhi MP Jai Prakash Agarwal as members discussed with him the implementation status of the 2017 poll manifesto of the party, a change in the party organisation in the state, and preparations for the coming elections, said a committee member who asked not to be named.This person added that the panel specifically asked the chief minister about the pending poll promises, including action against the Badals in the sacrilege and police firing cases. Singh did specifically brief the members about the status of probe into sacrilege and police firing cases, the chief minister’s aides said.“The committee members were informed that the special investigation team report in the Kotkapura firing incident was quashed by the court and the new SIT had already made quick progress,” they added.Between June and October 2015, three incidents of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib took place in Faridkot district, leading to huge resentment and protests in the state. On October 14, 2015, two protesters were killed in police firing in Behbal Kalan. The same day, police also opened fire on protesters in Kotkpaura. Amarinder had promised strict action against those responsible for sacrilege and police firing. On April 9 this year, the Punjab and Haryana high court quashed the investigation carried out by the state police’s Special Investigation Team (SIT) in the Kotkapura police firing case. The state government has constituted a new SIT in accordance with the court order.The CM’s meeting with the central panel, their second in less than three week, came on the day the SIT questioned SAD leader Parkash Singh Badal, who was the chief minister at the time of the 2015 police firing, for two hours in the case.Meanwhile, Rahul Gandhi had one-to-one meetings with about a dozen party leaders from the state, including six ministers, during which some of them conveyed to him their displeasure over Sidhu’s statements targeting the chief minister. At least four leaders, including two ministers, said the Amritsar East MLA’s actions would damage the party in the state. Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu, who raised the issue with both Rahul and Kharge, said that several leaders have informed the high command about his (Sidhu’s) statements and that notice has been taken. “There is discontent over this. The CM has been appointed by Sonia Ji and Rahul Ji. This kind of things coming from someone who was in the cabinet is unfortunate and not acceptable,” he said. Sidhu has publicly attacked the CM in the press, accusing him of colluding with Badals.Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar and Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa are likely to meet Gandhi on Wednesday, people familiar with the matter said.HT has also learnt that the panel is expected to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday to update her about the issues. However, the problem between the chief minister and cricketer-turned-politician may have got exacerbated with both taking a ‘maximalist’ position, according to one person who didn’t want to be identified.The CM told committee members that they should make a fair assessment about what each person brought to the table. While he was willing to go along with whatever the party decided, he wanted them to see the troubles Sidhu was stirring with his public outbursts against the CM. The CM’s side seemed to be upset that Sidhu drew his support from Priyanka and Rahul Gandhi.“The problem is we need both CM and Sidhu so we have to work it out,” said the leader quoted above.A second person that HT spoke to confirmed that Sidhu was adamant on the PCC chief post. However, the party doesn’t think that it would be the right fit for him as it is more of a behind-the-scenes role, that involved taking everyone along.Sidhu seemed less interested in accepting deputy CM post now that there was just months left before elections, the person added.The other issue, said a leader, was the choice of deputy chief ministers or PCC chiefs. Both Sidhu and the CM are from Patiala and the central leadership is looking for another deputy CM candidate that would balance out regional representation.The discussions with the CM were also about the roll out of Dalit- oriented schemes as they form 30% of the population in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cm-meets-cong-panel-amid-infighting-101624387780128.html
23-06-2021||India||At 5.4 million doses, Day 2 of Covid-19 vaccination drive records decline||Nearly 5.4 million people were administered Covid-19 vaccine doses across the country till 11pm on Tuesday – the second day of the new phase of its vaccination drive – as the country’s inoculation numbers dropped from the previous day, but remained significantly higher than what has been the pace of the drive thus far.On Monday, India’s latest round of vaccinations had started with a record 8.5 million doses administered — more in a day than any country other than China. Despite the drop on Tuesday, it was the third highest daily figures since the start of the country’s inoculation drive on January 16, but daily numbers fluctuated heavily across states.Madhya Pradesh, which recorded 1.7 million vaccinations on Monday, saw only 68,370 doses administered till 10pm on Tuesday – a drop of 96% between the two days. In Haryana, there was a 75% drop in daily vaccination numbers on Tuesday (128,979 doses administered till 10pm), compared to 511,882 Monday, data showed.To be sure, numbers from states are sometimes updated overnight on the Co-WIN dashboard, either due to data lag or to factor in walk-ins.Questions remain over whether India will be able to maintain the pace of vaccination in the coming weeks and months, particularly with respect to what appears to be a limited supply of shots available in the pipeline. The central government has set a target of administering 80 million doses between June 21 and June 30. In July, the Centre has set a target of administering 248 million doses.Senior health ministry officials credited the increase in rate of vaccination on Monday and Tuesday to greater co-ordination between the Centre and states. “We have demonstrated in the past that we have the capacity to administer far greater numbers of vaccines in a day, particularly if you see the example of the polio drive... This time, we have used that know-how for better collaboration. Since states knew the quantum of vaccines that was going to come to them in advance, they were able to execute it more efficiently,” said Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Tuesday.State data compiled from Co-WIN dashboard, however, showed that daily vaccination numbers on Tuesday dropped in 12 states, primarily those that had seen record turnout on Monday, such as Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Bihar, among others.Explaining the drop in numbers before Monday, MP’s state immunisation officer Santosh Shukla said, “We have fixed Tuesday and Friday for general immunisation and Sunday is a ‘no vaccination day’. This order has been released in March but in some districts, immunisation is being done due to availability of vaccines.”On Sunday, a day before the mega vaccination drive, the state had reported only 4,098 vaccinations. On Saturday, this number was 24,700, and on Friday it was 11,742. Vaccination numbers drop nearly throughout the country over weekends.In Karnataka, the number of vaccinations fell from Monday’s 1.15 million to 446,780 till 10pm on Tuesday – a drop of 61%. On Sunday, the state had issued 68,172 shots. The state health department officials said Monday’s numbers showed that they can conduct mass vaccinations – a feat they aim to repeat in coming days, provided enough vaccines are there. The pace also slowed down in Andhra Pradesh and Bihar on Tuesday with 34% and 29% fewer shots administered on Tuesday, the data showed.Also read | Astrazeneca Covid-19 vaccine effective against Delta variant found in IndiaThe drive in other states such as Maharashtra, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh picked up pace on Tuesday to somewhat compensate for a large proportion of losses from Monday’s numbers.Maharashtra saw the largest increase in numbers – a rise of 45% from the 394,794 doses administered on Monday to 574,365 till 10pm on Tuesday, according to Co-WIN dashboard. It was followed by Punjab (24% increase from Monday), Himachal Pradesh (23% rise) and Chhattisgarh (22% up).Uttar Pradesh showed a 15% increase in daily vaccination on Tuesday as the state administered 844,174 doses till 10pm – the highest in the country on Tuesday in absolute numbers.Most of north-eastern states were able to maintain the vaccination momentum by inoculating 19% more people as they did on Monday. The numbers in Assam dropped 27%, according to Co-WIN data.Several states said they were expecting more vaccines to be delivered over the next few days which would help them maintain momentum.“The state received 250,000 doses of Covishield on Tuesday morning and we are expecting another lot of 90,000 doses in the evening,” said Munindra Nath Ngatey, Assam’s director health services.In Rajasthan, where 420,697 people were vaccinated on Tuesday against 474,868 on Monday, state officials said vaccination had to be halted in several districts due to shortage. State health minister Raghu Sharma in a letter to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan has urged to increase the vaccine allocation to 15 million doses from 6.5 million for the month of July.Health ministry officials, during Tuesday’s Covid-19 press briefing, emphasised on a focus on increasing rural vaccinations. “Around 63.7% of doses administered on Monday were in villages and 36% in urban areas... This makes it clear that a rural outreach is possible in the inoculation drive. We are fully hopeful and confident that it is completely possible for us to better cover rural areas,” Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul said.(with inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-5-4mn-doses-day-2-of-vaccination-drive-records-decline-101624387720712.html
23-06-2021||India||Kerala HC stays two policies as Lakshadweep row rages||The Kerala high court on Tuesday stayed operation of two recent regulations issued by Lakshadweep administrator Praful Khoda Patel that ordered dairy farms to close and excluded meat products from the midday meals in the island’s schools.A bench of chief justice S Manikumar and justice Shaji P Chaly ordered that the administration will not take any action on the two rules for now and told the Union government and the island administration to file a detailed affidavit in two weeks.The high court’s reprieve on a petition filed by lawyer Ajmal Ahmad is the first for the island residents who have been protesting changes in rules ordered by the Lakshadweep administrator for more than a month.Ajmal Ahmed argued that the new set of regulations were intended to change the food habits of the islanders and create the foundation for imposing the ban on cow slaughter. Besides, the order to shut the local dairy farms will end up promoting dairy products from Gujarat.He also said the administration was planning to handover the midday meal scheme to a Bengaluru-based NGO called ‘Akshaya Patra’ to ensure that children only were given vegetarian means at school.At one point, the court asked the island administration why it was tampering with the age-old food habits of people. But the administration insisted that the dairy farms run by the animal husbandry department were closed down as there were no proper cold storage facilities on the island and the farms were not financially viable.Former Kerala finance minister Thomas Issac welcomed the interim stay.“It is the first major setback to the autocratic administrator. His controversial other decisions will also be challenged in the court,” Thomas Issac said in a tweet.Three more petitions are already pending before the high court against the rules pushed through by the administration after Praful Khoda Patel, a former minister from Gujarat who was appointed administrator of the union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, was assigned additional charge of Lakshadweep too.Residents of the archipelago have been protesting some of Patel’s decisions including the draft Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation (2021) that proposes to develop the islands as a major tourist destination, a proposal to notify the Goonda Act and a plan to ban cow slaughter. Patel’s critics in the islands argue that these steps will destroy the islands’ character and identity since 97% of the islands are covered by pristine forests and 95% of its Muslim population belong to the protected scheduled tribe category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-stays-two-policies-as-lakshadweep-row-rages-101624387720149.html
23-06-2021||India||New Delhi targets Pak at UNSC Afghanistan debate||India on Tuesday targetted Pakistan for impeding efforts to improve security and development in Afghanistan, with external affairs minister S Jaishankar calling for zero tolerance for cross-border terrorism and full transit rights for the war-torn country.Jaishankar didn’t name Pakistan in his statement at a UN Security Council debate on the UN assistance mission in Afghanistan, but there was little doubt which country he was referring to his remarks.While calling for a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire to end a surge in violence, including attacks on women, minorities and civil society activists, Jaishankar said India would welcome any move towards a genuine political settlement in Afghanistan.“For enduring peace in Afghanistan, terrorist safe havens and sanctuaries must be dismantled immediately and terrorist supply chains disrupted. There needs to be zero tolerance for terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including its cross-border one,” he said, in an apparent reference to Pakistan.“It is equally important to ensure that the territory of Afghanistan is not used by terrorist groups to threaten or attack any other country. Those providing material and financial support to terrorist entities must be held accountable,” he added.Durable peace in Afghanistan, Jaishankar said, requires “a genuine double peace” or peace within and around the country. The world community, he added, must deliver on its commitments to Afghanistan to ensure development and reconstruction.“For Afghanistan’s economic development, it is important to have unhindered access to the high seas. The international community should work towards the removal of artificial transit barriers imposed on Afghanistan and ensure full transit rights guaranteed to Afghanistan under bilateral and multilateral transit agreements without any hindrance,” he said.Pakistan has barred the movement of Indian goods through its territory to Afghanistan while allowing Afghan exports to India, despite strong objections from the government in Kabul over the years. To overcome such transit and transport-related problems, India has launched several air trade corridors between Afghan and Indian cities and developed Iran’s Chabahar port as an alternate access point to Afghanistan.New Delhi’s growing concerns over a recent surge in violence across Afghanistan, largely blamed on the Taliban, also figured in Jaishankar’s comments. He noted the UN secretary-general’s latest report on the situation in Afghanistan had made it clear the intra-Afghan talks hadn’t resulted in a reduction of violence.“On the contrary, violence has only increased, especially after May 1. The country has been witnessing targeted attacks on religious and ethnic minorities, girl students, Afghan security forces, ulemas, women occupying positions of responsibility, journalists, civil rights activists and the youth,” he said.“It is, therefore, crucial that the international community and in particular, this council, presses for a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire to ensure immediate reduction in violence and protection of civilian rights,” he added.India has backed all efforts to accelerate dialogue between the Afghan government and the Taliban, but if the peace process is to be successful, it is “necessary to ensure that the negotiating parties continue to engage in good faith, eschew the path to find a military solution, and fully commit towards reaching a political solution”, Jaishankar said.“I would like to reiterate our support for an inclusive Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled peace process. Any political settlement in Afghanistan must ensure that the gains of the last two decades are protected and not reversed,” he said, adding the constitutional and democratic framework must be preserved.Jaishankar also highlighted India’s recent steps to support Afghanistan during the transition period, including more than 550 community development projects covering all 34 provinces, a MoU for building the Shahtoot Dam to provide drinking water to Kabul, and the supply of 75,000 tonnes of wheat through Chabahar port to ensure food security amid the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-delhi-targets-pak-at-unsc-afghanistan-debate-101624387420735.html
23-06-2021||India||Monsoon unlikely to hit Delhi this month, may weaken in 7 days: IMD||The south-west monsoon is unlikely to hit Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, and some parts of Rajasthan till the end of the month, the Indian weather office said on Tuesday, further pushing back the expected arrival of the seasonal rains, which, just around 10 days ago, looked set to make an entry in the Capital almost a fortnight early, by June 15. Now, it will almost keep to the schedule it usually does, year after year.The India Meteorological Department also added that a weak monsoon phase is commencing over central, Peninsular and northwest India during next seven days owing to unfavourable meteorological conditions. Still, almost all parts of the country have so far received excess rainfall. Till Monday, the country as a whole received 37% more rain than it usually does in June; there was a 76% excess in northwest India, 58% in central India, 24% over the southern peninsula, and 13% in east and northeast India.The reason for the delay, according to IMD is a trough (an elongated area of low pressure) in the westerlies that have been persisting for the past 10 days. Normally, westerlies are weak in June as easterly monsoon winds pick up but this year, the trough in westerlies has been oscillating over northwest India, weakening the flow of the monsoon. Then, the mid latitude westerlies have strengthened again as a western disturbance (a cyclone originating in the mediterranean region) approached the Western Himalayan region on Monday.Scientists said such strengthening of mid latitude westerlies is uncommon in June. “There were two anti-cyclones, one over Afghanistan and another north of Myanmar. There was a trough running from Jammu and Kashmir up to parts of Rajasthan which was oscillating but very slightly. The trough was persisting for ten days. In the next four to five days we do not expect any change in conditions because mid-latitude westerlies have strengthened further. This is the main reason why the monsoon is not able to progress beyond certain parts of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. We cannot say when the monsoon will arrive in Delhi immediately. It will take time,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.Normally two or three western disturbances impact the Western Himalayan region in June but their impact is limited to northern regions of Jammu and Kashmir. The mid latitude westerlies are impacting the entire northwest India this time.The monsoon has so far covered most parts of the country except parts of Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab. But IMD said further progress of monsoon is unlikely in the next seven days. The northern limit monsoon continues to pass through Barmer, Bhilwara, Dholpur, Aligarh, Meerut, Ambala and Amritsar.There are other why the monsoon is likely to weaken over the coming week, apart from the trough in the westerlies.The Madden-Julian oscillation’s (MJO) location and amplitude strongly modulates the intensity of tropical convection and features such as low pressure systems over the north Indian Ocean. It is currently lying in Phase 1 (east Africa) with amplitude greater than 1 which is not favourable for enhancing the convection over north Indian Ocean region and hence monsoon rainfall activities, IMD said in a statement. MJO is an oceanic-atmospheric phenomenon which causes intra-seasonal variability in weather features.Weather models also indicate that the mid latitude westerlies will be sweeping over north India in the coming week. A western disturbance is lying as a cyclonic circulation over north Pakistan and adjoining Jammu & Kashmir and a there is a trough in mid- and upper-tropospheric levels. These are not favourable for enhancing monsoon activity over central India and the plains of northwest India.Winds over eastern and central parts of Arabian Sea have also weakened and are currently blowing at about 10-20 knots along the west coast. Such weak monsoonal winds are likely to prevail during the next seven days. The models also show a low probability of low pressure systems forming over core monsoon areas as well as over the north Bay of Bengal till June 30.“Sometimes such variations happen when instead of monsoon winds, westerlies start dominating. The timing is very important because such large-scale feature variations can slowdown progress of monsoon. Rains in east and northeast India will continue because contribution of moisture and convection from Bay of Bengal is still active. We will update as soon as monsoon starts strengthening again,” explained RK Jenamani, senior scientist at national weather forecasting centre, IMD.The normal date of monsoon onset over Delhi is June 27. This year, however, the onset is likely to be delayed. Earlier this month, IMD forecast that monsoon would set over Delhi June 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-unlikely-to-hit-delhi-this-month-may-weaken-in-7-days-imd-101624387360834.html
23-06-2021||India||Theaterisation will overcome hurdles: Rawat||As the government sharpens it focus on laying the groundwork for theatre commands in the backdrop of internal resistance, chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat on Tuesday said the new reforms do face some hurdles, but that the three services were in agreement on taking theaterisation forward.“These hurdles are also necessary as they make us realise that more discussions are required (to iron out the details of the plan). We are taking the theaterisation plan forward with more discussions,” Rawat told India Today TV.He said the processes for the creation of theatre commands were progressing in line with the prescribed timelines for bringing about jointness among the three services.The government expects Rawat, who took charge as India’s first CDS on January 1, 2020, to bring about so-called jointness among the three services in a three-year time frame (by January 2023). One of the means to achieve jointness is the setting up of integrated theatre commands for the best use of military resources to fight future battles.The CDS’s comments came a day after HT reported that while the army and navy were in favour of theatre commands, the air force had issues over division of its air assets, nomenclature of commands, leadership of theatre commands and dilution of powers of the service chiefs.Rawat said the armed forces , after several rounds of discussions , have done a lot of work on what kind of joint structures should be set up. “If we operate together and utilise the strengths of the three services, the synergised effort will not be the sum of three; but 1+1+1 (the three services) will equal 111,” he said.Experts highlighted the need for all stakeholders to cooperate to take theaterisation forward.“There was no consensus on the appointment of CDS for 20 years. Ultimately, the government had to take a decision. Similarly, when it comes to theaterisation, it is for India’s defence and security. No service should feel that they will have an upper hand or become subordinate to another service. We should all be mature enough to take India’s long-term interests into account,” said Lieutenant General DB Shekatkar (retd).On Tuesday, Rawat held a meeting with the vice chiefs of the three services and senior officials from the defence, finance and home ministries to discuss all aspects related to setting up theatre commands before the proposal is sent to the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) for approval, officials familiar with the developments said.A lack of consensus on the military’s theaterisation model emerged earlier this month during a key meeting of top government officials who reviewed a draft cabinet note on the new joint structures. This led to the government setting up an expert committee last week to carry out consultations on the long-awaited military reform.Theaterisation refers to placing specific units of the army, the navy and the air force under a theatre commander. Such commands are to be led by an officer from any of the three services, depending on the roles assigned to them. Most significant military powers including the US have moved to theatre commands which synergise the working of the three services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/theaterisation-will-overcome-hurdlesrawat-101624387360132.html
23-06-2021||India||0.03%: Positivity rates at two private labs 450 times lower than average during Kumbh mela||Two private labs in the dock for allegedly conducting fake Covid-19 antigen tests during the Mahakumbh in April reported positivity rates of 0.03% during the holy event, roughly 450 times lower than the average positivity rate in Uttarakhand at the time, official data accessed by HT showed on Tuesday.The data also showed that apart from the two facilities – Delhi-based Lalchandani Labs and Hisar-based Nalwa Labs – named in the FIR last week, a number of other private labs also reported very low positivity rates.In all, 11 labs were contracted by the mela authorities to conduct Covid-19 tests during Kumbh but only two were named in police complaints. Positivity rates are a ratio of the number of Covid-positive results to number of tests conducted, and are a measure of disease outbreak severity in an area.Data from the mela administration showed that the 11 labs carried out 207,000 antigen tests between April 1 and 30 and reported an overall positivity rate of 0.49%.For reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests – considered the gold standard of Covid-19 testing and more reliable than rapid tests – the labs carried out 44,278 tests and reported a positivity rate of 2.82%.In all, private labs carried out 251,000 Covid-19 tests during the mela and found 2,273 infections at a positivity rate of 0.90%. At the time, the average test positivity rate in Haridwar was 4%, and that of Uttarakhand was 13.7%.Roughly 9.1 million devotees took the holy dip this year and six million of this was in April, coinciding with a devastating surge in infections across the country.Data showed that Nalwa Labs carried out roughly half – 104,000 – of all antigen tests and reported 0.033% positivity. Lalchandani Labs carried out 13,992 antigen tests and reported 0.028% positivity.Haridwar district magistrate C Ravishankar, who is monitoring a three-member probe into the allegations, said the low numbers should have raised eyebrows. “Prima facie it was suspicious that a single lab carried out over 1 lakh tests in less than a month when other labs were nowhere close,” he said.When it came to RT-PCR, Nalwa carried out 5,782 tests and detected 29 infected cases, a positivity rate of 0.50%. Lalchandani Labs didn’t conduct any RT-PCR tests.The data pointed out that a number of private labs not named in the FIRs also reported low positivity rates.For example, two labs detected just one positive case throughout the month and reported antigen positivity rates of 0.064% and 0.087%. Roughly 93% of all rapid tests conducted at the mela were done by six labs that reported a combined positivity rate of 0.23%. The highest antigen positivity rate of 12.69%was reported by a Delhi-based lab that carried out 1,426 tests and found 181 infections.Ravishankar said that the low positivity rates were likely missed by officials because the focus was on carrying out as many tests as possible to ensure no infected people were visiting the mela. “It could be possible that no one noticed it (the unusually low positivity rate) because we were just coming from a time when cases were still low. Also, antigen tests usually report few positives,” he said.For RT-PCR tests, a Meerut-based lab reported the lowest positivity rate of 0.1% after carrying out 2,894 tests and finding only three infections. Overall, 44,278 RT-PCR tests were carried out by private labs and 1,250 people were found to be positive at a rate of 2.82%.Allegations of fake testing surfaced at the Kumbh last week after a Faridkot resident complained to the authorities that he received a message for collecting his Covid-19 report despite never having been tested. The complaint triggered a probe that unearthed roughly 100,000 fake rapid antigen tests. Three firms – Lalchandani Lab, Nalwa Lab and Noida-based private agency Max Corporate Services – were booked last week.At present, three separate probes are looking at the allegations: one by the police, one by the district administration and one by the mela administration.Police said their investigation – which is currently looking at the two labs -- will expand to probe all tests carried out by private labs. “Our aim is to find the truth about these tests. We are beginning our probe with the two labs mentioned in the FIR, and will expand our investigation to all the private labs,” said Senthil Avoodai Krishnaraj, senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Haridwar.Ravishankar said that the probe could expand as well. “It could be due to wrong testing methodology or any other errors, but no lab has been given a clean chit. Right now we have begun with the two labs, but will move to probe other labs as well, if needed,” said the officer.A mela administration officer, who did not want to be identified, said that errors could be because of the short period in which these testing camps had to be set up at the borders and in mela premises.Mela health officer Arjun Sengar cited the ongoing probe to refuse comment. Harbeer Singh, additional mela officer, said, “The issue is under probe and it is not appropriate for me to comment on it. But the probe is happening at multiple levels and action will be taken if any loophole emerges.”Nalwa Labs and Lalchandani Labs have rejected the allegations and approached the Uttarakhand high court to quash the FIR. Max Corporate Services also moved the high court, arguing that it was a service provider and only labs were authorised to conduct testing and uploading results on the government portal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/003-positivity-rates-at-two-private-labs-450-times-lower-than-average-during-kumbh-mela-101624387301579.html
23-06-2021||India||Gupkar leaders to be part of PM’s J&K meet||A five-party alliance of mainstream parties in Kashmir decided on Tuesday to attend an all-party meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the first such political outreach by the Centre since it controversially stripped the region of its special status two years ago.Leaders of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration ( PAGD), set up to demand restoration of Jammu & Kashmir’s special status, met at the residence of former chief minister Farooq Abdullah in Srinagar and decided to attend the meeting in Delhi on Thursday.The decision was unanimous, and the Centre didn’t impose any conditions for the 14 invited politicians, said leaders who attended the discussion.“We received an invitation from the PM and we are going in that meeting. We are going to put forward our point of view before the Prime Minister and home minister,” said Abdullah, National Conference (NC) patriarch and PAGD chairperson. “All those invited will be attending the meet in New Delhi,” he added.Asked about the PAGD’s stand, Abdullah said, “Whatever our stand was, is still there and will be there.” In a separate meeting, the Congress also decided to attend the all-party event.Former chief minister and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti, who is also vice-chairperson of PAGD, said she was already ready for dialogue, and indicated that PAGD will push for restoration of Jammu & Kashmir’s special status and full statehood.“We will talk about the agenda for which this people’s alliance was formed. What has been snatched away, we will talk about that and how they have erred. It was illegal and constitutional and without restoring it you can’t improve the situation and bring peace in Jammu & Kashmir,” she said.PAGD spokesman and CPI(M) general secretary Mohammad Yusuf Tarigami said all leaders will advocate for what was “taken away from us”. “We are not seeking stars or moon but the constitutional guarantees taken away from us,” he said.Anantnag MP Hasnain Masoodi said the Centre hadn’t imposed any conditions on participation in the meeting. “We see this meeting as an opportunity to present our point of view,” he said.The meeting signals the restarting of political engagement between mainstream Kashmiri parties and the Centre, which in August 2019 voided Articles 370 and 35A that bestowed special status to Jammu and Kashmir and privileges to its residents, and split the state into two Union territories. All mainstream political leaders were detained, internet and phone connections were snapped and curfew-like restrictions were imposed in the Valley for months.When the leaders were released in 2020, they came together as PAGD and adopted a resolution to demand the region’s full statehood and special status. Current PAGD members include the NC, PDP, CPI(M), J&K Awami National Conference, and the J&K People’s Movement.Politicians in the Valley remain bitterly opposed to J&K’s bifurcation and revocation of Article 370. In the past, PAGD members have clashed with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which backed the scrapping of special status.News of the meeting broke last Friday but months of backchannel talks between the Union home ministry and national security adviser Ajit Doval with mainstream politicians in the Valley paved the way for the event, said people aware of developments. On Saturday, Union home secretary AK Bhalla called all members personally to extend an invitation for the June 24 meeting. The meeting has no fixed agenda but is likely to discuss restoration of statehood, delimitation and fresh elections, added the people quoted above.According to members who attended the two-hour-long discussions at Abdullah’s residence on Tuesday, the decision to participate in the all-party meeting was unanimous. “There were no dissenting voices. Everyone agreed that dialogue is the way forward,” one member who was a part of the meeting said on the condition of anonymity. Mufti initially suggested that Abdullah should represent the PAGD but later it was decided that all invited leaders should attend the meeting.Tarigami said the outreach vindicated the PAGD’s stand. “There is clearly a realisation in Delhi that they have not been able to move forward on their own in the last two years since Article 370 was revoked,” he said. In local-body elections held last year, the PAGD had swept Kashmir, winning 110 of the 278 seats contested in the Valley.“The PM invited us and we will express ourselves in clear terms. Our historic state was downgraded without any consultation with us. Delhi is not mandated to destroy the foundation of the Constitution,” said Tarigami.Mufti said that for a conducive atmosphere, the government should release all political prisoners in the Valley. “Many prisoners are ill in jails. So, the political prisoners should be released and those who are lodged in jails outside Kashmir should be shifted back to Srinagar .”Masoodi said the leaders will press the Centre to undo the decisions of August 2019. “We don’t know what will be the response from the other side but we are hopeful that there is understanding in New Delhi that things need to be changed in J&K,” he said.Separately, the Congress also decided to attend the all-party meeting with its Kashmir unit leader GA Mir asserting that the restoration of full statehood will be its “priority number one”. The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by Congress president Sonia Gandhi and attended by former prime minister Manmohan Singh, and senior leaders Karan Singh, P Chidambaram, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Rajni Patil, Mir and Tariq Hameed Karra.“Congress will keep restoration of full statehood on priority number one irrespective of the agenda of the meeting,” said Mir.The meeting comes weeks after the delimitation commission for J&K wrote to all 20 UT’s district commissioners seeking both quantitative and qualitative data. Set up in early 2020, and given an extension earlier this year, the commission was tasked with delineating the boundaries of the assembly and parliamentary constituencies. It is only after this process is complete that assembly elections can be held for the first time in seven years.So far, both the PDP and the NC have boycotted the exercise of redrawing the constituencies in the UT in accordance with the provisions of Part V of Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019 and Delimitation Act, 2002.The meeting also sparked protests in the Hindu-majority Jammu region with some leaders accusing the Centre of pandering to Kashmiri politicians. “In this meet, Jammu has been given a negligible share but Kashmiri leaders who talk about separatism and separatists are invited,” said former state minister and Panthers Party chief Harsh Dev Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gupkar-leaders-to-be-part-of-pm-s-j-k-meet-101624387240693.html
23-06-2021||India||Covaxin submits Phase 3 data to expert panel, claims 78% efficacy||Covaxin, the coronavirus vaccine by Bharat Biotech, has shown a 77.8% efficacy in preventing symptomatic Covid-19 in large scale clinical trials, according to the data shared with Indian drug regulators who analysed the findings, an official aware of the matter said on Tuesday.The efficacy rate is similar to interim trial analyses, but the company is yet to release data regarding the multiple analyses it has carried out at different points in time. The trial was carried out in 25,800 volunteers and the latest data set was submitted to the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) of the Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO) over the weekend.“The required data was submitted by the company, and the subject expert committee went though it today. The experts were satisfied with the results presented, and the vaccine efficacy is confirmed at 77.8%,” said an official in the government aware of the development, on condition of anonymity.The vaccine was approved for emergency use in the Indian population in January, and the Hyderabad-based company had then said it would release phase III data by March. The release has since been pushed back on several occasions.Also read | Bharat Biotech to hold Covaxin pre-submission meeting with WHO next WednesdayThere were no delays in the company releasing its Phase 3 trial data, and that the progress was as per schedule, a company executive, Bharat Biotech, said.“Regulators want a minimum of two months data after the last trial participant is jabbed for efficacy analysis. The last participant in the trial of 25,800 participants was jabbed around mid-May; therefore the analysis will take its time. Hundreds of people are on job to analyse 2-3 lakh data sheets and some 50 lakh data points. We already have 9 papers published in top notch peer-reviewed publications; we have been totally transparent with our data,” the executive added.Clinicians said the efficacy results disclosed on Tuesday were encouraging. “No vaccine is going to be 100% effective but then for respiratory diseases it is anyway not possible to have 100% efficacy. Anything above 60% is good enough for a vaccine against a respiratory infection,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the pulmonology and sleep medicine department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.However, Bharat Biotech is yet to release the data from any of the interim analyses of the clinical trials. Concerns over lack of data trace back to January when the vaccine was approved by the Drugs Controller General of India under what it then said was in “clinical trial mode”. At the time, the company was yet to determine the efficacy rate.The first analysis -- based on 43 cases -- came in March, when it reported an 81% efficacy. This number came to about 78% in the second interim analysis, the results of which was disclosed on April 21 based on infections in 87 people.The Hyderabad-based company is also expected to hold a “pre-submission” meeting this week with the World Health Organization on Wednesday for emergency use listing of its vaccine. A WHO listing will help the vaccine being recognized by more agencies and countries, and potentially help the validity of vaccine certificates of people who got the dose.Clinical trials of Covaxin are also being carried out in children and have had a huge response. At present, participants in the 6-12 years age category are being recruited. The company has approval to conduct trial in children between 2 and 18 years.“We are unable to handle all the requests that are coming from parents, and even doctors, who want their children to receive the shot as part of the trial,” said the company executive.Covaxin is one of the three vaccines which are currently being used in India. The vaccine is based on an inactivated virus platform, and its efficacy rate may be among the best in vaccines that use the same technique. China uses two vaccines on the same platform – made by Sinopharm and Sinovac. The Sinovac vaccine has been approved by the WHO but officials in China have since expressed concerns that its efficacy rate – between 51%-67% -- may be too low.Even vaccines with lower efficacy rates, however, are believed to offer significant protection from hospitalisation and death.Covaxin accounts for a little over 10% of the close to 290 million doses of coronavirus vaccines delivered in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-submits-phase-3-data-to-expert-panel-claims-78-efficacy-101624387240127.html
23-06-2021||India||CBSE Class 12 evaluation scheme ‘fair’ and ‘reasonable’: SC||The Supreme Court on Tuesday held that the new Class XII evaluation schemes proposed by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Council for Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE) are “fair”, “reasonable” and in the larger interest of students.A bench of justices A M Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari, while dismissing three separate petitions on the matter, said, “We find no reason to interfere with the CBSE, CISCE schemes as there are other students supporting this. We find it fair and reasonable as it takes into account all sets of students and is in the larger public interest.”The three pleas were filed by a parents’ body from Uttar Pradesh, one Anshul Gupta, and a set of candidates appearing for compartment/patrachar examinations conducted by CBSE. The first two asked the court to prevail upon the boards to revisit their decision to cancel the Class XII examinations as they said the proposed tabulation scheme is discriminatory and open to manipulation by schools.Last week, the court cleared the tabulation formulae submitted by the two boards. CBSE proposed a 30:30:40 formula based on a student’s performance in classes X, XI, and XII, followed by rationalization based on the school’s past performance in board exams. CISCE based its formula largely on the performance of students in classes XI and XII.The court observed on Tuesday that any attempt to reverse the decision of the boards will create uncertainty in the minds of students. “The situation is so dynamic that any uncertainty will affect the psyche of students and their ability to prepare for future exams,” the court said.The petition filed by Anshul Gupta argued that if students could appear physically for professional exams such as NEET, CLAT, etc, they should be able to appear for Class XII exams too. “Can you take responsibility if they are exposed to the disease?” the bench asked Gupta, pointing out that nearly 14.5 lakh students will take the CBSE examination.The Centre, represented by attorney general K K Venugopal, told the court that it is not safe to hold the examinations during the pandemic as it’s important to protect the lives of children.Also read | CBSE to form panel to check Class 12 marks complaintsThe second petition filed by UP Parents’ Association argued that the boards could have provided the students the choice of taking the optional exams right in the beginning so that they didn’t have to wait until August-September as those are the months when college and university admissions happen.The court was not in favour of giving students this choice. “Students will not be able to make an intelligent choice to appear for the examination if given a choice at the beginning,” the bench said, adding that while the students can estimate their scores based on how they performed in the past examinations, they could in no way know how their schools’ performance would reflect on their final scores.The Centre also assured the court that the University Grants Commission has been directed to communicate to all higher educational institutions not to begin admissions until the final results are announced.The court, however, noted variations in the schemes proposed by both boards. CISCE will not analyse a school’s performance in calculating a student’s marks. CISCE schools have already submitted the raw marks with the board while CBSE has left it to the results committee in each school to tabulate the results.The court asked CBSE to put in place some mechanism to cross-check marks. The Centre assured the court that the system has in-built checks, and CBSE’s tabulation policy provides “best of both the worlds” to the students who can sit for improvement exams if they are not satisfied with their scores.The third petition challenged CBSE’s plan to hold offline exams for compartment/patrachar candidates and asked for a tabulation scheme like the one for regular candidates.“It is not possible for us to adopt a second-guess approach,” the bench said in its order, noting that in such matters, decisions have to be taken for 20 lakh students and cannot depend on individual perceptions of the petitioners.It also asked the compartment candidates to take the offline exams between August 15 and September 15, as suggested by CBSE.SC to Andhra: If there is one death, state will be held responsible The Supreme Court on Tuesday told the Andhra Pradesh government that its decision to hold Class XII board examinations was fraught with danger and the state will be held accountable should a single life be lost because of it.Hearing a petition filed by a group of parents demanding the cancellation of state board exams, the apex court found that of the states that are yet to make up their minds on cancelling examinations, Andhra was the only one to actually want to hold the exams.Advocate Mahfooz A Nazki, appearing for Andhra Pradesh, submitted that the state was confident about holding the exams and will take a call on it by the first week of July.The bench of justices A M Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari then said, “If there is even one fatality, we will make the state responsible.”The court directed the state to file an affidavit by Wednesday and posted the matter for further hearing on Thursday. That day the court will hear another petition filed by some parents challenging Kerala’s decision to hold Class XI examinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbse-class-12-evaluation-scheme-fair-and-reasonable-sc-101624385200027.html
23-06-2021||India||Bharat Biotech to increase Covaxin supply to pvt sector from 10% to 25%||More private hospitals could offer Covaxin from July as Bharat Biotech will be supplying up to 25% of the total production volume of its Covid-19 vaccine to the private sector next month. Currently, it supplies 10% of the total production volume, said a top company representative.The price at which the vaccine is sold to the government is also likely to be revised. The company has requested the government to look at revising the price of the vaccine per dose for the government sector. It has said the current price of ₹150 per dose seems to be non-competitive and not sustainable in the long run.The rate at which the vaccine doses are sold to the private sector may not change.Also Read | Fake Covid shots given at unauthorised vaccination camps in Mumbai: Police“Since January, we were supplying less than 10% to the private sector, and now the government has told us that we can increase it up to 25% for future deals. From next month, we will look at revising the distribution pattern, and...it is going to move towards 25%,” said a company executive, Bharat Biotech International Ltd.The executive is a part of the product development team in Bharat Biotech.The Covaxin price for the private sector currently is ₹1,200 per vaccine dose.“There are future orders that the central government is discussing with us. We are looking at requesting a better price. It is not just the cost of vaccines but also the distribution cost of supplies to states that we have to take care of... that increases the overall cost... there needs to be a better price. For the private market, we don’t see any changes for now,” he said.Covaxin is one of the two Covid-19 vaccines currently approved for use under the national Covid-19 immunisation programme.As of now, the company is producing close to 25 million vaccine doses monthly and is looking at stepwise scaling up of production in the next four to five months.“The current production capacity is 25 million doses per month, and this is likely to be maintained till August-September this year, after which more supplies will happen. In the next two months, we will be starting production at two of our facilities in Ankleshwar, Gujarat, and Bengaluru, Karnataka. These facilities are being re-purposed and the production is likely to start in the next two months,” the executive said.The company is looking at an increase to 60-70 million doses per month by November-December.“We actually see annualized production, and it is going to reach 800 million mark by the end of this year. We have initiated technology transfer with three institutions through the department of biotechnology, and these companies are also preparing their facilities for the purpose, especially setting up a bio-safety level-3 laboratory, and should start production in some time,” the executive said.According to the company, it takes anywhere between 90 to 120 days for producing a batch.Therefore, there is no scope for any ad hoc changes to be made in the supply chain. The company said the scope of exporting doses is currently not on the horizon. “Our doses are committed well in advance; there is no possibility of making sudden changes. The same goes for exporting as the government has clearly indicated that priority is Indian citizens. Even though the list of countries that have requested vaccine doses is piling up continuously, but exports will depend only on government approvals,” the executive added.At least eight countries have requested Bharat Biotech for Covaxin supplies.As for the delay in phase 3 trials, the executive said there was no delay as due processes were being followed as per the set protocol.“Regulators want a minimum of two months data after the last trial participant is jabbed for efficacy analysis. The last participant in the trial of 25,800 participants was jabbed around mid-May. Therefore, the analysis will take its time. Hundreds of people are on job to analyse two-three lakh data sheets and some 50 lakh data points. We already have nine papers published in top-notch peer-reviewed publications. We have been totally transparent with our data,” he added.The Covaxin trial among children has also met with a huge response. At present recruitment of participants is happening in the 6-12 years category while the company has the approval to conduct trials in children aged between two and 18.“We are unable to handle all the requests that are coming from parents, and even doctors, who want their children to receive the shot as part of the trial,” the executive said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-to-increase-covaxin-supply-to-pvt-sector-from-10-to-25-101624366720104.html
23-06-2021||India||‘Centre needs to improve relation with states, be receptive to feedback’||Tamil Nadu finance minister Palanivel Thiagarajan said the Union government is less receptive to feedback and should take the responsibility to improve relations with states. In a conversation with Divya Chandrababu, the minister also spoke about how Tamil Nadu constituted a dream team of economists, including Nobel laureate Esther Duflo and former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan. Edited excerpts:How did the committee come about?The chief minister was very keen that we should get the best minds in the world to help us. We wanted the composition to reflect our priorities as a party, as a (Dravidian) movement and a government that focuses on the poor and the oppressed rather than just for growth sake. Our high priority is that growth should be inclusive. So, we were keen to get people who had a track record of doing that. If you look at both professor Rajan and Dr Subramanian, they are Tamilians -- they have a natural affinity. Professor Duflo has been working with Tamil Nadu through J-PAL (Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab) long before she was a Nobel laureate, so she had an interest. Mr Narayan is a long-term Tamil Nadu cadre (officer). He has decades of experience (working) in Delhi and was former economic advisor to (late) Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Jean Dreze was very important to us because of his work with the MNREGA. Professor Dreze and professor Dulfo wanted to think about which way they could add value and the structure. So, we designed it to be very informal, result-oriented and input effectuation. It is an active group of highly committed, sophisticated individuals who will be proactive and help guide us in our actions on a continuous and ongoing basis.Two of the members, Rajan and Subramanian, have worked with the Centre. Would you say that their exit worked to Tamil Nadu’s advantage?None of these people, I think, are less than patriotic, and I do not think that they would have said a no to us unless there was a contractual constraint or a conflict of interest. When we invited them, we did not tell them who the other was. I guess they must have had that faith in us. Dr Rajan was pleasantly surprised when he saw the rest of the names. Now, they feel that diversity adds to enrichment.Do you think the Centre’s political economy is influenced by RSS moorings?Whatever philosophy, policy, approach or strategy you take, the outcome determines whether it has been right or wrong. The Union government does not show great receptiveness either for original input or there is not enough quantitative and qualitative feedback to figure out how we can adapt after an execution. We are at a stage where it is impossible either from a capital investment perspective or from a domestic demand perspective to be 100% self-contained and achieve the growth rate, employment and uplift of society that we all aspire to have. What they are doing now is not working. Even before Covid-19 was on the radar, we saw a decline in growth for several quarters.In that case, would you have any advice on the economy and GST?Given, I am six weeks into the job, I am not qualified to do that. On GST, I have been clear. In my maiden attendance, I put out an extensive 12-page document on my recommendations and suggestions. The implementation and design of GST leaves a lot to be desired and needs a lot of fixes. The relationship between the Union and the states was being atrophied by continuing differences in the discussions. It is time for the Union government to be more proactive in having cordial relationships with states because they have greater power, financial clout, resources, authority and everything in the relationship. I felt that the relationship as it stands right now is less than ideal.What do you think of the Centre revising its policy on vaccination drive?The Union government still has a lot of flexibility in the vaccines it approves, sources and whether it chooses to do monopoly procurement, which I have long advocated. We were always of the opinion that when there is only an oligopoly of producers, why should multiple buyers go and bang their heads against the wall? It is illogical. If they do a better job, and I think they can, then they can allocate enough for us. Had we been allocated all the vaccines we had asked for then, we (Tamil Nadu) would be able to reach 100% adult vaccination by the end of the year.And we are still facing a vaccine shortage...Again, I do not want to sound political, but clearly, it is a time for reflection. How did we find ourselves in this situation? If anybody had thought through the science, the only way to get back to normal was 100% vaccination. The only way to get the economy back to normal is 100% vaccination.What can be done to reduce fuel prices?We have prioritised what is both macroeconomically and to our conscience and our philosophy the right priority. We cannot, at this point, cut the state taxes for three reasons. On principle, when the Union government keeps increasing taxes and cuts our share of the Union taxes collected on fuel, it is not appropriate that we allow them to do so and for us to cut taxes. We did not commit that we would have cut the day we came (to power). We understand the benefit of cutting a regressive tax on the people. Since it is an input cost, it is potentially inflationary. Then there is a third component, which is that the financial situation we are in today. We cannot fix ten years’ worth of problems or seven years decline in one day. We found ourselves amid a second wave Corona pandemic.In your assessment, what led to Tamil Nadu’s current financial distress?The fundamental problem is that the state somehow started losing its revenue as a percentage of GSDP. When you consider revenue as a percentage of GSDP, now you have a unconfounded, relatively unbiased indicator. As a percentage of GSDP, the state’s own revenues used to be between 10 and 11.5% for much of the period between 2003 and 2014, which started dropping dramatically. Pre-Covid, they were already at 7.5%, and after Covid-19, they have fallen even worse. So, the biggest problem is you are not collecting revenue. The secondary problem is the Union’s drop in return of our tax money to us. Tamil Nadu contributes 10% to 12% of total revenue the Centre makes in direct and indirect taxes. We have lost ₹20,000 crore revenue from the Union and ₹70,000 crore worth of revenue that we should be self-generating.What are your plans to break out of this vicious cycle and to increase revenue for the state?There is a steady-state plan, and there is a short-term plan. The steady-state plan is to find a way to get back to 10.5-11% on your own in revenues. The first thing we are figuring out right now is from what channels were we getting it from for 10 years. The second point is, then how do we get that back to where it used to be for ten years without any problem, either politically or socially? The next stage is to look at the new ways to generate revenue from which we had not before. And then you need to borrow the 3% of your GSDP that is allowed under the FRA Act of Tamil Nadu, and invest that wholly into growth, infrastructure for industrial estates, for ports, airports, or drinking water systems for people, to increase the quality of life, and so on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-stalin-was-keen-that-we-should-get-the-best-minds-in-world-to-help-us-101624363359875.html

23-06-2021||Today's||India needs a third generation of reforms||In India’s development journey, two major policy departures in its approach to growth and development stand out. In each case, there was an acceleration in growth, which then started petering out. We are at a similar crossroads and it is time to usher in a third generation of reforms.The first generation of economic reforms took place soon after Independence. This was based on planning and import substitution. India’s growth witnessed a notable acceleration from the early 1950s to the mid-1960s, a significant transformation from stagnation of the past. This was followed by policy sclerosis, resulting in a growth downturn over an equivalent period till the late 1970s.The much delayed second generation of economic reforms finally began in 1991, and was again characterised by a growth-oriented approach. India was finally catching up with the prevailing global predominant thinking on development strategy — an open economy market-oriented framework. Fuelled by higher savings and investment, the economy ascended to a higher growth path of around 7% annual GDP growth over the next two decades. Industrial and export growth accelerated, along with a comfortable and stable external sector, and poverty reduced significantly.But, once again, the development engine started sputtering from the early 2010s. The slowdown is broad-based across all the sectors, agriculture, industry, and services. India’s economy is in trouble once again and hence needs a major reboot.There has been an inadequate generation of quality employment for the increasing Indian labour force throughout the development process. There seems to have been almost no net generation of jobs over the past 15 years or so. What is needed now is a special thrust to promote employment-intensive export-oriented manufacturing, which will need continued openness and not increased protection.But the key development failure, right through India’s history has been the lack of adequate attention to nutrition, health, and education. This is hampering the employability of new entrants to the labour force as new economic activities require an increasing level of educational competence. Thus, the next generation of economic reforms needs a special resolve to deliver efficient public services, particularly focused on the long-neglected social needs related to nutrition and health services, primary and secondary schooling, a major quality upgrade of tertiary education, water supply and sanitation, other public infrastructure and urban development; all public services that need enhanced government expenditure and technical competence and ability to deliver. The absence of these services is hobbling the performance of the private sector.The main organising principle of the second-generation reforms was freeing the private sector from the myriad government controls that had hobbled its performance. This process still needs to be pursued. But similar attention has not been given to improving the government’s performance.Also Read | Reforms under Aatmanirbhar Bharat improved ease of living, writes PM ModiConsequently, the third generation of economic reforms must focus on a similar empowerment of the public sector to deliver growth-enhancing public goods and services for the benefit of all segments of the public, private sector, and corporate entities alike. The “public sector” encompasses all levels of governments from the local, state to national, and their entities which deliver public goods and services, and includes regulatory and standard-setting authorities. They all need to be strengthened.The last 30 years have seen a clear private sector supply response to the increased demand for health, education and other services, reflecting the failure of their public provision in both quantity and quality. The way forward is not so much to restrict this private provision, but to improve significantly both the quality of public services leading to greater trust in the provision of these services, and their scale and quantity to promote universal accessibility. This would free up money in the hands of the less well-off for enhanced demand for growth, promoting other essential goods and services. There must be a renewed clear understanding that it is the government’s role to deliver public goods and services that only it can provide, and that such services cannot and should not be privatised.This kind of quality improvement cannot take place without a significant enhancement of government’s own technocratic competence and implementation capacity. The availability of economic competence enabled the formulation of reforms at the macro level in 1991, and then their implementation in the ensuing two decades. There needs to be a system change in the approach to public administration, away from the traditional colonial approach.Also Read | Moody’s slashes India growth forecast for 2021 to 9.6%The first condition for sustained growth is an enhancement of investment levels, both public and private. This would imply an overall increase in fiscal expenditure along with a shift in composition towards higher public investment for the delivery of public goods and services, which, in turn, would crowd in private investment rather than crowding it out. But buoyancy in the tax-GDP ratio does not reflect the sustained growth in GDP of the past three decades, particularly the stagnation experienced over the past decade. Focused attention now needs to be given, to increasing efficiency and compliance in tax-revenue collection so that India’s overall tax-GDP ratio rises to levels consistent with comparable international experience, to finance the needed enhanced public expenditures.The key departure from current received wisdom that I am making is to emphasise the role of the State in promoting economic growth. Countries that have been most successful in maintaining high sustained growth rates have done so by setting up growth-promoting governmental institutions to coordinate public investments, while also incentivising the private sector to make investments necessary for a growing, dynamic economy. Niti Aayog needs to be strengthened technically, and in its powers to perform such a role.The current government structure is simply not designed to take India to the next stage of development. The third generation of economic reforms must therefore focus on improving the government’s own competence, both administrative and technical, at all levels.Rakesh Mohan was the economic advisor to the government of India in the industry ministry in 1991.

23-06-2021||Today's||Theocracy and elections: The Iran way||Last Friday, Iran elected its eighth president since the 1979 Islamic revolution that ended the Pahlavi dynasty. As expected, Ebrahim Raisi, the chief of the judiciary since 2019, is set to take over from President Hassan Rouhani on August 3. Given Iran’s complex governance structure of a theocracy with partial elective democracy, the elections are pre-determined, though sometimes surprisingly competitive. This time, a low turnout of less than 50% after extending the voting deadline, showed that even by Iranian standards, the non-contest failed to generate interest.At the top of Iran’s governance structure is the supreme leader, currently 82-year-old Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in power since Ayatollah Khomeini’s death in 1989. He is the commander-in-chief of all armed forces and security services, appoints the heads of radio and TV networks and the judiciary, and half the 12-member Guardian Council (GC). The GC members need parliamentary approval and, in turn, vet candidatures for all elected positions — a 290-member parliament, 88-member Assembly of Experts and the president. In addition, GC also examines all legislation to ensure its conformity with the Sharia. In case of differences, the matter is referred to the 45-member Expediency Council, chosen by the supreme leader. The principal task of the Experts’ Assembly is to approve the new supreme leader.Also Read | US blocks websites linked to Iranian disinformationWhile the supreme leader is there for life (or till he chooses to retire), the president is limited to two four-year terms, defining where the balance of power rests between them. Speculation that a new supreme leader is likely to be appointed in the coming years made this election critical as Khamenei has to ensure a smooth transition while ensuring the preservation of his legacy.Raisi, a hardliner, owes much of his career progression to the supreme leader and is also seen as a potential successor. Incidentally, Khamenei too was president from 1981-89 and shortly before Khomeini died, he anointed Khamenei as his successor.Born in 1960, Raisi was a theology student in the holy city of Qom and joined the anti-Shah movement as a teenager. After the Islamic revolution, he embarked on a legal career as a prosecutor and during the 1980s, moved to Tehran. Following the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, thousands of political prisoners (declared anti-national and supporters of Saddam Hussein), were sentenced to death by a four-member committee that included Raisi. Later he was deputy chief of the judiciary (2004-14) and prosecutor-general. In 2017, he was runner-up when Rouhani won his second term in an election with a 73% turnout, and appointed judiciary chief later.In 2019, both the United States (US) and European Union (EU) imposed sanctions on Raisi on account of his human rights record, for the 1980s executions and lethal crackdowns on anti-government protesters, in 2009 and 2019.Raisi’s victory was clear on May 25 when GC disqualified strong contenders such as the former speaker Ali Larijani and current vice-president Ishaq Jahangiri, setting the stage for him. Many civil society leaders launched calls for a boycott that reduced the turnout to below 49%, and a record 3.7 million votes cast were blank and void. As an Iranian explained, “How do you pick an orange when all that is on offer are five bananas?” Conservatives enjoy over two-thirds majority in parliament after the 2020 election.Rouhani’s eight-year tenure has been dominated by the nuclear issue and relations with the US. Talks began in 2013 but it was Rouhani’s moderate credentials together with foreign minister Javad Zarif’s diplomatic skills that enabled progress. Secret talks with the US in Oman proved invaluable and in July 2015, the nuclear deal was concluded between Iran and P5+1 (US, Russia, China, UK, France, Germany and the EU). Iran accepted certain constraints on its nuclear programme, especially the uranium enrichment activities, in return for sanctions relief.Iran’s economy, hurting under the sanctions registered a 12% growth in 2016 only to start shrinking after Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the nuclear deal in 2018 and adopted a policy of “maximum pressure” to coerce Iran back to the negotiating table. Iran responded with a policy of “maximum resistance”. The economy has been in recession for three years now, amid rising unemployment and inflation running at 40%. Since 2019, Iran began to step up certain nuclear activities, while emphasising that its actions were reversible if sanctions relief was restored, balancing hardliners at home while putting pressure on the EU.With Joe Biden in the White House, prospects for reviving the nuclear deal improved. Six rounds of talks in Vienna registered limited progress. However, Rouhani’s hands were tied. With only six weeks left before the end of Rouhani’s tenure, Khamenei wanted that a deal, even partial, only be concluded after the elections. Rouhani will be responsible for any shortcomings while any relief credit will accrue to Raisi.Given the situation, the US has played along but the hard negotiation begins now. It will only offer partial relief in return for some Iranian rollback, holding back to engage the new regime in Tehran. With hardliners now dominant, the US expects that internal bickering will end.Meanwhile, talks last month between the Saudis and Iranians in Iraq have raised hopes of movement on Yemen. A change of guard in Israel may provide breathing space in Lebanon and Gaza. The sands in West Asia may be shifting, though ever so slightly.Rakesh Sood is a retired diplomat and currently Distinguished Fellow, Observer Research Foundation.

23-06-2021||Today's||The Pulwama investigation and its lessons for India on countering terror||In June 2019, Sajjad Bhat, a terrorist belonging to the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed, was killed in an encounter with security forces in South Kashmir. A car procured by Bhat (and filled with explosives)was used by another militant in February in the deadliest terrorist attack Kashmir had ever seen in its 30 years of bloodied history.Pulwama represented a rupture in various ways, including redefining the Indian State’s response to terror attacks. It was also a moment where the ineffective dossiers — international agencies would complain that they looked like Wikipedia entries — prepared by our investigation agencies would give way to solid, evidence-backed investigation.As the National Investigation Agency (NIA) connected the dots all the way to Pakistan, their investigation revealed that Jaish carried out this attack to dent Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s image just before the general elections. But not only did it misfire, it also contributed to Modi’s landslide victory. The attack also speeded up his government’s decision to do away with Article 370 later that year.Also Read | AIIMS Pulwama hits a wall as army red flags constructionIn June 2019 when Bhat was killed, however, not much was known about the attack. A few leads came to NIA investigators immediately after the suicide bombing. A few other minor players such as Bhat (who officially joined Jaish a few days after Pulwama) were identified and hunted down with great fanfare. But the security agencies hadn’t cracked the case.With Bhat’s death, the investigation came to a dead end. At that point, NIA investigators started looking for clues beyond what they could find at the site of the attack.It is because of this diligence that the conspiracy began to unravel one puzzle piece at a time, ultimately leading to a man, a ruthless manipulator and killer, trained in the best joint facility of al-Qaeda and Jaish in Afghanistan.It was a meticulous investigation, involving a lot of hard work and some lucky breaks. An investigation where NIA officers, with the help of their colleagues in Jammu and Kashmir Police, used an effective mix of human intelligence and technology.Along with the unravelling of the main conspiracy, other crucial information come to light. The investigation revealed that Jaish was using tunnels along the international border in Jammu to sneak into India with sophisticated arms and explosives.For this, it used a network of local sympathisers who, in at least one case, brought almost three dozen terrorists to the state in a year. The tunnels were an engineering marvel, and along with use of drones to drop weapons, posed a challenge for which India was unprepared. The investigation also confirmed the ugly innards of counterinsurgency, of how men considered informers by intelligence agencies turned out to be dangerous terrorists.But perhaps most importantly, the investigation also highlighted the limitations of our current counterinsurgency model in Kashmir. The hunting down of terrorists is important, and security agencies are quite good at it. But this cannot be the end goal.One of the men, almost a boy, arrested in the Pulwama conspiracy is from an affluent family. Yet the Jaish reached him, turning him into their courier, although behind his back, they mocked him, calling him a bhola (simpleton). Bhola is in jail now — where last heard, he was preparing for his medical entrance exams.If we have to have a long-lasting success in Kashmir, we must do two things. One, we have to ensure the Bholas of the future do not turn radical. Two, we must not stop the chain of investigation once a terrorist on the hitlist is eliminated. Our investigations must go beyond the site of the encounter. This is only the starting point.We committed the same mistakes after the Parliament attack mastermind Ghazi Baba was killed in 2003. He was technically the first Jaish recruit and it was the infrastructure he created that the militant group still uses in Kashmir. What we leave behind carelessly once we have achieved our immediate target comes to bite us in the future in devastating ways. That is the lesson of the Pulwama investigation.Rahul Pandita is the author of The Lover Boy of Bahawalpur: How the Pulwama Case was CrackedThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-pulwama-investigation-and-its-lessons-for-india-on-countering-terror-101624439082949.html
23-06-2021||Today's||Scientifically Speaking | Knowing how coronavirus hacks cells will help stop it||Many people are now familiar with the spike protein that the Covid-19-causing coronavirus uses to get inside human cells. All vaccines are designed to prompt the immune system to create antibodies that recognise the viral spike protein. But a lesson from India’s second wave is that in addition to vaccines, we need antivirals to help those who have already infected.The drugs that are currently available for Covid-19 were created with the purpose of treating other diseases. Consequently, many of these drugs have not lived up to the initial promise. To develop new antiviral drugs, last week, the United States (US) government decided to invest over $3 billion. To thwart the virus, we must find where it is vulnerable to intervention.Compared to the process of viral entry, there has been less attention paid to what happens once the coronavirus is inside the cell. This phase of the viral life cycle is important because some successful antiviral drugs might prevent intact virus particles from being made and infecting other cells.Inside the cell, the virus needs to evade the innate immune response and fight for the cell’s resources. But, in many ways, this is where the remarkable capability of the virus to wreak havoc comes into full play. Apart from the spike protein, there are at least two dozen other viral proteins encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome.Proteins are both building blocks and molecular engines that speed up living processes. They are made according to specific instructions in the genetic material. Different proteins do different jobs.The virus does not possess the ability to make its own proteins and so it must take over the cell’s protein-making machines, known as ribosomes. Ribosome read instructions in RNA to make proteins.Once viral RNA is inside the cell, it must compete with the cell’s own mRNA. In many ways, viral RNA looks a lot like cellular mRNA, so ribosomes are fooled into making some viral proteins. But the virus needs to ensure that it has preferential access to ribosomes, otherwise it will not be able to increase to massive numbers needed to spread rapidly.Here’s an analogy for how the coronavirus takes over a cell it has infected. If we think of the cell as hardware and viral RNA as malicious software, gaining entry to the inside of the cell is just the first step. The software must subvert the functioning system so that its instructions are preferentially followed.We know that the virus prevents ribosomes from making the cell’s own proteins, including tools of the immune system, and, instead, instructs it to make virus parts. How SARS-CoV-2 achieves this has been a mystery until recently.One of the first viral proteins that is made is called nonstructural protein-1 (NSP1). It is an important weapon in the viral arsenal. Last year, multiple groups showed that NSP1 gums up the channel which is used to read the cell’s own instructions. In addition, immediately after NSP1 is made, it starts to slow down ribosomes, so the cell can’t make proteins needed to minimise viral infection.But shutting down ribosomes completely would be problematic for the virus since it needs its own RNA to be made into viral proteins. The virus might drain the cell’s resources, but also needs to use what is left of the same resources to make proteins for new viruses.A paper published in Nature on May 12 by Noam Stern-Ginossar and colleagues shows that the coronavirus destroys the cell’s mRNA and prevents newly created mRNA from getting to parts of the cell where it can be read to make new proteins. By blocking its competition, viral proteins are freeing up ribosomes inside cells for its own proteins to be made.Last week in research published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Peter Cresswell and other researchers showed that another protein NSP14 also helps shut down immune responses inside the cell by interfering with ribosomes.Using our hacking analogy, the nefarious coronavirus has not one but many kinds of malware that slow down the cellular computer. It shuts down normal programmes, freeing up what’s left of the processor to execute its own instructions to make more viruses.These new results show why the coronavirus initially gets an upper hand after it infects cells. But this doesn’t mean that it is infallible. The virus also has an Achilles’ heel. While viral proteins are being made, the ribosome slips in reading the viral message by a letter. This slip is known as a frameshift, and it is necessary for the RNA to be “read” properly as coronavirus proteins are made.A paper published in Science on May 13 by Nenad Ban’s team describes the process of frameshifting with coronavirus RNA in detail. It also shows that antiviral drugs can disrupt this slip. Research is ongoing to exploit this weakness to prevent the coronavirus from hacking the protein-making machinery of cells. Other drugs might target NSP1 and NSP14 and serve as a firewall against these pesky proteins.Anirban Mahapatra, a microbiologist by training, is the author of COVID-19: Separating Fact From Fiction The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/scientifically-speaking-knowing-how-coronavirus-hacks-cells-will-help-stop-it-101624427382796.html
