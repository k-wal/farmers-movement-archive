On Wednesday, Shivajinagar reported a maximum temperature of 31.7 degrees Celsius, 2.8 degrees warmer than normal, as per the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The minimum temperature recorded was 22.3 degrees Celsius, 0.3 degrees cooler than normal as per IMD.Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting at IMD Pune said that the monsoon is not active over Pune and Maharashtra.“Also, moisture level and cloud cover has reduced. As a result, IMD is issuing forecasts for very light or light rainfall. Because of all these factors, natural insulation has increased. And the heat load has increased resulting in warmer days. Over Maharashtra, there is some moisture due to the westerlies, but not much. Such weather may continue in the coming days as well,” said Kashyapi. Across Maharashtra, the highest maximum temperature reported on Wednesday was 37.3 degrees Celsius at Akola, and the lowest minimum temperature reported was 17.5 degrees Celsius at Mahabaleshwar.IMD officials said that the Southwest monsoon has not made any progress since June 19. It is likely to get active by July 7 in most parts of the country, including Maharashtra.“Since June 19, there has not been any progress of the monsoon. It was due to impact mid-latitude westerly winds and absence of formation of low pressure system over North Bay of Bengal,” said IMD officials. Flu season upon us: docDoctors suggest that the seasonal flu may be about due to this temperature difference. Dr Sai Waghmare said, “There is a sharp change in day and night temperatures. Many suffer from seasonal flu and fever. Patients of asthma and joint pains can suffer more than others due to the cloudy weather. A good way to keep oneself away from these seasonal infections is to keep immunity up,” said Dr Waghmare.She added that a wholesome diet along with regular dedicated exercise can keep infection at bay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/max-temp-in-pune-2-deg-warmer-than-normal-as-monsoon-on-a-break-101625077642103.html

The HC said it was concerned by the issue of dumping of garbage in the sea which is affecting marine life and wanted the Centre and state government to take note of the same and submit a proposal to clean up the coastline in Maharashtra. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing PILs pertaining to Covid-19 management in Maharashtra, noted that in recent days it had read news reports of the coastline being strewn with garbage, especially after Cyclone Tauktae and the photographs indicated that the situation was grim. While addressing additional solicitor general Anil Singh for the Centre and advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni for the state, the bench said, “Over and above the problems faced by the coastline, a larger problem lies in danger to marine life due to dumping of filth. We are considering whether to initiate suo motu PIL on this. We have prepared a short list of all such reports which we will give to you.”Kumbhakoni requested the bench to defer its decision by a day and said he required time to go through the list of the news reports and consult with officials concerned. The bench then said, “The reason why we want to deal with the problem right now is that it is happening in monsoon, we cannot defer it for long. The problem is quite serious which needs to be taken care of as even Marine Drive was seen strewn with filth thrown up by the sea.”Seeking responses from Centre and state lawyers, the bench said that it would consider the initiation of suo motu PIL on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-asks-centre-state-to-address-issue-of-garbage-on-coastline-101625077282002.html
30-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: PG medical students with higher education prospects stuck due to delay in exam||For 25-year-old Sandhya Soni (name changed), her joy knew no bounds when she cleared the all-important entrance exam to bag a seat in the super speciality Master’s course in paediatric surgery at the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS), Delhi. However, now her fear is that she might lose the seat as the last date to submit their final-year postgraduate (PG) medical exam certificate is July 31, but the exams in Maharashtra is scheduled to take place in August.“Our final-year PG medical exam is scheduled to begin on August 16, but the final date to submit all certificates to AIIMS is July 31, which is impossible for us. We have approached the authorities at AIIMS, but have not heard from them yet,” said Soni, who along with another student from Grant Medical College are the only two students from Maharashtra to have cleared the entrance exam this year. “This is a super speciality course and the fact that we have been allotted a seat itself is a big deal. Missing out on the admission for no fault of ours will be unfair,” she added.Originally scheduled to take place in May, PG final-year exams were postponed by a month based on a circular by the National Medical Commission (NMC) in order to ensure all students are working across hospitals, as the country was in the midst of the peak of the second wave of Covid-19.On Tuesday, representatives of the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) approached the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) as well as AIIMS Delhi, requesting then to consider this matter. “PG final-year exams were postponed due to rising Covid cases, and therefore all hospitals needed their residents to work throughout the past two months. These students managed to ace their Master of Chirurgiae (MCh) entrance exam despite working seven days a week, which is commendable. Authorities at AIIMS must consider giving a one-time only extension to these candidates,” said Dr Pranav Jadhav, vice-president, central MARD.The letter has also been addressed to the Union health minister and Federation of Resident Doctors Association (FORDA). They have also requested MUHS to intervene in this matter and approach AIIMS directly. “We have received the request from students and will be writing to admission authorities at AIIMS,” said an official from MUHS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtrapg-medical-students-with-higher-education-prospects-stuck-due-to-delay-in-exam-101625077222760.html
30-06-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC dismisses PIL against tree cutting for coastal road project||The Bombay high court (HC) paved the way for continuation of the work on the interchange at Tata Gardens in South Mumbai in the ₹12,000-crore coastal road project by dismissing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by an NGO which had secured a stay from HC on May 20 against the January 6 order of the tree authority which had permitted cutting and transplanting of 140 trees. The PIL was dismissed after the NGO submitted that it did not have ₹60 crore to deposit in the court towards the security deposit decided by the judges based on the stipulation of Rule 7A of the Bombay High Court Public Interest Litigation Rules. Rule 7A stipulates that a petitioner has to make a security deposit of the amount decided by the judges if the PIL is to be heard on merits. On Wednesday the judges asked the NGO to deposit 0.5% of the total cost of the project as security deposit.The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the PIL filed by Society of Improvement of Greenery, was informed by advocate Ankit Kulkarni that the January 6 decision of the tree authority was not proper as the decision was taken without considering the views of experts. Kulkarni submitted that no study was conducted while passing the order of felling 61 trees and transplanting 79 trees. He added that the tree authority did not even take into consideration the survival rate of trees which had been transplanted for the Metro project, and hence the decision would result in most of the trees not surviving. In view of this, the NGO challenged the January 6 order of the TA. However, senior advocate Aspi Chinoy and advocate Joel Carlos for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which is responsible for the coastal road project, opposed the objections and said that the tree authority had not only uploaded the order on January 19 on its website but had also conducted a public hearing, but the NGO had not raised any objection then. Chinoy added that the NGO had not pursued the issue and woke up to it during the vacation and had secured a stay on the order on May 21, as a result of which work on the interchange had come to a halt, causing huge losses to the civic authority. In light of these submissions, BMC sought dismissal of the PIL. After hearing the submissions, the court sought to know from the NGO as to why it had come to court belatedly though its PIL was filed in March 2020. Kulkarni informed the bench that praecipes had moved for urgent hearing from time to time and the PIL got listed as well, but could not be heard due to paucity of time. The bench, however, was not satisfied and the chief justice observed that all praecipes were allowed and matters were listed, however he had not heard any request for urgent hearing of the PIL, hence he was putting the NGO to terms and sought to know whether it was willing to deposit an amount as stipulated in Rule 7A of PIL rules. “We will hear the PIL on merits only after you deposit the amount or else we will dismiss it,” the bench said. When Kulkarni responded that the members of the NGO were a mix of people who walked in Tata Garden and could not afford to deposit the amount, the court dismissed the PIL. The bench also clarified that in light of the dismissal, the May 21 stay was vacated and work on felling and transplanting of trees could continue as per the tree authority order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-dismisses-pil-against-tree-cutting-for-coastal-road-project-101625077222030.html
30-06-2021||Mumbai||Naseeruddin Shah and Dilip Kumar hospitalised, stable||Two veteran Bollywood actors — Dilip Kumar and Naseeruddin Shah — are undergoing treatment at Hinduja Hospital, Khar. Both were in stable condition, according to their doctors. Shah was rushed to the hospital on Monday with complaints of chest pain. Sources from the hospital said he has a minor blockage in his heart. Doctors will conduct an angiography — a type of X-ray used to check blood vessels — on him Thursday. A decision on whether he will require an angioplasty, a procedure to open blocked coronary arteries caused by coronary artery disease, will be taken then.“Once the angiography is done, we will be able to understand his health condition further,” said a doctor, who is part of a medical team providing him treatment. Dilip Kumar was taken to the hospital on Tuesday night for the second time in a month after he complained of breathlessness. Like earlier, doctors treated Kumar for water accumulation in his lungs. In the beginning of June, the 98-year-old actor was diagnosed with bilateral pleural effusion, which is build-up of excess fluid between the layers of the pleura outside lungs. “We have pumped out the water from his lungs. He is fine now but kept in the intensive care unit (ICU) for observation,” said a doctor from the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/naseeruddin-shah-and-dilip-kumar-hospitalised-stable-101625077162716.html
30-06-2021||Mumbai||9-year-old is Mumbai’s first leptospirosis death this monsoon||A nine-year-old girl from LT Marg Chowk succumbed to suspected leptospirosis infection on June 25 at Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital, also known as Sion hospital. This is the city’s first fatality suspected to be related to leptospirosis this monsoon. The girl was rushed to Sion hospital on June 24 with complaints of vomiting, abdominal pain and high fever. Within 24 hours, she succumbed at the hospital. According to data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), till June 20, a total of eight cases of leptospirosis have been reported in the city, higher than the past two years in the same month. Last year in June, only one leptospirosis case was reported and in the year before, five. This year, till June 20, a total 52 leptospirosis cases have been reported. Leptospirosis is a common infection during the monsoon. Caused by a form of bacteria called spirochete, leptospirosis occurs when humans come in direct contact with urine from infected animals, especially rodents, or through water, soil or food contaminated with infected urine in settings of poor sanitation habits. Areas that are prone to flooding and waterlogging during monsoon become the source of infection. As per the nine-year-old’s treating doctor at the hospital, she had been showing symptoms of leptospirosis for three-four days but by the time she was admitted to the hospital, her health had deteriorated. “With leptospirosis, her cause of death also includes massive pulmonary bleed (MPB), which means bleeding in lungs. She also had acute respiratory distress. Her condition deteriorated within a few hours of admission,” said the doctor. With the advancement of the monsoon in parts of Maharashtra, Mumbai recorded heavy rainfall in the first week of June. According to doctors at the hospital, the nine-year-old got exposed to the infection when she travelled outside in the rain in areas with waterlogging. The girl’s case papers have been sent to the death review committee of epidemiology cell, BMC, for investigation. On January 21, the hospital registered its first death related to leptospirosis of the year when an eight-year-old girl died. “Recently, the city has witnessed heavy rain and with the relaxation of the lockdown, many people are travelling outside which might have contributed to the rise of leptospirosis cases,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. In the second week of June, after heavy rain, BMC issued an advisory asking people to be cautious if they have walked through contaminated water during monsoon or after heavy rain. Citizens have been requested to take prophylactic treatment for leptospirosis within 72 hours of getting exposed to rain. “All private practitioners are hereby requested to start doxycycline course for all fever patients during monsoon season. Early treatment with doxycycline prevents organ involvement and other complications thereby preventing deaths due to leptospirosis,” said Kakani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/9yearold-is-mumbai-s-1st-leptospirosis-death-this-monsoon-101625077101982.html
30-06-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC upholds January 2020 tariff plan by TRAI, allows inclusion of premium channels in bouquet||The Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday upheld the Constitutional validity of the new tariff order (NTO) announced by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) in January 2020, giving a setback to broadcasters who had challenged the NTO on the grounds that it was arbitrary. The court, however, struck down the NTO condition which restrained broadcasters from including premium channels — rates of which exceeded three times the rate of the average channels — being offered in the bouquet and held that it was unconstitutional. TRAI said it would continue its August 2020 statement of no coercive action against non-compliance by broadcasters for another six weeks. The division bench headed by justice AA Sayed, which had heard and reserved its judgement on the petitions by various broadcasters on October 20, 2020, while pronouncing the judgement on Wednesday said the petitions challenging the 2020 regulation and tariff order by TRAI had failed, barring the challenge regarding inclusion of premium channels, rates of which are more than three times the cost of an average channel, in the bouquet. The petitions filed by Film and Television Producers Guild of India, Indian Broadcasting Foundation and TV broadcasters including Sony Pictures, Zee Entertainment, Star India, Disney, TV18, Asianet Communications among others before the HC last year had challenged the new tariff rules as well as conditions to be complied with while offering the bouquet of channels announced by TRAI in January 2020. The petitions had contended that as per the new amended tariff order (NTO 2.0), which reduced the channel prices from ₹19 to ₹12 and permitted broadcaster to offer only those channels which had maximum retail price of ₹12 or less in bouquet, was unconstitutional and arbitrary and hence should be set aside. NTO 2.0 had amended the 2017 tariff order pertaining to fixing and limiting prices of channels offered by various broadcasters and included new conditions in the interest of viewers. The petitions also claimed the reduction in the Network Capacity Fee (NCF), which was brought down to ₹130 by TRAI, as unreasonable. On Wednesday, the bench, while granting partial relief to broadcasters, set aside their other prayers including challenging constitutional validity of section 11 of TRAI Act, which enumerates functions and authority of the telecom regulator over broadcasters. After the order was pronounced, the broadcasters who challenged the TRAI decision sought a stay on implementation of the judgement so that they could approach the Supreme Court, which the bench allowed. Detailed judgement is expected to be uploaded on the HC website in due course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-upholds-january-2020-tariff-plan-by-trai-allows-inclusion-of-premium-channels-in-bouquet-101625077042029.html
30-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai sees highest June rainfall in six years||The city has received a total of 967.7mm rain in June so far, making it the highest rainfall received during the month in six years. It also marks a 90% departure from the monthly normal rainfall of 505mm. Data available with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) shows that 706mm of rain was recorded in the first 12 days of the month alone.The heaviest showers in June occurred on June 9 when the city saw 220.6mm or 44% of the monthly normal rain in just nine hours. This marked an early onset of the monsoon two days prior to the official onset date of June 11. The presence of a low-pressure area in the Bay of Bengal around that time along with a cyclonic circulation in the Arabian Sea intensified showers along the entire Konkan coast with intense westerly winds gusting at between 50kmph and 60kmph.However, there has been a sharp decline in the intensity of rains since then, with the southwest monsoon being in a subdued phase which, IMD officials say, is likely to continue for another week. “Models suggest monsoon entering into a break spell from June 29. Heavy rains to be confined mainly over northeast India at least till July 5 with suppressed rainfall over rest of India. Active break spells are part of monsoon dynamics and decide quantum of seasonal rainfall,” ministry of earth sciences secretary M Rajeevan had tweeted earlier this week. Speaking to HT on Wednesday, Rajeevan said models show a sign of monsoon revival sometime around July 7.The Monsoon Intraseasonal Oscillation and Madden-Julian Oscillation were not active over India, thereby suppressing rainfall. After June 12, there were no large scale weather features to support continued effects of monsoon. Cross-equatorial flows remained weak, there was an absence of convection over the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal, and strong mid-latitude westerly winds — all of these played a part in weakening monsoon.Mumbai had recorded just over 340mm rain in June 2020, 515.1mm in June 2019, 792.5mm in 2018, 523.2mm in 2017, 695.2mm in 2016, and 1,106.7mm in 2015, shows IMD data. During June 2014, Mumbai witnessed its lowest June rainfall in 10 years at 87.3mm while the second lowest was in June 2012 at 298.5mm. The all-time lowest June rainfall was in 1972 at 0.2mm followed by 1995 at 82.2mm.In June this year, Mumbai is among five Maharashtra districts that has seen ‘large excess’ rainfall, which is over 60% of the seasonal normal. Another 16 districts in Vidarbha, Konkan, and Madhya Maharashtra saw ‘excess’ rainfall with 20% to 59% of the seasonal normal; while 11 districts, largely in Madhya Maharashta, and a few in Vidarbha, saw normal rainfall. Konkan and Goa meteorological sub-division received ‘excess’ rain at 41% over normal.Three districts — Nandurbar, Akola and Dhule — saw deficient rains ranging between -30% to -51% of the normal amount for June. However, the entire state has received ‘excess’ rainfall which is 31% above the state’s normal of 207.6mm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-sees-highest-june-rainfall-in-six-years-101625076921995.html

Earlier, the district administration would attach and seal properties of defaulters but do not have the powers to auction them off. “We have attached the flats, villas and plots following orders from the UP-Rera. We have written to the UP government for appropriate decision on e-auction because we do not have the authority,” said Suhas LY district magistrate Gautam Budh Nagar. “In many previous cases too (in which the district had attached assets of defaulters) we had written to the state government (to auction them off) but are yet to receive their decision.”The assets, the district administration detailed, were 162 flats, six plots, five commercial spaces and 28 villas.The UP RERA has also written to the UP government to expedite the process in this regard.“We are regularly communicating this matter to the state government. And as per the recent communication a decision on paving the way for the e-auction is likely to happen soon. It will be a great help as we will be able to address homebuyers’ issues,” said Balvinder Kumar, member, UP-Rera.“We have been hearing for a long time that an e-auction will take place, but nothing has happened due to negligence on the part of the government.

There are at least 13 such defaulters who have projects in the said area, said officials.“The Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority’s decision to give more time only after depositing 10% of total land dues will benefit the developers and also impact positively the homebuyers because the realty project will become eligible for additional funding. The developers desperately need hand holding by the government so that they can arrange last mile funding, finish a stuck project and deliver to buyers,” said RK Arora chairman of Supertech Limited and president of Uttar Pradesh national real estate development council. “This option will lapse after August 31. If they want to get the scheduled of the payment of their respective land dues redone then they need to deposit 10%, after which they will get additional time to repay the defaulted amount,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer (CEO) of the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida).The Yeida had allotted land to these developers in 2010 on the condition that they would finish these projects in 10 years and repay the entire land cost within that time. The allotment had been done on an instalment basis after accepting 10% of the total land cost as token fee. The remaining 90% was to be paid over 10 years. The authority needs to recover around R4,000 crore from these builders. In June 2019, the Yeida had given five years more to finish the projects. However, citing dip in sales they defaulted on payments while the projects remain unfinished, said officials. Earlier the developers were initially supposed to pay 15% out of the total land dues to get additional time for repayment.Seven out of 13 builders are developing townships while six are constructing group housing projects. At least 30,000 homebuyers have invested money in these projects. “Once they pay 10% of total land dues, they will come out of the defaulter category and become eligible for additional loan from banks to finish their projects. If they manage to do so, it will benefit buyers as the realtor will be in a position to finish and deliver the units,” said Singh.“The Yeida’s decision to give more time after depositing 10% of total land dues will benefit developers and also impact buyers positively as stuck projects will become eligible for additional funding. The developers desperately need the government’s support so that they can arrange last mile funding, finish stuck projects and deliver units to buyers,” said RK Arora, chairman of Supertech Limited and president of the Uttar Pradesh National Real Estate Development Council.

30-06-2021||Noida||Heat wave continues in Noida, respite likely by weekend||Noida recorded its second consecutive heat wave on Wednesday aided by hot, westerly winds coupled with a delay in the arrival of the southwest monsoon to the National Capital Region (NCR).Weather analysts predicted another heat wave on Thursday, with a some respite over the weekend.A heat wave occurs when the maximum temperature is at least 45°C and above, or is over 40°C and at the same time above 5°C of the season’s average. According to the India Meteorological Department, Noida’s maximum temperature for Wednesday was 43 degrees Celsius (°C), which was 6°C above average and the same as Tuesday. The minium temperature was 30°C on Wednesday, while it was 28.8°C on Tuesday.The city had suffered its first heat wave on March 29 when the temperature was 40.5°C, which was 7°C above the seasonal average and also the first heat wave to be realised in March in 76 years.At the Safdarjung monitoring station, considered average for the NCR, the maximum and minimum temperatures were recorded at 43.5°C and 28.2°C, respectively.“The heat wave will continue on Thursday as well, primarily due to very dry weather and warm westerly winds from Rajasthan. There are chances of slight respite due to formation of convective clouds that may lead to some drizzle on Friday and Saturday, as slight change in wind directions from westerly to north-westerly winds may bring in some moisture from central Pakistan. However, soon after July 4, the mercury will rise and though there will not be heat waves, the condition will still be warm as mercury is likely to hover around 40°C,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet.He added that there are few chances that the southwest monsoon will advance before July 8.“There are chances that the south-west monsoon, which is currently stuck in the foothills of Himalayas, will advance further from the foothills of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh only after or around July 8,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/heat-wave-continues-in-noida-respite-likely-by-weekend-101625076081968.html
30-06-2021||Noida||BJP workers, farmers clash at UP Gate site||A group of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers and farmers protesting the Centre’s three farm laws allegedly clashed at UP Gate on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway (DME) in Ghaziabad on Wednesday afternoon after the workers gathered there to welcome a party official.Both groups lodged a police complaint against each other. While the BJP claimed that many people were injured and vehicles damaged in the incident, the farmers said they had protested peacefully and that it was the BJP that attacked them.Police said they were not informed of the BJP workers’ intention of gathering there.“They (BJP workers) were on one side of the DME (the Delhi to Ghaziabad carriageway), while the farmers were on the other. As soon as we came to know that the BJP workers had gathered there, we rushed a team there,” said Gyanendra Kumar Singh, superintendent of police (city 2). “We have received complaints from both sides and are investigating them.”The BJP workers had gathered to welcome Amit Valmiki, the party’s new secretary who was arriving from Delhi.“There were about 300-400 of us, including 20-25 women... We were peacefully standing there when suddenly, hundreds of them (farmers) jumped the central verge and attacked us,” said Sanjeev Sharma, city president of the BJP’s Ghaziabad unit.He said several party workers, including women, were injured and about 30-40 vehicles damaged.“Later, we met the district magistrate and senior superintendent of police and submitted a police complaint,” Sharma said.Priti Chandra, member of the party’s women’s wing said, “One of our workers suffered a fracture to her leg while several other women suffered minor injuries. While we boarded our cars to get away, the farmers banged our cars with sticks and swords.”The farmer leaders insisted the “attack” was a conspiracy to malign their peaceful protest, which had been ongoing since November 28, 2020 from the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway.“It is BJP’s new conspiracy to malign the farmers’ movement. They came on the pretext of welcoming their leader and damaged their own cars. We have given our complaint to the police,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, UP Gate site spokesperson from ‘Samyukta Kisan Morcha.’He said that BJP workers came near their camp and started waiving their party flags. “Upon this, our farmers pulled out black flags and started waiving it at them,” Bajwa said.Rakesh Tikait, the national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), backed the conspiracy theory.“They (BJP) were trying to instigate farmers on pretext of welcoming their leader. They said farmers were trying to oppose their leader who is from Valmiki community. This agitation is not against any community, and we have members of every community who are part of the protest,” Tikait said.Amit Valmiki eventually did arrive in Ghaziabad, said BJP’s Sharma.Last year, the Parliament had passed three laws: The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, Farm Services Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. While the government said these laws would be beneficial to the agriculture sector, farmers say that they would severely affect their livelihood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/bjp-workers-farmers-clash-at-up-gate-site-101625076023700.html

Aman and the fourth suspect, whose identity has been kept confidential, are still on the run, said police. Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said, “There was resentment in Kiran’s family as they believed her marriage with Vinay, who belonged to the same gotra (lineage), earned them a bad reputation in their community. They considered that the couple’s decision ruined their honour and pride in the village,” During interrogations, the DCP said, the suspects revealed Aman hatched the conspiracy to kill his sister and her husband. He included his cousin and two friends in the plan. A day before the attack, Aman did a recce of the couple’s rented accommodation at Amberhai village.On June 24, the four arranged weapons and reached the village in two vehicles. They did not find the couple at home but found their flat’s main door latched from outside. Aman, Rohit and Ritik went inside the flat and asked their friend to latch the door from outside and wait outside the building.Around 8.30pm, as the couple opened the door, the three men fired at them. Though the two sustained bullet injuries, they tried to escape. While Kiran ran towards the terrace, Vinay rushed outside, with his attackers chasing him. On reaching the terrace, Kiran screamed for help as she saw Vinay being chased down the lane by the attackers. The suspects chased Vinay for nearly 20m and shot him dead outside a boutique shop nearby. Kiran scaled the terrace’s iron railing and crossed over to the adjacent building. She climbed down the building and kept screaming for help. A resident of the building informed police, who arrived and rushed the couple to two separate hospitals. While Vinay was declared dead on arrival, Kiran was given medical attention for the gunshot injuries sustained in the attack. In her statement to the police, Kiran identified the three attackers as her brother, cousin and a distant relative, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dwarka-couple-hate-crime-2-arrested-hunt-on-for-woman-s-brother-101625076022561.html

This is part of the district administration’s mega vaccination drive starting July 1, wherein they plan to issue 25,000 jabs per day.However, the current target of 10,000 has been set as per the availability of the vaccines, said officials. Going by official data, the proposed session load for July 1 is 7,700 Covishield and 2,800 Covaxin doses, making the target to vaccinate 10,500 beneficiaries on Thursday.“The 2,800 Covaxin vaccines will only be given to those looking for their second dose, at seven government Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) in the district. We have set a realistic target as per the availability of doses and will be able to achieve the same on Thursday,” said district chief medical officer (CMO), Dr Deepak Ohri.According to Dr Neeraj Tyagi, the district’s immunisation officer, a total of 38 government CVCs will carry out vaccinations on Thursday.“Of the 7,700 Covishield vaccines to be administered, 4,700 are for the 18-45 category. Besides, 200 are for the first dose and 2,600 are for the second dose of the 45+ population, while 200 doses are reserved for Women’s Special CVCs,” said Dr Tyagi.Earlier, the health department had suspended administration of Covishield on Tuesday and only Covaxin vaccine was administered. Later, all vaccinations were suspended for Wednesday as well. The decision to cancel all vaccinations, including Covishield and Covaxin, was taken due to “unavoidable” reasons, a statement from the district health department had said.As a result, no vaccinations took place at government CVCs on Wednesday while only 720 doses of Covaxin (second dose) were administered in the district on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-plans-over-10-000-covid-vaccinations-on-thursday-101625075545702.html
30-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt schools to hold parent teacher meetings from July 19 to better aid online learning||To help parents aid their children better during the continued online learning this academic session, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday announced that public schools will hold a two-week special parent-teacher meetings (PTMs), beginning July 19. Between July 19 and 31, parents would be invited to visit the school and interact with teachers for a better understanding of their role in supporting children during the pandemic. “Covid-19 has impacted schooling adversely and we are unsure of when schools will reopen. Since online learning has increased the role of parents in their child’s education, the education department has decided to conduct special PTMs for parents of all students of Delhi government schools,” he said.Rakesh Semalty, head of a government school in West Jyoti Nagar, said, “Some of the schools are doubling up as vaccination or dry ration distribution centres. So we will have to finalise the meeting slots in such a way that there is no overcrowding. Coordination between teachers, students, and parents is a must. Last year, too, our teachers interacted with parents and counselled them to be more attentive towards children and to also allow them more access to electronic devices at home.”According to a government statement, these PTMs “will be a space for parents to understand how to provide regular learning support” to children. Schools in the national capital have been closed since March last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic and learning has moved online. While schools had reopened to senior students briefly between January and February this year, they had to be shut again as the second wave of Covid-19 swept through the country in March-April.Last week, the government also announced the commencement of the academic session for public schools along with a three-phase initiative to allow a smoother transition for students returning to classes after a difficult period. From March to May, Delhi saw over 13,000 Covid-19 deaths over 786,000 infections. Its effect, teachers said, is also visible in children with many of them having lost a loved one to the viral infection or having at least one case of Covid in their families.While Delhi government school teachers will be responsible for parent-teacher meetings, municipal school teachers, who will also join the meetings, will counsel parents of students who have just started class 6. Every year, around 170,000 students move from municipal schools -- they offer education only up to Class 5 -- to Delhi government schools in class 6.“PTMs for students of class 6 will be conducted jointly by MCD school teachers and government school teachers. This decision has been taken to ease the transition of students from MCD to the government’s directorate of education schools in class 6 and ensure that children receive adequate emotional and learning support in the new environment,” he said.Keeping Covid-19 regulations in mind, these PTMs will be done in small groups with school officials ensuring covid-appropriate behaviour. Parents of students in DoE schools will be informed of their slot through SMS or WhatsApp.Balwan Singh, a primary school teacher at a municipal corporation school in Narela, said, “We have contacts of parents and are familiar with both students and parents. So the move will help. But the main challenge will be to track students who have completely fallen off the grid and have not even taken admission in class 6.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-schools-to-hold-parent-teacher-meetings-from-july-19-to-better-aid-online-learning-101625075545144.html

However, since last week, the footfall has increased manifold, with no room left for social distancing to be followed. From 5.30pm to around 8.30pm, the market remains packed,” said Jha.“Due to the overcrowding not just by shoppers but also by illegal roadside vendors, we fear that the district administration may issue orders to shut our shops again, just like the authorities ordered shutdown of Laxmi Nagar market in Delhi,” he said.In an order issued on Tuesday, the district administration in East Delhi said, “Market shopkeepers, vendors and general public in main bazaar Laxmi Nagar are not following the Covid-appropriate behaviour. ...Main bazaar Laxmi Nagar, from Vikas Marg to Lovely Public School, Kishankunj, and its surrounding markets are hereby restricted to open with effect from 10pm on June 29 till 10pm on July 5, or further orders, whichever is earlier.” Akhilesh Jha, a garment seller at the Atta market, said that the crowding does not mean that the sales are increasing. “While the crowd may have increased, our sales have not. During the day, there is hardly any customer due to the heat. By evening, the footfall increases, but there are only a few genuine customers and others are window shoppers. One person comes with four other people to buy something,” he said.SK Gupta, president of Rehri Patri Sanchalak Welfare Association, said that there are only 20 registered roadside vendors at the market. “There are around 300 illegal roadside vendors at the Atta market. The presence of these illegal vendors leads to overcrowding in the market,” said Gupta. According to GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY, the administration will hold dialogues with the representatives of market associations to chalk out a solution to the problem.“Currently imposing a shutdown of the market for Covid violations is not on the cards as we have to keep in mind the daily income of the traders too. However, we will hold discussions with the market associations to chalk out a way so that social distancing can be followed even as markets remain open,” said Suhas.Meanwhile, the GB Nagar police carried out a drive at the Atta market on Wednesday evening to ensure Covid protocols are followed in the area. As many as 50 people were fined at the market for either not wearing a mask or not using it properly, said Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, GB Nagar. “We used the public addressal system (loudspeaker) to create awareness among the shoppers to maintain social distancing and wear their face masks properly. Action was also taken against those who were found violating Covid norms. We have warned the illegal roadside vendors at the market to vacate the space as they are the ones leading to crowding in the area. We will soon plan an anti-encroachment drive here,” said Singh.Medical experts said that the violation of Covid protocols by the public is like an invitation to the third wave of the pandemic. “If people fail to follow Covid protocols, we are not away from the day when the third Covid wave will hit us. People should avoid stepping out and only go out if necessary. Even if one infected person visits such a crowded market, it may turn into a super spreader,” said Dr NK Sharma, president of Indian Medical Association (Noida chapter).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/crowding-at-noida-s-atta-market-worries-traders-as-covid-norms-violated-101625075302636.html

Now, the work has begun statewide to improve them, make them well equipped and have their own oxygen generation plants. The government even asked all the MPs/MLAs, ministers, public representatives (such as mayors and corporators) to adopt CHCs and PHCs and pump in their development funds into this oft-neglected first line of health centres in the state. There are a total 3,011 PHCs and 855 CHCs in the state. Even in their present ramshackle state, many of these centres were turned into Level-1 Covid hospitals (CHCs) and Covid vaccination centres (both CHCs and PHCs) and served people in quite an unsung manner. The doctors there worked long hours unnoticed in these CHCs and PHCs. They served the poor with Covid screening or other ailments. On Doctors’ Day, HT takes a look at some of the doctors who tried to make a difference in these trying times.Scripting a turnaround Dr Ashwani Chaurasiya, 38, resorted to multi-tasking at the Bhathat CHC in Gorakhpur and played a pivotal role in upscaling it. He took over as in-charge of the CHC in June 2019 much before the Covid pandemic set in. At that time, people shied away from CHC located 25 km east of Gorakhpur as it lacked facilities and services, doctors and para-medical staff. These days, the Bhathat CHC is the most preferred destination of the patients residing in the rural areas of the district. Around 500 to 600 patients visit the OPD daily at the CHC that now has a battery of doctors and para medical staff. It also has an emergency ward. “When the first wave of pandemic hit the country in March, 2020, the CHC worked as referral centre. The sample of the suspected Covid patients were tested at the Covid helpdesk set up in the health centre. The positive patients were sent to the level one facilities by the ambulance,” said Dr Chaurasiya. When OPD services resumed at CHC after the first wave, the health centre became even more busy,” he said. Now when the Covid immunisation drive is on, the centre has become a major vaccination centre and overshot the target set for it by the district administration. Tending to migrants Then there is the Khandoli CHC in Agra and Dr Upendra Kumar there. In the first wave of Covid in 2020, the UP government turned this CHC into an L-1 category hospital. Dr Upendra Kumar had since been working long hours and without caring for weekly off and leaves. The CHC and Upendra attended to a lot of migrant workers, who were rushing back in panic during the lockdown last year. “It was an added responsibility, but we cherished the trust exhibited in selecting our CHC as L-1 facility in pandemic times. We had 53 admissions at CHC and all were discharged, barring 10 cases which were referred to SN Medical College,” said Dr Upendra Kumar. “Kuberpur, the village where Agra-Noida Expressway ends, was within limits of our CHC and thus we had an important task of testing and treating the migrant labourers coming from the NCR (National Capital Region). We organised camps and thermal-screened these labourers. We had limited staff and thus working hours extended to 14 hours on average in a day,” says Dr Kumar, 41. The CHC screened over 4,000 migrant workers and provided them treatment before sending them off to their home districts. “We had made three rapid response teams (RRTs) for Covid and even went to cold storages to screen labourers there,” he said. Agra is part of UP’s potato belt. “Among the migrants who we screened, about 1,600 were from Jammu and Kashmir,” he says. Dr Kumar says his CHC is bracing up for the possible third wave of the pandemic. He is happy that the local MLA has adopted it for improving the centre. “The MLA Ram Pratap Singh Chauhan has adopted it. Now, we have a 10-bed pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and an oxygen plant is also coming up on our CHC premises,” added Dr Kumar. Working without weekly off-days Dr Ram Gopal Verma and his CHC in the eastern UP’s Prayagraj attended to patients in a similar manner. Dr Verma, a 42-year-old Provincial Medical Services (PMS) doctor, has spent sleepless nights since April 2020 and worked without taking weekly off-days. “Barring 15 days in September 2020 when I myself tested positive for Covid-19 and had to remain in home isolation till I recovered, I worked at the CHC every day and many nights. And during the intense phases of the pandemic, I stayed in the small quarter allotted to me on the campus instead of going home to my wife and kids at my residence in Kaladipuram locality in the city,” he said. He is in-charge of the Mauaima CHC located around 35km from Prayagraj’s trans-Ganga area. The onus of catering to the medical needs of a large chunk of the population, including the Mauaima village comprising 18-odd hamlets with a combined population of around 25,000, lies on his shoulders. Amidst the pandemic, his task of personally seeing the patients, ensuring fellow doctors and staff attend to the needy coming to the CHC and managing the CHC has changed dramatically. “Now I am also overseeing proper receipt of Covid-19 vaccines and their administration, availability of medicines etc, identifying suspected corona cases and overseeing their treatment through home visits as well as distribution of medical kits etc among the needy, besides handling emergency cases like deliveries which are attended to 24x7. The big task is also to meet villagers, allay their fears and convince them to take the jab,” said a smiling Dr Verma, a qualified paediatrician and a pass-out of the prestigious King George’s Medical University (KGMU), Lucknow. Then there are online meetings with officials, besides face-to-face review meetings that require travel to the district headquarters. Dr Verma, who joined PMS in 2006, has stayed modest about his work and challenges. “All my colleagues are doing the same thing,” he said. The health centre was originally a PHC till recently and upgraded to the CHC status. With the infrastructure and manpower of a PHC, Dr Verma and the hospital worked as CHC. He also has been visiting 6 to 10 homes each day in nearby villages to see Covid-19 positive cases in home isolation in both first and the deadlier second wave of the pandemic. Reaching out to far-flung area In Sonbhadra, a backward district in eastern UP, Dr Shishir Srivastava, 36, medical officer-in-charge of Myorpur CHC, did extensive work in this far-flung area during Covid-19’s second wave. Dr Srivastava’s CHC is around 80km from the district headquarters. “On an average, three to four patients with oxygen levels below 80 came here daily. We gave them the prescribed primary treatment, oxygen support and, once they became stable, sent them to L-3 (Level-3 Covid hospital) hospital.” The CHC already had four oxygen cylinders and once the second wave hit, it (CHC) got five oxygen concentrators as well. Dr Srivastava said his team conducted awareness drives in the villages, appealing to the symptomatic people to get their Covid test done at the CHC. “Thereafter, many locals who had fever, cough or cold, came forward and got their test done. The non-symptomatic people, who were tested Covid-19 positive, were given medicines and asked to stay in home isolation. The team monitored their health condition for 14 days. Consistent team efforts help us manage Covid-19 situation in this far-flung district,” said Dr Srivastava. His team and he did not take a breather when the cases began declining. “We started visiting all the villages in our area and began motivating villagers for Covid vaccination. There were many myths and apprehensions in their minds to be busted.” Around 1.46 lakh people of various villages in this area were given the first dose of vaccine (at various vaccination centres) so far. Engaging social influencers In a remote CHC in Meerut’s Hastinapur, a doctor experimented a bit by associating social influencers for identifying patients of Covid-19 in villages and providing them treatment. The effort by Dr Ankur Tyagi and his team was widely appreciated. Dr Ankur Tyagi is in charge of rural-based Hastinapur CHC( Meerut district) which provides health facilities in 91 villages. “I was made a model officer of three urban PHCs ( Nanglabattoo, Jai Bheem Nagar and Rajendra Nagar) for implementing the similar model for identifying active corona cases and sending them for treatment,” said Dr Tyagi. He said initially it was very difficult as cases of Covid-19 were on the rise and CHC had limited staff to visit the villages for identifying symptomatic patients. “Villagers were reluctant for tests and isolating symptomatic patients was essential to prevent other villagers from getting infected,” said Dr Tyagi who then decided to seek the help of social influencers ( mainly unqualified doctors in villages) and formed a WhatsApp group of 50 persons including influencers, CHC doctors and health workers. These social influencers are quite popular among villagers and also enjoy their trust. “All of this helped us penetrate even the remote villages and CHC’s ongoing Active Corona Search campaign yielded good results,” said Dr Tyagi. He then also ran a campaign to distribute ayurvedic kaadha (medicinal brew) along with medicine kits to villagers and patients in more than 70 villages. His team and he administered vaccines to the 1,442 people in the 45-plus age group in a single day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/doctors-brave-the-odds-work-without-rest-to-fight-covid-19-in-uttar-pradesh-101625074282468.html

The district administration has also imposed Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) in the village but on Wednesday, some outsiders had gathered at Khori village and pelted stones at the police. More than 400 persons have been booked,” said Sukhbir Singh, assistant commissioner of police, Badhkal.The police also denied allegations of lathicharge on villagers, despite videos being shared on social media.The police said that people who pelted stones at police officials and are being identified through video recordings. A case was filed at the Surajkund police station for violation of Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as well as the Disaster Management Act.Responding to a call for a mahapanchayat organised by the Mazdoor Awas Sangharsh Samiti Khori Faridabad to discuss the next course of action before the demolition of over 10,000 houses constructed illegally on Aravalli land, residents had gathered at Ambedkar Park in the village on Wednesday morning. Locals said that Samyukt Kisan Morcha leader Gurnam Singh Charuni was supposed to address the gathering at 11.30am, but was not allowed to enter the village as police started lathicharge on residents. Nilesh Kumar, of Basti Suraksha Manch, an organisation supporting the residents, said, “As everyone has a right to life, a mahapanchayat was called where the residents along with farmer leader were supposed to discuss how to form a representation and proceed for talks with the state government. Residents peacefully gathered at the park and others were standing outside their houses extending support. Police forces present there started lathicharge on residents without any talks and almost 50 people were injured in the village.” Fearing a possibility of unrest, the Faridabad district magistrate on June 14 prohibited gathering of five or more persons “within a radius of 200 metres of village Khori”. Residents of Khori have been demanding rehabilitation since the Supreme Court on June 7 ordered the eviction of thousands of slum dwellers living in illegal constructions on forest land. Sapna, a resident of Khori, said, “We had gathered at the park and were waiting for Gurnam Singh Charuni to address the mahapanchayat. The police force started beating us when we told them that the residents are following all rules of the district administration and only want to discuss how our side can be represented to the government, but they did not listen. To save themselves, some agitated residents pelted stones back at the police forces.” After waiting for two hours to enter the village, around 3:30pm, Charuni along with his supporters sat at the entrance of Khori demanding rehabilitation for residents. Charuni was allowed to enter the village after 5.30pm. “We have three main demands, that the government should first rehabilitate the residents before demolishing their houses. Electricity and water supply must be started for all residents, and government representatives must talk to the local representatives of the village to find a solution. People are living in unliveable conditions here. I have learnt that some people have also committed suicide,” said Charuni. “Everyone has a right to life and if action is to be taken, then why are only the poor being punished? Why has there been no action on the five-star hotels that are built on the same site adjacent to the village?” Charuni said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/khori-400-booked-while-gathering-for-mahapanchayat-101625073805348.html
30-06-2021||Gurugram||Two arrested for selling animal genitalia over superstitious beliefs||Two men were arrested from Rewari on Tuesday for allegedly selling genitals of male monitor lizards and jackals over the last four months through social media, in collaboration with a few astrologers in Delhi-NCR, to people with superstitious beliefs, the police said. The monitor lizard is a protected species under the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972. A joint team of police and Gurugram and Rewari wildlife officials conducted a raid, posing as customers, and arrested them, after the Rewari officials were tipped off about the trades. Devender Kumar, a wildlife inspector from Rewari, approached the suspects posing as a customer and finalised a deal for buying the animal parts near Rewari railway station and were arrested during the same. Officials said they operated through mobile phones and social media and had no office or shop to run their operations. MS Malik, chief conservator of forests (wildlife), Gurugram, said that a team of the Haryana forest department, Haryana Police, Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, and Wildlife Trust of India conducted a raid around 4pm on Tuesday and arrested them near the Rewari railway station, The suspects were identified as Parveen Kumar and Mohit of Nangal Teju in Bawal of Rewari. The police said the team seized 30 pieces of hatha jodi (dried genitals of monitor lizard) and four pieces of siyar singi (jackal genitalia). “The wildlife crime control bureau was tracking the men for the past several weeks and shared tip-offs with us based on which a raid was conducted. We are suspecting that there are more people involved in this illegal trade,” said Malik. Malik said the suspects used to sell these genitals between ₹500 and ₹2,000 per piece. “They used to buy these items from dealers in Rajasthan,” he said. The suspects were sent to judicial remand on Saturday, after being produced before the district and sessions court said, officials. A case under sections 9, 39, 44, 49, 50, 51, and 55 of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 was registered at Rewari on Tuesday.

30-06-2021||Gurugram||Factory owner decides to shift premises, landlord abducts employees in threat||The police are on the lookout for two persons, who leased their premises for a factory in Sector 10, for allegedly abducting employees of the factory over a dispute in the rental payment. The police received a complaint on Tuesday from the factory owner, who alleged that two of his employees were abducted by the lessors in Saraswati Enclave of Sector 10. Ashok Nain, the station house officer of Sector 10 police station, said that they formed a team and raided three suspected locations, following which two employees who were held hostage were found. “The suspects fled the spot before police reached. They have been identified and will be arrested at the earliest,” he said. This is at least the fourth such incident of conflict between the lessors and lessee reported in the past 10 days, as the industry is trying to recoup its losses amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Dharmender Kumar Singh (45), the factory owner who runs an export house, said that he has been operating from the building in Sector 10 for the last three years. “Since last March, there have been only a few orders due to which we wanted to shift to another location. We have got a place for a much cheaper price; I paid the security amount and advance rent. I informed my landlord last month and requested him to adjust the security amount in the current rent cycle,” he said. Singh said the landlord did not agree and got furious. He is alleged to have threatened the life of the factory owner if he shifted and demanded one year’s rent in advance. “I requested him and finally decided to leave the security money but he did not stop here and did not let my employees shift the machines and raw material. On Tuesday, the landowner and his son came with a few men and abducted two of my employees. They left a message for me stating that they won’t let me move my stuff,” said Singh. A case under sections 323 (assault), 365 (kidnapping), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code was registered on Tuesday at Sector 10 police station against two persons. Nain said that such incidents are being reported frequently, as owners are losing their rent and businesses are unable to turn profits. Similar cases are registered at Udyog Vihar, Manesar and Sadar police stations. “There have been multiple complaints and many people have vacated their rented spaces without taking their security money. We have informed all tenants to inform police if they are targeted by anyone in the area and if they are finding problems while vacating or taking their security deposit,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/factory-owner-decides-to-shift-premises-landlord-abducts-employees-in-threat-101625073802792.html

According to official figures, the state has been inoculating over a lakh persons for past several days till Tuesday, when only about 50,000 persons received the jab.The vaccination drive was not conducted at various centres across districts on Tuesday and the trend continued on Wednesday, with daily inoculation numbers in the state going further down. As per CoWin dashboard, the central government’s online vaccination portal, just over 13,000 persons were administered the vaccine in the state by 5.30pm on Wednesday.As per the state health department, only 99,920 doses of the both the vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, were in stock till Tuesday evening. “Another 58,950 Covaxin doses arrived in the state on Wednesday. Vaccination is being done as per availability of the jabs in the state,” said Siddharth Tripathi, nodal officer of the health department’s Information, Education and Communication (IEC) wing. As per the schedule of vaccine supply provided by the Centre, the state will receive six lakh vaccine doses on July 2 and a total of 9.5 lakh by July 15. As per its pledge, the state is slotted to get 24.5.lakh doses in July, besides the 8.25 lakh doses for private hospitals in the state. Jharkhand health minister Banna Gupta blamed the Centre for the slowing number of vaccinations in the state. “The central government demands an advance plan from us, which we duly provide. We don’t produce the vaccines. It is the Centre that has to procure and provide vaccines to the state. What can we do in this? We want to scale up vaccination in order to protect the state from the possible third wave, but we don’t have enough vaccines. As per information, we will get vaccines by July 2,” Gupta said. The minister also appealed BJP MPs and MLAs to lobby with the central government and ensure the state gets the doses at the earliest. The state government has also written to the Centre, asking it to reduce the allocation of vaccine to private hospitals in the state to 5% from the existing 25%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/vaccine-shortage-hits-covid-19-inoculation-in-jharkhand-health-minister-blames-centre-101625071641716.html

According to the police, the couple was killed in the wee hours of Wednesday on the suspicion of practising “black magic”, that was allegedly leading to diseases among neighbours. ”The couple was blamed by one of their neighbours for a medical condition that he and his wife were suffering from and for the death of their 30-year-old son in January this year,” said SDPO Anup Kumar.According to the couple’s son, his mother was on way to a field early in the morning when more than ten named accused intercepted her and hacked to death. Later, they forcibly entered their house and attacked his physically challenged father by sharp weapons when he was sleeping. Police suspect the neighbour to have committed the crime. “We have arrested three people in this connection and the hunt is on for rest of the accused,” said the SDPO. The bodies were sent for postmortem examination , he added. Meanwhile, police is taking all possible precautions in probing the case since the area is Maoist-infested, officials said. The practice of branding women as witches and torturing them continues unabated in remote rural areas of Bihar. In the last two years, more than 350 women have been tortured and beaten on suspicion of practising witchcraft, according to police records. Concerned about the rising number of witchcraft-related killings, state officials said an awareness campaign will soon be started in the district. In 2012, the Bihar Human Rights Commission directed the state to expedite investigations and trials in cases related to offences under Prevention of Witch Hunting Act, 1999.

30-06-2021||Patna||Vaccine hitch as Bihar embarks on massive vaccination drive||Bihar aims to vaccinate 4.54 lakh people a day for the next six months beginning Thursday, as it embarks on a mega vaccination drive to inoculate six crore people by December, a target chief minister Nitish Kumar has set for his officials to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. The state’s vaccination goal, however, seems to be an uphill one, given the shortage of vaccines and their erratic supply. The number of vaccinations in a day has ebbed after peaking to 6.39 lakh doses on June 21. The state has been administering less than 50,000 doses to beneficiaries since June 27 due to the poor availability of vaccines. At least nine of the 38 districts in Bihar drew a blank on Wednesday as their vaccination centres were closed due to the non-availability of vaccines. Some districts reported double-digit vaccinations. It had administered 30,462 doses till 8pm on Wednesday. This was the lowest single-day inoculations done in June. The Centre, said state health officials, has committed to supply 91.81 lakh doses of the vaccine to the state in July. Of this, 68.86 lakh doses are to be administered free of cost through the government channel. The remaining 22.95 lakh doses will be routed through the private channel, where one has to pay for each dose of the vaccine. As per the schedule of vaccine supply, the Centre has committed to supply 24.77 lakh doses to the state health department between July 1 and 15. Given the state’s ambitious target to inoculate 4.54 lakh people in a day, the stock would not last even six days. The state had in its inventory around 10 lakh doses of the two vaccines — Covaxin 83,060 doses and the remaining 9,28,430 doses of Covishield. These would last only two days if the state were to vaccinate as per its target. The next tranche of 9,59,220 doses of Covishield is scheduled to arrive on July 8, followed by 1,50,000 doses of Covaxin on July 12; and 4,82,910 doses of Covishield and 1,09,540 doses of Covaxin on July 15, said officials in the know of the vaccine supply schedule. Executive director State Health Society, Bihar, Manoj Kumar, also the state’s nodal officer for vaccination, could not be contacted as he did not respond to phone calls or text messages. STATE’S VACCINATION PLAN On its part, the state government has drawn out an ambitious plan, involving different departments, to achieve its vaccination goal. It has drawn up a panchayat wise micro plan, leveraging the support of “Jeevika didis” (women self-help groups) and representatives of panchayati raj institutions and urban local bodies; and organising “Teeka Shala” or vaccination camps on school premises for parents of students studying there. Besides, 718 “Teeka Express” or mobile vaccination vans have been pressed into service in rural areas and 121 in urban areas to vaccinate the populace at their doorstep. It also hopes to rope in famous personalities, sports icons, etc. and encourage schoolchildren to motivate their parents to take the jab. As per the day-wise plan, 3 lakh people are proposed to be inoculated at the 3,000 vaccination centres across the state, at an average daily 100 jabs at each session site, said additional chief secretary, health, Pratyaya Amrit. “We also expect to have 83,900 inoculations through the 839 “Teeka Express” at an average daily vaccination of 100 people per van,” he said. “Jeevika Didis” are expected to inoculate 53,400 people a day through the 534 session sites they have been tasked to manage. “Teeka Shala”, one in every 534 blocks of the state, has been given a similar target, added Amrit. Besides, every district will have at least one vaccination centre which will be functional from 9am to 9pm. Patna already has two vaccination centres — the Patliputra Sports Complex, Kankerbagh, and the Hotel Patliputra Ashok at Beerchand Patel Marg — which will be operational round the clock. It also plans to tap and persuade flood victims, coming for gratuitous relief at special camps, to take the jab. Besides, the government has already requested the state election commission (SEC) to ask candidates contesting the panchayat polls to declare their vaccination status in their nomination papers. Panchayati raj minister Samrat Choudhary said he had suggested that all candidates, contesting the panchayat polls, should get themselves vaccinated so that the rural population also get inoculated and the safety parameters during the campaign of the three-tier local body are maintained. It has also planned that shops should mandatorily display vaccination status through a display of stickers, to be facilitated by the government. The health department also proposes to vaccinate all teachers and family members of all government employees in a “mission mode”. If Bihar gets sufficient vaccine in time, as planned, it may end up vaccinating 4.91 lakh beneficiaries a day. Bihar has so far administered 1,58,95,170 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine among its 7.22 crore target population above 18 years of age. Of these, 1,36,80,145 were given the first dose and the remaining 22,15,025 had taken both the doses of the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/vaccine-hitch-as-bihar-embarks-on-massive-vaccination-drive-101625071463444.html

Pune has a total of 40,000 Mhada flats which are old and in need for redevelopment. Recently, the Maharashtra government approved three FSI (Floor Space Index) for the Mhada propoerties in Pune which was earlier at 2.5 FSI.

Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar called a meeting with urban development and housing department to discuss the Pune city Mhada properties redevelopment issue on Tuesday. Siddharth Dhende who was present for the meeting said, “Many Mhada properties are not getting redeveloped due to various issues. For example, the Maharashtra Housing Society located near Nagpur chawl is near the airport and the prison where high rise is not possible. If the developers are allowed to do cluster of various Mhada plots, they can use the remaining FSI on other plots. The urban development department and Mhada minister Jitendra Avhad both accepted it and asked Pune Mhada to submit the proposal for same.” Pune city has various Mhada buildings which were erected since 1965 and now in a bad condition. The residents are demanding redevelopment but due to various reasons, the work cannot be restarted. Ajit Pawar also accepted that the situation in Mumbai and Pune is different and Pune would need different rules. Dhende said, “Many approach roads to Mhada buildings are either six or nine metres wide. It is bringing in restrictions for high rise buildings. Even many amenities like garden, playground, water tank were developed in the Mhada societies and they are coming in between various plots. By considering this, it has been demanded to get a site margin discount like SRA for Mhada buildings.” BOX Mhada buildings located at following places in the city Lokmanya Nagar (Sadashiv peth), Agarkar Nagar (Band Garden road), Bhamburda (Gokhale Nagar), Laxmi Nagar (Parvati), Mharshingar, Phulenagar, Maharashtra Housing Board Yerwada, Netaji Nagar (Wanwadi), Swami Vivekanand Nagar (Hadapsar), Hingne Mala (Hadapsar), Golf Club Road, Kothrud, Bavdhan, Wadgaonsheri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/cluster-development-allowed-for-mhada-redevelopment-in-pune-city-101625069841667.html

Shiv Sena has the highest tally of 23 corporators followed by NCP which has 18 corporators while BJP has 15 corporators and Congress has five elected members. The BSP has four corporators, SP has one and one independent candidate in the municipal corporation. The Shiv Sena fielded Rohini Shedge for the mayoral post and needed 34 corporators to back her candidature which would give the party a majority in the civic body. The Congress however decided to stay neutral in the election scheduled to be held on June 30. The outgoing mayor of Ahmednagar Municipal Council is a BJP candidate backed by NCP.

The impact on the economy of the Dehu and Alandi villages and Ssveral other villages on the route of the palkhis, which walks all the way towards Pandharpur, over 18 days, is substantial. As per earlier experience, Abhay Tilak, chief trustee of the Alandi Devsthan temple trust, claims the total value of “Wari economics” each year is at ₹1,000 crore. “Wari is a big event in the state which happens every year for the last 300 years, and every year there is increase in the number of warkaris joining the palkhis. The wari is not only for those 18 days, but its preparations starts way before. Right from the route, roads, making all other necessary arrangements at the villages, as well as arrangements by NGOs and local organisations, all goes into the preparation. The wari tradition economy is valued at ₹1,000 crore and has been impacted due to Covid-19,” said Tilak. Every year tens of thousands of pilgrims walk from Dehu and Alandi to Pandharpur, all devotees of Sant Tukaram and Sant Dnyaneshwar. This year both the saints will be taken by MSRTC buses to Pandharpur, with only a few selected warkaris on the bus. Sanjay More, chief of this year’s Tukaram Maharaj Palkhi said, “We are all set for the palkhi prasthan ceremony. The entire temple has been sanitised and 100 Warkaris along with temple trustees and administrative staff will be allowed inside the temple. Covid safety protocols will be followed strictly during the ceremony and we appeal to people not to come to Dehu for the ceremony as curfew has been imposed in the Dehu and Alandi villages.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sant-tukaram-palkhi-prasthan-today-no-foot-pilgrimage-101625069721602.html

Intellectuals of Sikh organisations added that the point of concern is that Sikh leaders in Delhi intentionally kicked up a religious frenzy over the issue, competing with one another in holding demonstrations in New Delhi.Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) president Manjinder Singh Sirsa flew to Srinagar to bring back the two Sikh girls, while a former president of the DSGMC organised a protest in New Delhi.“It is a known fact that every religious community in India opposes inter-religious and inter-caste marriages. There is a difference in rigidity shown by different religious communities on this account,” Khushhal added, pointing that the Indian Muslims were also no different. “The actions of Sikh leaders are objectionable. They were too loud and could not hide their motive of playing the political game of polarisation, for and on behalf of, the ruling BJP,” added Khushhal. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sikh-girls-marriages-in-j-k-issue-blown-out-of-proportion-says-kendri-singh-sabha-101625067981511.html

30-06-2021||Gurugram||Farmers adamant on repeal of farm laws won’t serve any purpose: Haryana CM||Haryana chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Wednesday said the protesting farmer unions should not remain adamant on repeal of the new central farm laws, adding that making it a precondition for talks with the government does not serve any purpose.He also claimed that only a "handful of people" were opposing the farm laws and that "common farmers are happy".“Those spearheading the agitation are in reality not farmers. Real farmers have no objection with the farm laws, they are happy,” he said.The chief minister further alleged that those opposing the farm laws are only doing so due to political reasons.“Their Punjab team is doing so because polls are approaching there. But there are no polls due in our state. Here the agenda is to defame the government using political angle. And the Congress is also supporting them in this,” he said.Khattar said the word “kisan” (farmer) is a sacred one, but some incidents like the alleged sexual exploitation of a woman from West Bengal at the Tikri border last month have "prompted people to raise questions".On Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar's appeal to the protesting farmers to end their agitation and his invitation for talks, Khattar said, "The farmer unions are adamant on only one thing -- repeal of the farm laws -- without being able to pinpoint at any shortcomings of the laws."“It does not serve any purpose if they remain adamant on just one thing and making it a precondition for talks with the government,” he said at a press conference here.“What I feel is that Kisan word is a very pious word. Everyone, including common people, government and I would say even those leading this agitation have faith and respect towards farmers. But the sad part which has come out of this agitation is that some incidents have happened prompting people to raise questions," he said in an apparent reference to the sexual exploitation incident at Tikri border.The Haryana Police had last month launched a probe into allegations by the father of the victim woman, who died after showing COVID-like symptoms, at a hospital in Bahadurgarh in Jhajjar district, that she had been raped by two men she had accompanied to the farmers protest site at Tikri border.The chief minister also referred to the death of a 42-year-old man whose family members alleged that he was set on fire by four people in Bahadurgarh.According to the complaint lodged by the victim's brother, the four men were part of the ongoing farmers agitation at the Tikri border near Delhi.“There has been sexual assault, murder, and also disputes with local people about roads being blocked for which even panchayats have been held,” Khattar said.He also referred to the alleged targeting of BJP-JJP leaders in the state over the farm laws.“I condemn their undemocratic way of work. We are exercising restraint. And what are they (those spearheading the stir) saying that the ministers, MLAs, chief minister, deputy CM cannot go to attend public functions. After all those running the government, it is their responsibility to go among the people and listen to them,” he said.“We have always exercised restraint as they (protesters) are our own people… we do not want confrontation. When they say some things, we tolerate it as they are our own people. But exceeding it beyond limit is not in anyone's interest,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/farmers-adamant-on-repeal-of-farm-laws-won-t-serve-any-purpose-haryana-cm-101625063855465.html
30-06-2021||Chandigarh||Building owners with Reliance stores seek Punjab CM help for reopening||A group of building owners who have rented their premises to Reliance Industries for operating its various businesses across Punjab on Tuesday sought the intervention of Chief Minister Amarinder Singh for reopening of their stores which were laid siege by protesting farmers for the past several months.Farmers protesting against the Centre's three farm laws are not allowing Reliance stores to operate in Punjab.The owners said they are in a deep financial crisis and moving towards bankruptcy as they have not been getting any rental incomes for the past 7-8 months because all Reliance retail outlets are closed due to farmer protests.They said the agitating farmers have put their tents outside various stores.Reliance has around 275 stores in Punjab and all of them are shut, they said."We are bearing losses in crores as the buildings are on loans from banks and we have to bear the burden of huge EMIs, municipal taxes, electricity and water charges, etc. Moreover, the livelihood of lakhs of workers, employees and their families has also been adversely affected," said Prabhnoor Singh Walia from Kapurthala in a statement here.He added that "farmer leaders warn us of severe consequences if we open the stores. We have even approached the district police and other local authorities but in vain. We have also met Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leaders and 'Kisan Jathebandeyaan' a couple of times and raised our concerns but to no avail".As per the agreements with the company, no rental payment can be made in case there is no billing or the store is closed due to agitation, Walia added."We are all Punjabis and fully support the farmers, but such forced closure of Reliance's stores is only harming Punjab, as Reliance procures a lot of products locally, provides huge direct and indirect employment to Punjabis and pays huge taxes to the state."No corporate would be interested to invest in the state if they are not allowed to operate peacefully," said Dharampal Singh Nain from Jagraon.Nirmal Singh from Jalandhar said, "We have borrowed loans and invested all our hard earned money in the properties, but such forced closure is ruining us."He added that the stores are open in all other states. "But in Punjab, farmers are not allowing to open even those stores which are under essential services, so we are here to request the CM for help.""We also appeal to the farmers associations to carry on their protest peacefully against the government but allow Reliance to open its stores."Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) has already said in a regulatory filing that it has no plans of entering contract or corporate farming, and it has not purchased any agricultural land in India for the purpose of contract farming," said Manav Sandhu from Taran Taran.Sandeep Singh Brar, officer on special duty to the Punjab CM who interacted with the aggrieved building owners, assured all possible support to them and promised to take it up with the CM, as per the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/building-owners-with-reliance-stores-seek-punjab-cm-help-for-reopening-101625061248437.html
30-06-2021||Kolkata||‘This is a planted game’: Mamata on criticism of Bengal govt over fake vaccine drives||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accusing it of spreading misinformation regarding the West Bengal government in connection to the fake vaccination programme.“The state government is taking strong action in the fake vaccine scam. There is a discussion on West Bengal every day on national TV. The BJP dictates TV and they are spreading misinformation,” Mamata Banerjee was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Banerjee also said that she suspected the home ministry to be behind this. “It's a planted game from the home minister's office, I am sure about it,” Banerjee further added.TMC MP Mimi Chakrabarty had busted a fake vaccination camp run by Debanjan Deb earlier this month. The TMC MP also risked her own health as she had received jabs at the fake vaccination centre earlier. Mimi’s suspicion arose after she did not receive a vaccine certificate which prompted her to contact the police and which led to Deb’s arrest.The West Bengal government came under pressure after Trinamool Congress MPs and other government officials were seen with Debanjan Deb. Last week TMC MP and Bengal Indian Medical Association chapter’s chief Santanu Sen denied any involvement with Debanjan Deb after his pictures with Deb surfaced on the web. He also said that he did not know Deb personally and did not ask him why he wanted to get his picture clicked with the lawmaker when the photo was taken.Debanjan Deb, 28, who has been charged with criminal conspiracy, forgery and cheating, conducted other fake vaccination camps as well. Deb also drove around with a blue beacon in his car masquerading as an IAS officer working with the state government. Kolkata Police also revealed that Deb carried out a raid as an IAS officer, according to news agency PTI.The opposition parties other than the BJP have also questioned the state government over how Debanjan was allowed to carry on with these scams. The Calcutta high court asked the West Bengal government to file a report on the fake vaccine scams organised by Debanjan Deb by Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/this-is-a-planted-game-mamata-on-criticism-of-bengal-govt-over-fake-vaccine-drives-101625061262778.html
30-06-2021||Delhi||Winner of The Diana Award, Kaif Ali: Youth has the power to change the world||The most prestigious accolade a young person, aged 9-25 years, can receive for their social action or humanitarian work, is the Diana Award. And recently, an architecture student of Faculty of Architecture & Ekistics, Jamia Millia Islamia, Kaif Ali has been honoured with it. Ali has been awarded for his work on Covid-19 Innovation –Space era, which is a module for demountable and portable shelter space for Covid-19 era and beyond. He started working on this project during March last year when the pandemic was raging. “I noticed when people were being isolated at home or at Covid centres, it was not entirely isolating and there was still a risk of spreading the virus. Tackling this very problem, I have created an intermediate space, which allows people to isolate completely. The shelter is portable and can be set anywhere, so people can even isolate near their locality. The shelter also follows all norms of social distancing and Covid protocols,” he says.The shelter can be designed with prefabricated sheets, or by using shipping containers. A standard shelter unit contains 4 shelter units, with 96 quarantine friendly beds, with a flexibility of modulation as per requirements. With a passion for humanitarian causes, Ali has designed refugee camps as college projects, and confesses on feeling passionate about it. He adds, “I have been tirelessly doing innovations in the humanitarian shelter domain. To make refugee camps or disaster relief camps and have participated in international competitions about the same.” And, when the pandemic hit us, Ali saw it as an opportunity to serve the society by his innovations. Admits to being a multi-tasker, Ali was working on space era, all while attending online classes, but, never saw it is as a problem and always felt passionate for his work. “It doesn’t feel like work because of the passion and dedication I have for it. Neither my college, nor any government body has asked me to do this project, it is all driven by my passion,” says the awardee.Having done this project all by himself, Ali feels proud of himself and wants to inspire youth. “Initially I asked my peers, if they want to join me on this project. But, they didn’t understand it. They thought using shipping containers is not a ‘new’ idea. So, I did it alone and I am happy it is being received well. With various organisations recognising my work and having received many awards, I am happy and proud that my efforts didn’t go in vain. I did something good for the society,” he adds. With a message for youth out there, Ali says, “I want all the young citizens to follow a three I’s formula, that is to imagine, initiate and inspire. I firmly believe that youth has the power to change the world and serve the society from our own professions. With consistency and courage, youth can inspire the coming generation.” With hopes of continuing to serve the society, Ali wants to further work for sustainability and bring out a youth perspective for climate adaptation and mitigation strategies. “I want to be a youngest sustainability professional and work in climate leadership domain,” he concludes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/winner-of-the-diana-award-kaif-ali-youth-has-the-power-to-change-the-world-101625060607476.html

Furthermore, women police officers will also be appointed across the state to keep a check on human trafficking in the rural areas. The chief minister stated that the government will soon come up with a detailed plan to rehabilitate children whose parents have succumbed to Covid-19.Addressing the issue of migrant workers, who suffered severely during the nationwide lockdown last year due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Soren said that his government was concerned about the workers’ welfare.According to the PTI report, the chief minister pointed out that despite the pandemic-induced migration crisis, the state has handled the matter sensitively. He said earlier this month his government ensured the safe return of Jharkhand-based migrant workers from Uttar Pradesh’s Deoria district. “Thirty migrant labourers including women and children were brought back to Jharkhand,” he added.Interestingly, earlier this month, a skill mapping of 250,056 migrant labourers, who returned home to Jharkhand, showed that 177,186 or 70 per cent of the returnees are skilled labourers, while the rest 72,871 are unskilled workers, according to the state government’s assessment. The mapping was done on Soren’s instructions with the aim for the government to provide them with jobs as per their skills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-cm-says-30-minors-rescued-from-being-trafficked-to-delhi-101625059373872.html

Do not put such an impractical condition,” Chief Justice Datta was quoted as saying by PTI.The court was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by two lawyers - Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari, asking for a direction to the central government and the state government to implement door-to-door vaccination for senior citizens above 75 years, specially-abled persons and those who are bedridden.Initially, the Maharashtra government in its affidavit on Tuesday said that it would have to take approval from the Centre. However, after the court pointed out that states like Kerala, Jharkhand and Bihar have already started the initiative, the Maharashtra government came up with their latest decision on Wednesday.As of now, the matter has been posted for further hearing on Thursday in presence of the chairman of the Maharashtra Covid-19 task force.Earlier this month, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said that his department is working towards rolling out door-to-door vaccination across the state. At the time, the minister also emphasised that the beneficiary’s family and a family doctor have to give in writing that the former can be administered the Covid-19 vaccine dose and that it would be their responsibility should anything adverse happen.However, Tope had stated that the door-to-door vaccination will not be applicable for all citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/maha-to-vaccinate-bedridden-people-at-home-on-trial-basis-pune-to-be-first-101625058257046.html

They fired 7 shots||Patna: A property dealer travelling on a motorcycle was forced to stop and shot dead by two men in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur on Wednesday morning, police said. A CCTV camera captured the brazen attack on the busy Sitamarhi-Muzaffarpur national highway that shows the assailants spent about a minute at the spot after the first shot, firing repeatedly to make sure that the man was dead.Police said they found seven shell casings from the spot.The dead man was identified as Nawal Kishore Singh, a property dealer from Sheopur districtMuzaffarpur SSP Jayant Kant said Nawal Kishore Singh was the brother of a former chief and district board member, Srinarayan Singh, who filed his papers to contest the Bihar elections as a candidate of a regional party Janta Dal Rashtravadi in October-November last year. Srinarayan was killed during campaigning on October 25, 2020.Police said Wednesday’s incident took place at about 5.30am when the property dealer was going somewhere from Ahiyapur. Nawal Kishore was forced to stop his motorcycle between Old Zero Mile and Vijay Chhapra on the Sitamarhi-Muzaffarpur highway, about 100 km from state capital Patna.When one of the two men got off the motorcycle and moved towards Nawal Kishore, he appeared to have figured something was amiss and tried to run. According to the CCTV footage, the assailant fired the shot on his back. Nawal Kishore fell. The assailant fired at him again, and again over the next 60 seconds. At one point, the assailant walked back to the motorcycle and got a second weapon to fire again. They eventually sped away towards Sitamarhi.Witnesses told the police that the men also killed a street dog who had been barking incessantly at them.“The dog ran a few metres and collapsed to his death”, said Ramsagar Shah, who has a tea stall near the spot.Local residents said it appeared the gunmen fired about 15 shots but the police stressed they found only seven shells.Police said they were trying to question two men present at the spot for a lead about the assailants. They are also seeing if the CCTV footage helps to identify the accused and are examining phone details of the dead man.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/property-dealer-shot-dead-by-2-men-on-bihar-highway-they-fired-7-shots-cops-101625057363183.html

Karunanidhi, who was then 78, was roughed up after police barged into his room while he was sleeping. He was dragged out even as he shouted “they are killing me” repeatedly. Karunanidhi’s archrival, J Jayalalithaa, was the chief minister then.

30-06-2021||Mumbai||Stop political rallies during the pandemic: Bombay HC to govt||The Bombay high court on Wednesday said it was time to prepare for the third Covid wave by learning from the devastation caused by the second wave and that the state government must ensure that no more political rallies were held during the pandemic, failing which the court will take strict action.“You will have to start activating machinery to stop political rallies defying Covid protocols. We will not allow this to happen. We are shutting down courts for physical hearings and these political leaders are organizing rallies with thousands of persons. The last rally was on the issue of naming of airport with over 25,000 people present. Can it not wait for Covid to get over? The court was referring to a large rally held two days ago to oppose naming of Navi Mumbai Airport after Shiv Sena patriarch Balasaheb Thackeray while demanding that it be named after late socialist leader DB Patil. The first phase of the airport is yet to be completed. There have been other political rallies demanding Maratha and OBC (other backward class) quotas. The court asked why these rallies could not wait and said it would not allow them during the pandemic. The instruction from the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni came during the hearing of a public interest litigation over shortage and black marketing of anti-Covid drugs during its procurement and distribution. “Everyone is trying to take mileage. Why? Let it wait for some time. Are vaccination camps less important? We should all take lessons from the second wave and be prepared for the third wave. We all invited it and saw what happened. We should avoid it,” the bench noted. The second wave of the pandemic is said to have worsened due to unchecked political events such as holding of elections in several states and violation of Covid-19 protocols in organising the Kumbh Mela at Haridwar earlier this year. The court also wanted to know from the government counsel why political leaders were not informing the electorate that the state government was not the authority to decide on the issue of Maratha reservation and that a review petition was filed in the Supreme Court. Earlier last month, the division bench headed by justice Ravindra Ghuge at Aurangabad court made similar observations and restrained politicians and ministers from conducting physical ceremonies and functions including for inaugurating projects until lockdown restrictions were eased.

30-06-2021||Noida||Protesting farmers, BJP workers clash at UP Gate site near Delhi||Ghaziabad: Hundreds of workers from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and protesting farmers camping at UP Gate protest site in Ghaziabad briefly clashed on Wednesday afternoon, police said. The incident took place when the farmers, who were holding their protest on one side of the Delhi Meerut Expressway (DME) objected to a gathering of local BJP workers on the opposite lane to welcome a party leader.“They (BJP) were on the other side of the DME and the farmers objected to the gathering. We came to know about 10-15 minutes earlier that the BJP workers had gathered to welcome their leader. We rushed to the spot and controlled the situation,” said Gyanendra Kumar Singh, superintendent of police (city 2).Singh said both sides intend to file complaints against each other.BJP workers claim they had gathered near the starting point of the Hindon elevated road connecting to the expressway to welcome Amit Valmiki, the party’s newly-appointed secretary who was arriving from Delhi.“There were about 300-400 workers including 20-25 women...We were on the other side of the expressway (Delhi-Ghaziabad carriageway) near the starting point of the Hindon elevated road. The farmers were on the other side in their camps. Suddenly, hundreds of them came to our side by jumping the central verge and attacked us,” said Sanjeev Sharma, city president of the BJP’s Ghaziabad unit.He said several party workers including several women were injured and about 30-40 vehicles damaged. “Later, we met the district magistrate and senior superintendent of police and briefed them about the incident. A complaint will also be filed shortly,” Sharma, added. The farm leaders, on the other hand, contradicted the BJP charge, insisting that the attack on them was a conspiracy to malign their peaceful protest.The farm protest at UP Gate started on November 28 - they occupied the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway as well a few days later -- against the three farm laws passed by the Centre that they say, will threaten their livelihoods by forcing them to sell to corporate giants with greater bargaining power at poor prices instead of government-run markets.The government insists the laws will bring competition and widen farmers’ market access.“It is a new conspiracy taken up by the BJP to malign the farmers’ movement. This has happened time and again. They came on the pretext of welcoming their leader and damaged their own cars. This is another conspiracy staged by them. We will shortly give a police complaint to the police,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, UP-Gate site spokesperson from ‘Samyukta Kisan Morcha.’Bajwa said they have been protesting peacefully for months and will remain peaceful. He asked the police to act against the BJP workers, adding that “if there is no action, we will decide the future course of action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/protesting-farmers-bjp-workers-clash-at-up-gate-site-near-delhi-101625050583421.html
30-06-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana to set up lab for genome sequencing at PGI Rohtak||Haryana health minister on Wednesday said that the state government has given orders for the setting up of a laboratory for genome sequencing at the Pandit Bhagwat Dayal Sharma Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Rohtak, following the detection of the first case of the Delta plus variant of coronavirus (Covid-19) in Chandigarh, news agency ANI reported. “The patient’s contact tracing is being done,” news agency ANI quoted Vij as saying.This comes after Dharam Pal, advisor to the Chandigarh administration on Tuesday stated that the contact tracing process of the patient with the Delta plus variant of Covid-19 has been completed and that there was nothing to worry about. “We are keeping a close watch on the situation,” Pal said.According to a statement from the Chandigarh administration, the first Delta plus variant case in the Union territory was reported after 50 random samples of the region’s citizens between May and June were sent to the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) lab on June 6 for Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS).The Delta plus variant was identified in a 35-year-old resident of Vikas Nagar Mauli-Jagran, who had tested positive for Covid-19 on May 22.Notably, the Union ministry of health and family welfare on Tuesday confirmed that the total number of Delta plus variant cases of Covid-19 has now risen to 51 from 48, with Maharashtra recording the highest number of cases. Other affected states include Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Odisha, Jammu and Kashmir, and more. As many as 12 Indian states and Union territories, and an equal number of countries have so far been hit by the variant of Covid-19, which the Indian government has hailed as a “variant of concern” for its deadly nature.The health ministry on Tuesday also clarified that the Delta variant, of whose subtype is the Delta Plus, can undergo about 15 to 17 mutations. However, the ministry also stated that the variant is very localised and that it has been isolated and cultured at National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune.Several states, including Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Punjab, among others, have taken cognisance of the rising cases of Delta Plus variants of Covid-19 and re-imposed or extended lockdown-like restrictions. Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday extended curbs till July 10, with relaxations on opening pubs and bars with 50 per cent capacity. The orders that will come into effect from July 1 were passed following a high-level review meeting chaired by Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-to-set-up-lab-for-genome-sequencing-at-pgi-rohtak-101625049951954.html
30-06-2021||Pune||Sutradhara’s Tales: When Pune city became Shaiste Khan’s military camp||When young a Shivaji Raje was sent to Pune along with Jijabai and Dadoji Konddev, Shahaji Raje equipped him with his own Ashta pradhan mandal (ministry of eight). Dadoji Konddev was the “karbhari”- in charge of running the entire jahagir (feudal land grant) from Indapur and Supe, to Baramati and Shirwal, on behalf of Shahaji.The jahagir also included a region of 12 mavals (sub regions to the west of Pune), which were remote and known for rice cultivation.Shivaji Raje, essentially an employee of Shahaji Raje, was made “Pot Mokasdar” (sub-letter of land rights), directly in charge of 36 villages in the Karyant maval, stretching from fort Sinhagad to Pune city. By the age of 15-16, Shivaji started actively looking after the entire jahagir. He, along with Dadoji Konddev, managed to subjugate various Deshmukhs of the 12 mavals, including Bandal Deshmukh. He took stringent action against powerful miscreants and sexual offenders such as the Patil of village Ranjhe, which helped with recognition of his power, even at a young age.Under Adilshahi, the forts were ruled by central powers, while the flat productive lands were part of jahagirs. However, except for fort Sinhagad and Purandar, which were connected to the mainland, remote forts were largely neglected. With his base as Pune, the period between 1645 and 1647 was effectively utilised by Shivaji to conquer various forts in the Maval region of Pune. Fort Sinhagad was the strategic fort to rule over Pune city. Shivaji took over Kondhana (Sinhagad) by bribing the Adilshahi governor and with help of Honap Deshpande. In 1645, fort Torna was conquered with help of a small infantry led by Yesaji Kank, Tanaji Malusure and Baji Pasalkar. Rajgad hill (Murumb Deo Dongar) was taken over and was built into a formidable fortress with treasure found at Torna. Fort Rajgad later went on to become first fort capital of Maratha Empire. After the death of Dadoji Konddev in 1647, Shivaji consolidated his powers by taking over Supe. He raided Junnar and retrieved a huge treasure and horses. His activities irked the Adlshahi court and Fateh Khan was sent to act against Shivaji. However, Shivaji managed to defeat Fateh Khan at Khalad-Belsar, but lost his comrades Baji Pasalkar and Godaji Jagtap in the battle. When Nilkanthrai, the commander of Purandar, died, Shivaji under the pretext of solving a dispute, first arrested, and then recruited the surviving heirs under his independent rule. Subsequently, forts Rajmachi, Lohagad, and Rohida were included in the newly formed “Swaraj”.After 1655, Shivaji Maharaj preferred staying at forts Purandar, Sinhagad and Rajgad. The departure of the ruler from Pune affected the morale of local people, there was a lull in city life and the population receded. The development of Pune, kick-started by the arrival of Shivaji, came to an abrupt halt, and Pune became just another town on the map of the Deccan.The death of prominent Adilshahi sardar, Afzalkhan at the hands of Shivaji in 1656 was a shocking event and made all of India take note.After accession to the throne in 1659 after emperor Shahajahan’s death, Aurangzeb took rein over most of India, including the Deccan. Shivaji Raje’s “swaraj adventures”, by then, had attracted the attention of the Mughal court. Shivaji’s new stature placed him in the way of the southward expansion of the Mughal Empire. He had already earned Aurangzeb’s wrath by pillaging Aurangzeb’s domains.Without wasting any time, Aurangzeb sent his maternal uncle and trusted commander, Shaiste Khan as subhedar (governor) of Deccan to defeat Shivaji in 1660.Shaiste Khan arrived via the Phaltan-Baramati route and tried to capture fort Purandar. But, Marathas defended the fort and Shaiste Khan had to retreat to Saswad. He eventually came to Pune and took over the entire region from the Marathas. His commanders captured fort Sangramdurg at Chakan after fierce resistance from Firangoji Narsala for two months. Shaiste Khan descended into the Deccan with a huge army of 40-50 thousand. And on conquering Pune in May 1660, Shaiste Khan made Lal Mahal, the former residence of Shivaji Maharaj, his base. There was no prominent town in the region of the 12 mavals, except Pune, to accommodate such an army. The city also provided the necessary space along the river banks. The fertile region around Pune was raided for grains and other requirements. The population of Pune swelled overnight and the entire town was made into a military camp. Krishnaji Kalbhor was given the Deshmukhi of Pune in 1662. The original Kasba peth, Shahapura and Somwar were not enough to accommodate the requirements of the camp. Hence, Shaiste Khan went on to settle a new peth, Shastapura, along the river and beyond the Nagjhari stream, which is the present day Mangalwar peth. The military also brought in various artisan communities to settle in Pune. Prominent among them were shikalgars (weapon makers) and kagajis. A separate Kagazipura was settled to the east of Kasba for paper making.Shivaji Maharaj waited for the right opportunity to reconquer Pune and on April 5, 1663, he secretly attacked the Mughal camp in Pune. Shivaji was at Sinhagad, 20km from Pune, and under the pretext of a marriage procession managed to sneak in 200-300 Maratha soldiers dressed as the marriage party and as labourers, with the help of Pune’s Kotwal.It was the month of Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting, and security around Lal Mahal was slack. At midnight Shivaji and his squad of men sneaked into Lal Mahal, which he was intimately familiar with. He led the men towards the cook house next to the women’s quarters and opened up a passage into Khan’s harem. Shivaji Maharaj managed to sever the fingers of a fleeing Shaiste Khan. A general and a number of officers were killed that night and many officers fled through the narrow lanes of the town. This attack on the heart of a Mughal military camp instilled great terror in the minds of the Mughal soldiers and particularly, Shaiste Khan. Shivaji and his troops swiftly retreated to the nearby Sinhagad and mislead the Mughal troops in the direction of Katraj ghat, to follow bullock carts which were lit-up. This tactic of deflection led to the coining of the phrase “Katraj ghat dakhawane”!Shaiste Khan left Pune and the Deccan in the next three days to return north, in extreme embarrassment.

30-06-2021||Lucknow||Akhilesh Yadav says Uttar Pradesh will see democratic revolution in 2022||Akhilesh Yadav of Samajwadi Party on Wednesday said that there will be a democratic revolution in Uttar Pradesh in 2022 against the current politics. Referring to the current politics as "negative", "disruptive" and conservative", Yadav said the state assembly polls will witness not elections but a revolution against such differential politics."United against today's disruptive, conservative, negative politics, new politics of exploited, neglected, oppressed, humiliated, Dalit, oppressed, deprived, poor, farmers, workers, women and youth is taking birth," Yadav said on Wednesday in a tweet.The assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh are scheduled to take place in 2022.The former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh also said that in 2020, the state will witness a democratic revolution against " disruptive politics" and not elections. Yadav said this as he took a dig at the current Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) regime, which is led by chief minister Yogi Adityanath."In 2022, there will be no election in UP, there will be a democratic revolution," Yadav added.The SP supremo is confident about his party's win in the next election. He has exuded confidence that the party would gain 350 seats of the total 403 assembly seats, as he claims that the people are against the BJP government.Yadav has accused the ruling party of deceit and "negative" politics earlier too. On Tuesday, he accused the saffron party of damaging the hopes of people and playing with their sentiments. He said that the party is not interested in truth and does not have faith in the Constitution and moral values."The truth is that the BJP is not interested in development, but in destruction. It does not have any faith in the Constitution and moral values. It has damaged the hopes of people and played with their sentiments. The BJP is doing politics using deceit, force, terror and allurement," PTI quoted Yadav as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/akhilesh-yadav-says-uttar-pradesh-will-see-democratic-revolution-in-2022-101625044003150.html
30-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi schools have to admit EWS category kids as per allotment: Sisodia||Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday announced that city’s private schools have to admit students from economically weaker section (EWS) category even if there were no general category admissions in those schools this year.Under the Right to Education Act, 25% of seats in entry-level classes -- nursery, KG, and I -- in all private schools are to be reserved for the EWS/Disadvantaged group (DG) category. Private schools declare the seats to the Directorate of Education every year and the education department conducts a draw of lots to allot EWS seats. In practice, schools admit one EWS student from the government’s allotted list for every three general category students admitted by them.“Around 32,500 EWS seats have been allotted to different schools based on the draw of lots this year. Usually, EWS parents can go and get their children admitted to private schools. Schools conduct one EWS admission for every three general category admissions,” Sisodia said.While talking about how the Covid-19 pandemic has derailed admissions for general category students due to multiple reasons, Sisodia said, “Many parents approach me saying that though their child’s name appeared on the list, schools are denying admission as there has been no general category admissions this year. The government has now decided that even if there are no general category admissions yet, the EWS students have to be admitted to the private schools as per the allotted list.”EWS students are entitled to free textbooks, writing material, and uniforms till Class 8, for which the government reimburses a fixed amount. The education minister said, “The government provides ₹2,260 per month to these schools for each EWS student for fee and other expenses. We are ordering schools that they conduct EWS admissions even if there have been no general category admissions and the government will reimburse them accordingly,” he said.He said since education is likely to continue in online mode for the time being, the Delhi government schools are organising a special parent-teacher meeting between July 19 and 31.“Parents are requested to go to the school so that the teachers are able to guide them on their role in the online mode of learning. For class 6 students, the government has decided to rope in teachers from municipal corporation schools as well,” he said.This will ensure a smooth transition from municipal corporation schools to Delhi government schools. Every year, around 170,000 students move from municipal schools -- that offer education only up to Class 5 -- to government schools in Class 6. Before the pandemic, students and parents interacted with the government school teachers as soon as classes started. However, since the pandemic has caused activities to move online, it was necessary to conduct this PTM with teachers who have previously taught the child in classes 4 and 5, Sisodia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-schools-have-to-admit-ews-category-kids-as-per-allotmentsisodia-101625046260795.html

30-06-2021||Chandigarh||Sukhbir, Sidhu spar over misguided missile attack||Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal and Punjab Congress MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu sparred on Wednesday after the former caustically called the cricketer-turned-politician “a misguided missile”. Addressing mediapersons after paying obeisance at Golden Temple with his wife and former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, Sukhbir said: “Sidhu is a misguided missile, which has no control. It can hit anywhere, including himself.” Also read: Punjab MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu meets Priyanka GandhiThe SAD chief was replying to a question related to Sidhu’s criticism of Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh over the probe into the 2015 sacrilege incidents. Sukhbir, who was the state deputy chief minister and held the home portfolio at that time, was questioned in the Kotkapura firing case by the Punjab Police special investigation team in Chandigarh on Saturday. “Over the past 25 years, Sidhu hasn’t been loyal to anyone. He deserted cricket, left the BJP and turned to the Congress only to criticise its leaders. Earlier, he would make Prime Minister Narendra Modi happy with a few dialogues and now he uses the same dialogues for Congress president Sonia Gandhi,” the Akali leader said, adding, “Punjab doesn’t need a dramatic actor like him. Punjab needs a sober person to lead it for its progress and development.” Sidhu, who earlier in the day announced his “long meeting” with Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in New Delhi, promptly took to Twitter to hit back at his Akali rival, saying that his aim was to destroy Sukhbir’s “corrupt business”. “Guided and aimed at you to destroy your corrupt businesses. Until your Sukh Vilas built on Punjab’s ruins is not turned into a public school & public hospital to serve Punjab’s poor, I won’t relent!” the firebrand Congress leader posted on the microblogging site. Kejriwal making fake promises on power: SukhbirOn Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s promise of free power in Punjab if the Aam Aadmi Party is voted to power next year, Sukhbir said instead of making electricity free up to 300 units in the national capital, the AAP chief has been making fake promises in Punjab. “The Delhi government has been providing only 200 units of free electricity, but its CM is promising 300 free units in Punjab. Moreover, the 200 units being provided to poor people are out of the free electricity scheme when power is consumed over and above 200 units. In Punjab, 200 units of electricity are already free,” Sukhbir said. He said, “Kejriwal doesn’t know anything about Punjab. He is speaking about providing 24-hour power supply. He must know that round-the-clock electricity supply was given by our government.” Farmers facing brunt of power cuts Criticising the Capt Amarinder Singh government, he said it had failed to run all thermal plants. “Power plants need maintenance. Due to poor planning, farmers are getting only four-hour electricity supply instead of the promised eight hours for sowing paddy. When our government was in power, we provided eight-hour electricity to the farmers. Besides, the state government has stopped canal water for farmers, especially in the border areas,” he said. He criticised the shortage of vaccines to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. “The shortage of vaccine in the state is a concern. The state government should ensure adequate vaccine for all,” Sukhbir added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/navjot-singh-sidhu-a-misguided-missile-akali-chief-sukhbir-101625043140732.html
30-06-2021||Kolkata||TMC MP Mimi Chakraborty recovering now after falling prey to fake vaccine camp||Trinamool MP Mimi Chakraborty who had to be hospitalised a day after she reportedly fell prey to a fake vaccine racket in Kolkata is recovering and is fine now. On Wednesday, the MP took to Instagram and posted her health updates where she said that she was doing well and her gall bladder issue will also be fine in some time."If u ask me how worst days look like well I have just experienced it and consequences were pain, physically and mentally," the MP wrote and then thanked her followers on the social media platform.The actor-turned-politician fell ill on Saturday and was admitted to a hospital, a few days after she was reportedly administered some fake vaccine.According to reports, the actor-politician was invited to a vaccination camp in the city, which was organised by Debanjan Deb, who impersonated as a joint commissioner of the civic body, Kolkata Municipal Corporation. The MP took a dose of the vaccine from the camp but received no SMS from Co-Win, which made her suspicious about the entire set-up. After she raised an alarm, the fake vaccination racket, which organised another vaccination camp in the city, was busted. Debanjan Deb has been slapped with a charge of an attempt to murder, though he claimed that the vaccines were not fake and he had written to Serum Institute of India seeking vaccines.The fake vaccination apparently has no connection with Trinamool MP's illness as she had some gallbladder issues from before. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has recently commented on the issue and said that the government has no role in organising the vaccination drive. She said she had also spoken to Mimi to enquire about her health. She has a gall bladder-related problem, the chief minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tmc-mp-mimi-chakraborty-recovering-now-after-falling-prey-to-fake-vaccine-camp-101625041897152.html
30-06-2021||Delhi||World Asteroid Day: Delhi youngsters peer into the sky for asteroids||While skywatching is a hobby for some and a distant dream for others, some youngsters in the Capital are peering at the sky to learn about the keys of the cosmos. On World Asteroid Day, some young asteroid discoverers tell us what makes them, in a world of video games and social media, go on asteroid quests.For 18-year-old Shubham Gupta, who is anxiously waiting for his board exam results, Delhi’s resident young astronomer Aryan Mishra’s lecture on the subject. two years ago, opened up the world of amateur astronomy. “I was in 10th grade when Mishra sir set up Delhi’s first astronomy lab in our school. I soon immersed myself in the equipments, reading voraciously about planets, stars and more. During the pandemic, I participated in an asteroid search campaign online, where we analyse astronomical data given by the International Astronomical Search Collaboration (IASC) — an online scientific programme that helps youngsters discover near-Earth objects,” says Gupta. After seven preliminary discoveries, Gupta finally found one asteroid for which he was granted a provisional certificate this June. “Now, this asteroid’s orbit will be tracked by NASA and other space agencies. The discovery has emboldened me to pursue my dream of studying more about space,” he adds. A similar interest in space inspired 16-year-old Delhiite Kshitiz Goel to pursue astronomy under the guidance of his teachers at school. “I was immersed in my studies, since this is my board exam year, and between the stress of economics and accounts, astronomy is what gave me some respite. My sister and I would spend time discussing about planets and stars, so I decided to spend my summer vacations looking for asteroids,” says Goel, who has discovered two asteroids. “For five days after my study was confirmed, I was in utter disbelief,” he shares.“All kids need now is a stable internet connection and a will to learn,” says Mishra, who had made the headlines after discovering an asteroid at the age of 14. He is now a 21-year-old college student mentoring youngsters across Delhi and setting up astronomy labs across the country. “There are various platforms, websites where youngsters can help professional astronomers discover galaxies and learn more about space,” he adds.How they discover asteroids:- Enthusiasts can use original datasets from Pan-STARRS telescope in Hawaii and analyse the data through a software called Astrometrica.- When a participant discovers a moving object, it is called a preliminary discovery in the process of asteroid hunting. - After the object is observed twice, it is called a provisional discovery, which gives the asteroid the provisional name.- It takes three to six years to make more observations and discover the orbit of the object. After this, the astronomical body is moved to numbered status and can be named by the student discoverers!Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/world-asteroid-day-delhi-youngsters-peer-into-the-sky-for-asteroids-101625041700850.html

30-06-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu meets Priyanka Gandhi||A day after former Congress president Rahul Gandhi declined plans of meeting Navjot Singh Sidhu in New Delhi, the Punjab MLA tweeted a photo with party leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and declared the two had a “long meeting”. Though the former Punjab minister’s office claimed that Sidhu had been called to Delhi for a meeting with Rahul, sources said no meeting was fixed between Rahul and Sidhu. Also read: No meeting was scheduled with Sidhu, says Rahul GandhiRahul, the former Congress president, said on Tuesday, “There is no meeting. I don’t know what fuss you are making.” He made the remark while leaving his Tughlaq Lane residence in Delhi. However, the party sources said that there was speculation that Sidhu, who was camping in the national capital, may meet Rahul and Priyanka soon. The two siblings are trying to bring all Congress leaders, including Sidhu, on a common platform and present a united Congress ahead of the elections early next year. Quelling infighting in Punjab Congress Rahul has been meeting leaders from Punjab over the past few days amid the infighting in the state Congress and ahead of a revamp of the party and the state cabinet. The Congress leadership is all set for a revamp of the state unit ahead of the assembly elections. Rahul Gandhi has met ministers, MLAs and MPs, including Brahm Mohindra, Vijay Inder Singla, Balbir Singh Sidhu and Rajya Sabha member Shamsher Singh Dullo and MLA Lakhvir Singh Lakha. He has already met state Congress chief Sunil Jakhar and Rajya Sabha member and former Punjab Congress chief Partap Singh Bajwa. At loggerheads with Punjab CM Sidhu, who had resigned from the Punjab cabinet after he was divested of the local bodies portfolio in 2019, has been at loggerheads with chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh. He has attacked the chief minister over the alleged delay in justice in the 2015 incidents of sacrilege and subsequent police firing. Singh had slammed Sidhu for continuously attacking him over the sacrilege issue and termed the former’s outbursts “total indiscipline”. Early this month, Sidhu appeared before a three-member panel set up by the Congress to resolve the infighting within the party’s state unit. On June 22, Capt Amarinder Singh appeared before the panel, headed by Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, in Delhi. However, he returned to Chandigarh without an audience with party president Sonia Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi. AICC general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat and former MP J P Aggarwal are members of the panel.

30-06-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The return of Kaushambi biryani||The lane is littered with empty carts. This stretch of Kaushambi at the congested Delhi-UP border in Anand Vihar used to be crammed with super busy mobile street food establishments. The smoggy air would smell of diesel, but one could also get the whiff of freshly fried parathas, pickles and chutneys. One stall made yummy pooris served with rasse wali aloo subzi. Many carts offered various adaptations of biryani. The most extraordinary was Uttaranchal Dhaba, owned by a fellow from that hill state, which was the only eatery here with a large table, around which folks would settle down to wholesome thali meals with garma-garam phulkas. Then the second surge began.Now our world is reopening, again. The informal food lane, mostly serving the passengers of the adjacent bus terminal, is starting to show a few signs of life, though the blue awning of a chhole bhature stall is still lying collapsed upon the counter, as if the sky had fallen upon the place. Nearby, the hopeful owner of Sharma food cart is repainting his cart. Shiv Mahima Parathe Wale has dozens of parathas on a thali beside a pile of deep-fried green chilies. And one of the area’s best biryani carts, too, is back.Shiv Shudh Shakahari Biryani has shudh shakahari, pure vegetarian, ingredients—matar, paneer, soya chaap and gobhi. Rishab bhai, the cart owner, makes the dish at home in Indirapuram. This late morning the biryani is inside a huge deg, or cauldron. On lifting the lid, you glimpse at steaming saffron-shaded rice cratered with vegetables and whole green chilies. A second layer of vegetables is buried deep under the rice. Rishab bhai serves by thrusting his ladle vertically into the biryani, so that both the layers of veggies come out in the single serving—much like the way you might eat tiramisu, getting all its many delicious layers in every single bite. Each spoonful of the biryani transports you anew into a fresh gust of taste and fragrance.The area has a few other biryani stalls too, but they are yet to open. During the second surge, Rishab bhai was hibernating at his village in Bulandshahr, UP. His recently married brother runs a similar cart in nearby Ghazipur. Both serve the same biryani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-return-of-kaushambi-biryani-101625010328190.html

In the present case, I do not see any reason for believing that the petitioner is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail,” the judge added.He also pointed out that “such people need to be dealt with firmly and no sympathy should be shown to them”. The state counsel had earlier said if the accused was granted bail, he was likely to go absconding and even temper with the prosecution evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-rejects-bail-plea-of-man-held-with-2-300-intoxicating-tablets-in-tarn-taran-101624995799412.html

The victim, Ravin Bachu Korda, fell from the tree after he lost balance due to the shock after being struck by lightning, while his three other friends also received minor burns and fractures after falling down. Two boys are admitted in the government hospital at Kasa, while another boy is admitted to Vedant Hospital at Dhundalwadi. “The injured have been identified as Mehul Anil Mankar, 14, Deepesh Sandip Korda, 14, and Chetan Mohan Korda, 13,” said Dahanu tehsildar Rahul Sarang.“We are analysing the situation in regard to the issuance of compensation to the victim. But as per the recent GR (government resolution) we can award can natural disaster compensation only if the area received more than 65mm of rainfall. But on Monday, the area did not receive that much rainfall and hence, we are studying the situation for the compensation claim. My team is at the village in this regard and a report is awaited,” said Sarang. Residents of the villages in the Wada-Dahanu belt climb on teakwood trees to catch signals on their mobile handsets as there is no mobile network in the these areas. “Even students climb trees to check their results. Villagers choose only teakwood tree because it is the tallest in the area and its branches are strong. The Centre has digitalised all transactions but we are still living in the early years when mobile network was new in our country. Due to weak network, we are compelled to climb the tall teakwood trees and talk. It’s a huge risk as there are chances of falling and suffering fractures or even dying, especially during the monsoons,” said Shashi Thakur, a resident of the area.“Our grampanchayats have written letters to all service providers to improve network by building mobile towers, but there is no response from them,” said Vasant Bhoir, another resident.“The mobile handsets are of no use as there is no or poor network but we have to recharge our phones to talk to our relatives, internet and hence we have to climb onto trees,” said Machindra Agiwale, a journalist with a leading Marathi newspaper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/boy-struck-by-lightning-while-searching-for-mobile-network-in-maharashtra-s-dahanu-101624995797814.html

Two brothers from Kandivli have been arrested by Virar police in the case.“On June 17, he had taken the accused to Panvel, for which he charged them ₹700. But near Panvel, the brothers told him to take them to Khandala and agreed to pay ₹5000,” the missing complaint filed by Jha’s son Prem, 22, stated. “A fight broke out between Jha and the passengers over fuel near Khandala toll.

30-06-2021||Chandigarh||Kejriwal’s promise of free power may cost Punjab ₹5,000 crore a year||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal’s promise of providing 300 units of electricity free to every household every month if his party forms government in Punjab will have a significant budgetary ramification for the state exchequer as the annual power subsidy bill is likely to cross ₹15,000 crore from the existing ₹10,668 crore.The state has a total of 80 lakh power consumers of which 50% are already availing subsidy. The Delhi chief minister’s announcement, if implemented, will make all the consumers eligible for subsidy. The AAP government in the national capital has been able to sustain the free power subsidy for Delhi residents through a significant reduction in losses due to electricity theft. Also, the Congress high command’s instructions to the Amarinder Singh government to consider giving 200 units of free power to urban domestic consumers will also enhance the subsidy burden if the proposal is implemented.If the next government gives free 300 units to all domestic consumers, the total domestic subsidy will touch the highest in country. Of ₹10,668 crore power subsidy bill for the current financial year in Punjab, ₹6,735 crore is in free electricity for farmers. The subsidy for free 200 units to SC/BC/BPL domestic consumers is ₹1,627 crore. At present, the number of domestic consumers getting 200 units of free power is around 15 lakh. “Though exact calculations can’t be made right now, this will increase the power subsidy bill by another ₹5,000 crore even by conservative estimates,” said VK Gupta, a power sector expert. “But here the catch is that you have to pay the entire bill if the consumption crosses beyond 300 units,” he added.A senior corporation official said, “Delhi gives ₹1,600 crore annual power subsidy while we already are giving over ₹10,000 crore for the same. The subsidy amount ultimately comes from the pockets of consumers. But it is not good either for the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) or the power sector on the whole.”Earlier, the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) in its tariff order announced a reduction of 50 paise to ₹1 per unit for domestic consumers in the state. The move resulted in a relief to 69.15 lakh consumers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kejriwals-promise-of-free-power-may-cost-punjab-rs-5-000-crore-a-year-101624995683670.html
30-06-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab running out of vaccine stock, no clarity on fresh supply of doses||With Punjab running out of Covishield vaccine stock on Tuesday and left with 1.12 lakh doses of Covaxin, only 29,589 jabs were administered on Tuesday and there was no clarity on the state getting fresh supply from the Centre . “There has not been any communication from the Centre about allocation of fresh doses of Covishield for Wednesday. The state is likely to get 60,000 Covaxin doses in the next couple of days,” a senior government official involved in the inoculation drive said. The demand for the Covishield is more in the state and a large number of people, especially the international travellers, are shying away from taking the Covaxin dose. The Centre’s vaccine data reveals that the state was scheduled to get 21 lakh doses of Covishield and Covaxin in June but got only 17 lakh doses till Tuesday. For private hospitals in Punjab, the Centre has proposed 6.25 lakh doses. But there was a poor response from private hospitals as they booked only 60,000 doses. “Of the 60,000 doses for which the private hospitals have already made payment, not a single dose has arrived in the state,” said a senior official. Chief minister Amarinder Singh has reiterated the demand for more jabs from the Centre to vaccinate the entire 18-45 age group to complete the vaccination of all eligible persons in the next two months. Even as he ordered opening of vaccination to the entire population in the 18-45 age group, the CM said focus will remain on covering the categories prioritised earlier. Currently, 4.8% of Punjab’s eligible population is fully vaccinated, with Mohali district leading the chart. The CM said the state government had already vaccinated 62 lakh eligible persons and was utilising the stock without any wastage. “The state had been repeatedly taking up the issue of inadequate doses with the Union government. I will take up the matter again with the Union health minister on urgent basis and also the Prime Minister, if needed,” said Amarinder. State health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu questioned the BJP-ruled states like Haryana and Gujarat received the lion’s share of doses from the Centre. 98% protection among police personnel after 2 doses Citing a study on the Punjab Police showing 98% protection among their personnel after receiving two doses of vaccine, Amarinder asked the health and medical education departments to continue monitoring vaccine efficacy in the light of the new variants of concern. Of around 79,000 Punjab Police personnel having been vaccinated so far, 57% have received the second dose. The study, conducted between February 3 and June 28, showed that of the total deaths during this period 15 were of those not vaccinated at all, nine of those who had received one dose, and only two who were fully vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-running-out-of-vaccine-stock-no-clarity-on-fresh-supply-of-doses-101624995681622.html
30-06-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana MC panel to explore viability of reusing 37 defunct buses||The municipal corporation (MC) commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal has formed a committee to look into the possibilities of bringing into use the 37 city buses worth 17 crores that have been lying defunct in the depot on Tajpur Road for years. The committee has been directed to submit a viability report regarding what will be the cost of taking up the repair work and whether the civic body will be able to successfully operate the buses in the city area.The decision was taken during the meeting of the Board of Directors of Ludhiana City Bus Service Limited held at MC Zone D office on Tuesday.The buses have been dumped at the site for over eight years now and are lying in a dilapidated condition with many of their parts stolen in the past. They are gathering dust with burst tyres and weed all around. Tall claims had been made by Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Congress to revive the buses during their respective tenures in the MC house, but nothing was done at the ground level.The project was started in February 2011 with the target of introducing 200 buses under the Jawahar Lal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), but the authorities have not been able to properly run the 120 buses which were purchased then. Out of the 120 buses, only 83 were transferred to the contractor who is currently running the service in the city, and 37 are gathering dust at the depot.The contractor informed that only ten buses are being run in the city owing to the losses incurred by him amid the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-mc-panel-to-explore-viability-of-reusing-37-defunct-buses-101624995678372.html

Over 1,100 metric tonnes (MT) of garbage is generated in the city on a daily basis and MC has been paying ₹324 per tonne as the tipping fee to the company. Citing hike in diesel price and maintenance expenses, the company has now demanded that the civic body should at least pay ₹435 per tonne.Mayor Balkar Sandhu convened a meeting with MC officials in this regard at his camp office on Tuesday, following which a committee was formed to look into the matter. The committee comprises senior deputy mayor Sham Sundar Malhotra, leader of opposition in MC House Harbhajan Singh Dang, councillors Jai Prakash and Yashpal Chaudhary besides few civic body’s health branch officials.The panel has been asked to find out the viability of lifting the garbage by MC on its own and look into the demand of the company.As per the information, the company had sent the ultimatum to MC on June 10, but the civic body took it into consideration at the last minute. One of the officials, who wished to remain anonymous, said it will be a herculean task for the MC to lift the garbage on its own as it has no machinery, such as tippers, required for transporting the trash to the main dumping site on Tajpur Road. The civic body has already been facing the wrath of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) over its failure in dealing with solid waste properly.A member of the committee and leader of opposition in MC house, SAD councillor Harbhajan Singh Dang said the panel is deliberating on the possibilities to continue the lifting process and the report will be presented before mayor Balkar Sandhu on Wednesday. Mayor Sandhu said the final decision will be taken after going through the report of the committee. MC is also working to hire a new contractor for solid waste management in the city, he added. As per the sources, MC is deliberating on increasing the tipping fee till the time a new contractor is hired. A2Z company had terminated its contract with MC on February 4 and the civic body made a stopgap arrangement by roping in the third party to whom A2Z company had sublet the work of lifting garbage from the city. The BJP councillors had earlier targeted mayor Balkar Sandhu for allegedly favouring the contractor. Garbage collectors dump the waste collected from houses at over 40 secondary garbage dumping points in the city. Tipping fee is paid to the company for shifting the garbage from secondary dumps to the main site of MC on Tajpur Road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/firm-roped-in-for-garbage-lifting-in-ludhiana-seeks-revision-of-tipping-fee-101624995621678.html

The new cyber cell consists of offices for ACP Cyber 1 and 2. This would allow better and efficient distribution of work. Moreover, new hardware and software infrastructure will be added to the cyber lab to ensure quick, timebound redressal of complaints and technical and scientific investigation in cases of cybercrime. The police chief added that along with enhancing the capabilities of Ludhiana police, this upgrade would create an overall public friendly environment by providing better facilities. “Moreover, it would ensure greater privacy to the complainants which would encourage more and more people, especially women, to reach out to us,” he added. Agrawal said they had been receiving about 300-400 complaints every month. Despite this huge workload and impact of Covid-induced lockdowns, the cyber cell has had an impressive performance in 2020, he added. Nearly 1,700 complaints have been disposed of resulting in the registration of 28 FIRs in 2020. The cyber cell has ensured recovery of about ₹40 lakh in the past one year as well, Agrawal said. The police have been relying on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to spread awareness among the public regarding various types of cybercrimes like ATM frauds, credit card frauds, cyber bullying, blackmailing, OTP frauds, and child pornography among others. Besides this, the police chief said, the cyber crime unit (CCU) is also receiving complaints through National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal which is functioning under the Cyber Crime Prevention against Women and Children scheme.The commissioner also warned the citizens against sharing their personal and financial details with anyone and urged them to update the privacy settings of their social media profiles to prevent misuse. He said people can lodge their complaints on the official email id (cp.ldh.police@punjab.gov.in) or can approach the cyber cell Ludhiana directly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/tech-boost-to-ludhiana-police-as-new-improved-cyber-cell-starts-operation-101624995619521.html
30-06-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab’s largest Transport Nagar cries for attention||Despite tall claims made by the Ludhiana civic body regarding development and cleanliness drives, the area touted as the largest Transport Nagar of Punjab lies in a state of despair with deep potholes, waterlogged roads, garbage strewn across lanes and choked sewer lines. With the advent of monsoon, the transporters are set to bear the brunt for civic body’s apathy this year too. Spread across 114 acres, Transport Nagar caters to 1,200 transporters who run their business in the area where over 1,000 trucks move in and out on daily basis. Frequent breakdowns are reported due to poor condition of roads, which have not been rebuilt for over a decade, say transporters. They add that the sector is already reeling under losses due to the pandemic and the filthy conditions coupled with serious waterlogging witnessed in the area are not only taking a toll on their business, but also on their health. Press secretary of Ludhiana Goods Transport Association, Jagdish Jassowal, said, “Roads here have not been repaired for the last at least 12 years and accidents take place often due to deep potholes. Frequent breakdowns are also reported, especially after waterlogging when potholes are not visible to the truckers. Sometimes, a breakdown costs around ₹5,000 to a transporter and it becomes difficult to meet these additional expenses during the pandemic, when many of the transporters are struggling to make ends meet. Last week too, we faced major inconvenience after rain.” “Many of the carts and rickshaws tend to overturn on uneven paths, due to which goods get damaged. Many of us refrain from bringing our private cars here fearing potholes,” he added.A transporter, Sarabjit Singh, said, “Transport Nagar is a low-lying area and failure of authorities to clean the sewer lines and an internal drain (nullah) passing through the locality results in waterlogging. Sewer lines have been clogged for years, but no one is paying heed to the problem. Accumulated rainwater from adjoining areas like Industrial Area-A also flows into Transport Nagar. Silt and garbage can be seen spread at every nook and corner of the area, due to which foul smell also gets emancipated in the vicinity.”Encroachments irks transportersA large number of encroachments in the form of kiosks and dhabas also irk the transporters as they face shortage of space to park trucks. They rue that sewer connections of such establishments have been attached to sewer lines illegally, resulting in blockage. Transporters say that the authorities had been working on the plans to shift the Transport Nagar out of the MC limits, but nothing concrete has yet been announced regarding the same. They claim that they have at multiple instances approached the authorities, including mayor Balkar Sandhu, in the past more than a year, but nothing could save them from suffering due to waterlogging and potholed roads during the monsoon this year. President of the association, Didar Singh, said, “There is not even a single patch of road without potholes in Transport Nagar. During monsoon, it becomes difficult to reach our offices due to waterlogging. Mayor Balkar Sandhu also visited the area last year and assured that road construction will commence soon, but to no avail. We are forced to work in pitiable conditions and are planning to meet the authorities again.” Meanwhile, mayor Balkar Sandhu said tenders for different projects worth crores have been approved for development of Transport Nagar as MLA Surinder Dawar had also expressed concern over the same in the past. He is pursuing the case, he added. MLA Dawar also said that tenders for development projects worth over ₹6 crore have already been floated for construction of roads and other projects. “A delegation of transporters apprised me of the problems recently, following which I also convened a meeting with the mayor. The work will soon commence at the ground level. Directions have also been issued to officials to clean the sewer lines and accumulated silt and garbage in the area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjabs-largest-transport-nagar-cries-for-attention-101624995618409.html

No doubt, all the statements of the victim speak about penetrative sexual assault. However, initially she claimed that she has been assaulted by her maternal uncle and in her other statement, she claimed that it was her father and another maternal uncle,” said the court.The court added that as the girl was in the custody of the child welfare committee, there was no possibility of the father contacting her.The case was registered at JJ Marg police station on June 29 last year by the girl’s paternal aunt wherein she alleged that she was sexually assaulted by her maternal uncle. During the investigation, it was revealed that, there was a dispute between the girl’s parents. Her mother had taken her to her maternal house on June 13, 2020, and returned after two days.On June 28, 2020, the girl disclosed to her paternal aunt that while they were at their maternal house, her maternal uncle sexually abused her. The family lodged the case against the maternal uncle on the next day.On July 20, 2020, the girl made a statement that her father has sexually assaulted her and also threatened that she should not disclose the incident to anybody. She also alleged that she was forced to take name of her maternal uncle and later claimed that another maternal uncle abused her when she was in Class 1.The prosecution objected to the plea claiming that the medical evidence shows that the girl was subjected to sexual abuse. The father, however, claimed his wife was suffering from a mental disorder and was hospitalised. Further, they claimed that the girl was subjected to sexual abuse by her maternal uncle and he was falsely implicated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-man-booked-for-sexually-assaulting-daughter-gets-bail-101624995197735.html

The plea was withdrawn with a liberty to file a fresh one, if there is a cause for the same.The government’s move announcing jobs to two Congress MLAs’ sons earlier this month had resulted in a big political storm, and even people from within the party had opposed it. Subsequently, it is learnt one of the MLAs has turned down the government offer. The jobs were offered to the sons of Fateh Jung Bajwa and Rakesh Pandey, bringing them under the ambit of terror-affected families. Bajwa’s son was offered a job of an inspector and Pandey’s son of a naib tehsildar.The plea had argued that only C and D category jobs could be given under compassionate appointments policy and not group A and B. Further, it was also argued that these appointments have to be made “immediately” and not after 20-30 years as happened in this case. He had also argued that under the compassionate appointments policy, the grandchildren are not covered, hence the government decision is illegal and liable to be set aside.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pil-challenging-jobs-to-kin-of-punjab-mlas-withdrawn-101624995079352.html
30-06-2021||Chandigarh||HC stays order on name change of Amritsar mall||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday stayed an order passed by the Amritsar district administration asking a shopping mall not to use the word Ambarsar in its name.The court of justice Lisa Gill acted on the plea of VR Ambarsar Mall who had challenged the deputy commissioner order of April 23. A response from the state government has been sought by October 10, while staying the impugned order.As per the petitioner, it purchased “Trillium Mall” and renamed it as it became part of the Virtuous Retail Group. The name was changed to VR Ambarsar keeping in view the fact that it is a colloquial name of the city and is close to the hearts of its inhabitants. Initially, the mall received a complaint in July-August 2020, against using this name and subsequently, the complainant moved the district administration, which passed the order in question.Senior advocate Chetan Mittal had told the court that the Amritsar city is colloquially known as Ambarsar. The word Ambarsar has also been used in various movies, shops, songs, etc. There is a market which is also known as Ambarsar Bazaar. Ambarsariya Di Hatti and Ambarsar Badiyaan have been used at various places and there is no bar in using the word Ambarsar as per the Emblems and Names Act (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950, he had argued.The court was further told that IK Gujral Punjab Technical University, Amritsar campus, which is a state university, has also referred that the city is colloquially known as Ambarsar. “There are various news articles and social media pages which claim that the word Ambarsar is an emotion and not just a word and they prefer to call it so. There are various cities with colloquial names like Benaras for Varanasi and Delhi is also known as Dilli,” he had told the court adding that the action did not mean that the city’s name has been changed.The court was also told that there was nothing reflected in the order and the complainant – Jai Punjab Welfare Society, has referred in the complaint as hurting the religious sentiments. Otherwise, there is no such prohibition in any of the Acts.

ADGP internal security RN Dhoke, IG border range SPS Parmar and DIG BSF Prabhakar Joshi, along with about 8 BSF Commandants among others were present in the meeting.Giving a call for total synergy and teamwork between BSF and Punjab Police, he said that it was high time that both the elite forces worked as one and activated good-old human intelligence by gathering and sharing real-time information.He asked the BSF officials to share sector-wise inputs of movements of suspected persons with the Punjab Police so that they can keep a sharp vigil on their activities and ensure penal action against such elements.The DGP directed the SSPs of Gurdaspur, Batala and Pathankot to list out border villages and develop a robust intelligence network by ensuring close collaboration between the police, public, Guardians of Governance, NGOs etc in every village so that they promptly notify about any criminal activity taking place in their villages.He also gave instructions to increase the police checkpoints, especially at night, in their respective jurisdictions and ensure checking of maximum vehicles.DGP Dinkar Gupta also ordered the SSPs to list out and take action against all the proclaimed offenders (POs), bail jumpers and absconders in NDPS Act, Arms Act and UAPA. He also directed them to ramp up the drug recoveries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-dgp-calls-for-synergy-between-bsf-police-to-counter-drone-threat-101624995025331.html

Crimes involving amounts under ₹10 crore will be investigated by police stations. Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale issued a standing order to this effect on Monday and directed all the 100 police stations in Mumbai to follow the rule with immediate effect.Cases involving amounts less than ₹10 crore but are complex in nature and require specialised skills in investigation as well as those having social/inter-state ramifications may be investigated by EOW with prior permission of the police commissioner. The local police need to send a proposal for such cases to the commissioner for an approval of transfer. The branch investigates banking frauds, company’s frauds, scams in government projects, multi-level marketing or investment frauds, housing frauds, general cheating, etc.“Investigating officers of other cases of financial crimes at police stations seek timely guidance from senior EOW officers. The joint commissioner of police, EOW, may call for papers of any case of economic offences that is being investigated by the local police, for scrutiny and proper directions in investigation,” stated the commissioner’s order. The complaints of such frauds of more than ₹10 crore should be sent to EOW office with the complainant to avoid delay after registration and transfer. “The move intends to reduce the burden on the agency. EOW is a special investigation agency and it must only investigate cases that are complex in nature and require a dedicated probe. These would include cases of mass cheating, or those involving multiple companies, banks or state boundaries. Simple cheating or fraud cases can be probed at the police stations, even if it involves a huge amount,” said an EOW inspector. In 2018, EOW – the specialised branch that investigates major financial scam and banking frauds – registered 123 cases involving financial frauds worth ₹4,072.11 crore. The department registered 110 cases involving white-collar crimes, worth ₹34,219.84 crore, in 2019. Subsequently, last year, amid the pandemic, EOW officers lodged 57 financial frauds cases worth ₹9,681.48 crore. This year, the wing has probed 58 such cases involving ₹2,223.90 crore. Previously, police stations used to probe crimes below ₹6 crore. Initially the amount to be probed by police stations was limited to ₹50 lakh as per a special order dated March 29, 2007. It was raised to ₹3 crore in May 2014, when EOW was a part of the Mumbai crime branch. The government separated EOW from the crime branch vide a government resolution dated May 27, 2016, and appointed a joint commissioner of police-rank Indian Police Service (IPS) officer to head the wing, like the crime branch.“With the changing scenario in crimes, it is imperative to strengthen the economic offences wing in terms of efficiency and maintain quality standards by modifications in earlier orders in this regard. Mumbai being the financial capital of India is a perennial target of economic offenders. Due to rapid globalisation and advancement in technology, it has become feasible for offenders to commit financial crimes from any corner of the world. Also, the number of cases, quantum of property involved and impact of such crimes has increased significantly in the past few years,” a senior police officer said.“Though the major portion of such cases is handled by the EOW effectively, to meet multifarious and increasing challenges in financial crimes, it needs to take up selected cases for in depth and scientific investigation. Following this guideline, the lower limit of cases to be taken up for investigation by EOW was raised to ₹6 crore on September 13, 2018. It has now been increased to ₹10 crore and above, the officer added.According to an officer from the agency, the move will benefit victims of fraud up to ₹10 crore, as they no longer need to visit the EOW headquarters at Crawford Market but can instead lodge a complaint at the local police station and follow it up there. “As Mumbai is the financial capital of the country, many corporate giants, financial institutes and banks are headquartered in the city. This is one of the reasons why fraudsters, especially those involved in Ponzi schemes, target the city,” said another police officer. In April, Nagrale had transferred 13 police officers serving in EOW for over five years to side branches. More officers who served in the branch for more than four years are slated to be moved soon in the upcoming general transfers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/eow-to-probe-financial-matters-worth-10-crore-or-more-mumbai-police-commissioner-101624995025900.html

However, the authorities of the centre refused to admit them citing the illnesses.“Being denied treatment and rehabilitation disappointed the victims. We suspect that all four addicts might be HIV positive, but it is the responsibility of the administration to rehabilitate them,” said Vikramjit Singh Sidhu, chief of Youth Power Group.“The families of these addicts, who hail from a locality notorious for drug abuse, approached us. We rushed to admit them. We demand that the administration organise a medical camp for all residents of the area,” he added.A 26-year-old drug addict said they used to consume chitta, but when one of his friends died due to drug overdose in the past, he realised it was time to seek help or there would be no one to take care of his little daughter if he too meets the same fate as his friend’s.Red Cross De-addiction Centre project director Mohan Sharma said that two youths were HIV positive and had hepatitis C and they were referred to civil hospital as such patients can’t be admitted to rehabilitation centre.DC Ramvir said all men who wanted rehab would be admitted and given free treatment.Civil surgeon Anjana Gupta said she has received the details of these addicts and one was suffering from HIV. “We have sent our teams and they will be given treatment soon. However, their relatives and friends will be screened,” added CS Gupta.Deputy superintendent of police (rural) Satpal Sharma said they have already declared the concerned locality as a hotspot for drugs. “Two drug addicts and their fathers were also facing cases under the NDPS Act. If these men want rehab with the help of an NGO, the police will help them,” added Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hiv-ve-drug-addicts-struggling-to-get-help-in-sangrur-101624995021790.html

The announcement came a day after Samant called for a virtual meeting with vice-chancellors of all state universities to discuss fee reduction, considering the economic slowdown that has affected families across the nation.“Students who have lost their father/mother/parents to Covid-19 will not have to pay their fees until the completion of their UG or PG course. We are also waiving off miscellaneous fees for other students in the coming academic year,” Samant said in a press conference held in the city on Tuesday evening. He added that fees charged for gymkhana, extra-curricular activities, college magazine, sports fund, computer, medical aid fund as well as youth festival, which are anyway subsidised, will be waived off in full for the upcoming year. “As maintenance of laboratories and libraries and purchase of e-content has already been invested by colleges, a 50% discount will be applied on these charges. However, as the dormitories are not being used by students, dormitory charges will also be waived off,” added Samant.While students and parents have welcomed the move, it has received mixed reactions from colleges affiliated with state universities. “Full waiver will affect unaided colleges, because we depend on fees to pay salaries to our staff. Thankfully, the government will be reimbursing tuition and development fees for such students to colleges, because unlike aided colleges where salaries are paid by the government, expenses in unaided colleges are bore by the management,” said T A Shiware, chairman of Mumbai Association of Non-Government Colleges. He, however, added that this decision is a good move to support students affected by Covid-19. Last week, Samant had announced a rebate of ₹16,250 to engineering students from government-aided institutes for not using the library, gymkhana and other facilities on campus, as students have not attended physical classes in over a year. This decision will benefit nearly 20,000 students across the state.In the press conference, Samant clarified that tuition and development fees levied by aided as well as unaided colleges will not be discounted. “Only miscellaneous fees including gymkhana, computer fees, sports fee, medical fund etc will be discounted,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ug-pg-students-who-lost-parents-to-covid-19-to-get-full-fee-waiver-maharashtra-edu-minister-101624994657774.html

The batch of students admitted to undergraduate programmes this year will become the first beneficiaries of this programme when they graduate to their second year in 2022.Students will continue to be admitted through the Joint Entrance Exam. However, at the beginning of the second year, a select group of students can enrol for LASE. “The selection of these students will be based on some criteria the details of which are yet to be finalised,” said Anurag Mehra, professor in the department of chemical engineering and one of the coordinators of the LASE programme.The process works similar to a branch change. In the second year, LASE students will study foundation courses as well as some other courses available in the institute. Faculty advisors will guide students in making this decision, said Mehra.All first-year students will have a common curriculum. Thereafter, if they enrol in the LASE programme, the students will be free to choose a course of their choice, apart from some prerequisite courses such as maths and physics, which will be compulsory. Broadly, students will have five categories – engineering sciences, natural sciences, social sciences, art & design and design your own custom concentration – to choose from. At the end of the four years, they will be granted the Bachelors in Science degree in any of the above categories, or the one that they specialise in.“For example, a student is interested in the field of healthcare, they can choose a course from the biosciences and bioengineering department, electrical engineering or some management courses from the school of management,” said Mehra.IIT-B director Subhasis Chaudhuri said that LASE students will take a set of ‘foundation courses’ in their second year, which are focussed on areas such as modern South Asian history, history of science, contemporary digital societies, current social structures, reading and writing literature, apart from subjects in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). “The motivation behind such courses and the programme as a whole is to enable the cultivation of diverse all-round proficiencies for those who want to explore different fields, venture out in new directions or pursue untrammelled and untraveled paths,” said Chaudhuri.“Liberal arts are often misunderstood as courses in the fields of Arts. It is actually a multidisciplinary education tool encompassing the study of natural sciences, social sciences, arts and humanity. With the LASE programme, we want to give students the flexibility to choose any course they want. It’s like a buffet of courses available to the students,” Mehra added.Chaudhuri said, “Today’s aspirational youths are more exploratory in their pursuits, be it academics, career or financial matters. Our efforts have primarily been in creating such academic opportunities that our students can pursue freely. It’s just one more way of telling our student that they can be the one that they wish to be rather than what we want them to be.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/iit-bombay-students-can-now-curate-their-course-choose-subjects-101624994419462.html

According to them, the government’s announcements that claim to boost inbound tourism have no practical holding. Jerroo Bharrucha, president of tourist guide association (TOGA), Mumbai, said, “RLGs have existed long before the Ministry of Tourism and Culture (MOTC) was formed, but the way we have been treated in recent times is depressing. We represent and showcase all that is good in India and hence, we are the face of India as tourists spend maximum time with us.” “We have helped tour operators to build their tourism empires as all rolling business is brought by our work. The government of India should be doling out cash compensation to us instead of asking us to apply for loans. They know very well that many tour operators have not paid RLGs throughout India for work done in 2018 to 2020,” added Bharrucha. Tourist guides alleged that the finance minister’s announcement was like being given a beautifully-wrapped box only to find castoffs inside. “We were euphoric about were getting something but later realised what we will actually be getting. Which bank is going to give us a loan on a licence that the tourism ministry is not renewing till we sign on dotted lines? In case we get the bank loan, how are we supposed to repay when there’s no work,” Bharrucha questionedDr Subhash Goyal, president, Confederation of Tourism Professionals of India, said that the finance minister’s announcement is too late and too little. “Already, 10 million people have become jobless and thousands of companies have become bankrupt. Without the announcement of the date for issuance of e-tourist visas and free visas will be meaningless. The money saved by not giving free tourist visas can be utilised for giving grants to the tourist guides and tourism workforce,” Dr Goyal said, adding, “Giving loans to tourist guides and small tour operators is also meaningless because how will they return the loan and pay the interest when there is no business? ” The highly-fragmented tourism sector includes stakeholders such as travel agencies, individual travel agents, car rental agencies and tourist guides whose businesses were practically wiped out as the pandemic put a stop to travel. CRISIL Ratings Limited said the sector critically needs opening up of inbound and outbound travel, which is currently very restricted. “With improved vaccination rates, we expect opening up in the second half of this fiscal, but that would also be contingent on policies of foreign countries. Domestic travel though should start to bounce back, as state-level lockdowns ease,” CRISIL said. Manish Gupta, senior director, CRISIL Ratings said, “The move to provide 500,000 free one-month tourist visas till March 31, 2022, amounts to only ₹100-crore allocation, but importantly, it sends out a message that India is getting ready to welcome tourists. This could provide a boost to budget-conscious travellers before the inbound season, which typically starts from October.”Sourav Mukherjee, head, India and Middle East of travel tech services firm RateGain, said that giving 500,000 free visas will give the much-needed start to the inbound segment, mainly for tourists. “This is a much-needed move for the industry and leisure destinations. However, we still need to wait till the process starts. This will not be a boost as such but will act as a kick start. We could have said this was a boost only when the inbound sector would have had some movement already. But if the government could also create confidence among the tourists, it will immediately have a positive effect on the leisure segment,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tourism-experts-say-finance-minister-s-500k-tourist-visas-1-lakh-loan-offer-an-eyewash-101624994418801.html

The court said BNSL officials say though they have solar back-up but it us using outdated and obsolete technology. “Therefore, in the given circumstances, we are of the considered view that old and outdated technology needs to be phased out gradually and the batteries need to be replaced by Lithium-NickleCobalt-Aluminium (NCA) Lithium-Nickle-Magnese-Cobalt (NMC), Lithium-Iron-Phosphate batteries or any other batteries with latest technology in a phased manner,” the court said.The court said that during the previous hearing, the court had asked the Himachal Pradesh Electricity Board to obtain instruction, as to why, there were frequent shut downs of the main transmission line in such areas.HPSEBL official Sanjeev Maria said they will resolve the issue by constructing a sub-station. He said much progress could not be achieved for want of adequate work force, which now has been made available to the board with appointments of 1,800 assistant linemen and 250 junior engineers. A progress report in this regard will be submitted to the court on the next date of hearing.The court also arrayed service providers who constructed the communication towers and are maintaining them as party respondents and issued a notice to them.The court also said that rates for laying cables in the state were probably the highest in the country at ₹1,600 per metre and has granted four weeks’ time to the advocate general to apprise the court regarding this aspect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-directs-bsnl-to-replace-obsolete-tech-to-improve-connectivity-himachal-101624994418321.html

AC has also decided to introduce subjects such as artificial intelligence and data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning, cyber security, internet of things, data engineering, cyber security including blockchain technology, among others, considering the industry needs, said a spokesperson for the varsity. “There will be radical changes in the manner in which engineering will be taught henceforth. AICTE gave its go ahead earlier this year but the science and technology faculty has already been working on introducing newer subjects with respect to emerging industry demands and trends,” said a statement released by MU on Tuesday. AC also approved the concept of “school” for the first time, which will bring together subjects from various departments under one roof making it easier for students to opt for interdisciplinary subjects in a single course. “MU will be introducing different schools, including the school of Indian languages; English and foreign languages; social sciences; and performing arts, all with aim of giving students the option of more subjects under the same head. This is a positive step towards giving students more freedom in choosing their subjects in various courses,” said Leeladhar Bansod, deputy registrar, public relations, MU. He added that for the first time, regional case studies will be included in various courses of the commerce department to enhance research skills of students. Using provisions under the Maharashtra Public Universities Act, the academic council is preparing to hand over autonomy to various departments of the university, allowing academic independence and flexibility in curriculum. As of now, five departments of the university have already been awarded autonomy.2021-22 academic year calendar announced AC has approved the academic calendar for 2021-22 year, bringing relief to colleges as well as students. While the two semesters have been scheduled from June 14 to October 30, 2021, and November 15 to May 1, 2022, winter and summer breaks have been scheduled to give a good break for the stakeholders. For 2021-22, Diwali break is scheduled for two weeks from November 1 to 14, whereas the summer break has been slotted from May 2 to June 11, 2022.The 2022-23 academic year will begin from June 12 next year, said a statement released by MU.“Last year, as a large chunk of the first semester was wasted trying to figure out reopening of colleges, summer and winter breaks were limited to one or two weeks only. This time, the academic year is planned well, giving colleges and students a much-deserved break,” said the principal of a suburban college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/university-of-mumbai-s-academic-council-approves-engineering-course-in-marathi-101624994297678.html

Seven IITs had 10 or less faculty members from the other backward classes (OBC) community. The data was revealed by 22 of the 23 IITs in response to a query filed by an alumnus of IIT-Bombay (IIT-B) early this year under the Right to Information (RTI) Act. Data for IIT-Mandi was unavailable. None of the 22 IITs, including Delhi, Bombay, Madras and Kharagpur, follow reservations in their faculty positions. The Centre mandates a reservation of 27% in faculty positions for candidates from OBC category, 15% from SC and 7.5% from ST community. At IIT-B, only six (0.9%) of the 684 faculty positions are from SC community, one (0.1%) is from ST and 10 (1.5) from OBC category. At IIT-Madras, of the 596 faculty members, 16 (2.7%) are SC candidates, three (0.5%) are ST, while 62 (10.4%) are OBC. Pawan Goenka, retired managing director and chief executive officer of Mahindra Group and chairperson of the board of governors of IIT-Bombay and IIT-Madras, said, “The board of governors of IIT-B and IIT-Madras is well-aware of the gaps in diversity with respect to the reserved categories and gender. But we also know that it is not due to lack of efforts. These IITs are taking proactive steps to address these gaps while going through the recruitment process as per the prescribed norms. I am sure the other IITs are also doing the same.” In July 2019, education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal, while answering a question in the Lok Sabha, revealed that the sanctioned strength of faculty in all the 23 IITs was 8,856, of which 2,813 positions were vacant. Of the 6,043 faculty in IITs, around 2.5% (149) were from SC and 0.34% (21) from ST communities. Despite repeated attempts, Amit Khare, secretary, higher education, and Rakesh Ranjan, additional secretary for IITs at the Ministry of Education, did not respond to HT emails. ‘Good quality teachers a priority’ Goenka said IITs were sensitive to the reservation rules. “Currently IITs have a fairly large number of vacancies which they are trying to fill but sufficient high-quality candidates have not been available across all categories. IITs need candidates with PhD, high-quality research papers, and good teaching ability. These have to largely come from within the top engineering colleges in India or good universities abroad. The number of PhD students graduating from the IITs, specially the older ones, has been increasing significantly in the past four years as a result of the increase in intake post 2011. I believe this will help to address the issue in the coming years,” he added. Data shows that seven IITs—Bhilai, Gandhinagar, Goa, Indore, Jodhpur, Palakkad and Patna—have no ST faculty on their rosters. In fact, except Dhanbad, Dharwad, Jammu and Tirupathi, the ST faculty at all other IITs constituted less than 1% of the total faculty count. PB Sunil Kumar, director of IIT-Palakkad, said, “We give all relaxations as mandated by the Centre’s norms, and in addition, make sure that at the least, a few among the applicants from reserved communities are given a chance to present their case to the selection committees. We do face problems in finding the right candidates as the pool of applicants from such communities is small.” “The current education system permeates discrimination in the name of merit. The idea of merit doesn’t take into account the social, emotional, academic, cultural and intellectual gap in students coming from diverse backgrounds,” said Govardhan Wankhede, former professor and dean, school of education, Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai. Few senior faculties from reserved categories IITs follow a flexible cadre system for the appointment of faculty. The sanctioned strength of faculty at different grades, such as professor, associate professor and assistant professor, is not fixed. Until 2019, reservations were only applicable for recruitment of assistant professors, which is the entry level. This is why most faculty members from reserved categories were in the assistant professor category across all IITs. Fifteen of the 23 IITs, including IIT-Mandi, do not have a single SC or ST professor, while seven do not have even one SC or ST associate professor. IITs also do not have promotions. Each position is filled as a fresh recruitment. This means assistant professors at an institute have to apply for recruitment as an associate professor and compete with other candidates. Avatthi Ramaiah, chairperson, Centre for Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policies at TISS, said the discrimination was systemic. “If a reserved category candidate has applied, the law mandates that the selection committee should have a member from the category. Most times, it is this member that bats on behalf of the reserved category candidate alone. There is resistance from all quarters because the department members have a set idea of who they want,” said Ramaiah, who has served on several selection committees. Corrective measures At IIT-B, departments have to forward all applications from SC and ST candidates to the selection committee. S Sudarshan, deputy director, academic and infrastructure affairs at IIT-B, said, “Prior to the reservations, departments had the liberty to forward shortlisted candidates to the selection committee. However, a few years ago, after the reservation policy came in, the policy was changed. Now departments have to forward all applications from SC and ST category to the selection committee as long as they meet the basic eligibility criteria.” IITs at Palakkad and Goa are conducting special drives to identify suitable candidates from diverse backgrounds. “We are only six years old and are still in the early stages of recruitment. However, we have already conducted one such drive last year,” said Kumar. IIT-Goa director BK Mishra, too, said that the institute is currently conducting a special drive to improve the number of faculty members from SC, ST and OBC categories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rti-data-iits-not-following-reservation-rules-for-faculty-101624994117807.html

30-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 13,197 kids lost one of their parents to Covid||The number of children who lost either of their parents to Covid-19 has mounted to 13,197 in Maharashtra. While 11,659 of them lost their father, 1,538 lost their mother to the virus. A total of 409 children have been orphaned after losing both the parents, according to the data collected by the women and child welfare department. Acting on the Supreme Court direction, the state constituted task forces in each district to identify such children and avert trafficking and illegal adoption. Women and child welfare officers have reached out to families with deaths due to Covid-19 and facilitate them with counselling, legal and financial aid. The process for enrolment of orphaned children whose extended family members are not able to look after them has begun. Pune has the highest number of children who have lost either or both parents (1,380), followed by Nagpur (1,206), Thane (1,103), Mumbai (762) and Nashik (508). Thane has the highest number of orphaned children (53), followed by 36 in Nagpur and 34 in Pune. Of the orphaned children, 221 are boys and 180 are girls. WCD minister Yashomati Thakur said: “The task forces appointed under the chairmanship of district collectors are working to help these children with the help of child welfare committee in the districts. We have taken full responsibility of their further studies for which technological support in the form of laptops, android phones is being provided to them as immediate steps. We have signed a memorandum of understanding with two not-for-profit organisations, Indian Psychiatric Society and Project Mumbai, for technological and psychological support.”Thakur added, “We have already announced ₹5 lakh in fixed deposit accounts of these children till they turn 18. Until then, financial aid will be given to children under Balsangopan Yojana.”District administrations have been helping such children with counselling, fixing responsibility of their parenting to relatives, as well as ensuring financial aid, custody to child care institutions and legal adoption, if needed. “As the basic principle of the Juvenile Justice Act (JJ Act), we prefer the custody to remain with extended family in case of orphaned children. Family care is important for their upbringing. Such children in custody with relatives, such as uncle or grandparents, are given financial assistance of ₹1,125 per month under our Bal Sangopan scheme. The scheme is applicable for the children who have lost either of their parents,” said an official from the department. According to the officials from the department, the number of children who have lost their parents to Covid-19 is expected to go up further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-13-197-kids-lost-one-of-their-parents-to-covid-101624993637750.html

30-06-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC: ‘When will you set up body to oversee illegal construction?’||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday asked the state government and civic bodies, including the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), to put an end to building collapses that result in loss of lives by taking urgent steps to curb uncontrolled illegal constructions. The HC further sought to know when it would be acting on the suggestion given by it four years ago to constitute an authority that would only oversee the issue of illegal constructions in the city. The court also asked the BMC to respond to the court-appointed inquiry commissioner’s preliminary findings in Malwani building collapse case. The next hearing is scheduled on July 2.A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the suo motu public interest litigation instituted by it in September 2020 following the Bhiwandi building collapse incident which claimed around 40 lives, was informed that justice (retired) JP Deodhar, who was appointed as commissioner of inquiry on June 11, had visited the site of the building collapse at Malwani and prepared a preliminary report. On June 11, after hearing about the circumstances that led to the Malwani building collapse which led to 12 deaths had described it as a man-made disaster and ordered a judicial inquiry and appointed a former HC judge to conduct the probe. The preliminary report submitted on Tuesday was based on the findings on the terms of references which included availability of sanctioned plan for structure, structural audit report and on whom the responsibility can be fixed and which officials were responsible to maintain vigil and supervision of unauthorized and illegal structures in the area. After perusing the preliminary report the bench observed, “Sum and substance of the findings was that there was a single storied structure on which three floors were raised in an absolute unauthorized manner and no permission was taken from authorities and the inquiry commissioner has fixed responsibility.” When senior counsel Aspi Chinoy for BMC sought a week’s time to respond to the report, the bench allowed the same but said that the civic authority should decide on which of the recommendations made by justice Deodhar were acceptable to them. “As per report, more than 8000 structures are there in the particular western suburb and how many of them are unauthorized is yet to be ascertained. Ask your officers to take the issue seriously.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-when-will-you-set-up-body-to-oversee-illegal-construction-101624993459052.html
30-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: 27-year-old run over by train||A 27-year-old woman died and two other persons were run over by a train on the trans-harbour line at Pawane MIDC on Tuesday. According to the police, the deceased, Nazma Shaikh, Ezbul Shaikh, 39, and his wife, Shenur Shaikh, 28, were crossing the railway tracks below the Pawane bridge around 4.05pm. A train, which was going to Thane from Vashi, ran over Nazma and she died on the spot. Ezbul jumped into a nearby nullah and suffered injuries due to the fall, Shenur also jumped into the nullah, but she was partially hit by the train. They were later admitted to Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) Hospital at Vashi. Vishnu Kesarkar, senior inspector of Vashi GRP, said, “Prima facie, it appears that trains came from both sides (Thane and Vashi) when these people were crossing the tracks, and they got confused. Nazma’s husband was also with them, but he was walking around 20feet behind them when the accident took place. All of them were from Kopar Khairane and would sell fish in local markets.” “There is a proper bridge for crossing the tracks in the area where the accident took place. The railways have also developed protective walls on both sides of the tracks to prevent illegal crossing,” Kesarkar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-27-year-old-run-over-by-train-101624993457735.html

30-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra limits height of Ganesh idols to 2-4ft, no processions||Amid the second wave of Covid-19, the state government has, for the second year in a row, put restrictions on Ganesh festival to avert the spread of the virus through crowding. The 11-day festival starts from September 10. The state has banned immersion processions, restricted the height of idols to 2-4 feet and has also advised people to immerse the idols in artificial ponds near their homes. In the guidelines issued by the home department on Tuesday, the state has restricted the height of the idols to 4ft for public pandals and 2ft for household idols. Mandating to keep the festival a low-key affair, the state has clarified that no relaxations can be given for the festival in the existing norms. The guidelines also advise avoiding cultural programmes, and suggest organising blood donation and health camps instead. “Do not organize any processions for the home arrival or immersions of Ganesh idols. The traditional ‘aarti’ shall be performed at home instead of the immersion places. Children and senior citizens should avoid going for immersions. Try to avoid traditional idols and use idols made up of metal or marble for worshipping. If the idols installed are made of clay or are eco-friendly, then they can be immersed at home itself. If not possible at home, the idols should be immersed at a nearby artificial pond,” it said further.Community mandals should try to arrange for online darshan of idols. They should also arrange darshan through cable network, website, Facebook etc., added the circular.“The pandals may be disinfected, thermal screening be arranged for and physical distancing and other Covid-related norms be strictly adhered to by devotees turning up at mandaps to seek darshan of Lord Ganesh,” the state home department said. The state government also urged them to display health related advertisements during the 10-day festival to create awareness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-limits-height-of-ganesh-idols-to-2-4ft-no-processions-101624993338257.html
30-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s drinking water stock can last for 65 days: BMC||With the good rain in June, the stock in seven lakes supplying drinking water to Mumbai is around 17.44% till Tuesday, which can last for around 65 days. Last year, the water level in seven lakes was 8%, while in 2019, it was just 6% the same day. Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials said a water cut is not on the cards at the moment. However, it will monitor the rainfall through the first two weeks of July. The water level in the seven lakes supplying drinking water to the city is 252,459 million litres, of the total capacity of 1,447,363 lakh million litres. According to the BMC’s data, on Tuesday, Tulsi lake was 74% full, followed by Vihar with a stock of 62.39%. Last year, at this time, both Tulsi and Vihar had mere 30% and 20% water stock. The stock of Bhatsa, which supplies 55% of the total annual water requirement, is at 14.94%, up from 7% last year at this time. In Tansa, the water level is 31.42%, which was 10% last year at this time; Modak Sagar was at 38%, compared to 20% last year at this time. Upper Vaitarna’s water level is 0%, same as last year. Middle Vaitarna has 13.54% stock, against 11% last year. Powai Lake that supplies water to the civic body for non-potable purposes overflowed on June 12. Last year, it got full on July 5. The seven lakes are bifurcated into two systems – the Vaitarna system supplies to the western suburbs and the island city, and the Bhatsa system supplies to the eastern suburbs. The lakes are situated in Mumbai as well as neighbouring Thane and Palghar districts. A BMC official from the hydraulics department said, “The rain forecast for this year is good, and it looks like there might be no need for any water cut. However, we are monitoring the situation. A decision will be taken in the coming days based on the rain pattern in July.” The city experienced 20% water cut last year in August 2020, amid the Covid outbreak owing to low level of water storage in the lakes. BMC chief Iqbal Singh Chahal had also prepared a backup plan to bring water to Mumbai from Bhandardara dam in Ahmednagar, if required. Before 2020, no water cut was imposed in 2019, owing to good rainfall in catchment areas. The BMC had imposed a 10% water cut in 2018, a 20% cut in 2016 and a 25% cut in 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-drinking-water-stock-can-last-for-65-days-bmc-101624993278765.html

Fearing arrest, he moved Delhi’s Rohini court seeking anticipatory bail in the two cases.Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee’s (DSGMC) legal team is pursuing the matter.Senior advocate Ramesh Gupta Senior appeared for Sidhana along with advocates Rakesh Chahar, Jaspreet Rai, VPS Sandhu, Jasdeep S Dhillon, APS Mander, Prateek Kohli, and Sankalp Kohli.On January 26 this year, protesters from the Singhu border reached GT Karnal Road, where they destroyed the police barricades, rioted with swords, and ran their tractors over the police officials with an intention to kill, according to the FIR.“Police tried to intervene and stop them. Water cannon was used to disperse the protestors, tear gas shells were fired. The mob started throwing back tear gas shells towards the police,” it stated, adding that various policemen and one DTC driver suffered injuries.As per the FIR registered on the complaint of Inspector Anil Kumar, the protester, with their pre-planned objective, deviated from the rally routes agreed upon by the farm unions and caused violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/attack-on-cops-sidhana-gets-interim-protection-from-arrest-101624993278319.html

Vaccinating 100% of the population is a distant dream, as there are areas where people are too reluctant to get a jab.On June 3, ASHA workers visited the slums of Gandhi Colony to encourage people to get vaccinated. However, they had to leave after the slum dwellers unleashed dogs at them.An ASHA worker said: “We had one of the worst experiences. We had just set out a table in the slums, when an addict came and started abusing us and threatened us with stones and sticks. In no time, two dogs were unleashed and we had to run like anything.”As they tried to save themselves, people were laughing instead of helping, the worker added.‘All efforts went in vain’Dr Lakshmi Sirohi, nodal officer for Covid-19 vaccination of all primary health centres in old Panchkula, said though the team was called back, they did not give up and contacted the sarpanch, but all efforts went in vain.In one of the videos, a person could be seen shouting at a female health worker, saying that if a child dies, he will pick their children from homes. The worker said: “People use vulgar language and hurl abuses at us. It’s quite unsafe as well as many drug addicts are there. However, all are not bad. There are a few good people as well who support us.”She said that out of the 2,000 living there, hardly 200 had been vaccinated after a lot of effort.Dr Sirohi said: “There are a few communities where there is more reluctance. One such community is Deha and 50-55 of its people live in Kharak Mangoli village; none have been jabbed.”The health officials have been trying to vaccinate people in Navanagar village for the last three months, but auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) are still “not allowed to enter the village”. It has a population of around 300 and all are migratory workers.In one village, only 2 adults inoculatedIn Sultanpur village, only two adults out of 1,100 population have got the shot. Nearly 80% people are below the poverty line, and are largely illiterate.Dr Ashwani from Hangola village said: “A man of Yamunanagar died a few days after he was vaccinated. And the rumour spread like wildfire that he died because of vaccine. First the residents refused for a month, then they urged the younger population be vaccinated first. We will visit them soon and see how the youth responds.”Dr Monika Shori, medical officer at CHC Nanakpur, said: “Some elderly man in the adjoining village died a few days after getting the vaccine. Villagers believed that he died because of the vaccine. Because of this rumour, we had to face a lot of problems.”When the team visited at the end of April, they were asked to return. They tried again after 15-20 days, but got the same response. They tried convincing one person, who was visiting their OPD, but he refused twice fearing that he would die.Finally, 2-3 persons from the village got the jab, when a camp was organised in a religious place. So far, only 10-12 persons from the village have been jabbed. “People are still reluctant and ANMs still cannot enter their village,” Dr Shori said.Dr Meenu Sasan, district immunisation officer, said: “We are vaccinating over 5,000 persons a day. Reluctance has come down, but still there are areas where people are not ready. Usually such areas are those where the illiteracy rate is high and people are poor.”“We keep on visiting such areas, educate people, and try to win their confidence. It takes time in some cases,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vaccine-hesitancy-in-rural-belt-major-hurdle-for-panchkula-health-department-101624993158243.html
30-06-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali MC to take over upkeep of Phases 8A, 8B in industrial area||After two years, the Mohali municipal corporation will finally take over the maintenance of the Industrial Area in Phases 8A and 8B from the Punjab Small Industries and Export Corporation (PSIEC) in the first week of July. This comes as a relief to owners of more than 800 industrial units in the area. For two years, the maintenance work was stuck in a bureaucratic maze, and neither the PSIEC nor the MC were attending to poor condition of the area, which is marked by overgrowth, dilapidated roads and non-functional streetlights. Despite the civic body collecting around ₹16 crore in property tax from the industrial plots here, only ₹1 crore has been released for development work. For two decades, the area was under the PSIEC, but after a series of meetings with officials in 2019, it was decided that its maintenance will be handed over to the civic body. Municipal commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said, “Everything has been finalised and we will be taking over the maintenance in the first week of July. Tenders have been floated for various maintenance work. Also, nine PSIEC employees have been shifted to MC.” For the last four years, industrialists and workers have been complaining about the poorly-maintained infrastructure. Mohali Industries Association (MIA) president Yogesh Sagar said, “Due to bureaucratic maze, the maintenance has been severely affected for the last two years. Streetlights are non-functional, choked drains cause waterlogging at the merest excuse of rain and heaps of garbage dot the landscape, attracting stray dogs and cattle.” Vivek Kapoor, vice-president of MIA, said, “The authorities concerned are testing our patience now. Due to the poor condition, we don’t even feel like going to our units. Even the central scheme of introducing a special purpose vehicle to improve infrastructure remains on paper. The tragic part is that it has been almost two decades now, and we are still asking for basic amenities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-mc-to-take-over-upkeep-of-phases-8a-8b-in-industrial-area-101624993101122.html

People can simply walk in to get the jab as no prior slot booking is mandatory on the Co-WIN app.“Many people, especially the business class, have to report to work by 9am, and hence they cannot wait for their turn at the vaccination centres. To help these working men and women, we have decided to open evening vaccination centres,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director health services, Chandigarh, adding that the health department has enough vaccine stock to cover all people before the possible third wave.According to the latest electoral list, a total of 7,09,180 people are eligible to take vaccine in the 18+ age group. So far, 4,33,666 (61%) have taken their first dose.Free ride for seniors, people with disabilitiesMeanwhile, the social welfare department has launched free pick-up and drop facility for the disabled and senior citizens from their house to the nearest vaccination centre. As many as 242 residents availed themselves of this facility on Tuesday by contacting the toll-free number 9915023456. The drive aims to provide inclusive, seamless and accessible delivery of vaccination to maximum number of disabled persons, senior citizens and their caregivers, as they are most vulnerable and have co-morbidities that may put them at a higher risk of contracting the virus, stated a release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhfour-vaccination-centres-to-open-in-evening-too-101624992498550.html

30-06-2021||Chandigarh||Three health infra projects stuck at Chandigarh’s GMCH||Three major health infrastructure projects—a sports injury centre, a new emergency-trauma centre and a mother-child care centre—all planned to come up at the Government Medical College and Hospital in Sector 32 (GMCH-32), have been marred with long delays.All the three projects have been approved three to four years back and the funds too allocated for their completion.The mother and child centre, though conceptualised long back, was approved in 2019 and ₹38 crore were allocated for it. The new emergency and trauma centre to come up at an estimated cost of ₹52.77 crore also got the final nod of the administration in 2019. The sports injury centre to come up at a cost of ₹32 crore was approved in 2018.While the future remains uncertain for the sport injury centre, the mother and child care centre is back to the drawing board stage. For the new emergency and trauma centre, even though the work contract has been allotted, after several hiccups the work is still to pick up pace.Sports injury centre plans put on back burnerPlans for the sports injury centre, which was to be only the second such facility in the country, has been put on the back-burner. “The priorities of the department have changed now, and there is a rethink over the project,” said CB Ojha, UT chief engineer.The facility was proposed to be built on 1.6 acres near GMCH-32. As per the original plan, the centre was to have a six-storey building with two basement and parking facilities. Also planned were several key diagnostic facilities like CT scan, MRI and emergency services. Facilities like hydrotherapy lab, physiotherapy units, operation theatres, rooms for resident doctors, the nursing staff and wards were all incorporated in the centre’s plans.Meanwhile, the mother and child centre is yet to get to the implementation stage. “The client department has once again requested changes in the architectural plans of the facility. After incorporating these changes, a final plan will be made and thereafter only the tendering process will start,” said Ojha.The centre, with around 330 beds, is planned to come up in the K-block area of GMCH-32. As per the previous architectural plan approved, it would be spread over 1.11 sq ft area having seven floors plus a basement.Tender allotted for new trauma centre last yearIt was last year that the UT engineering department had allotted the tender to a city-based firm for the construction of the new emergency-cum-trauma centre at GMCH.A target of 18 months was decided for the completion of the project, which was around February 2022. “But the construction work has been marred with delays. Earlier, the work on the project couldn’t start as the permission to cut around 70 trees was not given. The nod by the environment department came only recently. Then there was the issue of oxygen supply: with the second Covid wave at its peak, there was a ban on oxygen supply for industrial and construction purposes,” said a UT official.The 280-bed facility spread over 1.4 lakh square feet will come up in the place of the existing covered parking block in front of Block A.The creation of the new facility, an exercise pending for at least a decade, will be a major upgrade for GMCH-32. Since its inception in 1996-97, GMCH has been catering to patients from Chandigarh, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and several other, farther states. At any given point, there are at least 350 patients admitted in the emergency. “We have all the clearances in place now, and the work on the site has started,” said Ojha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/three-health-infra-projects-stuck-at-chandigarh-s-gmch-101624992198233.html
30-06-2021||Other||Ambedkar always worked for an egalitarian society, says President Kovind||Lucknow: President Ram Nath Kovind said here on Tuesday that equality was always top on the mind of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, as he had realized that integrated development of the country was not possible unless the governments worked to bring about equality in society. Speaking at a virtual foundation stone laying ceremony of Babasaheb Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar Memorial Cultural Centre to come up in Aishbabh area here, the President said Ambedkar worked to bring about equality in society and incorporated the same in the Preamble of the Constitution of India. “As chief architect of the Constitution of India, he mentioned equality in the Preamble to the Constitution,” said Kovind. Governor Anandiben Patel, chief minister Yogi Adityanath, deputy chief ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma and other dignitaries attended the foundation stone laying ceremony organized at Lok Bhawan here. As chief minister Yogi Adityanath, in his address earlier, had pointed out that Ambedkar launched a newspaper titled ‘Samta’ 93 years ago, Kovind said the foundation of memorial and cultural centre was being laid on the day when Ambedkar pushed the idea of equality in society. “This day is important for us because Dr Ambedkar began his journey for equality 93 years ago on this day and we are witness to this journey being taken forward by laying of the foundation stone of Ambedkar memorial and cultural centre,” said Kovind. He said Ambedkar had a special connection with Lucknow. “Bodhanandji, who was like a guru for Baba Saheb, and Bhadant Pragyanandji, who gave ‘diksha’ to him, lived in Lucknow and Dr Ambedkar used to visit them,” he said. Kovind referred to the convocation ceremony of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Lucknow in December 2017 and said he paid tributes to Bhadant Pragyanand by visiting the latter’s memorial. He said all the places associated with Baba Saheb Ambedkar had special importance for the people of country. The union government had developed the places linked with Babasaheb as pilgrimage centres. The Ambedkar memorial centre in Delhi had been working to take Babasaheb’s ideals to people around the world. He said the UP government had also decided to spread his ideals and set up a memorial and cultural centre in his name in Lucknow. Top quality research should be done at the research centre to be set up at the memorial and cultural centre in Lucknow, he said, adding that the central university set up in the name of Ambedkar in Lucknow and proposed research centre would have coordination to take ahead the ideals of Babasaheb.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ambedkar-always-worked-for-an-egalitarian-society-says-president-kovind-101624992018089.html

As per officials, the centre will come up on 5493.52 sq metre nazul land in front of the Aishbagh Eidgah. The project’s estimated cost is ₹45.04 crore. The centre will have an auditorium with the capacity to seat 750 people, a library, research centre, picture gallery, museum and a multi-purpose convention centre. It will also have a cafeteria, dormitory and other facilities. Speaking at the foundation laying event, chief minister Yogi Adityanath pointed out that construction work of the centre would soon start. The Yogi Adityanath cabinet’s nod for the project just about nine months before assembly polls in February-March next year is being viewed as an attempt to woo Dalit voters. The project is also being seen as the BJP’s answer to Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati’s grand Ambedkar Memorial spread over 107 acres in Gomti Nagar, which came up during her tenure as the Uttar Pradesh chief minister in 2008.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ambedkar-centre-to-have-25-foot-high-statue-of-baba-saheb-101624991777579.html
30-06-2021||Mumbai||Vaccination rate drops again in Maharashtra owing to short supply||Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Tuesday said the Covid-19 vaccination rate has dropped amid a short supply of doses, even as the state plans to inoculate more than one million people every day. The state recorded 8,085 new infections. “We want 70% of our population to be vaccinated at the earliest, so that the severity of the third wave is reduced by achieving herd immunity. We could vaccinate only 380,000 people on Tuesday, against our daily average of 700,000 over the past few days. If you ask me about the remaining stock with the state, it has dropped down to almost zero,” he said. The state administered just 384,499 doses on Tuesday. Tope said there was no need to fear the Delta Plus variant of Covid-19 as its characteristics have not been proven, as of yet. The government also announced it would continue the genome sequencing of more than 3,500 samples of probable Delta Plus variants, at least for the next three months. Tope also said that, of the 4,000 samples collected from across the state through genomic sequencing, 21 were found to have been affected by the Delta Plus variant. “Of the 21 patients, 20 got discharged and one died. The person who died was 80 years old and had also comorbidities. We cannot exactly say he died due to the Delta Plus variant. In such circumstances, there is no need to fear the variant,” said Tope.He said the government is taking various steps like collecting about 100 samples per district for genomic sequencing and they have collected 4,000 such samples till date. “It is up to the people who need to take precautions and their behaviour will determine whether we will get the third wave or it will be delayed,” he added. However, the state government last week had kept the base of its lockdown restrictions as level three.Mumbai on Tuesday recorded 566 new cases and 12 deaths, with its toll reaching 15,426.There were 190,140 tests done on Tuesday, while the number of recoveries clocked was 8,623.The total number of active patients in Maharashtra currently stands at 117,098, while the total number of cases right from the Covid-19 outbreak has now reached 6,051,633. With 16,467 active patients. Pune tops in active cases, followed by Thane with 15,935 patients.The death toll has now reached 121,804, with Pune leading with 16,688 deaths, followed by Mumbai with 15,426 patients.Another issue which has grabbed headlines is there are indications that 2,040 people have been administered fake vaccines. “The preliminary report shows that they have been administered saline water instead of the vaccine. We have sent their data to the central government,” said Tope. He said they will be checked after 28 days after they have been administered the vaccine and the decision will be taken after consultations with the central Government.The scam is being investigated by the Mumbai Police and 10 people have been arrested till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaccination-rate-drops-again-in-maharashtra-owing-to-short-supply-101624991657610.html

In the letter, the company had not only placed an order for 200 kg of extracted fibre from banana stalks at Rs. 110 to Rs. 150 per kg but assured to build a long-term relationship with the self-help group. The letter of intent opened up new opportunities of livelihood for the 40 women of the SHG,, including Poonam Devi. Isanagar is located between the Ghaghra and Sharda rivers where floods and erosions are routine and residents have limited sources of livelihood. Apart from traditional crops, the block is also famous for banana farming, which drew attention of Kheri chief development officer (CDO) Arvind Singh, who has earned repute for his innovative and successful projects like Operation Kavach, Operation Chaturbhuj and Operation Mamta etc. According to Singh, banana farming always left huge stock of banana stems as wastage after harvesting of the fruits. Singh told Hindustan Times that banana stem could be used for extracting fine quality fibre to be used in textile industry if properly processed and it could also add to the income of the rural womenfolk. “An idea to set up fibre extraction unit in Samaisa village hit me which would not only solve the banana stem wastage problem but employ dozens of women, providing them additional source of income,” he added. “We started a pilot project of extracting fibre from banana stems, engaging Ma Saraswati self-help group in December 2020,” CDO Arvind Singh said. He said,, “Required equipments for extraction were procured from Gujarat and necessary training was imparted to the women.” The fibre extracted from banana stems was sent to some companies for quality check and its saleability. “Our efforts yielded results when Altmat company of Gujarat expressed its willingness to procure 200 kg of banana yarn extracted by the SHG and provided a token money of ₹21,,000,” he said. The CDO informed that several other companies had also placed orders for the yarn. The authorities have decided to replicate the project in other blocks of the district if successful. According to SHG women, extraction of banana yarn or fibre from the stem yielded Rs. 100 per kg of yarn. Each SHG member can extract four to six kg of yarn per day which means income of Rs. 400 to ₹600 per day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/turning-waste-into-value-banana-yarn-opens-new-avenues-for-rural-women-101624991537641.html

The construction company that was carrying out the work at the site has been named in the FIR, the police said.Police said BG Shirke Construction Technology Pvt Ltd is carrying out the construction at the site. HT tried to contact the company (Delhi office) on two landline numbers mentioned on its website but the calls went unanswered. An email was also sent on two email IDs mentioned on the website.Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said around 4pm, the police control room was alerted that some construction workers had “fallen off a height” at a DDA construction site in Dwarka Sector 14.“A total of four workers sustained injuries after the lift, meant for taking workers from the ground to the upper floors, broke while on the seventh floor.

30-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt bans fishing in Yamuna, says water too polluted||The Delhi government’s animal husbandry department on Tuesday banned fishing in parts of river Yamuna, citing the high pollution levels in the water.“It is hereby brought to the notice of all concerned that in view of the high pollution levels in the Yamuna waters, as per the provisions made in the rules (formulated under Indian Fisheries Act, 1897), the issuing of fishing licence in two portions of public waters is suspended till further orders,” the notification read.The notification further said fishing will be prohibited in a portion of the Hindon canal, Ghazipur drain and Shadipur drain (road drain 0 to 17000); and portion of river Yamuna, from groyne number 85 (downstream), New Okhla barrage, to Delhi boundary.Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) said the most recent data on river pollution levels was not readily available with the agency. Officials also said compared to the rest of the river, fishing pockets usually are less polluted and the dissolved oxygen levels in the water are high enough to support aquatic life.Contrary to popular notions, despite the highly polluted state of the Yamuna in the national capital, portions of the river are still frequented by fishermen who depend on the river for their livelihood. According to them, even though aquatic life has reduced drastically over the past two decades, owing to pollution and low water flow in the Delhi portion of the river, fish varieties such as puthi and golden fish, are still common in parts of the river.On Tuesday, images of the white, toxic foam floating over the water in the Kalindi Kunj portion of the river started doing rounds on social media, drawing outrage from environment activists and public.“Disgusting state of river Yamuna in Delhi, as disgusting as its politics and politicians residing here. Thousands of crores spent on cleaning the river, tall promises and aartis, and yet a sewage canal in the name of a river, (sic)” tweeted environment activist and founder of environment protection NGO Swechha, Vimlendu Jha, tweeted alongside with murky pictures of the river.High phosphate content in the wastewater because of detergents used in dyeing industries, dhobi ghats and households is the main reason leading to the formation of toxic foam in the Yamuna river, an official of the Central Pollution Control Board had said earlier.Earlier this month, on June 14, the DPCC had banned the sale, transport, storage and marketing of soaps and detergents that do not comply with the new BIS standards, in order to control the discharge of pollutants into the river water in an effort to control the foam in the river.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-bans-fishing-in-yamuna-says-water-too-polluted-101624988663545.html
30-06-2021||Delhi||SC issues notice to Delhi police on plea to release seized oxygen concentrators||The Supreme Court on Tuesday issued notice to the Delhi Police on a petition filed by Matrix Cellular (International) Services Private Limited demanding release of oxygen concentrators seized as case property in an alleged case of hoarding involving South Delhi-based businessman Navneet Kalra.A three-judge bench headed by justice RF Nariman sought response of the Delhi police in three weeks. The petitioner firm challenged a May 27 order of the Delhi high court refusing to release oxygen concentrators worth ₹3.5 crore lying idle with the police as case property.For Matrix, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi submitted that the high court was wrong to assume that the seizure was part of black marketing when the government has not fixed any maximum retail price (MRP) for oxygen concentrators. He stated that the police found mischief with the products sold by the company when other products were available on similar price across e-commerce sites.The high court, while rejecting the plea raised by Matrix, held that the oxygen concentrator, is covered within the definition of drug as per Section 3(b)(iv) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. It relied on a February 11, 2020 government notification which said that device includes an instrument, apparatus, used for treatment, sustaining life, etc. Later, another order was issued by the Centre on June 29, 2020 which prohibited increasing MRP of oxygen concentrators more than 10% in a year.The high court said, “The facts show the petitioner was engaged in selling untested oxygen concentrators to people desperate for these devices and at exorbitant prices through false representations, especially, when the State and the whole country saw a unprecedented surge of Covid-19 infections and severe lack of oxygen cylinders and/or concentrators….Hence, the investigation being at initial stage, the reliefs sought for in this petition cannot be granted by this court.”The Delhi Police seized the concentrators from restaurants where businessman Navneet Kalra has a substantial stake. The police lodged a case against Kalra and employees of Matrix and recovered 524 oxygen concentrators at the instance of the accused persons. Each device was allegedly being sold for about ₹70,000, according to the police.The high court directed the police to put an identification mark on the concentrators and held no fault with the action of the police to seize the concentrators prior to lodging of first information report. The court said, “Even if it is assumed, there were some irregularities in its procedure to seize, it shall not vitiate the seizure. The only requirement is the court needs to be careful in scrutinising the seizure memo.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sc-issues-notice-to-delhi-police-on-plea-to-release-seized-oxygen-concentrators-101624988662861.html

They misbehaved with female teachers, engineers and workers by breaking into the school. Why BJP supporters have a problem with construction of schools and education,” Sisodia, who holds the education portfolio, tweeted in Hindi. He also tweeted photographs of the purported attack on his Twitter account on Tuesday morning.Delhi BJP leaders denied the allegations that party workers were involved in the alleged attack.Sisodia, who also the education portfolio, was in Rohtash Nagar to inspect the construction of a government school. He has been inspecting the ongoing construction of new rooms and blocks in Delhi government schools for the last one week. On Tuesday, he visited schools in Babarpur, Karawal Nagar, Shivaji Park and Gokalpur. Delhi government runs nearly 1,030 schools across the capital.Sisodia’s cabinet colleague, health minister, Satyendar Jain, also shared photographs of the incident and blamed the BJP for it. “The BJP may try any tricks but they will not be able to stop us. They may launch thousands of such attacks, but we are not going to be threatened. We have pledged to serve Delhi and its residents and nobody can stop us,” Jain tweeted in Hindi.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said Sisodia’s tweet alleging attack on his team and school staff by local BJP workers is a proof of his intolerance for “public protest”.“No BJP worker entered the school premises so there is no question of any attack on school staff or labour. Some local BJP workers assembled there and wanted to apprise the deputy chief minister of local problems related to Delhi Jal Board and ration, but he refused to meet them after which they raised slogans. The matter ended after police intervened,” Kapoor said.Deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram said two separate complaints were received at the Shahdara police station from the school management. The first complaint was about an unidentified mob creating a ruckus and manhandling school’s staff during a protest. The second complaint was filed later and it mentioned damages caused to some flower pots on the school’s campus.“We are examining the complaints and further action would be taken accordingly,” said the DCP.About the Sisodia’s allegations that his official vehicle was damaged by the BJP party workers, police said that no complaint regarding that was received from the deputy chief minister or the Aam Aadmi Party till Tuesday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sisodia-alleges-attack-by-bjp-workers-during-school-inspection-in-east-delhi-101624988662112.html

Over 2.5 years later, even a single one these projects is to take off, with transport minister Kailash Gahlot blaming “bureaucratic hurdles and the Covid-19 pandemic” for the inordinate delay.“Gradually, we are revisiting the files and looking at what can be done to revive these projects. The locations of these terminals were identified after demand assessment in those areas,” Gahlot said.A senior transport official said the government had floated tenders for construction of new bus terminals and modernising the existing ones. The projects were to be commissioned by December, 2019. “Designs for the eight terminals were finalised in 2019 itself. But the tenders failed; it did not get as many bidders as were required,” said the official, on condition of anonymity.As per the request for proposal (RFP) document, the terminals were to be built as lively urban spaces where passengers could easily and conveniently access multiple transport modes such as buses, auto-rickhshaws, e-rickshaws and so on, as well as amenities such as food courts, ATMs and mohalla clinics.The Nehru Place, Azadpur and Najafgarh bus terminals were to have an aerodynamic canopy, held up by tree-like columns. The canopy was designed in a way to serve as a shelter and help in rainwater harvesting, officials said.The public plaza of the terminal would have space for kiosks, shops, and hawkers with a round-the-clock anchor store. It was planned as a space through which the cash-strapped Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) could also garner some revenue from outdoor signage and digital media integrated into the architecture of the public amenities on site.Officials said after reassessing the project requirements, fresh tenders are likely to be floated in a month or two.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-years-on-five-planned-bus-terminals-in-delhi-yet-to-be-built-101624988660751.html
30-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police lodge FIR over child pornographic content on Twitter||The Delhi Police on Tuesday registered a first information report (FIR) in connection with the child sexual abuse and child pornographic material available on microblogging site Twitter, a complaint regarding which was received from the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) last month.“Acting on the NCPCR’s complaint regarding availability of child sexual abuse and child pornographic material on Twitter, in the form of various accounts and links, a case has been registered by the cyber cell unit (CyPAD) under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Information Technology (IT) Act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. Investigation into the case has been taken up,” said Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal.On being asked whether the FIR was registered specifically against the microblogging site, a CyPAD officer, who asked not to be named, said, “It is an FIR that has been registered against the unlawful activities involving various accounts and links on Twitter. The case is not against any individual or company. We will investigate the case to ascertain the culprits and fix responsibility, who could be individuals as well as the company.”When contacted, a Twitter spokesperson said, “Twitter has a zero-tolerance policy for child sexual exploitation (CSE) and we have a proactive approach to combating sexual exploitation of minors on our service. We have been at the forefront of responding to the evolving challenge of preventing the exploitation of children on the Internet and will continue to aggressively fight online child sexual abuse, as well as invest in the technology and tools that are essential to stay ahead of this issue.“We will continue to invest in proactive detection and removal of content that violates Twitter rules and work with law enforcement and NGO partners in India to tackle the issue,” the spokesperson continued.According to the CyPAD officer quoted above, a total of 13 screenshots pertaining to child sexual abuse and child pornographic material on Twitter and the accounts that posted them were received on Monday from the NCPCR. A majority of the accounts were not accessible. But since child sexual abuse and pornographic materials were visible in the screenshots, the FIR was registered for further investigation, the officer said.“We will now be approaching Twitter to seek its assistance in collecting details about the users of the accounts from which the objectionable materials were uploaded. Our further probe would proceed based on the information that Twitter shares with us. We are also trying other options to identify the users of the accounts in question,” the officer said.The NCPCR filed the complaint on May 29 with Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava, seeking an FIR against Twitter Inc and Twitter Communication India Private Limited (TCIPL), following its inquiry into the availability of child sexual abuse and pornographic material on the site.It asked the police chief for a copy of the FIR and action taken report in seven days. It sent a reminder on June 8 and summoned the CyPAD’s deputy commissioner of police, Anyesh Roy, to appear before the commission on June 29 (Tuesday) with the action taken report.In its complaint, the NCPCR also mentioned the registration of an FIR against Mohammad Zubair, co-founder of fact-checking website Alt News, by the Delhi Police’s cyber cell last year on a complaint the commission had received in regard to online threats and repeated incidents of stalking of a minor girl on Twitter allegedly by Zubair.The commission also expressed its discontent against Twitter and said the “Twitter handle of Mohammad Zubair is still active and there seems to be no action initiated or taken by Twitter against the aforesaid person, who has exposed a minor to harassment in the virtual world”. Zubair had denied the allegations to a news agency and added he would take legal recourse.The commission said it also conducted an inquiry into the spreading of child sexual abuse material and porn sites on the internet, web and social media platforms, including Twitter.“It was also observed by the commission that the toolkit for deep and dark web was also available on Twitter. Thus, giving access to all, including children, to obtain such material,” the complaint read.An official at Twitter, who asked not the named, said the site employs PhotoDNA technology, its own proprietary tools, and other systems to detect behavioural signals and remove media with such content. Viewing, sharing or uploading such content was prohibited on the site, the official added.“In 2019, we launched a feature in our search prompt that is aimed at deterrence of child sexual exploitation (CSE). The prompt was developed in collaboration with the ministry of home affairs and NGOs in India to blacklist specific CSE search keywords in Hindi, English, Bengali and Kannada,” the official further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-lodge-fir-over-child-pornographic-content-on-twitter-101624988658753.html
30-06-2021||Delhi||Covid-19: For third day, Delhi vaccinates more than 200,000||More than 202,000 people in Delhi were vaccinated against Covid-19 on Tuesday, a senior government official said, as the capital crossed the 200,000-mark for the third time since the Centre revised the vaccination policy on June 21 to provide free doses for all.Government records said around 204,000 were vaccinated on Monday, while the highest single-day vaccination -- 207,000 -- was reported on Saturday. Delhi reported less than 10,000 vaccinations last Sunday as all government-run vaccine centres were closed in the city.As per government data, of the 7.5 million vaccine doses administered so far in the Capital, around 4.1 million people have received at least one dose, and 1.7 million people have received both doses.“Turnout at vaccination sites in Delhi is very high now. Around 75% of it is people in the 18-45 years age group. Currently, Delhi has a capacity of administering 225,000 vaccine doses per day. We hope we are able to increase that in the coming days, for which vaccine supplies have to be scaled up,” said Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) legislator Atishi, while reading out the government’s vaccine bulletin in a video press briefing on Tuesday.The city has 1,374 vaccine sites spread across 763 locations – ranging from hospitals to dispensaries and schools -- which offer doses for free. The centres are currently open for all age groups and have the provision for on-spot registration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid19-for-third-day-delhi-vaccinates-more-than-200000-101624988657529.html
30-06-2021||Delhi||Make malaria a notifiable disease in Delhi: Health minister Harsh Vardhan||Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Tuesday postponed Delhi’s target of achieving zero indigenous transmission of malaria by two years, to 2022, and asked the Delhi government to make malaria a notifiable disease in the Capital.During a review meeting with lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain and mayors of the three MCDs, he also pushed the authorities to develop a community-driven approach towards eliminating the disease.While Delhi reported 228 cases of malaria last year, including the first death due to the disease in at least nine years, the city has seen only 11 cases of malaria till June 26 this year.“The target for elimination of malaria in Delhi has been postponed to 2022. This target is not impossible to achieve for Delhi because it is among Category 1 states where there is less than one case per 1,000 population. When it comes to malaria, in the last two to three years, the mortality has gone down by over 80% in the country which is a historic success,” said Dr Vardhan.There are 448 districts in the country where the annual parasite incidence or the number of cases of malaria per year per 1,000 population is less than one. These districts have been listed in category 1 and were given the target to achieve zero indigenous cases by 2020, according to the National Strategic Plan for Malaria Elimination (2017-2022). This is in line with the country’s target to achieve zero transmission by 2027, and maintain it for three years, to achieve malaria elimination by 2030.Noting down steps to be taken in this regard, Dr Vardhan said, “Capturing actual data from the Hospitals and taking preventive actions in the areas of infection is critical to achieve elimination. So is the regular reporting from the private sector essential for taking timely preventive measures and for accuracy of data pertaining to incidence of malaria. Further,as we move towards elimination, 10% of all fever cases need to be screened for malaria so that no cases of malaria can escape detection.”A senior official from the Union health ministry said, “This was not a hard target. The WHO (World Health Organisation) only recognises national level elimination and so the states were given sub-national targets to work towards. For Delhi, the challenge also is that many patients come in for treatment from neighbouring states and give Delhi addresses of their relatives, making it difficult to track the origin of the case.”Dr Vardhan added, “Malaria and dengue have not been made notifiable disease in Delhi despite being discussed every year. This is very important if we have to eliminate the disease. We need to know where every single case is being reported from, what is the environment nearby, and how we can prevent breeding. If the disease is made notifiable, we will be able to track every single case and develop micro-strategies.”Declaring a disease notifiable makes it legally mandatory for hospitals and private practitioners to report all cases to the administration. During the pandemic, Covid-19 as well as the secondary fungal infection, mucormycosis, were made notifiable disease in the state.According to a senior official from the North Delhi municipal corporation, which manages data for vector borne diseases like dengue, malaria, and chikungunya for the city, said, “The proposal for making malaria and dengue notifiable diseases was sent to the Delhi government in 2019. The file is still pending with the law department because – one, legal provisions are hard to change and take time, and two, the pandemic meant that the offices weren’t really functioning for almost 15 months.”‘Not an easy target’It will be extremely difficult to achieve the target of 2022 for Delhi, according to PL Joshi, former director of National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme. “This is because field level activities were disrupted completely by the pandemic. All field level workers that helped in malaria surveillance were mainly working to control Covid-19,” he said.He added that the other challenge was that most of the cases were caused by plasmodium vivax in Delhi. There are four plasmodiums that cause malaria in humans – falciparum, vivax, ovale, malariae – the most common being the first two.“Vivax malaria relapses and hence is difficult to eliminate. The treatment protocol is for 14 days so compliance is an issue; there is a need to follow up every case to ensure that they complete treatment and check for relapse. Currently, there is also no way to detect the plasmodium when it is dormant in the liver,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/make-malaria-a-notifiable-disease-health-minister-harsh-vardhan-101624988597538.html
30-06-2021||Delhi||50-75% saplings planted in Delhi between 2016-19 survived: Audit by FRI||The survival rate of new saplings planted in the National Capital between 2016 and 2019 has been between 50% and 75%, which is considered “good”, according to the third-party plantation audit conducted by Forest Research Institute, Dehradun.VK Dhawan, forestry expert at FRI Dehradun, who is leading the plantation audit for the Arvind Kejriwal-led government in Delhi, said that the plantation between 2016 and 2019 was analysed based on field data, and it was found to be “good”. “After analysing data from all the divisions of the Delhi forest department, we have come to the conclusion that the survival rate of plantation in Delhi has been between 50 and 75%, which is good.”Around 6.7 million new saplings were planted in Delhi during the plantation season from June to September, between 2016 and 2019. The Delhi forest department had planted more than 3 million saplings last year, too.He explained that 40-50% survival rate is considered “average”, 50-70% is considered “good”, 70-80% survival rate is considered “very good”, and 80-90% is considered “excellent”.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government had roped in FRI experts to conduct the plantation audit for the Delhi forest department, to ascertain an overall picture of the survival rate of new saplings planted in the city, the kind of species planted, and the benefits of planting such species. On Tuesday, FRI experts said that a draft audit report, the initial findings of which has been accessed by HT, will be submitted before the Delhi government this week, and the final report will be released by July-end.The environment department had also directed all other greening agencies in the city, including Delhi Development Authority (DDA), three municipal corporations in Delhi (east, north and south), New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), and the Public Works Department (PWD) among others, in 2019, to conduct similar third-party audits to ensure more effective plantation drives.Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said that FRI has completed its audit. “FRI Dehradun has completed analysing plantation between 2016 and 2019. The final report will be released by July end,” he said.The report suggested that the Delhi government focuses more on planting of native varieties, instead of exotic species, Dhawan added. “We have noticed that the Delhi forest department chooses very good plant species, and have largely planted native species, medicinal varieties, species that are known to control pollution levels and increase oxygen levels among others. They have also planted varieties of Ficus — that are known to be good for birds as they feed on the seeds — in many parts. So, the choice of species has been good, but there are some areas in the Capital where exotic species were planted, which require more care and are also not good for the ecology around it.”Exotic plant varieties require more water and nutrients from the soil, compared to native species.He said that exotic species such as bottle brush, varieties of eucalyptus, and others were found more around central Delhi.The FRI, in the report, has also given a detailed plan for the eradication of Prosopis juliflora or mesquite, which is an invasive species like Kikar, that interferes with the growth of native species planted around it. FRI experts have mentioned that the Kejriwal government must ensure “gradual removal” of this species by clearing the seeds and shortening the canopy of trees.“We have suggested to the Delhi government to consider planting along the Yamuna Pushta area since a lot of plants are being affected due to flooding of the river during monsoons. Either additional plantation should be done there, or plantation should be focused on parts where it is not affected by flooding,” Dhawan said.Meanwhile, environment experts said that such a third-party plantation audit will act as a “guiding document” for future plantations in the city. “Such third-party evaluation helps in assessing survival rates, drawbacks where growth is not up to the mark, and implement strategies to improve the efforts in the following years. Such plantation drives are organised every year, and it is important to know how many new saplings have survived, to fix accountability on the agencies,” said CR Babu, professor emeritus, Centre for Environment Management of Degraded Ecosystems, Delhi University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/5075-saplings-planted-in-delhi-between-2016-19-survived-audit-by-fri-101624988598076.html

Wildlife SOS and officials from the forest department rushed to provide on-site treatment and the Sambar was later released back into the wild. The incident occurred on the Kalyan Nirmal Highway (NH-222) near Vadkhal village, located in the Otur forest range of Pune district. Wounded and in severe shock, the Sambar was found sitting on the side of the road by concerned passers-by. They immediately alerted the forest department who contacted Wildlife SOS for medical assistance. Yogesh Ghodake, range forest officer, Otur, said, “Due to the quick intervention of the forest department and Wildlife SOS, the Sambar deer was able to receive timely help and safely return to the wild.” By the time a three-member team from Wildlife SOS joined the forest department, a huge crowd had gathered on the highway to catch a glimpse of the animal and take pictures of it on their cell phones. The forest officers immediately stepped up to control the crowd while Wildlife SOS veterinarian Dr Nikhil Bangar provided on-site treatment to the injured deer. The Sambar, according to forest department, could be around four-year-old. Dr. Nikhil Bangar, wildlife veterinary officer, Wildlife SOS, said, “The Sambar was in a state of shock and was unable to move, so we administered fluid therapy to help her regain strength. Fortunately, the deer had not sustained any severe injuries and we provided topical treatment for minor abrasions on the body. On recovering from the stressful ordeal, we diverted her towards the green patch on the side of the road.” Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder and CEO, Wildlife SOS, said, “It is not uncommon for us to receive rescue calls where an unsuspecting animal has been injured due to negligent or rash driving. Such callousness not only puts the life of the animal at risk but also poses a threat to the safety of humans. However, we are glad to see that more and more people are making a conscious decision to help out animals in distress.” The Sambar (Rusa unicolor) is a large deer native to the Indian subcontinent, southern China and Southeast Asia. Male sambar has unique stout and rugged antlers that are typically up to 110 centimetres long in adult individuals. Over the years, the Sambar population in the wild has been threatened due to loss of habitat and poaching, making them a vulnerable species under the IUCN Red Data List. This species is also protected under Schedule III of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/female-sambar-deer-rescued-after-getting-hit-by-vehicle-101624982297263.html
30-06-2021||Ranchi||Reduce private hospitals’ vaccine share to 5% in state: Jharkhand to Centre||The Jharkhand government has requested the Centre to reduce the share of vaccination in private hospitals from 25% to 5% in the state, owing to a host of factors such as demography, paying capacity and share of private hospitals in the state till date.Jharkhand’s additional chief secretary (health), Arun Kumar Singh wrote to Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Monday, requesting the Centre to provide 95% vaccines to the state government.“It is requested to reduce the share of vaccination in private hospitals from 25% to 5% in the state of Jharkhand. Atleast 95% of the vaccines for the state of Jharkhand should be allocated from the government route to enable equitable distribution of vaccines. This would also ensure adherence to the constitutional mandate of equity, equality and reasonable opportunity for all citizens,” Singh’s letter read.Substantiating the state’s request, the additional chief secretary underlined that 75% of the state’s population lives in rural areas having negligible access to private hospitals. Demand of vaccines in private hospitals even in urban centres is limited owing to lack of purchasing parity, as 37% of the population is below poverty line (BPL).The health secretary also highlighted that 13 of 24 districts in the state are scheduled tribal districts and 19 districts fall under left wing extremism (LWE) affected districts, where hesitancy about vaccination has been a key challenge.“A virtual meeting with private hospitals across the state was organised on June 16 to analyse their demand for procurement of vaccines on payment basis and it was found to be very limited. As a matter of fact, only three private hospitals in the state ordered for vaccines in the earlier scheme of vaccination for the age cohort 18-44 years, that too in minimal quantities and had to struggle to utilise the available stock. As you are aware, since the advent of Covid-19 vaccination in private hospitals on Jan 30, 2021, the share of calculation in private hospitals in the state has been less than 2% till April 30,” the secretary argued in his letter.As per the latest health bulletin, Jharkhand till now has vaccinated 67.73 lakh of its 3.29 crore population. While 57.27 lakh persons have received the first dose, 10.44 lakh persons have been given their second dose as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/reduce-pvt-hospitals-vaccine-share-to-5-in-state-j-khand-to-centre-101624982177831.html

The proposal to develop these depots was taken during the board meeting held recently and is likely to get approval from the final top authorities. PMPML has 13 depots of which four are reserved for electric buses. The newly renovated depots will have workshops along with ample parking facilities for the buses while the upper floors will accommodate hospitals, hotels and offices and other commercial establishments. VK Associates, a private agency was entrusted to carry out a feasibility report after which it conducted a survey of the depot. Following their report, the PMPML decided to take up the project. The survey report found out that the depots can be developed according to the areas where they are located. The agency has estimated that the modernization would fetch profits up to ₹1,516 crore for PMPML annually once the depots are developed and the space leased for commercial activities. The depots besides having facilities for buses will also have commercial offices, hotels, hospitals, which will bring in the desired revenues. At present, PMPML is facing a severe financial crunch and is not in a position to procure a loan from the banks. According to the PMPML authorities development of the depot will be carried out on a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model basis or by leasing out the property. PMPML managing director and chairman Rajendra Jagtap said, “There are 17 depots and 13 open spaces under PMPML jurisdiction. The decision to develop these places will be taken during the board meeting.” In a big decision a few days ago, the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd (PMPML) authorities will be constructing a dedicated mega charging station at its Manjri–Budruk-Shewalewadi depot to cater to the rising demand of electric buses in the near future. At present, the passenger traffic of the PMPML (before pandemic) was at 10.47 lakh on daily basis and the fleet utilization of the hired buses of the PMPML is more than PMPML-owned buses. The gap between revenue and expenditure was Rs23 crore in 2011-12, which increased to ₹315 crore in 2019-20According to the PMPML authorities, the projective cumulative losses of the PMPML for the next 10 years will be close to ₹9,600 crore. The current fleet size of PMPML consists of around 2,300 buses but around 1,400 buses remain on the streets daily (pre-pandemic times).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmpml-to-develop-30-depots-on-ppp-basis-at-a-cost-of-rs-11-666-crore-101624981937803.html

The restrictions are imposed to contain the Covid outbreak as the popular festival is scheduled to begin on September 10. The government’s letter gives guidelines on the 10-day celebrations and last day of immersion procession. Mandals have been instructed to arrange “darshan” of the diety online and avoid crowd at the daily prayers and offerings during the 10-day festival. Devotees are requested to make idols out of metals, marbles and other substance instead of traditional plaster of Paris and immerse ecofriendly idols at home. Civic bodies are instructed to set up artificial tanks and ponds for immersion. The guidelines states that mandals should not hold processions on the first and last days, and children and senior citizens should avoid visiting immersion spots. Mandals should also help municipalities, police, government authorities and health officials by following health norms. Mahesh Suryavanshi, treasurer, Dagdusheth Ganpati Mandal trust, said, “We welcome the state government’s guidelines for this year’s Ganeshotsav. We request the authorities to arrange meetings with local Ganpati mandals and share the guidelines in detail for each city as the festival is celebrated differently at various places. The festival celebrations in Mumbai and rest of Maharashtra are completely different. The issue of mandap set-up faced in Pune last year should be resolved this time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/maharashtra-issues-ganeshotsav-guidelines-amid-covid-situation-101624981817190.html

Speaking to CNN, Fauci highlighted the disparity in vaccination rates in different regions of the United States to express his concern over the spike in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases."When you have such a low level of vaccination superimposed upon a variant that has a high degree of efficiency of spread, what you are going to see among undervaccinated regions -- be that states, cities or counties -- you're going to see these individual types of blips," Fauci said."It's almost like it's going to be two Americas," the 80-year-old immunologist added.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the 'variant of concern' B.1.617.2, first detected in India, accounts for more than one-fourth of the total active Covid-19 cases in the country and has reached nearly every state. The United States has administered at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine to over 53% of its population and aims to achieve herd immunity through vaccination as soon as possible.Also Read | Fauci’s institute backs Covaxin, funded its efficacy boosterHowever, US authorities are now struggling to combat vaccine hesitancy when the Delta variant, known for its higher transmissibility, has started gaining more ground in the country, especially in places with low vaccination rates. States like Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, Wyoming, and Louisiana have less than 35% of residents fully vaccinated. In Mississippi, unvaccinated people accounted for more than 90% of Covid-related deaths in the past month."I'm concerned about the Delta variant...and I am worried that what we are seeing in terms of a plateauing of cases nationally but also an increase in cases in many small sections of the United States, that is, in fact, being driven by the Delta variant," US Surgeon General Dr Vivek Murthy told CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fauci-warns-of-two-americas-as-delta-variant-cases-rise-in-us-101625070616548.html

30-06-2021||World||Experts want countries to closely watch UK strategy of combating Delta variant||Experts are urging countries to watch the strategy of the United Kingdom closely as it attempts to out-vaccinate the potential third wave of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) driven by the highly transmissible Delta variant first detected in India, according to a CNN report. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had earlier expressed confidence in the government’s four-step roadmap out of lockdown that would have culminated on June 21 if not for the Delta variant.The government had to extend the final phase of lifting virtually all restrictions and returning back to normal on July 19, a goal targeted through aggressive vaccination drives. Britain boasts of one of the largest vaccination coverage in the world in terms of vaccination population percentage and should have been easier than other countries. However, the emergence of the Delta variant, which has become the dominant strain in the country, could potentially jeopardise Britain’s plan to return back to normal.Dr Susan Hopkins, strategy director for Covid-19 at Public Health England (PHE), recently said that it should be possible for 70 per cent of the adult population to receive both doses of Covid vaccine before July 19, indicating an endorsement of the government's position on the final phase of unlocking. But the country is now witnessing a worrying spike in Covid-19 cases, with nearly 120,000 new infections reported in the past week.The impact of vaccination has impacted the demography of infection since recent data on Covid-19 indicates that people under-30s, who have not been extensively vaccinated, were the ones largely infected by the virus. Deepti Gurdasani, a senior epidemiology lecturer at the Queen Mary University of London, told CNN that the Delta variant has the “potential to change the shape of the pandemic” in the UK.Also Read | Delta Plus: What should diabetic, high BP people do? All you need to knowWhile Britain’s new health secretary, Sajid Javid, has stressed that there’s “no reason” to reconsider the July 19 target for opening-up, several countries have started imposing restrictions on travellers from the UK in the wake of Delta variant spread. Hong Kong, a former British colony, has labelled the United Kingdom as an "extremely high-risk" location.As the variant of concern is becoming a dominant strain in many countries across the world, experts believe that they should look at Britain’s approach closely, which is solely relying on vaccines to contain a potential catastrophe. Gurdasani said that Britain needs to refocus the entire strategy, adding that all countries need to have a long term focus on masks and ventilation."What we're seeing is the dangers of a vaccine-only strategy. Vaccines are a hugely important part of our response, but we do need to protect our vaccines, and we need to reduce transmission," Gurdasani was quoted as saying by CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/experts-want-countries-to-closely-watch-uk-strategy-of-combating-delta-variant-101625062908781.html

On Earth, a significant amount of methane is produced by microbes that help livestock digest their food and the process ends with cattle releasing the gas into the air while exhaling or burping.Curiosity rover’s repeated detections of methane right above the surface of Gale Crater has captivated scientists and non-scientists alike as it may imply that microbes were, or are, present on the Red planet. It is also, however, possible that the gas was produced due to the geological processes that involve the interaction of rocks, water, and heat.But the mystery of methane gas intensified after ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter sent by the European Space Agency (ESA) failed to detect any methane higher in the Martian atmosphere.Chris Webster, a senior research scientist at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), said he was fully expecting the Trace Gas Orbiter team to report that there’s a small amount of methane everywhere on Mars when the orbiter came onboard in 2017.“But when the European team announced that it saw no methane, I was definitely shocked,” said Webster, lead of the Tunable Laser Spectrometer (TLS) instrument in the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) chemistry lab aboard the Curiosity rover.Also Read | Scientists use NASA satellite data to track ocean microplastics from spaceThe TLS has measured less than one-half part per billion (in volume) of methane on average in Gale Crater, punctuated by spikes of up to 20 parts per billion in volume. The contradictory data from the high precision of Curiosity’s TLS and the European orbiter, designed to be the gold standard for measuring methane and other gases over the whole planet, baffled the scientists.John E Moores, a planetary scientist from York University in Toronto, published an intriguing prediction in 2019 asking “what if Curiosity and the Trace Gas Orbiter both are right?" The hypothesis suggested that the discrepancy between methane measurements comes down to the time of day they’re taken.TLS operates mostly at night when no other Curiosity instruments are working since it needs a lot of power. Moores noted that the Martian atmosphere is calm at night, so the methane seeping from the ground builds up near the surface where Curiosity can detect it. On the other hand, the European orbiter requires sunlight to pinpoint methane about 5 kilometres above the surface.During the daytime, warm air rises and cool air sinks. The methane gas detected near the Martian surface at night gets mixed into the atmosphere during the day, getting diluted to undetectable levels.The Curiosity team decided to test Moores’ prediction and powered TLS over the course of one Martian day, bracketing one night-time measurement with two daytime ones. SAM sucked in Martian air for two hours, leaving a concentrated sample of methane that TLS could easily measure by passing an infrared laser beam through it many times“John predicted that methane should effectively go down to zero during the day, and our two daytime measurements confirmed that,” said Paul Mahaffy, the principal investigator of SAM.While the scientists were able to solve the mystery behind variations, they are yet to solve the global methane puzzle at Mars. According to Nasa, methane is a stable molecule that is expected to last on Mars for about 300 years before getting torn apart by solar radiation. But scientists suspect that something is destroying methane on Mars in less than 300 years, given the constant seeping of methane from similar craters should have accumulated enough in the atmosphere for the Trace Gas Orbiter to detect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-closer-to-solving-methane-mystery-on-mars-says-nasa-101625056847448.html
30-06-2021||World||Vladimir Putin says he received both doses of Sputnik-V, urges Russians to follow suit||Vladimir Putin, the Russian president on Wednesday said that he was vaccinated with Russia's Sputnik V vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) earlier in March and April during the annual nationwide televised phone-in show in Moscow, news agencies reported.Putin said that he felt he needed to be protected against Covid-19 for as long as possible and also said that he did not feel any significant side-effects barring tenderness at the jab site. “After the first shot, I didn't feel anything at all. About four hours later, I felt that there was some tenderness where I had received the shot. I received the second at mid-day. At midnight, I measured my temperature. It was 98.9°F. I went to sleep, when I woke up my temperature was 97.8°F. That was it,” Putin told the nation.Putin said that he is against mandatory vaccination but said that the army is getting vaccinated with Sputnik-V like him. He also defended the local authorities taking steps to ensure vaccination saying it is needed to avoid a national lockdown. “The military is getting vaccinated with Sputnik V, and after all I'm the commander-in-chief,” Putin said. The Russian president however urged Russians to not listen to rumours and pay heed to what the specialists are saying about the vaccine. He said it is ‘necessary’ to avoid listening to people ‘who understand less and spread rumours’.Putin’s comments come in the backdrop of Russia reporting a record-high number of deaths from coronavirus in the last 24 hours and as daily case tally remained above 20,000. Russia on Wednesday reported 669 deaths and 21,042 fresh cases which brought the caseload to more than 5.5 million.The government is also concerned about the vaccine hesitancy among Muscovites. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov earlier this week admitted that Russia will fail to vaccinate 60% of the population within the fall season. Only 16% Russians have had at least one dose so far whereas the European Union and the United States have vaccinated more than 50% and 54% of its population respectively.(with inputs from Reuters, Bloomberg)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-says-he-received-both-doses-of-sputnik-v-asks-russians-to-follow-suit-101625052716989.html

30-06-2021||World||WHO declares China malaria-free after nation reports zero cases for last 4 years||China was certified as malaria-free on Wednesday by the World Health Organization, following a 70-year effort to eradicate the mosquito-borne disease.The country reported 30 million cases of the infectious disease annually in the 1940s but has now gone four consecutive years without an indigenous case."We congratulate the people of China on ridding the country of malaria," said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus."Their success was hard-earned and came only after decades of targeted and sustained action. With this announcement, China joins the growing number of countries that are showing the world that a malaria-free future is a viable goal."Countries that have achieved at least three consecutive years of zero indigenous cases can apply for WHO certification of their malaria-free status. They must present rigorous evidence -- and demonstrate the capacity to prevent transmission re-emerging.Beijing, which is in the middle of a propaganda push ahead of celebrations for the 100th anniversary of the founding of its ruling Communist Party this week, hailed the WHO's certification as a "great achievement for China's human rights cause"."The CCP and the Chinese government have always prioritised safeguarding people's health, safety and prosperity," said foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin at a routine briefing in Beijing."Eliminating malaria is a great contribution by China to human health and global human rights progress."China becomes the 40th territory certified malaria-free by the Geneva-based WHO.The last countries to gain the status were El Salvador (2021), Algeria and Argentina (2019), and Paraguay and Uzbekistan (2018).There is a separate list of 61 countries where malaria never existed, or disappeared without specific measures.China is also the first country in the WHO's Western Pacific region to be awarded a malaria-free certification in more than three decades.The WHO's World Malaria Report 2020 warned global progress against the disease was plateauing, particularly in African countries bearing the brunt of cases and deaths.In 2019 the global tally of malaria cases was estimated at 229 million -- a figure that has been at the same level for the past four years.'Outside the box' In the 1950s, Beijing started working out where malaria was spreading and began to combat it with preventative anti-malarial medicines, said the WHO.The country reduced mosquito breeding grounds and stepped up spraying insecticide in homes.While searching for new malaria treatments in the 1970s, China discovered artemisinin -- the core compound of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), which are the most effective antimalarial drugs available.In the 1980s, China was among the first countries to extensively test the use of insecticide-treated nets to prevent malaria. By 1988, more than 2.4 million had been distributed nationwide.By the end of 1990, the number of malaria cases in China had plummeted to 117,000, and deaths had been cut by 95 percent."China's ability to think outside the box served the country well in its own response to malaria, and also had a significant ripple effect globally," said Pedro Alonso, director of the WHO's global malaria programme. Southern border surveillance From 2003, China stepped up efforts across the board that brought annual case numbers down to around 5,000 within 10 years.After four consecutive years of zero indigenous cases, China applied for WHO certification in 2020.Experts travelled to China in May this year to verify its malaria-free status -- and its plans to prevent the disease from coming back.The risk of imported cases remains a concern, not only among people returning from sub-Saharan Africa and other malaria-hit regions, but also in the southern Yunnan province, which borders Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam, all struggling with the disease.China has stepped up its malaria surveillance in at-risk zones in a bid to prevent the disease re-emerging, said the WHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-declares-china-malaria-free-after-nation-reports-zero-cases-for-last-4-years-101625044219458.html

The boy, identified by his family name Huang, was admitted to a hospital on April 21 and had been in a coma for 70 days with severe brain haemorrhages, reported news agency AFP. Huang’s parents decided to withdraw his life support after he developed respiratory problems as well as multiple organ failure.The boy’s coach, identified by his surname Ho, reportedly not only directed other judo students to practise their throws on Huang, but he himself threw the boy a dozen more times, according to the prosecutors. The boy had complained of a bad headache but the coach continued throwing him to the floor until he turned pale and became unresponsive. He was rushed to Feng Yuan Hospital in central Taichung city after the alleged physical assault.According to Taiwan News, doctors said the boy’s injuries resembled those from a car crash. The severe haemorrhages prompted doctors to perform craniotomy and after the operation, declared that Huang was in a “brain dead state.” Citing Huang’s family, local media reported that the boy was thrown about 27 times. Prosecutors said his head repeatedly hit the floor but did not specify how many times."Wish you can rest in peace in another world and the justice system can finally bring comfort to your family," Taichung city mayor Lu Shiow-yen, who visited the boy in hospital, said in a post on her Facebook page.Earlier this month, Ho was charged with physical assault resulting in serious injuries and using children to commit a crime, prosecutors said in a statement. The accused has denied any wrongdoing saying that “it was a normal judo lesson. We did not use inappropriate force and had no idea that he sustained grave injuries,” according to the prosecutors.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/7yearold-taiwan-boy-thrown-27-times-during-judo-class-dies-101625044414330.html
30-06-2021||World||Explained: What's causing heat wave in Northwestern US, Canada||A sweltering heat wave that has settled over western Canada for several days is believed to be a contributing factor in dozens of sudden death calls received by police in the Vancouver area, authorities said on Tuesday. The temperature has reached a record 49.5 degrees Celsius.At least 134 people have died suddenly since Friday in the Vancouver area, according to figures released by the city police department and the Royal Canadian Mounted police, reports news agency AFP.When does rising temperature is labelled heat wave?According to the National Weather Service (NWS), in most parts of the country, temperatures must be above the historical average in an area for two or more days before the label heat wave is applied to a hot spell, reports AFP.How does a heat wave form?Heat waves begin when high pressure in the atmosphere moves in and pushes warm air towards the ground. That air warms up further as it is compressed and one begins to feel a lot hotter, said the NWS.What's causing the heat wave?The ongoing heat wave affecting the northwestern United States and adjacent Canada is because of a combination of weather effects and climate-driven warming, said the NWS.This heat wave is being driven by an extreme strong heat dome. Heat domes or sprawling ridges of high pressure are a staple of summer. They bring copious sunshine and sinking air that heats up as it is compressed.This particular heat dome is unprecedented for its strength in the Pacific Northwest and it has blown away records based on measurements from three miles high in the sky down to the ground.Places in North America currently experiencing a heat waveOne of the hottest cities on the continent on Monday was Salem, Oregon, about 45 miles southwest of Portland, where the high temperature reached 117 degrees Fahrenheit,, the NWS said.Canada broke a national heat record on Sunday when the temperature in a small town in British Columbia reached almost 116 degrees, breaking an 84-year-old record by nearly 3 degrees.The Northeast, under a separate weather system from the Northwest, is also in the middle of a three-day heat wave that is expected to end on Thursday. Boston reached 97 degrees on Monday, tying its record for that date, the NWS said.When will the heat wave end?Forecasters say that temperatures will remain hot upto next week in the Pacific Northwest. In Portland, temperatures have moderated somewhat but are expected to reach the mid-80s later in the week, said Clinton Rockey, a meteorologist with the NWS in Portland. Temperatures will remain 10 to 20 degrees above average at least until next Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-what-s-causing-heat-wave-in-northwestern-us-canada-101625036778779.html

"Vancouver has never experienced heat like this, and sadly dozens of people are dying because of it," police sergeant Steve Addison said.Other local municipalities have said they too have responded to many sudden death calls, but have yet to release tolls.The scorching heat stretching from the US state of Oregon to Canada's Arctic territories has been blamed on a high-pressure ridge trapping warm air in the region.Temperatures in the US Pacific Northwest cities of Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington reached levels not seen since record-keeping began in the 1940s-- 115 degrees Fahrenheit in Portland and 108 in Seattle Monday, according to the National Weather Service (NWS).The heat wave has forced schools and Covid-19 vaccination centers to close in the Vancouver area, while officials set up temporary water fountains and misting stations on street corners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-130-dead-as-canada-reels-under-record-breaking-temperature-101625035130182.html
30-06-2021||World||A brief history of China's Communist Party as it celebrates 100 years||China's ruling Communist Party will celebrate the 100th anniversary of its founding on July 1. In the build-up to it, President Xi Jinping and the party have exhorted its members and the nation to remember the early days of struggle in the hills of the inland city of Yan'an, where former president of the People's Republic of China Mao Zedong established himself as party leader in the 1930s.Origin of Communist PartyThe Communist Party of China (CCP) was founded in 1921, holding its first Congress in Shanghai, with the help of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, during a tough period after the nation had a decade earlier cast off 2,000 years of dynastic rule.Mao's role in the finding of the partyAt the initial Congress, Mao Zedong was the representative for Hunan province. He rose to become the commander of the Red Army in 1935 and became the founding leader of the People's Republic of China in 1949.Members of the partyThe CCP's ranks have risen roughly in line with China's population, totalling 95.2 million members as of this month or 6.7 per cent of the Chinese population.Initially founded as a party for peasants and workers, the CCP has become increasingly diverse. In 1982, it shifted its focus to recruiting university students and in 2002 began to welcome private entrepreneurs. Men dominate the party, with women making up only 28.8 per cent of members. All seven members of top party leadership are men.The members from ethnic minoritiesEthnic minorities make up 7.5 per cent of members, slightly less than their share in China's population. Party members are required to be secular atheists, renouncing religions including Buddhism and Taoism, which have been present in Chinese society for centuries.How does one join the party?Chinese youth and students with good grades and behaviour are chosen by teachers to join the Young Pioneers, who don red neckerchiefs to set themselves apart and are given leadership roles to manage other students. The same process repeats in high school, where good students join the Youth League, the teenage wing of the party.Application to join the party proper is a laborious process that typically begins in university and lasts two to three years. The process has several stages, ending in an oath-swearing in front of the party's hammer-and-sickle flag.Membership cardsMembers must pay dues set at 0.5 per cent to 2 per cent of their income. Under Xi, the party has encouraged party members to wear the party badge to show their affiliation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-brief-history-of-china-s-communist-party-as-it-celebrates-100-years-101625029448335.html

Queiroga further said his team would probe the allegations during the period of the suspension of the contract."According to the preliminary analysis of the CGU, there are no irregularities in the contract, but for compliance, the health ministry chose to suspend the contract," a statement from the ministry read.The allegations against Bolsonaro, who is facing mounting pressure and protests at home for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, became known after whistleblowers went public with the alleged irregularities. An official of the health ministry said he, too, alerted the president about his concerns.Also Read: Brazilians protest Bolsonaro's role in half a million Covid-19 deathsBrazil signed a deal with India's Bharat Biotech International Limited for 20 million doses of its anti-Covid vaccine Covaxin. But federal prosecutors have now opened an investigation into the deal, citing comparatively high prices, "quick talks," and pending regulatory approvals as red flags. The deal is also under the scanner of a Senate panel probing the federal government's handling of the pandemic.Additionally, a leading opposition member on the Senate panel, Senator Randolfe Rodrigues, on Monday filed a formal complaint against Bolsonaro at the Supreme Court, seeking a probe into the "serious allegations" by the court.

The US sees the announcement as a potential positive development if it leads to changes on the ground, the state department said."We are closely monitoring developments. We call on all parties to commit to an immediate, indefinite, negotiated ceasefire, so as to end the violence, restore stability to Tigray, and create a context for an inclusive dialogue that preserves the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Ethiopian state," State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement on Tuesday.The United States also urges Ethiopian authorities to immediately restore telecommunication services in Tigray and permit unhindered freedom of movement, Price added.Meanwhile, the rebels in the Tigray region gained more territory on Tuesday as part of the nearly eight-month-long conflict that has claimed thousands of lives. The Tigray Defence Forces' (TDF) latest victory came in the town of Shire, in the counter offensive they launched against the government crackdown.Shire was captured just a day after regional capital Mekele was wrested by the TDF on Monday. The victory led to street celebrations in multiple locations.In a statement, Tigray's pre-war government said Mekele is under complete control of TDF. "We reiterate our expressed commitment and pledge that Tigray will indeed be the graveyard of the unjust and unholy coalition of invading forces," the statement further said.Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, winner of the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, sent troops into Tigray last November to oust the northern region's former ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).He said the move came in response to TPLF attacks on federal army camps, and promised that victory would be swift.But his military has suffered a dramatic reversal at the hands of TDF.The brutal war in Tigray has been marked by massacres, widespread sexual violence and other abuses. The United Nations has also warned that roughly 350,000 people face starvation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tigray-rebels-gain-more-ground-us-gives-cautious-welcome-to-ethiopia-ceasefire-101625030738727.html

Our close ties to India and India’s support for us early in the pandemic call for our support. As case rates continue to decline, we must help them finish the battle against the second wave and win the war against Covid-19 altogether.”The resolution “recognises the efforts of the administration to deliver urgently needed medical supplies and vaccine raw materials to India; (and) urges the administration to facilitate private, in-kind medical supply donations to India and work to deliver additional, urgently needed medical supplies to India, including oxygen generator plants and a cryogenic oxygen tanker and containers.”The passage of the resolution came just a day after the US Agency for International Development (USAID) announced $41 million more in assistance, taking up the total to $200 million, in addition to $500 million of supplies and relief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-house-passes-resolution-on-covid-19-help-for-india-101625030540092.html
30-06-2021||World||Fauci’s institute backs Covaxin, funded its efficacy booster||A top US infectious diseases institute on Tuesday said it funded research that led to the development of a chemical substance that boosts the efficacy of Bharat Biotech’s Covid-19 vaccine, Covaxin, which, studies have suggested, can effectively neutralise the Alpha and Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2.The adjuvant used in Covaxin - Alhydroxiquim-II - has been developed by ViroVax of Lawrence, Kansas, a company founded and run by Indian-American Sunil David.The US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) said the project was exclusively supported and funded by its adjuvant development programme. “Ending a global pandemic requires a global response,” said Anthony Fauci, the NIAID director, and added, throwing the institute’s weight behind the vaccine, “I am pleased that a novel vaccine adjuvant developed in the United States with NIAID support is part of an efficacious Covid-19 vaccine available to people in India.”David had been working with the NIAID Adjuvant Program since 2009, since he founded the company after 20 years of research and teaching on the faculty of the University of Kansas and University of Minnesota. He has focused on “searching for novel molecules that activate innate immune receptors and developing them as vaccine adjuvants”.David went to Christian Medical College in Vellore and came to the US after postdoctoral training stints at Borstel, Germany, and the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.Covaxin is one of the two most popular Covid-19 vaccines in India, alongside AstraZeneca’s Covishield. Though results of Phase 3 clinical trials are awaited, it has been given emergency use authorisation in India.NIAID gave the vaccine its backing - drugs are authorised and regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration - saying, “Unpublished interim results from the Phase 3 trial indicate that the vaccine has 78% efficacy against symptomatic disease, 100% efficacy against severe Covid-19, including hospitalisation, and 70% efficacy against asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.”The institute also cited two studies that Covaxin generates antibodies that “effectively neutralise” both Alpha and Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2.Here is how this adjuvant works, according to NIAID: “The adjuvant comprises a small molecule attached in a unique way to Alhydrogel, a substance frequently called alum that is the most commonly used adjuvant in vaccines for people. Alhydroxiquim-II travels to lymph nodes, where the small molecule detaches from alum and activates two cellular receptors. These receptors, TLR7 and TLR8, play a vital role in the immune response to viruses.”Bharat Biotech signed a licensing agreement with ViroVax in 2019 for some of its candidate vaccines - also arranged by NIAID under the Indo-US Vaccine Action Program - and expanded the licence to include its use in the Covid-19 vaccine after the breakout of the epidemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/faucis-institute-backs-covaxin-funded-its-efficacy-booster-101625029640619.html
30-06-2021||World||North Korea's Kim sacks top officials after Covid-19 'grave incident'||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has replaced several top officials after a "grave incident" in the country's efforts to defend itself against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), according to news agency AP on Wednesday, which cited reports in state media.Pyongyang closed its borders in January last year to defend itself against the Covid-19 pandemic that first emerged in neighbouring China.North Korea has claimed to have had no cases of coronavirus infections throughout the pandemic, despite testing thousands of people and sharing a border with its ally China, where the first Covid-19 cases were confirmed in late 2019. But officials had "caused a grave incident that poses a huge crisis to the safety of the nation and its people", Kim told a politburo meeting, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).The alleged “grave incident” in North Korea's pandemic fight was not specified in the report from the KCNA.Kim added that the "incompetence and irresponsibility of the senior officials are a major factor that hampers the implementation of important tasks", adding that they were "captivated by selfishness and passivity". Earlier, Kim had warned his people to prepare for the "worst-ever situation".New members of the presidium of the politburo -- the highest decision-making body of the ruling Workers' Party -- and the politburo were named at the meeting on Tuesday, KCNA reported, adding that "government officials were transferred and appointed".From the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, North Korea described its anti-virus efforts as a “matter of national existence,” banned tourists, jetted out diplomats and severely curtailed cross-border traffic and trade.Earlier this month, Kim during a political conference, called for officials to brace for prolonged Covid-19 restrictions, indicating that the country isn’t ready to open its borders anytime soon despite its economic woes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-sacks-top-officials-after-covid-19-grave-incident-101625015089710.html
30-06-2021||World||Northwest US battles 'unprecedented' heat wave; deaths, power outage reported||As the northwest US battles an "unprecedented" heat wave, officials have said at least more than half a dozen deaths in Washington and Oregon might be due to the heat wave that began last week.In Oregon, an immigrant from Guatemala who apparently arrived in the US just a few months ago, and was working at a nursery in St. Paul, might have died due to the heat wave, the state's worker safety agency, known as Oregon Osha, said. Also in Oregon, officials in Bend said deaths of two homeless people may have been weather-related. Meanwhile, deaths of four people in Washington's Bremerton were also ascribed to weather.The National Weather Service said the "dangerous" weather which led to consecutive days of record high temperatures exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 degrees Celsius) in both Seattle (Washington state) and Portland (Oregon) is now expected to ease though the agency also said the mercury was recorded at 109 Fahrenheit or 42.2 degrees Celsius in Spokane (Washington)-the highest-ever temperature recorded there.According to energy corporation Avista Utilities, about 9,300 of its customers in Spokane lost power on Monday, adding that more "planned" blackouts began on Tuesday afternoon. "We try to limit outages to one hour per customer," said Heather Rosentrater, an Avista Utilities vice president.Explaining why the company had to implement deliberate blackouts, Avista president and chief executive Dennis Vermillion said, "The electric system experienced a new peak demand, and the strain of high temperatures impacted the system in a way that required us to proactively turn off power for customers. This happened faster than anticipated.US president Joe Biden, while delivering a speech in Wisconsin, also took note of the heat wave in the northwest. "“Anybody ever believe you’d turn on the news and see it’s 116 degrees in Portland Oregon? 116 degrees!

30-06-2021||World||Indian nationals in Afghanistan warned against rising violence||Rezaul H Laskarletters@hindustantimes.comNew DelhiIndia on Tuesday issued a detailed and specific security alert for its nationals in Afghanistan against the backdrop of an escalation in violent attacks by terror groups, warning that they should exercise utmost vigilance as they faced a “serious threat of kidnapping”.The security advisory was issued by the Indian embassy amid a massive surge in violence by the Taliban, which has enhanced its efforts to wrest control of territory from Afghan government forces as the US continues withdrawing its forces from Afghanistan. The alert, also tweeted by the Indian embassy’s handle, said terror groups operating in Afghanistan had “escalated violent activities and carried out a series of complex attacks in various parts of Afghanistan...”Meanwhile, the Afghan Taliban, in a statement, said “all civilian and non-military foreign nationals, diplomats, embassies, consulates and workers of humanitarian organisations” would not “face any problems or security risks” from the organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-nationals-in-afghanistan-warned-against-rising-violence-101625012103000.html
30-06-2021||World||Death toll in Florida condo building collapse rises to 12||Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava says another victim has been found in the rubble of a collapsed Florida condo building.The new discovery brings the death toll to 12, with 149 people still unaccounted for.Elected officials pledged Tuesday to conduct multiple investigations into the collapse of an oceanfront Florida condo tower, vowing to convene a grand jury and to look closely “at every possible angle” to prevent any other building from experiencing such a catastrophic failure.Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said she and her staff will meet with engineering, construction and geology experts, among others, to review building safety issues and develop recommendations "to ensure a tragedy like this will never, ever happen again."State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said she will pursue a grand jury investigation to examine factors and decisions that led to Thursday's collapse of the 12-story Champlain Towers South in Surfside. The disaster killed at least 11 people and left 150 unaccounted for.Even as officials looked to the future to determine the cause of the collapse, they were resolute in vowing to continue the effort to find survivors.On the sixth day of a painstaking search, Governor Ron DeSantis evoked a well-known military commitment to leave no one behind on the battlefield and pledged to do the same for the people still missing in the rubble.“The way I look at it, as an old Navy guy, is when somebody is missing in action, in the military, you're missing until you're found. We don't stop the search," DeSantis said at a news conference."I think that's what is happening. Those first responders are breaking their backs trying to find anybody they can. I think they are going to continue to do that. They've been very selfless. They've put themselves at risk to do it.”Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett cited the case of a woman who was found alive 17 days after a garment factory collapsed in 2013, killing more than 1,000 people in Dhaka, Bangladesh.“No one is giving up hope here. ... We are dedicated to getting everyone out of that pile of rubble," Burkett said.Also on Tuesday, the White House announced that President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden would travel to Surfside on Thursday.Martin Langesfeld, whose sister, 26-year-old Nicole Langesfeld, is missing in the collapse, also expressed hope that there are still survivors.“We're not alone in this. There's hope. I really believe miracles do happen. Things like this have happened around the world," he said during a vigil Monday night on the beach near the collapsed building.The collapse has drawn scrutiny of the safety of older high-rise buildings throughout South Florida. Cava ordered a 30-day audit on whether buildings 40 years old or older are complying with a required recertification of their structural integrity, and that any issues raised by inspections are being addressed.On Tuesday, the mayor said building inspections have found four balconies in one building in Miami-Dade County that “must be immediately closed due to safety concerns".Previous grand juries in South Florida have examined other large-scale disasters, such as the 2018 collapse of a pedestrian bridge at Florida International University, which killed six people. That investigation is ongoing.Criminal charges in such matters are possible, such as the third-degree felony murder and manslaughter charges brought in the 1996 crash of ValuJet Flight 592, which killed 110 people in the Everglades.Work at the site has been deliberate and treacherous. Debris fell onto the search area overnight from the shattered edge of the part of the building that still stands. That forced rescuers to mark a “don't go beyond here” line and focus their efforts on parts of the debris pile that are farther from the structure, Burkett told Miami television station WSVN.Several members of an Israeli rescue team worked partly on hands and knees Tuesday over a small section of the rubble, digging with shovels, pickaxes and saws. They removed debris into buckets that were dumped into a metal construction bin, which was periodically lifted away by a crane. The crane then delivered an empty bin.Late in the afternoon, rescue officials sounded a horn for a second time during the day's work, signaling an approaching storm with lightning. Workers temporarily evacuated.Authorities said it's still a search-and-rescue operation, but no one has been found alive since hours after the collapse on Thursday.The pancake collapse of the building left layer upon layer of intertwined debris, frustrating efforts to reach anyone who may have survived in a pocket of space.The authorities meet frequently with families to explain what they're doing and to answer questions. They have discussed how DNA matches are made to help identify the dead, how next-of-kin will be contacted and explained in “extreme detail” how they are searching the mound, the mayor said.With that knowledge, Cava said, families are coming to their own conclusions.“Some are feeling more hopeful, some less hopeful, because we do not have definitive answers. We give them the facts. We take them to the site," she said."They have seen the operation. They understand now how it works, and they are preparing themselves for news, one way or the other.”Rachel Spiegel, whose 66-year-old mother, Judy Spiegel, is missing, said Tuesday that she was hoping for a miracle, but she also wrote about looking beyond the tragedy.“Our mom Judy was the glue that kept our family together. All of the family mementos, photos, clothing and heirlooms our father and mother have collected over the past 65 years were lost in a matter of seconds,” Spiegel wrote in a message about setting up a fund for charities on behalf of her mother.“As we continue to search for meaning in this catastrophe, we must also look to the future and rebuild.”In a text message exchange with The Associated Press, she added, “Please keep praying for a miracle".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-in-florida-condo-building-collapse-rises-to-12-101625008569442.html
30-06-2021||World||US to close 4 emergency shelters for migrant children||US officials will close four emergency facilities set up to house record numbers of migrant children crossing the Mexican border alone but cautioned Tuesday that minors were still arriving.The Department of Health and Human Services will shut two facilities in Texas and two at convention centers in California by early August, Aurora Miranda-Maese, juvenile coordinator for the agency's office of refugee resettlement, said during a court hearing about custody conditions for migrant children.Four of the large-scale shelters will remain open, including one that has faced criticism from immigrant advocates at Fort Bliss Army Base in El Paso, Texas, she said. Others are in Albion, Michigan; Pecos, Texas; and Pomona, California, she said.US officials have reported a recent drop in the number of children held in emergency facilities, including a more than 40% decline at Fort Bliss since mid-June. Miranda-Maese said more children are being released to relatives in the US or being sent to state-licensed shelters, which have a higher standard of care.The emergency sites were set up by the Biden administration this spring to handle a rise in the number of children arriving on the southern border alone, many fleeing violence in Central America and seeking to reunite with relatives in the United States.Henry A. Moak Jr., juvenile coordinator for US Customs and Border Protection, said it isn't clear whether that's about to change despite the summer heat.“It appears the numbers are still going up,” he told the court. “I don’t know if the hot weather is going to deter that at all.”Health and Human Services cares for the children until they can be sent to live with relatives in the United States. The agency has about 15,000 children in its care, and fewer than 3,000 in emergency facilities, Miranda-Maese said. But she noted that the number of children received from border authorities has increased in the past week.“That's concerning because this is definitely a very difficult and challenging time to be crossing the border,” she said.Miranda-Maese recognized the challenges at Fort Bliss and said the facility was being reconfigured to a more child-friendly pod system with single cots instead of doubles. She said officials also are working to improve the system to screen relatives more quickly so children can go live with them.Her comments came during a hearing in a federal court in Los Angeles that oversees a longstanding settlement governing custody conditions for immigrant children.In recent filings to the court, more than a dozen children described their desperation to get out of the emergency facilities. In one account, a teenage girl said she had been at Fort Bliss for nearly 60 days and could hardly sleep at night because the lights were always on and she resorted to eating only popsicles and juice because the food was foul.Carlos Holguin, an attorney for the children, said advocates were concerned that well-run facilities like one at the Long Beach Convention Center were being shut down while Fort Bliss will remain open. He also said it wasn't clear which children were sent to state-licensed shelters, which are governed by different standards, and which are sent to the emergency sites.Officials are expected to file updates to the court in July. Another hearing is scheduled for August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-close-4-emergency-shelters-for-migrant-children-101625005499528.html
30-06-2021||World||New Israeli foreign minister Yair Lapid in the UAE on first state visit||Israel’s foreign minister kicked off the highest-level visit by an Israeli official to the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday, nine months after the two countries established relations in a deal brokered by the United States.Foreign Minister Yair Lapid met the UAE's foreign minister in Abu Dhabi and inaugurated Israel's first embassy in the Gulf.Although the visit is historic, it received little fanfare across local media. Lapid was not greeted on the airport tarmac by Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, but by a lower-ranking minister of state. Even press access for Lapid’s various appearances in Abu Dhabi was strictly limited to Emirati media and select Israeli outlets traveling with him.The toned-down atmosphere surrounding his visit belies the UAE's open-arm embrace of its newfound ties with Israel. In recent months, the two countries have rapidly expanded bilateral trade and signed investment deals, including in gas, technology and other sectors. More than 200,000 Israeli tourists have traveled to the UAE, the Israeli Foreign Ministry has said. Many of those visits have been to Dubai, which is open to tourists.Lapid's visit, however, comes just weeks after a new government in Israel was formed in a power-sharing deal that named the ideologically hawkish, right-wing Naftali Bennett as Israel’s prime minister.His visit also comes less than six week after emotions ran high across the Middle East amid Israel's 11-day war in the Gaza Strip that killed 254 Palestinians, including dozens of children. In Israel, 13 people died as a result of the conflict.Lapid told diplomats gathered at the official opening of the Israeli Embassy in Abu Dhabi that the moment represented “the right to determine our fate by ourselves.” Israel, he said, isn’t going anywhere.“The Middle East is our home. We’re here to stay. We call on all the countries of the region to recognize that. And to come talk to us,” he said, according to the speech released by Israel’s Foreign Ministry.The Gaza war and tensions in Jerusalem, however, have interrupted US-backed diplomatic efforts to encourage more Arab states to sign normalization deals with Israel.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken described Lapid’s visit as “significant for Israel, the UAE, and the broader region.” In a statement, he said the US will work with Israel and the UAE to strengthen the partnership.The Trump administration brokered the so-called "Abraham Accords" agreement that established ties between the UAE and Israel. It was hailed at the time by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Donald Trump as among their greatest achievements.Lapid’s visit to the UAE was one that Netanyahu had hoped to make himself before his 12-year-run at the helm ended earlier this month. He had repeatedly tried to score a lightning trip to Abu Dhabi to boost his re-election campaign.In acknowledgement of Netanyahu, Lapid told diplomats gathered at the Israeli Embassy that the former prime minister is “the architect of the Abraham Accords” and that “this moment is his, no less than it is ours.”Underpinning UAE-Israel ties is a shared concern that Iran's nuclear deal with world powers did not go far enough to curb Tehran's reach in the region. Their reservations about the deal helped propel quiet ties, long before they formally announced full diplomatic relations last year.President Joe Biden is pushing to revive and expand the nuclear accord, which Trump pulled the US out of in 2018. Earlier this week, Lapid was quoted as saying that Israel has serious reservations about the nuclear deal being discussed in Vienna, but pledged Israel would make its objections privately. It’s expected that Lapid’s conversation with his Emirati counterpart included talk of Iran.“There’s been years of under-the-radar relations between Israel and the UAE, and we are now enjoying the fruits of the infrastructure of peace that we’ve built in the last decades,” said Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Lior Haiat.On Wednesday, Lapid will inaugurate Israel’s consulate in Dubai and visit the site of the World Fair's Expo in Dubai, which will open in October. Lapid is also due to meet with members of the expatriate Jewish community residing in Dubai.The UAE’s move to formalize ties with Israel marked the first time in over two decades that an Arab state had normalized relations with Israel. It paved the path for a similar announcement by Bahrain, and later by Sudan and Morocco in rapid succession.Soon after its pact with Israel, the UAE scored US authorization for the sale of 50 advanced F-35 fighter jets, which would make it only the second country in the Middle East, after Israel, to acquire them.Meanwhile, Palestinians across the political spectrum have slammed the UAE’s ties with Israel in the absence of peace talks or concessions toward a two-state solution.In May, tensions flared in east Jerusalem when Israeli forces clashed with Palestinian protesters and worshippers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in the final days of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. The site in east Jerusalem is holy to both Jews and Muslims.The tensions in Jerusalem drew rare public rebuke from the Emirati government. The UAE's public statements, however, changed in tone after Hamas militants in Gaza began firing rockets at Israel. The UAE considers Hamas as an Iran-backed militant group and an offshoot of the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-israeli-foreign-minister-yair-lapid-in-the-uae-on-first-state-visit-101624998714004.html

By 2035, all new cars and light duty trucks sold in Canada will be zero emission vehicles -- 100 percent of them," Alghabra told a news conference."This is five years sooner than our previous goal," he said.The regulatory move, he said, will help Canada to meet its overall net-zero carbon emissions target for the economy by mid-century.Alghabra noted that his country is one of the few in the world with domestic access to all of the key resources for producing electric vehicle (EV) batteries, and praised General Motors, Ford and other automakers for opening EV assembly plants in Canada.But despite government incentives to defray the relatively higher prices of EVs, purchases have been slow to take off.According to government data, battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids accounted for less than four percent of the 25 million passenger cars and trucks registered in Canada last year -- up from about two percent in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-cars-to-be-zero-emissions-by-2035-in-canada-says-transport-minister-101624998076169.html
30-06-2021||World||Pakistan PM Imran Khan says country under under 'pressure' from US, western powers over close ties with China||Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Tuesday that Pakistan was under "pressure" from the US and other Western powers over his country's all-weather ties with China and vowed to never buckle under pressure.Pakistan and China enjoy a "very special relationship" spanning over 70 years and nothing could change these time-tested ties, Khan said in an interview with China's English-language state-broadcaster China Global Television Network (CGTN), an excerpt of which was shared on his Instagram account.Talking about the evolving regional rivalry between the US and China, Khan said that "Pakistan thinks it is very unfair for the US or other powers – western power" to pressurise "countries like us to take sides" in a conflict with China."Why should we take sides? We should have good relations with everyone. It is not going to happen if pressure is put on Pakistan to change its relationship or downgrade its relationship with China, it wouldn’t happen," Khan said.Emphasising the deep relationship with China, Khan said that Pakistan would never bend under any kind of pressure. "Whatever will happen, our relationship between the two countries - no matter what pressure is put on us - is not going to change," he said.He said that there was a "strange, great rivalry" taking place in the region which was public knowledge."You see the United States being wary of China. The way United States and China are looking at each other creates problems because what the United States is doing is it's formed this regional alliance called the Quad, which is US, India and a couple of other countries," Khan said.The Quad or Quadrilateral alliance consisting of the US, India, Japan and Australia has been resolving to uphold a rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific amid growing Chinese assertiveness in the region.Responding to a question about how to further deepen Sino-Pakistan ties, Khan said that the two sides enjoyed strong political ties but the relationship was not only limited to official relations but it was also "people to people relationship".He said trade was important to increase ties in future and termed the USD 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as the "biggest thing happening in Pakistan".The CPEC, which connects Gwadar Port in Pakistan's Balochistan with China's Xinjiang province, is the flagship project of China's ambitious multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).Highlighting the 70 years of diplomatic ties, Khan said China always stood with Pakistan, which "always had a very special relationship with China".He said that China "always stood with us" whenever Pakistan was in trouble politically or internationally or in a conflict with its neighbour, in an apparent reference to India."In good times, everyone stands with you but in your difficult, tough times, bad times, you remember those people who stood by you. That's why you will find that in Pakistan, people always have a special fondness for people in China," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-pm-imran-khan-says-country-under-under-pressure-from-us-western-powers-over-close-ties-with-china-101624997567137.html
30-06-2021||World||Top US general says security in Afghanistan deteriorating||The US's top general in Afghanistan on Tuesday gave a sobering assessment of the country's deteriorating security situation as America winds down its so-called “forever war.”Gen. Austin S. Miller said the rapid loss of districts around the country to the Taliban — several with significant strategic value — is worrisome. He also cautioned that the militias deployed to help the beleaguered national security forces could lead the country into civil war.Miller told a small group of reporters in the Afghan capital that for now he has the weapons and the capability to aid Afghanistan’s National Defense and Security Forces.“What I don’t want to do is speculate what that (support) looks like in the future,” he said.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in meetings at the White House last week with President Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah — the Afghan official tasked with making peace with the Taliban — President Joe Biden said the US was committed to humanitarian and security assistance to Afghanistan.But the president also said that keeping US soldiers in Afghanistan defied a peace deal the Trump administration negotiated with the Taliban and that wasn't a risk he was prepared to take.“Given the timeline set by the prior administration, that if we did not withdraw our troops, US men and women would be facing fire from on the ground and that was not something as the commander in chief, that he felt was acceptable,” Psaki said.Washington signed a peace deal with the Taliban in February 2020. It laid out the promise of a US withdrawal and commitments by the Taliban to ensure Afghanistan does not harbor militants that can attack the United States. The details of those commitments have never been made public.The Taliban have accused Washington of breaking the agreement, which called for all troops to be out by May 1, the date the final withdrawal began. US officials have said the Taliban have made some progress, but it's not clear whether the insurgent group has kept its end of the deal.The insurgent group issued orders to commanders against allowing foreign fighters among their ranks, but evidence continues to surface that non-Afghans are on the battlefield.Still, Miller was insistent that only a political solution will bring peace to the war-tortured nation.“It is a political settlement that brings peace to Afghanistan. And it’s not just the last 20 years. It’s really the last 42 years,” he said.Miller was referring to not only the US war but that of Russia's 10-year occupation that ended in 1989. That conflict was followed by a brutal civil war fought by some of the same Afghan leaders deploying militias against the Taliban. The civil war gave rise to the Taliban, who took power in 1996.American officials have said the entire pullout of US troops will most likely be completed by July 4. But Miller refused to give any date or time frame, referring only to the Sept. 11 timeline given by Biden in April when he announced the withdrawal of the remaining 2,500-3,500 American troops.Meanwhile, Taliban fighters have been over-running districts in rapid succession, many of them in the north of the country, which is dominated by Afghanistan's minorities. The north is also the traditional stronghold of many former mujahedeen leaders who have been a dominant force in Afghanistan since driving the Taliban from power in 2001 together with the US-led coalition.Several of the districts are on key roads and one is on the border with northern Tajikistan. The Taliban have issued statements saying hundreds of Afghan security forces have surrendered, most of them going to their homes after being recorded on video receiving transportation money from the Taliban.Miller said there are multiple reasons for the collapse of these districts, including troop fatigue and surrender, psychological defeat and military defeat. But he said the escalating violence puts the country at risk of falling into a deadly civil war.Going forward, the Afghan defense forces must focus on consolidating their strengths and establishing strategic areas and protecting them, Miller said. Losing districts to the Taliban that allows them to sever transportation and communication links threatens provincial capitals.“As we start talking about how does this all end, the way it must end for the Afghan people is something that revolves around a political solution,” he said. “I’ve also said that if you don’t reduce the violence, that political solution becomes more and more difficult.”Miller refused to say where the US and its NATO allies were in the withdrawal process.He said his time as the head of the US's military mission in Afghanistan was coming to an end, without giving a date, though the press briefing had the feeling of a farewell.Miller wouldn't speculate on the legacy of America's longest war, saying it will be for history to decide.“The future will tell the rest of the story," he said. "What we will have to do is make an honest assessment of what went well and what didn’t go so well over the years as we work forward.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-general-says-security-in-afghanistan-deteriorating-101624996614285.html
30-06-2021||World||Randy Moore becomes first African American to lead US Forest Service||Veteran forester Randy Moore has been named chief of the US Forest Service, the first African American to lead the agency in its 116-year history.Moore, 66, replaces Vicki Christiansen, who has led the agency since 2018. The Forest Service, a division of the Agriculture Department, oversees 193 million acres of public lands in 154 national forests and 20 national grasslands.Moore has served as regional forester in the California-based Pacific Southwest Region since 2007, where he has responsibility for 18 national forests in California and Hawaii.He will take over from Christiansen as head of the 30,000-employee agency upon her retirement July 26. Christiansen and Moore will collaborate on what is already shaping up as a severe wildfire season in the West, where an epic drought, complicated by climate change, has made putting out fires more challenging and strained firefighting resources throughout the region.In the Pacific Northwest, where an extended heat wave has triggered record-breaking temperatures in Oregon and Washington state, fire crews have been positioned in high-risk areas, and cities and counties have imposed burn bans.Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who appointed Moore, called him “a catalyst for change and creativity” in carrying out the Forest Service’s mission to sustain the nation’s forests.As a regional forester, Moore has been on the forefront of climate change, most notably leading the region’s response to the dramatic increase in catastrophic wildfires in California over the last decade, Vilsack said. “His proven track record of supporting and developing employees and putting communities at the center of the Forest Service’s work positions him well to lead the agency into the future at this critical time in our country,'' Vilsack said in a statement.Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., praised Moore's selection as Forest Service chief.“California understands all too well the challenges facing our forests and I’m glad a Californian will head efforts to tackle them,” she said.Arkansas Rep. Bruce Westerman, the top Republican on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Moore “a seasoned professional,'' adding: “I sincerely hope we can work together on mitigating catastrophic wildfires, opening up our national forests to sustainable lumber harvesting, making forests more resilient against insects and diseases and much more.''Before heading the Pacific Southwest region, Moore was regional forester in the Wisconsin-based Eastern Region, where he oversaw forests in 20 states.Moore started his federal career in 1978 at USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service in North Dakota. He has worked at national forests in Colorado, North Carolina and Missouri, a national grassland in Kansas and as an administrator in Washington.Moore's appointment comes as Congress and the Biden administration push to increase firefighter pay and convert at least 1,000 seasonal wildland firefighters to year-round workers as fires have grown more severe. President Joe Biden last week called for an increase in pay for federal firefighters, who start as low as $13 an hour.“That’s a ridiculously low salary to pay federal firefighters,” Biden said. "That’s going to end in my administration.''||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/randy-moore-becomes-first-african-american-to-lead-us-forest-service-101624995250129.html

But political observers said it was unlikely to end the ongoing power tussle between him and state party president DK Shivakumar. It all started with the polls to elect the president of state youth Congress in February when Shivakumar-backed candidate Mohammed Harris Nalapad, the son of Congress legislator N A Harris, was disqualified after winning 64,203 votes out of the over 150,000 valid votes polled. In his place, Raksha Ramaiah, who polled 57,271 votes with Siddaramaiah’s backing, was declared the winner.The result led to an impasse and worsening of relationship between the two factions led by the two tallest Congress leaders in the state, in turn making it harder for the party to put up a united fight against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has been beset with its own problems.People aware of the developments said that both Ramaiah and Nalapad have now agreed to a compromise, allowing the former to retain the position till the end of the year and pass it on to the latter thereafter.“Both of them have mutually come to an understanding that Raksha will remain [the youth congress president] till 31 December and then [the post] will be given to Nalapad,” Srinivas BV, the national president of the Indian Youth Congress told Hindustan Times on Wednesday.Siddaramaiah too acknowledged that he favoured a compromise. “Now, the election officer has said that he will broker a compromise [between Raksha and Mohammed]. Make both of them sit together and get whatever compromise is all I have said,” Siddaramaiah said on Wednesday.However, Shivakumar refused to comment on the issue on Wednesday.People aware of the developments said that Raksha’s supporters were also not happy with the decision.This is not the first tussle between Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar. Both had also locked horns over the issue of party’s chief ministerial candidate in the run up to the state polls||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/siddaramaiah-says-he-backs-compromise-to-end-karnataka-feud-conflict-remains-101625075362509.html

Facebook, Twitter and Instagram were inundated with requests from people across the country who were looking for oxygen cylinders, hospital beds, plasma donors and ventilators.The replies in the said period also witnessed a surge, Twitter officials said in a statement. "The average daily number of tweets about Covid-19 from India increased by over 600% (7 times) during the surge (April 1-May 31, 2021). People in India came together to support each other and share information, bolstering replies during the surge months by 1.5 times," the statement read.The key observation also found tweets from medical professionals in India increased by 1.5 times during the surge period as they used Twitter to share important information.The social media platform added that the tweets on Covid-19 grew manifold during April 1-May 31, 2021 with the service witnessing 100% growth in Covid-19 conversations compared with the previous two months.Lauding the public efforts, Twitter said an incredibly positive people's movement to support one another took shape on the service."With the onset of the second wave of Covid-19 in India, Twitter emerged as a real-time helpline as people turned to the service seeking and offering help to secure life-saving facilities, medicines, food, and much more," Twitter said.Here are the key trends that gained momentum on Twitter:"More than ever, Twitter remains committed to serving the public conversation. It introduced a number of features and initiatives in support of the Covid-19 conversation in India," the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tweets-soared-7-times-higher-during-covid-19-second-wave-peak-twitter-101625072665359.html
30-06-2021||India||No weekend shutdowns in 20 Odisha districts, but malls to remain closed||Bhubaneswar: The Naveen Patnaik government on Wednesday extended the Covid lockdown till July 16 but relaxed restrictions in 20 of the state’s 30 districts where the infection is on the wane.Chief secretary Suresh Mohapatra said the statewide lockdown, which started on May 2, has yielded results and helped reduce the positivity rate from a high of more than 24% in April to 4.4% on Wednesday. Positivity rate is a crucial metric that shows how widespread the virus is in the community, and over time it provides an idea of whether a region’s testing strategy is adequate to contain the virus. Mohapatra said 20 districts have been classified as category A where fewer restrictions will be in place as compared to the remaining 10 districts, classified as category B district because they are reporting a positivity rate of more than 5% and a higher number of active Covid cases.

30-06-2021||India||G20 for investment to ensure food security as part of Covid-19 emergency funding||The G20 on Wednesday called for investments to ensure food security, sustainable food systems and territorial development as part of Covid-19 emergency funding and long-term national recovery plans.It also noted that the Covid-19 pandemic was likely to add more than 100 million people to the total number of undernourished in the world in addition to more than 840 million people, who were likely to be affected by hunger by 2030, missing the target to end malnutrition and achieve “Zero Hunger” under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).The meeting also called for accelerating adaptation of agriculture and food systems to climate change, which impacts agriculture output and is among the forces driving the rise in global hunger.The call was part of the Matera Declaration on food security, nutrition and food systems adopted at the conclusion of the G20 foreign ministers’ meeting in Italy that was attended by external affairs minister S Jaishankar. The meeting was held to prepare for the G20 Summit later in the year.The Matera Declaration warned that as per current trends, the number of people affected by hunger will exceed 840 million by 2030.“These figures do not take into account the toll of the Covid-19 pandemic that is likely to add more than 100 million people to the total number of undernourished in the world, as people lost their jobs and income, with consequences on their food security,” the declaration said.Post-pandemic recovery efforts and equitable access to Covid-19 diagnostics and vaccines were among the other key issues discussed by the ministers of the bloc, which includes the European Union.Jaishankar appreciated Italy’s role in highlighting food security and said in a tweet: “The Matera Declaration reflects the Indian concern for the welfare of small & medium farmers, promoting local food cultures and recognising agri-diversity.”He said he had shared his views on contemporary challenges at the G20 meeting, adding that livelihood, health, digital access and climate action should constitute the new developmental priorities.“Covid has impacted the fight against poverty, hunger and disease across the world. It has pushed back the global development agenda, increasing vulnerability in many societies. India is today at the forefront of the response, giving food support to 800 million citizens,” he tweeted.The Matera Declaration sought enhanced “catalytic investments for food security, nutrition, and sustainable food systems and territorial development, as part of the substantial Covid-19 emergency funding and longer-term national recovery plans and packages”.It said this should be done “consistent with WTO obligations and taking into account the voluntary Committee on World Food Security (CFS) Principles for Responsible Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems”.All actors across the international financial architecture and financial ecosystem need to play a role in improving availability of and access to sustainable finance in the food and agriculture sector to enable small scale and family farmers and fisherfolk, agro-enterprises, cooperatives and other operators within food value chains to invest more in sustainable food systems, the declaration said.The meeting welcomed the establishment of a “Finance in Common” working group on financing sustainable food systems, led by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and highlighted the private sector’s critical role in supporting public efforts to improve agri-food systems.It also emphasised the importance of accelerating digital transformation and innovation, with adequate protection of intellectual property rights and data privacy and the voluntary transfer of technologies, for sustainable and resilient agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/g20-for-investment-to-ensure-food-security-as-part-of-covid-19-emergency-funding-101625071284014.html

The testing facility will begin functioning from June 30. All railway stations in Goa along the Konkan Railway route will also have Covid testing centres, Udayavani quoted Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant as saying on Wednesday.Anyone entering Goa for work or for the purpose of tourism will need to undergo Covid-19 test on the spot. “Thousands of workers who had returned to their hometowns due to Covid-19 induced lockdown are now returning to Goa to resume work, which is why our railway stations are brimming with people. Madgaon station, which is also a major junction, is seeing a boom in the footfall of people. We have ramped up the Covid-19 testing facilities here,” Sawant said.Workers are returning to Goa from Karnataka, Odisha, and Maharashtra in big numbers. In addition, the state government has also ramped up testing facilities at Majali, a border fishing town between Goa and Karnataka. Following the return of the workers, many industries, including mining in north Goa, tourism in south and central Goa are coming back to life.Both Karnataka and Goa governments have set up special medical outposts on their respective side of the border where Covid test results are given on the spot to the persons who enter. Those who already have the RT-PCR negative report obtained within the last 72-hours will have free access to both sides of the border, say district authorities in Uttara Kannada district.On the southern border of Karnataka with Kerala, the respective governments have made RT-PCR reports compulsory for entry into both sides of the border. Testing facilities have been set up at border checkpoints in Mangaluru, Sullia, Puttur in Dakshina Kannada district, parts of Kodagu, Chamarajanagar, and Mysuru districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-pandemic-puts-goa-karnataka-border-under-scrutiny-101625070741594.html
30-06-2021||India||NIA arrests 2 Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists in Darbhanga station blast case||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday arrested two Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorists in connection to the Darbhanga railway station blast that took place earlier this month in Bihar.NIA arrested two key accused -- Imran Malik and Mohd Nasir Khan -- from Hyderabad after visiting the scene of crime and noting the key inputs from the probe.The preliminary probe, NIA said, has revealed a trans-national conspiracy hatched by top operatives of terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba to execute terror acts across India and cause large-scale damage to life and property.The accused terrorists acted under the directions of Pakistan-based handlers of LeT, the investigative agency said. Khan and his brother Malik fabricated an incendiary IED and packed it in a parcel of cloth and booked the same in a long-distance train from Secunderabad to Darbhanga.The low intensity blast at the station was aimed at causing an explosion and fire in a running passenger train resulting in huge loss of lives and property.One of the accused, Khan had visited Pakistan in the year 2012 and had received training from handlers of LeT in fabrication of IED from locally available chemicals.Khan and Malik were also in touch with Pakistan based handlers of LeT over encrypted communication platforms, the NIA said. The accused will now be produced before the Special NIA Court in Patna, following which a detailed examination and probe will continue.On June 17, the parcel, booked in the name of one Mohd Sufian from Secunderabad, exploded upon arrival at Darbhanga junction. No one was injured in the low intensity blast.In the early probe, the NIA Investigation revealed that a forged PAN card was used in booking the packet from Secunderabad station.They said the income tax department revealed that the PAN card details were forged and the original card belonged to someone abroad. Forensic report of the empty 50 ml glass bottle retrieved from the site is still awaited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-arrests-2-lashkar-e-taiba-terrorists-in-darbhanga-station-blast-case-101625069499313.html

A bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy observed that such a provision is doubtful given the current situation.“Can a citizen refuse to take a vaccine as a matter of right? It is doubtful whether the right to refuse to take the vaccine can be exercised in such circumstances,” the court observed according to a report by news agency PTI.The court also pointed out that vaccination is not only to protect an individual but to cater to the larger interest of public health. The court said that when the question of public health arises there is a possibility that an unvaccinated person may be asymptomatic and yet be a carrier of the disease therefore casting doubt over the ‘right to refuse’ vaccination.The court made this observation after the State observed an element of reluctance in some quarters regarding the Covid-19 vaccine. The court asked the authorities to persuade citizens with awareness campaigns, scientific data and inform them that the vaccine is indispensable when it comes to dealing with the pandemic.The court also highlighted that there needs to be a plan to vaccinate persons with disabilities and also those who do not have resources to travel in semi-urban or rural areas. The court said that it hopes that people with disabilities irrespective of their status and resources will be taken care of by the State in due course. The matter was adjourned till July 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/right-to-refuse-vaccine-doubtful-in-present-situation-madras-hc-101625069215214.html
30-06-2021||India||India asks EU member states to accept Covishield and Covaxin vaccines||India has asked European Union (EU) member states to accept Covid-19 vaccines authorised by the World Health Organization (WHO) or national authorities, such as Covishield and Covaxin, for Indian nationals travelling to Europe. The Indian side also informed EU member states that it will follow a policy of reciprocity in recognising Covid-19 vaccines for travel, and exempt EU nationals possessing the “green pass” from mandatory quarantine only if the bloc includes vaccines being administered in India in the EU Digital Covid Certificate, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity on Wednesday. The EU had clarified on Tuesday that the green pass is not a precondition to travel and individual member states have the option to accept vaccines approved by WHO such as Covishield. The clarification came against the backdrop of speculation about the possible impact of the green pass on Indian nationals as the regime doesn’t include any of the vaccines currently being administered in India. The green pass framework is set to be in place from July 1 to facilitate free movement within the 27-member bloc during the Covid pandemic. Under this framework, persons vaccinated with four vaccines currently approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) will be exempted from travel restrictions within the EU. Questions have arisen about Indian travellers to Europe facing problems as EMA has cleared Comirnaty, Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen vaccine, Spikevax or the Moderna vaccine, and Vaxzevria or the European version of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Serum Institute of India (SII), which makes Covishield or the Indian version of the AstraZeneca shot, is approaching EMA for its approval. “We have requested EU member states to individually consider extending exemption to travellers who have taken Covid-19 vaccines in India, such as Covishield and Covaxin, and to accept the vaccination certificate issued through the CoWIN portal,” said one of the people cited above. The genuineness of Indian vaccination certification can be authenticated on the CoWIN portal, the people said. India has also conveyed to EU member states that New Delhi will institute a reciprocal policy for recognising the EU Digital Covid Certificate. “Upon notification of Covishield and Covaxin for inclusion in the EU Digital Covid Certificate framework and recognition of Indian CoWIN vaccination certificates, Indian health authorities will reciprocally exempt travellers from the concerned EU member state carrying the green pass from mandatory quarantine,” the person said. External affairs minister S Jaishankar took up the issue of approving the Covishield vaccine for travel to Europe during a meeting on Tuesday with Josep Borell, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs and security policy. The two leaders met on the margins of a meeting of the G20 foreign ministers in Italy. “A comprehensive review of our relationship with EUHR VP @JosepBorrellF. Taking forward the agenda of the Leaders’ Summit. Discussed vaccine production and access. Took up ‘Covishield’ authorisation for travel to Europe. Will be following up,” Jaishankar tweeted after the meeting. On Tuesday, German ambassador Walter Lindner tweeted that his country recognises a double shot of Covishield as “valid proof of anti-Covid vaccination”. He added that this “does nevertheless not modify existing travel or visa restrictions for travellers from areas of concern/virus variants areas”. Covishield and Covaxin are the two main vaccines being used for India’s immunisation programme. The EU Digital COVID Certificate will serve as proof that a person was vaccinated, received a negative test result or recovered from Covid-19. Temporary restrictions on non-essential travel to the EU are currently in place from many countries, including India, due to the pandemic. EU member states are expected to gradually lift these restrictions at external borders as the health situation improves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-asks-eu-member-states-to-accept-covishield-and-covaxin-vaccines-101625068162125.html

They were all from the Kumaon Regiment.The truck was headed to Gangtok with six jawans and is believed to have skidded off Jawaharlal Nehru Road due to bad weather conditions, police said.“The accident occurred around 8.30 am. One jawan died on the spot. The other three died in the army hospital at Gangtok. Two jawans are in critical condition,” East District’s superintendent of police Siva Prasad said.“It was raining at that time.

Police are investigating the threat. The senior leader said the letter, written in Malayalam, was mailed to the MLA hostel, where he stays. He surmised that the language suggested the letter was written by someone from north Kerala. “It said I will be targeted for including more names in [the] criminal list. It seems it could be a move from some of the accused in T P Chandrasekharan murder case,” the MLA said. Radhakrishnan was the state home minister when Chandrasekharan, a rebel communist leader, was hacked to death by a group owing allegiance to the CPI (M) in 2012. Many accused in the case were convicted and jailed. “I have no other enemies. I heard some of the accused in TP murder case are on parole now. Let the police investigate it,” he said.Opposition leader V D Satheesan, state Congress chief K Sudhakaran and former chief minister Oommen Chandy have sought detailed investigation into the threat.T P Chandrasekharan’s widow K K Rema has been elected to the new assembly with Congress party’s support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-kerala-home-minister-gets-death-threat-told-to-leave-country-101625065462150.html

Priyanka held a meeting with Sidhu at her residence this morning.After meeting Sidhu, Priyanka went to Rahul Gandhi's residence and had a 40-45-minutes-long meeting with him, reported news agency ANI.Post this round of meeting with Rahul, Priyanka again held a meeting with Sidhu at her residence.Also read: ‘Capt Amarinder is not the Congress... he lies every day’, says Navjot Singh SidhuThe cracks from the infighting appeared for the public view after Sidhu, who is critical of party leader and Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, accused him of colluding with the Badals of the Shiromani Akali Dal, the Congress’s arch-rival in Punjab.Sidhu arrived in Delhi on Monday ahead of his meeting with the Gandhis and was scheduled to meet the leaders. The meeting has been dubbed as a crucial one for the party which does not want to part ways with the cricketer-turned-politician.Rahul Gandhi has attempted to address the growing factionalism in Congress’ Punjab unit. He held one-to-one meetings with over 20 party leaders from the state last week.Congress chief Sonia Gandhi formed a three-member committee to resolve the rift. In its report on June 10, the panel suggested that Sidhu be suitably accommodated in the state unit.Also read: Sidhu meets Priyanka Gandhi amid rumblings within Congress’s Punjab unitSidhu has expressed his desire to be the state unit chief. But the chief minister, the biggest vote-catcher for the party in the poll-bound state, is averse to the idea. Differences between the two led to Sidhu’s resignation from the state Cabinet in July 2019.In their last seen episode of contention, former Punjab minister Sidhu on May 21 challenged CM Singh to prove that he had met any leader of another party for switching sides.“Prove one meeting that I have had with another party’s leader. I have never asked anyone for any post till date. All I seek is Punjab’s prosperity. Was invited and offered Cabinet berths many times but I did not accept. Now, our esteemed high command has intervened, Will wait,” the Amritsar East MLA tweeted.Amarinder and Sidhu had met over tea in March following reports that the Congress central leadership had been trying to rehabilitate the MLA who had resigned as minister after he was divested of the local bodies portfolio in 2019. After the meeting, Amarinder had expressed confidence that Sidhu would be back in his cabinet.Sidhu had joined the Congress after leaving the BJP before the 2017 assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navjot-singh-sidhu-reaches-rahul-gandhi-s-residence-amid-turbulence-in-punjab-congress-101625061428990.html
30-06-2021||India||SC calls for Baba Ramdev’s speech on allopathy, plea listed for Monday||The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed yoga guru Baba Ramdev to produce the original text of his speech questioning the efficacy of allopathy that made the Indian Medical Association (IMA) register multiple FIRs against him in different states.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana has asked him to file the document by Monday, the date for next hearing on the yoga guru’s plea to stay arrest following two criminal cases filed by IMA in Patna and Raipur. Ramdev has also sought that these two cases be clubbed.The Patanjali Yogpeeth founder made disparaging remarks held to be unscientific and promoting vaccine hesitancy while questioning allopathy’s efficacy vis a vis coronavirus while talking to followers on May 19.Ramdev stirred controversy claiming he didn’t need Covid-19 vaccine since he had dual protection of yoga and Ayurveda. He also claimed that the thousands of fatalities caused by Covid-19 showed that allopathy was not 100% effective. He also alleged that a section of the society was deliberately engaged in discrediting the ancient Indian science of healing. Several experts said Ramdev’s comments could be seen as promoting vaccine hesitancy at a time when it was the only effective way of fighting the global pandemic.Although, he later clarified that he intended no ill-will to doctors. Delhi Medical Association filed a suit against him in the Delhi high court and IMA lodged FIRs in several other states including Bihar and Chhattisgarh..Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, who appeared for the yoga guru before the Supreme Court, said that Ramdev had no axe to grind against doctors. “I propounded that ayurveda is better than allopathy. I am a public figure and I am entitled to have a view. I am not against anybody but everybody has a right to freedom of speech and expression.”The bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy, could not find the original text of Ramdev’s speech, leading to Rohatgi seeking an adjournment to bring it on record.Ramdev has pleaded that despite his apology, the IMA went ahead to file cases against him. The FIRs at Patna and Raipur include charges of intentionally causing insult with the intent to provoke breach of peace, punishable with a maximum sentence of two years under Section 504 of Indian Penal Code (IPC). Ramdev has also been charged with other offences under the IPC and the Disaster Management Act.Rohatgi said Ramdev being a public figure seeks protection of the highest court since it was not feasible to approach individual high courts in view of multiple FIRs filed by IMA branches across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-calls-for-baba-ramdev-s-speech-on-allopathy-plea-listed-for-monday-101625063841899.html
30-06-2021||India||India's consumer digital economy to touch $800bn backed by e-commerce: RedSeer||India's consumer digital economy is expected to become a USD 800 billion market by 2030, growing from USD 85-90 billion in 2020, driven by strong adoption of online services like e-commerce and ed-tech in the country, according to consulting firm RedSeer.India's online retail market is also set to become the third-largest globally, after the US and China, with annual gross merchandise value (GMV) touching USD 55 billion in 2021, and USD 350 billion by 2030. Besides, kiranas are expected to achieve approximately USD 1.5 trillion sales by 2030.The insights were presented during RedSeer's Ground Zero 5.0 event."Today, over 50 per cent of customers say they use online services because of convenience. A few years back, almost 70 per cent used to say the key reason is discounting but with the hit of COVID, digital services have undoubtedly served the customers very well, which is evident in high customer satisfaction and customers willingness to keep using the digital as a key channel to fulfill their needs," RedSeer founder and Chief Executive Officer Anil Kumar said.He added that the next wave of entrepreneurs will create innovations that will make the Indian model successful globally.In a fireside chat, NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said massive disruption is taking place globally amid the pandemic. He noted that companies are looking for alternate destinations and that India can become an integral part of the global supply chain.Former Infosys executive and Manipal Global Education Services Chairman TV Mohandas Pai stated that India doesn't have a chip industry, which requires huge investments. He called on industrialists like RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani and Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekhar to invest in the semiconductor ecosystem because "without the chips, our future electronics are not going to be so good"."There's a lot of work going on in this direction right now...this is our top priority," Kant said. The digital economy includes 60 per cent of travel, 40 per cent of non-grocery retail, 30 per cent of education, 25 per cent of food and beverages services, and 6 per cent of pharma/grocery going through digital channels by 2030.As per RedSeer data, 88 per cent of the online shoppers that will be added between 2020-2030 will be from tier II cities and beyond.Further, more than 7 billion cumulative incremental online retail transactions to be added from customers in tier II cities and beyond, while over USD 150 billion worth of cumulative incremental online retail GMV is expected to be added from these locations between 2020 and 2030.RedSeer said e-logistics in India has become the fastest-growing market globally with over 3 billion shipments in 2020, and new-age logistics players are expected to deliver 2.5 billion D2C (direct to customers) shipments by 2030.With the rise of e-commerce, the need for specialised delivery services emerged, which led to the overall growth of the logistics segment. Emergence of this sector is creating 5 lakh employment opportunities for gig workers in 2021.According to RedSeer research, shared mobility saw a sharp decline due to the second wave-led lockdowns in the last two months. Although the autos segment recovered the fastest, the overall sector merely clocked 18 million rides, a drop from 113 million rides in January last year.However, while the shared mobility is dipping, personal mobility space is riding on a wave of strong traction seen since last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-consumer-digital-economy-to-touch-800bn-backed-by-e-commerce-redseer-101625062493762.html

The procedure followed by states and union territories in registering deaths came under the judicial scanner in two public interest litigations filed by advocates Reepak Kansal and Gaurav Kumar Bansal.The court had repeatedly observed throughout the proceedings that persons affected by Covid-19 can die due to other complications. Unfortunately, the judges noted in its verdict on Wednesday, the guidelines issued by the Centre and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) did not specifically deal with this aspect.Also Read: SC grants Centre 6 weeks to fix ex-gratia for deaths due to Covid-19According to Union health ministry data, 3,98,454 people have died due to Covid since the first death was reported in Karnataka in March last year.The bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and MR Shah directed the appropriate authority to frame a “simplified procedure or guidelines” for issuing an official document or death certificate to the family of those who died due to Covid-19. This document should state the exact cause of death as “Death due to Covid-19”, added the bench.“If a person has died after he was found Covid positive and he has died within two to three months, either in the hospital or outside the hospital or at home, the death certificate or official document must be issued to the family members of the deceased who died due to Covid-19 stating the cause of death as ‘Died due to Covid-19’,” the bench said.Presently, death certificates do not mention cause of death. This is due to the bar placed under Section 17 of the Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969. This provision states that “no extract relating to any death, issued to any person, shall disclose the particulars regarding the cause of death as entered in the register.”For families who have already received death certificates and intend to apply for correction with regard to cause of death, the court directed the authority concerned to provide the remedy available to such families under the guidelines.The court while considering the petitions recognised the plight of many families who lost their dear ones due to after-effects of Covid-19 but the cause of death was not certified as due to Covid.The bench said, “It is the duty of every authority to issue accurate/correct death certificates stating the correct and accurate cause of death, so that the family members of the deceased who died due to Covid-19 may not face any difficulty in getting the benefits of the schemes that may be declared by the Government for the death of the deceased, who died due to Covid-19.”During the arguments in the case, the central government pointed out that it is mandatory for states to register all deaths due to Covid-19. It referred to an October 2020 communication issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Affairs to all states/UTs. It said, “All deaths with a diagnosis of Covid-19, irrespective of comorbidities, are to be classified as deaths due to Covid-19. It is submitted that the only exception could be where there is a clear alternative cause of death, that cannot be attributed to Covid-19 (e.g., accidental trauma, poisoning, acute myocardial infarction, etc), where Covid-19 is an incidental finding.”Broad guidelines for recording of Covid-19 related deaths in India were prepared by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and issued in May 2020 to all states. These guidelines stated that positive deaths would imply deaths related to Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/death-within-2-3-months-of-testing-positive-to-be-counted-as-covid-death-sc-101625062941973.html

30-06-2021||India||Top army officer says state help from across border possible for drone attack||Indian Army’s 15 Corps Commander hinted on Wednesday at the possibility of Pakistan aided terror groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish –e- Mohammed being responsible for the drone attack on a Jammu Air Force base considering the technology involved.“We are well aware that these assets and tech [for] drone warfare, for example, cannot just be made on the roadside. These indicate state-supported systems and technology… and state supported, or state sponsored, technology definitely indicates Jaish and Lashkar,” Lieutenant general DP Pandey, Corps Commander of the 15 Corps in Srinagar, told NDTV in an interview.On Sunday, two air force personnel were injured and a building was damaged when suspected drones dropped two explosive payloads on the high security air force station in Jammu. The case is now being investigated by multiple agencies including the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The use of a small drone to carry out attacks is counted by security analysts as a watershed in asymmetric warfare in India. But it has been used elsewhere, by Islamic State (IS) fighters.Soon after the attack, a high alert was issued around Srinagar airport and major army installations and security camps in forward areas.The corps commander said the investigations into the attack are going on and an initial analysis of data indicated “a certain level of guidance from state actors”.“The capability or capacity exists to modify drones, which are locally available as well… with a certain level of guidance from state actors, they can be modified to carry out these attacks.”Terrorists organisations based in Pakistan have been using drones to drop off arms, ammunition and money in bordering areas to help militants carry out attacks. Analysis of one such captured drone had revealed that it had been assembled using parts made by different manufacturers for deniability.“The next level in this is greater deniability – an attempt to say this is possibly internal,” he said.The army officer said that the drone threat was likely to keep on increasing. “We are aware and have taken advanced measures over the past few days to re-orient ourselves. As a unit, the army is looking for proactive solutions and I am very confident that we can take care of this challenge as well,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-army-commander-says-state-help-from-across-the-border-possible-for-drone-attack-101625060901701.html

Another such attack was thwarted within 24 hours by alert security forces that opened fire on unidentified drones hovering over Kaluchak military base in Jammu. Several such sightings have taken place since then over military bases in the region.Experts have said that this is the first time that drones are being used in an attack on a major defence installation in the country. There have been several incidents of Pakistan-based terrorists using drones in the border areas of Jammu and Kashmir to drop arms, ammunition, drugs, and money to fuel terrorism in the region. But experts said Sunday’s attack represented a new security threat.The use of a small drone to carry out attacks is counted by security analysts as a watershed in asymmetric warfare in India. But it has been used elsewhere, by Islamic State fighters for one, to target forces in Iraq and Syria for years that prompted the United States and drone manufacturers to spend millions of dollars on research to stop what are sometimes called, the “killer bees”.Initial investigations into Sunday’s attack have pointed to the role of Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) in the drone strike at a Jammu air force station.Following the development, armed forces and military installations at forward bases have been alerted and asked to maintain full vigil to counter this new threat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drones-low-flying-objects-banned-in-rajouri-following-jammu-drone-attack-101625058261757.html

NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma wrote to the Delhi Police commissioner seeking investigation into the matter and has asked authorities to take legal action. The letter said that the NCW took suo motu cognisance of several profiles on Twitter which were found to be sharing “pornographic content”.Jaishankar calls for debate on responsibility, accountability of Big Tech firmsThe NCW in its notice said that complaints were lodged regarding the pornographic content earlier but said that the tech giant failed to take any action. Sharma in her letter said that the NCW feels ‘disturbed’ that despite such content violating India’s laws as well as Twitter’s policies there has been no action. The letter said that posts sharing such content have been shared with Twitter.“The commission has shared with Twitter details of a few profiles sharing pornographic content on Twitter and has directed to remove all such content within one week. The platform has also been asked to communicate action taken within 10 days,” the letter said.“The Commission is disturbed by the fact that despite knowing of the availability of such banned content which not only violates Indian laws but also Twitter's own policy. no action has been taken till date towards removing them,” the letter further said.The NCW’s move comes after the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) lodged a complaint with the Delhi Police against the tech giant for allegedly failing to curb child sexual abuse and child pornographic material on Twitter.

Bhagat, who was 24 at the time of murder, cited slow pace of trial in the case, which has been delayed further due to the pandemic, to seek bail. The trial is set to resume on July 14, but is expected to face further delays. Advocate Vikram Varma, who is representing the family of the victim, said the bail plea was firmly opposed by the family and the prosecution.Danielle’s mother Andrea Brannigan had earlier said that if allowed to walk out on bail, Bhagat may disappear making her wait for justice even longer. “I was so anxious and scared he would get bail today. I have been waiting for justice since the 14th of March 2017, even though I was promised it would be fast tracked. It is causing me great anxiety and worry,” Brannigan said. McLaughlin, 28, who hailed from Donegal in Northwest Ireland, visited Goa in 2017 with a friend and celebrated Holi in coastal Canacona village, known for its popular beach Palolem. She was befriended by Bhagat during the trip and murdered on March 14 after the two spent an evening together. Danielle was reportedly attacked with a stone and was found lying in a pool of blood without clothes with injuries to her head and face.A post-mortem concluded that McLaughlin died due to brain damage and constriction of the neck.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goan-man-accused-of-killing-irish-girl-danielle-denied-bail-101625056101774.html

The clarification by the ministry comes in response to the media reports that expressed concerns regarding infertility due to Covid-19 vaccination amongst the population of reproductive age and its safety for lactating women."None of the available vaccines affects the fertility of either men or women, as all vaccines and their constituents are tested first on animals and later on humans to assess if they have any such side effects. Vaccines are authorized for use only after their safety and efficacy are assured," the health ministry said in an official statement.Also read: India has administered over 330 million Covid vaccines till nowIn order to curb the prevalent myths regarding vaccination, the government has been fact-checking several claims. The ministry also cited such myths busted by the government through PIB Fact Check regarding infertility due to vaccination.It further said that there is no scientific evidence to suggest Covid-19 vaccination can cause infertility in men and women. "The vaccines have been found to be safe and effective," the ministry said as it cited fact-checked claims.Dr N K Arora, chairperson of Covid-19 Working Group of National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) also countered such fears and allegations and said that such misinformation was also created during administering Polio vaccine in India and abroad, as it was claimed that children who get the vaccine may face infertility in future. Dr Arora assured that all vaccines go through intense scientific research and none of the vaccines have this sort of side-effect, in a recent interview, the ministry said.Meanwhile, regarding safety concerns for lactating women, the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) had recommended vaccination for all lactating women and termed it safe without the need to stop or pause breastfeeding before or after the shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-covid-19-vaccine-affects-fertility-clarifies-health-ministry-101625050744190.html

Govt explains why||The Union health ministry on Wednesday clarified on apprehensions of fear and vulnerability surrounding coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in children, especially in the subsequent disease outbreak waves. Covid-19 in children is often asymptomatic and seldom requires hospitalisation, officials said in a statement."During the Covid-19 second wave in the country, several questions have been raised in the media regarding higher vulnerability of children to get adversely impacted by Covid-19 during the subsequent waves, if any," officials said in a statement.The experts have allayed these fears and apprehensions on several platforms," the statement added.Stating that children who catch Covid-19 often remain asymptomatic, officials said there is a possibility of a small percentage of children who get infected requiring hospitalisation."The healthy children recovered with mild illness without need for hospitalisation while the ones admitted in the hospital due to Covid-19 infection during second wave either had co-morbidities or low immunity," the statement added.Moreover, officials said that there is no data, either from India or globally, to show that children will be seriously infected in the subsequent Covid-19 waves.The government said adequate arrangements are being made in terms of healthcare infrastructure in a bid to provide effective care and treatment to children who may get infected.The government has also ramped up its efforts to bring children under the vaccination ambit and said Covaxin trials have also been started in children between 2-18 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/children-not-to-be-affected-severely-in-next-covid-19-waves-govt-explains-why-101625049027192.html
30-06-2021||India||Jaishankar calls for debate on responsibility, accountability of Big Tech firms||External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday called for a debate on the responsibility, accountability and influence wielded by big tech companies as “non-state players”, saying such issues cannot be brushed under the carpet.Jaishankar’s remarks came against the backdrop of a tussle between social media giant Twitter and the Indian government following the implementation of controversial new digital media rules. He made the comments while participating in a virtual conversation with former UK prime minister Tony Blair.The minister said there was a debate in different parts of the world on big tech, including a “very vigorous one in India”. While acknowledging technology and innovation as forces of progress that had opened new vistas, Jaishankar said there is also a need for democratic societies to debate the responsibility that comes along with the power wielded by big tech companies.Without naming any particular company, Jaishankar said, “In a democratic society, we have to ask ourselves...big tech is there, it’s very visibly in my life. You have a big presence [but] where is the responsibility which comes with it? They have huge power, where is the accountability?”He added, “This is again not an issue limited to India. They harvest our data as they do across the world. So you have, in a sense, the opposite of the American revolution, which is you have representation and no taxation.”Besides looking at the role of big tech as a governance issue, a political issue, and a democratic issue, there is also the need to examine the influence such firms command, he said.“International relations have been devised on the basis of state-based players. What happens when you have non-state players who in some ways are bigger than many states? These are very serious questions which need debating,” Jaishankar said.“I think they can’t be brushed under the carpet, saying you shouldn’t question them because then you are attacking freedom of speech. I think that’s a cop out. It obviously serves their interest, so it’s a very, very legitimate debate.”Blair, while responding to a question on big tech companies challenging democracy from the moderator of the conversation organised by India Global Forum, described such firms as “vast behemoths with enormous power”.He said many firms should now be seen as public interest companies since they have enormous impact on the lives of people, and there is a need for a regulatory framework within which they should operate.Blair said another key issue is the digital divide, as hundreds of millions of people don’t have access to technology. He also called for focus on the power of China in the technology sphere.Twitter is currently engaged in a tussle with the Indian government over the new IT rules, which came into effect on May 23. The government has criticised Twitter for deliberate failure to comply with the new guidelines that mandate appointments of chief compliance officer, nodal officer and grievance officer by social media platforms with more than 500 million users. The US giant also recently lost its intermediary status in India, making Twitter liable for any unlawful user-generated content.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-calls-for-debate-on-responsibility-accountability-of-big-tech-firms-101625052021600.html

Kant will succeed incumbent DGP Loknath Behera, who retired on Wednesday. He is reported to the be first Dalit officer on the chief post in the police department of the southern state.Kant is a 1988 batch officer and was picked by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan for the top post from the list of officers recommended by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC).Kant's selection came as a surprise as media reports have predicted vigilance director Sudesh Kumar and Fire and Rescue Services director general B Sandhya as the primary contenders of the post.Hailing from New Delhi, Kant began his police career in the Kerala cadre as an assistant director in the Intelligence Bureau. This was followed by his stints under various designations in the state as the chief of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau, Prisons and Correctional Services and Fire Force. He has also received the President's police medal for meritorious services.Kant is still additional director general of police (ADGP) and would be promoted to the rank only by the end of the next month, PTI reported quoting officials aware of the development. Interestingly, he has only seven months of service but may get an extension according to the new guidelines relating to the appointment of the state police chief.Meanwhile, Behera during his farewell stressed the need to regulate drone usage in Kerala in view of the recent terror attack in Jammu airport using the unmanned aerial vehicle. Retiring after 36 years of service, Behera, who is an Odisha native said he is a Malayalee at heart and would continue to wear 'mundu', as part of his love for the state.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anil-kant-to-be-new-police-chief-of-kerala-101625047479916.html

The final decision will be taken by Sajad Lone who is the party chairman.”The National Conference, People Democratic Party (PDP), Apni Party, and Congress have two members each in the council. Three members of the council, including Safina Baigh, are independents.The couple quit Mehbooba Mufti’s PDP last year after Safina Baig was denied a ticket to contest the DDC election. She successfully contested as an independent and was later elected the chairperson with the support of five members of the Apni Party and People’s Conference.The People’s Conference disassociated itself from Muzaffar Hussain Baig after disagreements over the stand he took at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s all-party meeting with leaders from Jammu & Kashmir last week. Lone and Muzaffar Hussain Baig attended the meeting together.People Conference leader Imran Reza Ansari said that Muzaffar Hussain Baig was never with their party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cloud-over-baramulla-ddc-chairperson-after-lone-s-party-disassociates-with-baig-101625048781348.html

There are more like him who move around in vehicles fitted (with) beacons and (government) logos. I have a doubt that such fake officers were introduced in the election process, and they manipulated the polling and counting. I have also heard that Deb was once the convener of the (ruling) TMC (Trinamool Congress)’s IT (information technology) cell in south Kolkata. He was involved both with the government and with the party. Senior TMC leaders knew everything about him and that is why he was able to continue the racket for so long,” said Ghosh.Deb, who is accused of masquerading as a bureaucrat, has been arrested for allegedly organising fake Covid-19 vaccination camps in Kolkata. He has been seen in photos with many TMC leaders. TMC leaders have maintained it is impossible to check the credentials of everyone in public programmes where photos are being clicked.The TMC rubbished Ghosh’s allegations. “Ghosh seems to know many things about these imposters. He could have lodged a complaint before the elections. I will urge the Kolkata Police to make him a party to the case relating to the fake vaccination racket so that more details could be retrieved. The BJP is trying to find an excuse and hide its face after the humiliating defeat in the assembly polls. But there is a limit even to wild allegations,” said TMC leader Kunal Ghosh.Election Commission officials in Kolkata refused to comment on Ghosh’s charges.The BJP set a target to win more than 200 assembly seats in the assembly polls but could manage only 77. The TMC returned to power for the third time by winning 213 seats out of the 292 for which the polls were held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fake-officers-planted-to-manipulate-bengal-polls-alleges-bjp-101625047640943.html

30-06-2021||India||Delimitation Commission to visit J&K from July 6 to July 9||The Delimitation Commission tasked to carve out new constituencies in Jammu & Kashmir is set to visit the Union Territory to talk to political parties, district officials, and other stakeholders from July 6-9 as part of the process before the assembly polls are held.“During this period, the Commission will interact with political parties, public representatives and Union Territory administration officials including district election officers/deputy commissioners of the 20 districts of the Union Territory to gather first-hand information and inputs concerning the ongoing process of delimitation as mandated under the (Jammu &) Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019,” the commission said in a statement.Former Supreme Court judge Ranjana Prakash Desai heads the commission, which was constituted in March 2020 to redraw the Lok Sabha and assembly constituencies of Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, and Nagaland. Chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra and election commissioners of Jammu & Kashmir and the three states are ex-officio members of the commission.HT on June 26 reported the commission was planning interactions with the stakeholders in Jammu & Kashmir. The commission, which has nearly nine months left to complete the exercise, will also carve constituencies to be reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled tribes for the first time in Jammu & Kashmir.Also Read | J&K police recruitment: Large number of women turn up for PETThe constituencies are being created on the basis of “physical features, existing boundaries of administrative units, facilities of communication and public convenience”.The commission, which was granted a yearlong extension in March to complete the exercise, has collated census and geographical data to factor in the existing difficulties and communication needs of the region.“There are considerations of a geographical nature, such as access in hilly districts. The Commission will have to ensure that the most basic administrative block, whether it is the tehsil or the district, is not broken down in the process. This way there can be seamless elections and effective implementation of government schemes,” said a person familiar with the matter on June 26.The delimitation of new assembly constituencies will be based on the 2011 census data. The constituencies will go up from 107 to 114.The last redrawing of constituencies was done in 1995 on the basis of the 1981 census when the erstwhile state was governed under its own Constitution and Jammu & Kashmir Representation of the People Act because of the region’s special status. The status was revoked in 2019. After the 2001 census, the Jammu & Kashmir assembly passed a law putting delimitation on hold until 2026.The issue of delimitation was discussed at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with political leaders from Jammu & Kashmir last week. This was the first meeting of its kind since the Centre ended the region’s special status.Former Jammu & Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah has said the delimitation exercise should be undertaken with the rest of the country due after 2026. An amendment was passed by Parliament to freeze the constituencies demarcated in 2002 until 2026.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delimitation-commission-to-visit-j-k-from-july-6-to-july-9-101625046802042.html

The price rise will be effective on all brands of Amul milk, including Gold, Taaza, Shakti, T-special, as well on cow and buffalo milk etc. The price is being hiked after a gap of nearly one year and seven months, officials said. An increase in the production cost is the reason behind the price rise, the company said. "Prices of Amul milk will be increased by ₹2 per litre across India from tomorrow. The new prices will be applicable on all Amul milk brands like Gold, Taaza, Shakti, T-special, as well on cow and buffalo milk," said RS Sodhi, Managing Director, GCMMF, which markets Amul brand of milk and dairy products. Sodhi said the hike in the milk price became necessary due to the rise in food inflation. "Additionally, the cost for packaging has gone up by 30 to 40 per cent, the transportation cost by 30 per cent, and the energy cost by 30 per cent, which led to the increase in the input cost," he said.Though the price hike may come across as a jolt to many consumers amid the soaring price of fuel and vegetables, the company said that the increase is much lower than the average food inflation. "The increase of ₹2 per litre translates into a 4% increase in MRP, which is much lower than average food inflation," the company statement read."Given the increase in input costs, our member unions have also increased farmers' price in the range of ₹45 to ₹50 per kg fat, which is more than 6% over the previous year," the company said.The price rise in turn will benefit milk producers as it is the company's policy to pass on almost 80 paise of every rupee paid by consumers for milk to the milk producers.Milk price in the country was last revised in December 2019 when Amul raised the price by ₹3 per litre in Gujarat, Delhi-NCR, West Bengal and Maharashtra. At the same time, Mother Dairy too announced an increase in milk prices by ₹3 per only in Delhi-NCR owing to a lower supply.Amul's business grew during the Covid-19 pandemic-induced lockdown as the consumption of milk products has seen a steep rise during the period. In April 2020, Amul's milk cooperatives sold around 255 to 260 litres of milk every day, reports said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amul-milk-price-to-increase-by-rs-2-per-litre-across-india-from-july-1-101625046486950.html

In both the case, the beneficiaries raised suspicion after they did not receive any message from Co-Win, the one-stop-shop IT platform for India's vaccination drive. Both the cases are under investigation and it is yet to be found whether what was administered to these people were harmful or not.In a first official comment, the Union health ministry on Wednesday said these instances are "individual aberration", which could be caught only spotted because of the centralised IT platform Co-Win. "As we have vaccinated over 33 crore people, such instances of individual failure now can be easily spotted the moment you do not receive an SMS from Co-Win. We are in touch with states which are taking action against such scams," Lav Agarwal, joint secretary of the Union health ministry said on Tuesday when asked about the vaccination scam in Mumbai and Kolkata.TMC MP Mimi Chakraborty recovering now after falling prey to fake vaccine campPrime Minister Narendra Modi emphasised strict monitoring of two things, whether there is any adverse impact after vaccination and whether everyone is getting the second dose of the vaccine, Lav Agarwal said, explaining how Co-Win checks all the boxes, apart from alerting people if they have been subject to any scam.#LargestVaccineDrive #Unite2FightCorona कोरोना पोर्टल पर टीकाकरण के लिए पंजीकरण करवाने में आने वाली सभी समस्याओं के लिए भारत सरकार ने आईटी टीम का गठन किया है। वो इस पर कड़ी नज़र रख रही है।-लव अग्रवाल, संयुक्त सचिव, स्वास्थ्य मंत्रालय @PMOIndia @drharshvardhan pic.twitter.com/ZhnAR87R0PWhat happened in MumbaiThe residents of a highrise in Mumbai were conned when an event management company got them vaccinated but they were neither registered on Co-Win, neither did they receive their certificates promptly. Several incongruities emerged when they were issued their certificates. Several production companies have been duped like this. According to preliminary reports, the residents were given saline water. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Tuesday said the government will do antibody tests of everyone who have been apparently conned and then these people will get Covishield depending on what ICMR suggests.What happened in KolkataDebanjan Deb, a 28-year-old man, impersonated as Kolkata Municipal officer and organised two vaccine camps in Kolkata. In one of these vaccine camps, Trinamool MP Mimi Chakraborty was invited. As the MP took the jab but did not receive any SMS, she raised an alarm based on which the entire fake vaccine racket got busted. It is not yet known what was administered to these people in the name of vaccines. An SIT has been set up for investigation and an attempt to murder charge has been slapped on Debanjan Deb. An expert committee has also been formed to find out whether these people will need to take the first dose once again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fake-vaccination-in-mumbai-kolkata-what-health-ministry-says-on-this-101625044852637.html
30-06-2021||India||Centre seeks report on fake vaccination racket busted in Bengal||The Centre has sought a report from the West Bengal government by Thursday on the fake vaccination racket busted by the Kolkata Police last week.Over 800 people, including ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) Member of Parliament Mimi Chakraborty, are suspected to have been injected with antibiotic amikacin instead of Covid-19 vaccines at fake vaccination camps organised in Kolkata earlier this month. Debanjan Deb, 28, who impersonated as a bureaucrat, allegedly organised the camps.“It is requested that the matter may be urgently enquired into and the factual position about the serious allegations clarified immediately and that, suitable and strict action may be taken in the matter, if necessary. It is also requested that a factual report on the matter may be sent to the ministry in the next two days,” said a Centre’s letter to the state’s chief secretary on Tuesday.On June 25, Suvendu Adhikari, the leader of the opposition in the West Bengal assembly, wrote to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan seeking a probe by a central agency into the racket.The Kolkata Police have set up a Special Investigation Team to probe into the case and six persons have been arrested to date.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders have alleged Deb shared close links with TMC leaders, including ministers after their pictures together surfaced. TMC leaders have rubbished the charges. “It is not possible to check the credentials of each and every person attending a public programme where anyone may click pictures,” state minister Firhad Hakim has said.TMC leader Kunal Ghosh said the BJP cannot digest the defeat in the assembly elections and is hence resorting to “back-door politics”. “I don’t know whether the Union health secretary asked for a report from BJP-led Uttar Pradesh government when dead bodies of Covid-19 victims were dumped in the river. Where was he when West Bengal was requesting oxygen, medicines and vaccines? The state government is doing whatever is necessary. Police have started a probe and the state health department and civic body have held camps for the victims.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-seeks-report-on-fake-vaccination-racket-busted-in-bengal-101625045540757.html

The meet was chaired by delimitation commission chairperson Justice (retd) Ranjana Prakash Desai and Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sushil Chandra, a statement by the DC said.“The commission will meet on Wednesday to decide a time to have an all-party meeting, including the local parties in Jammu and Kashmir,” a person familiar with the development said last week.The Delimitation Commission was constituted in March last year and its term was extended by another year in March 2021 due to the ongoing pandemic.Tasked with drawing out constituencies for the polls, in a first, the commission will also carve constituencies for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes for the first time in the erstwhile state. The primary aim will be to create constituencies on the basis of “physical features, existing boundaries of administrative units, facilities of communication and public convenience”.Initiating one of the preliminary steps, the commission will discuss allocation of seven new constituencies it will add to the J&K Union territory, pushing the total count of constituencies to 114. The commission will also focus on allocating areas for 90 constituencies in the Union territory. This exercise will not include the other 24 which are a part of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Carried out 27 years ago, Jammu and Kashmir last witnessed restructuring of its assembly boundaries in the year 1995, based on the 1981 census when the erstwhile state was governed under the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution and Jammu and Kashmir Representation of the People Act, 1957, until its special status was revoked.

However, the court has now deferred the matter for July 2.The panel, led by former Intelligence Bureau chief, Rajiv Jain – who became an NHRC member on June 2 - was put together on orders of the court. The ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) government had soon after filed a review petition to the court, seeking for the order’s recall, but it was eventually dismissed.The committee was asked to “enquire into complaints of post-poll violence” in West Bengal, and also to recognise those who were prima facie accountable for the violence and the officers who maintained a “calculated silence”.This development comes following the alleged attack on Atif Rasheed, vice-chairperson of the National Commission for Minorities and a member of the NHRC panel on Tuesday during his visit to south Kolkata’s Jadavpur area to look into complaints of post-poll violence.The alleged incident occurred in Dompara region, with Rasheed claiming before a section of the media that he and his NHRC team members were attacked by goons.The deputy commissioner of police (south suburban division), Rashid Munir Khan told HT that no complaint has been registered by either Rasheed or any other NHRC member. “A police force was escorting the NHRC team. It gave me a report. At Dompara, some people shouted slogans at the NHRC team. Some of the agitators were apparently under the influence of alcohol,” Khan said, adding that if Rasheed files a complaint, the police will certainly look into it.A few days ago, the panel visited Kolkata and Sitalkuchi in north Bengal’s Cooch Behar district, police officials said. They met and recorded statements of the family of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker Abhijit Sarkar in Kolkata, who was allegedly strangled to death by a mob in the city’s Narkeldanga area on May 2, the day Assembly election results were announced, police officials added.A second team of the NHRC visited Sitalkuchi to meet the family of a BJP worker, whose son was allegedly kidnapped and killed. Furthermore, the team also went to the home of Ananda Burman, a young BJP supporter shot dead on April 10.Police officials had stated that the two NHRC teams – part of the seven-member committee - will be visiting several parts of north and south Bengal before submitting the report on June 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nhrc-team-submits-report-on-bengal-post-poll-violence-to-calcutta-high-court-101625041388960.html

Sidhu arrived in Delhi from Patiala on Monday.Also Read | Shatrughan Sinha on pro-Modi tweet: ‘It was Sunday humour’A party insider said Sidhu’s meeting with Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is important as it signals the Congress does not want to part ways with the cricketer-turned-politician ahead of the polls.

He held one-to-one meetings with over 20 party leaders from the state last week.Congress chief Sonia Gandhi formed a three-member committee to resolve the rift.

See the rates of petrol-diesel in your city to find out the real reason,” Gandhi said via a tweet, adding a hashtag tax extortion. With Wednesday’s tweet, the Congress leader continued his attack on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over rising fuel prices and inflation.The Congress party will launch a countrywide agitation from July 7 to July 17 to protest against the rising fuel prices. The party made the decision at a meeting of the party general secretaries and various state in-charges which was chaired by the Congress president Sonia Gandhi on June 23.The leaders of the opposition party accused the Centre of reaping profits from people using excise duty and taxes on petrol and diesel which have led to a spike in fuel prices across the country.Petrol prices have risen above ₹100 in megacities like Mumbai and Bengaluru. A litre of petrol in Delhi is costing ₹98.81 and in Kolkata and Chennai ₹98.64 and ₹99.89 respectively.

The Delhi Police had registered a case later on Tuesday for "availability of child sexual abuse and child pornographic material" on its platform.The case was registered after National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) wrote to the police saying it had received a complaint about online threats against a minor girl, and found pornographic material on Twitter, according to a letter written by the rights group to police."Investigation has been taken up," a statement from the Delhi police said.Twitter, meanwhile, said it has a zero tolerance policy for child sexual exploitation.The company is already facing a case for displaying a wrong map of India, which showed Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir as a separate country. The map was taken down from the company’s website after the case was registered.These cases have compounded the problems of Twitter which is already involved in a tussle with the Centre over new IT rules. Many central ministers have repeatedly criticised Twitter for not complying with the new rules, which came into effect in May.Companies such as Twitter must now appoint a chief compliance officer, a grievance officer and another executive to liaise with law enforcement and the government on legal requests. LinkedIn job postings show the three positions are open at Twitter.Non-compliance with those rules means Twitter may no longer enjoy the legal privilege in India that allowed it to not be held liable for user-generated content.Twitter, in turn, has raised concerns about the safety of its employees in India and flagged intimidation by the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-asked-to-share-details-of-accounts-sharing-child-sex-abuse-content-101625038754159.html

CoWIN is the backbone of national Covid-19 immunisation delivery management system. The new procurement process will be operational from July 1.There will be a slot on CoWIN for private hospitals to register as private Covid-19 vaccinate centres to be able to avail of the facility.The approval will be granted on CoWIN itself, and the payment for vaccine doses will also have to be made electronically through the National Health Authority Portal (NHA), after which the order will be processed.Also Read | When will Covaxin get WHO nod? Rolling data submission to begin in JulyThe Centre is procuring 75% of the vaccine supplies produced in a given month to be distributed under its free supply scheme, and the remaining 25% is left to be taken up by the private hospitals across the country based on doses allocated in advance.The Centre recently advised states to aggregate Covid-19 vaccine distribution in private hospitals on monthly basis, and to either procure the doses themselves or allow the Centre to facilitate procurements for them, in order to equitably distribute vaccine doses among private hospitals.The step was taken after a huge disparity was seen in the private sector with Covid-19 vaccination largely limited to big private vaccination centres that tend to buy a major volume from the available 25% quota allotted to the private sector, leaving the smaller hospitals in want of adequate doses.India began implementing the liberalised pricing and accelerated national Covid-19 vaccination strategy from May 1, wherein 50% of the available doses were earmarked for supply to states and Union Territories, as free of cost supply from the Centre, while the remaining 50% was available for direct procurement from the vaccine manufacturers by states and private hospitals.In his June7 address to the nation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced modifications in the vaccine policy, under which 75% of the total central drugs laboratory cleared doses are being procured by the Centre for distribution to states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pvt-hospitals-to-procure-covid-vaccine-doses-through-cowin-from-july-1-101625038160430.html

30-06-2021||India||Hot, dry Loo-like winds blow over NW India instead of humid easterlies||Loo-like dry, hot westerly winds from central Pakistan region are blowing at about 20 to 30 kmph over the Capital and other parts of northwest India that are especially strong in May and the first half of June before monsoon arrives and temperatures fall marginally, and heat wave conditions dissipate.But this time, hot, gusty dry winds are blowing over the region in June-end. “These are winds associated with heat wave. They are hot dry winds blowing from Pakistan. We cannot say they are unlikely in June because heat waves are recorded in early and mid-June,” said M Mohapatra, director general, India Meteorological Department (IMD).Also Read | As monsoon plays truant, Delhi suffers first heat wave of season“The pressure gradient is very high so strong westerly winds are blowing. Easterly winds did not set in because monsoon weakened and did not cover the northwestern region entirely. We are not expecting monsoon to progress for at least a week,” explained K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre, IMD.“These are Loo winds which are commonly experienced in May and early June. It’s very unusual to record them in July or the fag end of June. The wind speed at Palam in Delhi is around 40 to 45 kmph. Till Tuesday, the winds were easterly at the lower level and westerly at the higher level so it was a mix of humidity, dry winds making conditions extremely uncomfortable. The temperature is also very high,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, climate change and meteorology at Skymet Weather.The normal date for monsoon to set in over Delhi is June 27. It is delayed by 3 days and is likely to be further delayed by a week, according to IMD.The northern Limit of monsoon (NLM) continues to pass through Barmer, Bhilwara, Dholpur, Aligarh, Meerut, Ambala and Amritsar. It has been in the same position for over a week now. “Prevailing meteorological conditions, large scale atmospheric features and the forecast wind pattern by dynamical models suggest that no favourable conditions are likely to develop for further advance of southwest monsoon into remaining parts of Rajasthan, west Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Punjab during the next five days,” IMD said in its bulletin on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hot-dry-loo-like-winds-blow-over-nw-india-instead-of-humid-easterlies-101625036240457.html

Mohapatra said the Covid situation has not worsened in 17 districts, while in eight districts in coastal and northern Odisha the situation has not improved much.On Tuesday, while reviewing the situation of Covid-19 in Odisha, chief minister Naveen Patnaik had said that the second wave is not over yet and experts are warning about the third wave of Covid. “We should not let our guards down but be much more careful.

30-06-2021||India||Bharat Biotech says it received no advance payment from Brazil govt for Covaxin||As the Brazil government suspends the deal to purchase 20 million doses of Bharat Biotech's Covaxin over allegations of graft in the deal, the Hyderabad-based vaccine maker on Wednesday issued a statement and said as of June 29, the vaccine maker has not received any advance payment from the Brazil government. "In the case of procurement of Covaxin by Brazil, a step-by-step approach was followed towards contracts and regulatory approvals, during the 8-month-long process. EUA received was received on June 4. As of June 29, we haven't received any advance payments nor supplied vaccines to Brazil," the company said in a statement.Brazil suspends Covaxin deal as Bolsonaro faces graft charges"The pricing of Covaxin has been clearly established between $15-20 per dose for supplies to Governments outside India. The pricing for Brazil has also been indicated at $15 per dose," Bharat Biotech said.The ₹2,400 crore has turned the heat up for the Jair Bolsonaro government as it was alleged that the government struck a deal with Bharat Biotech to acquire about 2 crore doses of Covaxin at a higher price, and at a time when the vaccine was not approved by the regulator of Brazil. Covaxin received emergency use authorisation in Brazil in the first week of June, though the negotiation process has been going on for the last seven-eight months.Here's what happened> Brazil Health ministry official Luis Ricardo Miranda who acted as a whistleblower in this case raised suspicion about the deal as Pfizer was reportedly offering Brazil its Covid-19 vaccine at a lower price.> Miranda looks after the imports of the health ministry and when he had to approve an import licence, he refused to do so as the company mentioned in the invoice was not Bharat Biotech, the company with which the deal was signed, but some Singapore-based Madison Biotech.> Luis Ricardo Miranda also told senators that he was under pressure to clear the deal.> Bolsonaro defended the allegation saying that there was no corruption as the government did not pay any money and did not receive any vaccine.> Covaxin was granted emergency use approval on June 5. Bharat Biotech also corroborated Bolsonaro's statement that no vaccine has been sent and no money has been received.> Bharat Biotech has, however, said that Madison Biotech is its global sales and marketing arm.> An investigation into the deal began in April.> Brazil's newspapers reported that Bharat Biotech had initially quoted a price of $1.34 per dose, the government agreed to pay $15 per shot.> Whistleblower Miranda and his brother who is a lawmaker met Bolsonaro “The President looked me in the eye and said, ‘This is serious’,” adding, “'If I interfere with this thing, you know what kind of shit it’s going to stir up. This must be so-and-so’s deal.’” the whistleblower has told the investigators.> Bharat Biotech said it followed all processes in Brazil as in other countries while the price of the vaccine in the international market was made public beforehand.Explaining the process of how a country can procure vaccines from Bharat Biotech, the vaccine maker said that the company first received a letter of intent, following which it applues for emergency use authorisation in the country. Once the vaccine gets approval, the health ministry of that country releases a purchase order. Even if the order is placed before the approval, the procurement happens only after the approval.Once the purchase order is released, the company raises a Pro Forma Invoice based on which the ministry makes the payment. Once the payment is received, the company proceeds to supply the vaccines. In this case, the company received no money from the health department of Brazil, Bharat Biotech said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-says-it-received-no-advance-payment-from-brazil-govt-for-covaxin-101625034370081.html

The resolution said the second Covid-19 wave was so severe that the health care system was overwhelmed due to the sudden increase of severe cases in April and May. It added in spite of the best efforts of the doctors and other health care staff, several people succumbed to the severity of the disease. The resolution said the government “bravely battled the pandemic” by strengthening the health infrastructure.Also Read | Goa oxygen shortage deaths: HC declines to entertain pleas for probeThe BJP described the meeting as “routine” while expressing full confidence in Sawant’s leadership. Health minister Vishwajit Rane, who was among those who criticised the government for failing to impose restrictions to check Covid-19 spread in time, did not attend the meeting. Rane has also called for an inquiry into the deaths due to oxygen shortage in the state. He expressed his inability to attend the meeting since he was not in the state.Rane was unavailable for comments.State BJP chief Sadanand Shet Tanavade said they commended the state government for the way it handled the pandemic as well as other calamities like the cyclone. “So, putting all this together, a congratulatory motion was passed, and several ministers and MLAs (members of legislative assembly) spoke. This was passed unanimously.”Goa’s positivity rate touched 51% at the peak of the second wave of the pandemic, which was the highest in the country at the time. The Bombay High Court at Goa was forced to take cognisance of the situation when the inadequate supply of oxygen left 75 people dead at a government hospital.The state has reported 16,60,00 cases and more than 3,000 deaths since the second wave of the pandemic hit Goa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-bjp-backs-cm-sawant-s-handling-of-pandemic-101625034680714.html
30-06-2021||India||When will Covaxin get WHO nod? Rolling data submission to begin in July||Bharat Biotech's Covaxin inches a step closer to get approval from the World Health Organization as rolling data submission will begin in July, as per the WHO website. The pre-submission meeting has been held and as this data submission begins, Covaxin will only be one step away from getting the nod — which is the evaluation that may take some time. The Hyderabad-based company earlier said it expects the emergency use listing to arrive by September.What is the evaluation process?WHO's emergency use listing is a standard list that every country is more or less accepting. Though there is no vaccine passport yet, many countries have decided to allow travellers vaccinated with WHO-listed vaccines. So, getting recognised by WHO is crucial for Bharat Biotech's Covaxin. And the sooner the result comes, the better for Indian travellers vaccinated with Covaxin.Fauci’s institute backs Covaxin, funded its efficacy boosterFor EUL, the vaccine maker first needs to apply which is the submission of the expression of interest, which involves some amount of paperwork. Once the EOI is accepted, a pre-submission meeting is held between the company and the WHO. Covaxin has reached this stage.Now, the vaccine maker will have to present all clinical trial data conducted in all sites to WHO, which will be evaluated simultaneously. Then WHO will give an anticipated date when the approval is likely to be given only when all data is submitted and follow-up inspection observations are also completed.What WHO examines whether the product has been able to eradicate the disease or prevent outbreaks and whether the manufacturing is compliant with Good Manufacturing Practices.Covaxin and controversiesAt home and abroad, Covaxin has been the centre of several controversies beginning its approval in India in January in the "absence of adequate data". After the vaccine makers provided their latest data, its high price in India came on the radar as the vaccine in the private market costs more than Covishield and Sputnik V. Meanwhile, Brazil has suspended the purchase of the vaccine from Bharat Biotech following allegations of corruption in the deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-will-covaxin-get-who-nod-rolling-data-submission-to-begin-in-july-101625033261383.html

It said ₹10 lakh compensation is not even equal to the two-month average net earnings of the pilots.In an email on Tuesday, Vidya Prasad Karmarkar, the widow of Prasad Karmarkar who operated Boeing 777 for Air India, requested the airline to grant the pilots Permanently Medically Unfit (PMU) grants as per the Air India circular of 2016.Officials said under rules, there is no provision for declaring pilots PMU unless they personally appear before a designated medical board for a medical evaluation. But as per the circular, the airline’s medical board in cases of critical medical situations can declare a pilot PMU for compensation under this category.Also Read | New UK travel rules amid Covid cause travel uncertainty: AirlinesVidya Prasad Karmarkar said, “In almost all of the unfortunate deaths, the pilots have suffered Covid related multi-organ failure with them being in critical condition and abjectly poor prognosis, before giving up their individual battle against the virus.

30-06-2021||India||SC grants Centre 6 weeks to fix ex-gratia for deaths due to Covid-19||The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed the Centre to frame guidelines specifying ex-gratia amount for persons who died due to Covid-19 within six weeks.The court has not fixed any amount that is to be given and has left it to the wisdom of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).The order came on two separate petitions filed by advocates Gaurav Kumar Bansal and Reepak Kansal which claimed that Covid being a disaster notified under the Disaster Management Act (DMA) 2005, the Central government will be bound by Section 12(iii) of the Act providing for ex-gratia of ₹4 lakh for those who died during the disaster. On March 14, 2020, the Centre had declared Covid-19 to be a disaster under DMA. The court said under Section 12(iii) of DMA, it was mandatory for NDMA to issue guidelines on ex-gratia under minimum standards of relief as the word used in the Act is “shall”.“The statutory duty is cast upon the authority to frame guidelines for ex-gratia. By not recommending ex-gratia, it can be said that the national authority (NDMA) failed to perform its statutory duty under Section 12 of DMA,” said the bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and MR Shah.The guidelines for ex-gratia would be guided by the requirement, availability of funds, and money allocated for other measures needed for mitigation, prevention and relief with regard to Covid-19.The Centre had argued that while passing the DMA, the legislature did not contemplate a pandemic situation as the Act was meant to provide relief for one-time events such as earthquakes, cyclones, etc or a few incidents taking place periodically for some time. Further, the Centre argued that during Covid-19, it had adopted a multi-pronged approach in containing the harm caused by disaster by augmenting hospital infrastructure, medical supplies, drugs, insurance to health care providers and food safety to poor citizens. According to the Government, in such a scenario, granting ex-gratia may not be understood as “shall” but “may”. In an affidavit filed before the top court on June 19, the Centre claimed that granting ₹4 lakh ex-gratia for Covid-19 deaths was “beyond fiscal affordability” of states. However, during arguments, the Centre said this did not mean that it had no money but considering the fact that the pandemic is ongoing, funds need to be allocated on multiple fronts. The petitioners argued that fiscal constraint can never be a ground to deny relief entitled to citizens under the DMA. The court also directed Centre to issue simplified guidelines for issuance of certificate of death due to Covid-19 and for making corrections in the certificate already issued. The bench further directed Centre to take appropriate steps for providing insurance cover as recommended by the finance commission||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-grants-centre-6-weeks-to-fix-ex-gratia-for-deaths-due-to-covid19-101625032400245.html

With this money, students can pursue graduation, post-graduation, professional courses, diploma, PhD, post-doctorate and can even go for research...in both India and abroad,” chief minister Mamata Banerjee said last week.There will be a credit limit of ₹10 lakh under the scheme at the interest rate of 4% with the provision of easy repayment. “Anyone aged up to 40 and who has resided in the state for at least 10 years can avail this. It is a soft loan for the students for which they do not have to bring any guarantor. The state government would be the guarantor. Students can repay the loan within a period of 15 years after getting a job,” said an official.Banerjee will launch the scheme.

As seen in the video, the minister then went inside his car without responding to the parents.During the interaction, the minister also asked the parents to switch the camera off once. Following the interaction, which the minister left in the midway, the parents demonstrated outside his residence. NSUI burnt en effigy of the minister and demanded his resignation. The parents' organisation too demanded his resignation over his insensitive remark and said that they will complain to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Congress state president Jitu Patwari shared the video on social media and wrote, "This is Madhya Pradesh's education minister and Shivraj Singh Chouhan's uncontrolled horse. He is telling the parents' union 'do whatever you can, go and die'. This response to the demand of fee waiver in schools during the pandemic shows how the government is blinded by the power."The minister has not commented on the viral video so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/go-die-madhya-pradesh-minister-tells-parents-who-complained-of-high-fees-101625028900192.html

Antibody prevalence was found to be 14% among the 164 persons with HIV/AIDS, who visited the hospital for their anti-retroviral therapy, added the study uploaded to medRxiv, a free online archive, and distribution server.The average seropositivity in Delhi was 25.7% at the time when the samples from persons with HIV/AIDS were collected between September and November 2020.“This captures the data after the first wave of the infections; we do not know yet what happened during the massive second wave of infections. However, the lower infection prevalence among people with HIV is likely to be because they might have followed precautions more rigorously being at a higher risk of contracting infections,” said Neeraj Nischal, associate professor, department of medicine at AIIMS.Also Read | Fewer women taking Covid-19 shots in India? Here’s what govt data saysAnother reason ascribed by the study for the low prevalence of antibodies among the people living with HIV/AIDS is that the persons might not have generated antibodies after getting Covid-19 or might not have sustained it.Delhi’s population level seroprevalence shot up after November’s surge in infections to over 56% in the January round. The scheduled April round of the survey was cancelled because of rising Covid-19 cases. Another AIIMS study found a higher seroprevalence of 74.7% in urban areas of Delhi in March, again before the devastating wave of infections in April-May.Interestingly, the study also found that majority of the patients had either no or minimal symptoms.“We are still gathering evidence as to how Covid-19 affects people with HIV. Based on limited evidence, we believe people with HIV who are on effective HIV treatment and have suppressed viral load with good CD4 counts have the same risk of severity of Covid-19 as people who do not have HIV. So, it is important that all such people continue taking their anti-retroviral therapy,” said Nischal.A previous AIIMS study showed that over 97% of the patients had minor or no symptoms. In South Korea, more than 60% of the people with HIV were asymptomatic for Covid-19 at the time of diagnosis, according to the study.Nischal warned that the small study from one centre should not be used to generalise trends across the country. Wider studies were needed to understand the impact of Covid-19 on people with HIV, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lower-exposure-to-covid-among-persons-with-hiv-aiims-study-101625028500069.html

Another such attack was thwarted attack on Monday and three army teams reported drone sightings near military installations in Jammu between 1 am and 4.30 am on Tuesday.The fresh drone sighting was reported a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday chaired a meeting of top ministers to discuss a long-pending policy on the management of and ways to deal with emerging security challenges.Senior police superintendent (Jammu) Chandan Kohli said, “The Army informed us that they again spotted drones over Kaluchak and Kunjwani military stations around 4 am (Wednesday). We are looking into it.” He added police were investigating drone sightings in Jammu.Also Read | NIA takes over Jammu drone attack probeDrones have been spotted hovering over military stations in Jammu for the fourth straight day.The Kaluchak military station was attacked in 2002 by three armed terrorists from Pakistan. The three first attacked a Himachal Road Transport Corporation bus on the Jammu-Pathankot highway and killed seven passengers before storming the station, where they killed 23 people.In February 2018, Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists attacked the nearby Sunjuwan Army installation and killed six soldiers and a civilian besides injuring 20 others.

The 3907 MW project, if cleared, will involve clearing at least 270,000 trees in sub-tropical evergreen and rain forests in a vital tiger area, according to the fact sheet of the Union environment ministry’s Forest Advisory Committee (FAC).The project is proposed to be developed by Etalin Hydro Electric Power Company Limited, a joint venture of Hydro Power Development Corporation of Arunachal Pradesh Limited and Jindal Power Limited (JPL) at the cost of about ₹25,296.95 crore, according to the fact sheet.In response to a conservationist’s RTI query about the cost-benefit ratio on June 21, the state government said the information pertains to a third party and consent for disclosure was sought. “M/S Etalin Hydro Electric Power Company Limited does not want to disclose information till FAC reconsiders it.” Also Read | Supreme Court pulls up environment ministry over ‘diluting green standards’HT reached out to JPL for a response via email on June 27 but there has been no response yet.Ritwick Dutta, an environmental lawyer, said the cost-benefit ratio analysis is mandatory under the National Forest Policy and the Forest Conservation Act. “Whatever diversion of forest area takes place on account of a project (cost-benefit ratio analysis) is done by the government and not by the project developer. So, the application for forest clearance is normally done by the state government to the Centre... it is their (state government)’s job to do the cost-benefit analysis.”Dutta said the analysis is not third-party information. “It is a public document for the benefit of the public at large. So, denial of information is illegal,” said Dutta. “Some information can be the third party such as those involving patents or design of the project, but the ratio analysis can never be third party information. The state should make it public. They do not need the company’s permission to do that.”The FAC examined the project last year and sought key details related to the ecological impact and economic viability of the project. It sought the power ministry’s response on the economic feasibility. FAC referred to the delay in the project by six years and said the country’s energy plan may have changed during the period. It noted a large number of hydroelectric projects were pending due to environmental and forest clearance concerns.The FAC directed Arunachal Pradesh to submit a cost-benefit ratio analysis for the project as per the latest guidelines of the Union environment ministry, which was directed to monitor the exercise.Environmentalists working in the region said the analysis is an important document based on which a recommendation is made by the FAC, and the Union environment ministry takes the decision on a project. The application forms for forest clearance are public documents available on the ministry’s website when the FAC examines a matter. The environmentalists say this also enables members of the public to make informed submissions to the FAC when it takes up specific projects for forest clearance.In a February 29, 2012, order, the Central Information Commission said documents related to the forest clearance process be uploaded online. It said in case any additional documents/reports/studies are sought by the FAC or it undertakes any site visit, then such information should also be uploaded on the ministry’s website within 10 days of receipt of information.The ministry guidelines on cost-benefit analysis say: “While considering a proposal for diversion of forest land for non-forestry use, it is essential that ecological and environmental losses and eco-economic distress caused to the people who are displaced are weighted against economic and social gains.”The RTI applicant first sought information from the environment ministry, which shared the relevant information. The application was transferred to the state public information officer as the document related to the analysis is with the Arunachal Pradesh government. The applicant can file a complaint with the state appellate authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arunachal-declines-to-share-cost-benefit-analysis-of-mega-hydro-project-101625026400336.html

Here's what govt data says||India has vaccinated more people than the entire population of Canada in eight days between June 21 and June 29, but the male-female ratio of vaccination coverage remains skewed. From June 21, India entered a new phase of vaccination where the Centre procures 75 per cent of vaccines from the vaccine makers and distributes them among states so that people can be vaccinated at an accelerated pace. Over 4.61 crore doses have been administered in the last eight days, which the government said is more than the population of Iraq (4.02 crore), Canada (3.77 crore), Saudi Arabia (3.48 crore) and Malaysia (3.23 crore).However, as far as the male-female ratio is concerned, government data reveals that women are left behind men by over 3 crore doses as 14.99 crore doses have been administered to women since the beginning of the vaccination drive, which is 46 per cent of the total doses. Around 17.8 crore doses have been given to men, which is 54 per cent of the total vaccination. In India, 54,693 people belonging to the other gender category have received vaccination till date.Moderna’s Covid vaccine approved for use in India"We would like to see increased proportion of women coming to vaccination booths for receiving the vaccine so that skew in gender can also get corrected," Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul said commenting on the gender gap.What might have held women back from getting vaccinatedWhen the vaccination drive began in India on January 16, pregnant and lactating women were kept outside the coverage of vaccination, which might be one of the reasons, according to experts, behind the skewed ratio. Rumours like women should not take Covid-19 vaccines during menstruation or that vaccines will affect fertility might have also deterred women from coming forward to take vaccines.For both men and women, Covid-19 vaccines have no impact on fertility and there is no such question as all these are investigated during the trial, Dr Paul said on Tuesday, during the press meet of the health ministry. "With full authority and science and research, I want to say there is no side effect of infertility associated with vaccines and it is rumour mongering and raising doubts so please don't believe them. There is no chance with any infertility, male or female, in relation to any licensed vaccine -- Covaxin, Covishield, Sputnik-V and Moderna," Dr Paul said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fewer-women-taking-covid-19-shots-in-india-here-s-what-govt-data-says-101625024549589.html

The proposed bill for the same is now with the ministry of home affairs awaiting the assent of the President after being passed by the Odisha Legislative Assembly in February 2021. There is no provision in the Indian Ports Bill, 2021 to include a State Maritime Board which is constituted at a later date by a state enactment. The Union government, through Maritime States Development Council (MSDC), seeks to appropriate this authority of the state through the proposed bill,” Behera wrote.Also Read | Over 16,000 pre-activated SIM cards seized from cybercriminal gang in OdishaWhile passing the bill in February this year, the state government had said the State Maritime Board will be the authority that allows construction, maintenance and operation of ports in the state directly or through PPP mode. It will also regulate and control navigation within the limits of the port and port approaches. “The proposed provision, instead of making India a strong maritime nation, through its centralisation of authority will stunt the growth of port-led development in the nation. Also, this proposal is against the very spirit of cooperative federalism and empowerment of states,” he said.Behera said MSDC has been in existence as a notified advisory body since 1997, focusing on integrated planning and development of ports and inland waterways. “MSDC should only comprise ministers of coastal states and the Union minister for ports, like the GST council...The draft Bill mandates centralisation of many routine functions to MSDC such as, conducting enquiry, deciding tariff structure etc. which will be very limiting and less efficient. MSDC’s role should continue to be recommendatory and advisory as before,” Behera said in the letter.Behera also requested that important bills are not expedited and proper deliberations are done with stakeholder states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lack-of-provision-for-state-maritime-board-in-proposed-indian-ports-billodisha-101625023879799.html

Can a recovered patient get reinfected? 5 big questions answered||The world is grappling with the more virulent strain of the coronavirus, the Delta Plus variant. It has been spreading rapidly, causing more infections. Some reports even claim that it is impervious to vaccines and therapies generally used to treat Covid-19 patients.But is that a reality? How dangerous is the delta plus variant? And how long with the coronavirus disease continue to wreak havoc. Dr Tanu Singhal, Consultant, Paediatrics and Infectious Disease at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, speaks to hindustantimes.com on these and other issues.Q: Does Delta Plus variant adversely affect vaccine efficacy?Dr Singhal: The Delta Plus variant is a mutation in the Delta variant. The original Delta variant was first discovered in India and drove the second wave. It had acquired two new mutations - one was L452 R and other was E484 Q. We know that this variant is highly transmissible and possibly more virulent and less impacted by vaccines. This Delta Plus variant has been recently discovered and has another mutation - K417 N - which is also found in the beta and gamma variants which is the South American and the Brazilian variants but the practical experience with Delta Plus variant has been very less because there are only about 50-odd cases which have been sequenced in India so far. So, the first important point I would like to make is we don’t have sufficient knowledge about the transmissibility or the virulence or the immune escape properties of this Delta Plus variant. It has been hypothesised that because it has the K417 N mutation, which was also there in the Brazilian variant, it may escape vaccine induced immunity but there is no practical data to support it so far.There is one woman in Rajasthan who was fully vaccinated yet got infected with Delta Plus variant but her disease was mild. So until now it has been discovered that while variants can cause breakthrough infections in vaccinated people overall the severity of the disease is milder.Q: What happens if a recovered patient contracts the infection again, this time the Delta Plus variant?Dr Singhal: Firstly, so far reinfections have been few. That means most of the patients who got infected in the first wave did not get infected in the second wave. So we know that prior infection with the other original virus did give long-lasting protection even against the delta variant. But we do not know how common that is going to be for reinfection with the delta plus. But until now all reinfections have been mild and not required hospitalisation unless person is vulnerable.Q: What are the symptoms of infection with Delta Plus variant? Are they different from the Delta or Alpha variants?Dr Singhal: We do not have data so far to establish that the symptoms are milder or more severe as compared to the delta variant.Q: Is the third wave of Covid-19 going to be as devastating as the second one? Are we better prepared for it in terms of vaccines and oxygen supply?Dr Singhal: We have sero-prevalence surveys that says about 60-70% of our population is immune which was about 25-30 per cent at the end of the first wave. Therefore, chances are that natural immunity is comparatively higher now than what it was after the first wave. Also we have vaccinations levels now which are much better. Hence, possibility of third wave being as severe as second wave is unlikely and it should rather be a smaller and less ferocious wave hopefully. This could change though if we have a new variant which emerges and is able to escape immunity provided by either previous infection or vaccination.We will be better prepared to handle the third wave as compared to the second wave because what happened was after the first wave everybody became complacent as there were very few cases in the months that followed the first wave and people thought that India has achieved herd immunity and Indians are more immune than other people and Covid is gone from India and we did not build infrastructure which we should have between the first and second wave. So I think the message is gone through clear and authorities are trying to ramp up the infrastructure. Which is a good step and much desired for regular health services and also builds our preparedness for other future pandemics if they were to occur.Q: How many waves are expected to hit before Covid-19 is declared under control? When are we expected to reach herd immunity?Dr Singhal: No one has an answer to this question. But looking at the previous pandemics like Spanish flu, the Asian flu of 1957-58, the Hong Kong flu of 1967, or SARS or MERS outbreaks, or H1N1 flu of 2009, most pandemics have lasted for two years. As an extension to that, and also with the world achieving herd immunity and vaccinations increasing, I feel personally in another six month time we should have better control of this pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-a-covid-recovered-patient-get-reinfected-with-delta-plus-expert-answers-101625020118869.html

The speculation arose after the actor-turned-politician posted a pro-Modi tweet."There are four kinds of unhappy people: Those who are unhappy with own sorrows, with others' sorrows, how happy others are and a new variant of people being unhappy with Modi without any reason," Sinha had said in his tweet posted on Sunday in Hindi.दुनिया में चार तरह के दुःखी लोग होते हैं..१. अपने दु:खों से दु:खी,२. दूसरों के दु:ख से दु:खी,३. दूसरों के सुख से दु:खी,और*New Variant*४. बिना बात खामखां मोदी से दु:खी!😁😁😂😂"It was a Sunday humour for entertainment. I make some tweets for fun every Sunday and no political meaning should be derived from them," the Congress leader told news agency PTI.The 75-year-old added that he doesn't have any feeling to leave Congress and join the BJP again.Sinha had surprised the political circles last year by praising PM Modi over the evacuation of Indians from China in wake of the coronavirus.“With an attitude of gratitude, I salute you & your people for having done the needful in an emergency situation so soon, as I always say soon, sooner the better,” Sinha said in a string of tweets in September, 2020.The Indian government had evacuated hundreds of its citizens, most of them students, from Wuhan from where the coronavirus disease is believed to have emerged.Sinha quit the BJP and joined the Congress just before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and unsuccessfully contested from his native Patna Sahib constituency on a Congress ticket. He had earlier served as a Union minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government.Sinha had twice won with a handsome margin from the Patna Sahib seat on a BJP ticket in 2009 as well as 2014. But in 2019, Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad defeated Sinha from the seat by securing 62 per cent of the votes as against the actor-politician's 33 per cent.Before walking out of the saffron party, Sinha had targeted PM Modi and Union Home minister Amit Shah. He used to say that BJP has become "one-man party and two men army" without naming anybody.Sinha had debuted in politics three decades ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shatrughan-sinha-on-pro-modi-tweet-it-was-sunday-humour-101625018342877.html

The only licensing and regulatory body for the financial audit and accounting profession in India will celebrate the 73rd Chartered Accountants day this year.ICAI is deemed as the second biggest accounting organization in the world with about 2.5 lakh members.In his radio address 'Mann Ki Baat' on Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioned that Chartered Accountants Day is celebrated on July 1 and reminded them about a gift he sought from them. “A few years back, I had asked chartered accountants of the country for a gift of Indian audit firms of global level. Today, I want to remind them of this. Chartered accountants can play a very good and positive role in bringing transparency to the economy. I extend my best wishes to all chartered accountants and their family members,” he said.History and Significance of National Chartered Accountants DayBefore India's Independence, the British government had established a rule that expected firms to keep track of their accounts under the Companies Act of India. An auditor was also appointed to audit these books. The auditors were expected to gain a certificate certifying them for this task. In the ensuing years, the role and designation of an auditor morphed to various degrees where the accountancy profession became largely unregulated and created confusion in terms of the qualifications of auditors.After Independence in the year 1948, an expert committee recommended that a separate autonomous association of accountants should be set up to regulate the profession of accountants in the country. The Indian government adhered to the recommendation and passed an act in the Parliament that gave birth to a statutory body named The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-chartered-accountants-day-on-july-1-all-you-need-to-know-101625013069567.html

India improved its ranking from 47 to 10 in the United Nation’s ITU Global Cybersecurity Agenda (GCA). The US is ranked first, followed by the UK.“It is great news and an acknowledgement of multiple initiatives that we have taken along with CERT (Cyber Emergency Response Team),’’ said India’s National Cyber Security Coordinator (NCSC) Rajesh Pant.While giving credit to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for acknowledging the importance of cybersecurity in his Independence Day speech last year, Pant also highlighted other measures: “We have a national cybersecurity strategy that is awaiting cabinet nod and also recently operationalized the trusted source policy that asks all telecom companies to declare where they source their equipment.’’The rankings come at a time when the government has been dealing with several instances of cross-border cyber attacks.In February, HT reported several instances in which government domain email addresses were used to launch cyber attacks and the discovery of critical vulnerabilities in several government servers, which could have given attackers access deep into sensitive networks.The International Telecommunications Union, or ITU, which is a specialised agency under the UN, said in the report that the ranking is based on four pillars: legal measures, technical measures, capacity building measures and organisational measures.The latest report is the fourth one in the series.“This rating doesn’t reflect the reality of India’s poor cybersecurity situation,’’ said Ramanjit Chima of Access Now.“India has not yet published its national cybersecurity strategy due for over a decade and has not set clear cybersecurity responsibilities within the different parts of the government despite two years of discussions. It is also facing increased cross-border cyber attacks and data breaches every month and is being asked for its position on global cyber policy issues.

The Prime Minister may also review the performance of some ministries.The performance review usually happens before a cabinet reshuffle, and the buzz around the agenda for today's virtual meeting has fuelled speculation that the Prime Minister can indeed expand the Union Cabinet. The exercise is expected to take place before the monsoon session of Parliament begins next month.The strength of PM Modi's is 60 and is expected to go upto 79.PM Modi has held meeting with the chief ministers of various states, including the election-bound states of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.However, the expected agenda is to discuss various schemes launched by the Centre to tackle the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). A senior functionary of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) told Hindustan Times on condition of anonymity that the the Prime Minister may ask the ministers in today's meeting to spread the message to the public about the measures taken by the government to mitigate the pain and problems of the people.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced eight new schemes on Monday to boost the economy battered by shutdowns causes by the pandemic. Among the measures announced by Sitharaman is ₹1.5 lakh crore of additional credit for small and medium businesses, more funds for the healthcare sector, loans to tourism agencies and guides, and waiver of visa fee for foreign tourists as part of the package to support the economy.The central government is in high gear to dispel perception about its lack of preparation for the second wave of Covid-19 and the meeting is a step towards that. The BJP too has started preparations to change the perception on the ground.The steps are needed to be taken in the wake of assembly elections due in a number of states next year. BJP chief Jagat Prakash Nadda held a meeting with party functionaries last week and discussed ways to amplify the message around government's achievements in mitigating the effects of the second wave of the pandemic.Nadda also discussed with national general secretaries of the party and senior members the preparations for the anticipated third wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-meet-council-of-ministers-today-covid-vaccination-likely-on-agenda-101625012321853.html

The issue of Depsang Bulge will be dealt with by local commanders as it was a 2013 legacy issue, HT learns.According to South Block officials, the decision to discuss Hot Springs (patrolling point 14) and Gogra (patrolling point 17A) was taken at the virtual meeting of Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India China border affairs on June 25.The two friction points, which are near the Kugrang and Chang Chemmo rivers respectively, were transgressed by the PLA on May 17-18, 2020 (apart from north banks of Pangong Tso).The 2013 friction point of Depsang Bulge, south of Daulet Beg Oldi, will not be taken up by the senior military commanders but dealt at the local commanders level, the officials added, asking not to be named. In April 2013, PLA transgressed the Raki and Jeevan nullah with the aim of blocking Indian Army from patrolling points 10 to 13A within the bulge area.While disengagement has taken place from the north and south banks of Pangong Tso, a larger de-escalation remains work in progress due to mutual mistrust and suspicion after the PLA’s 2020 transgressions.Both the Indian Army and the PLA Army have three divisions of troops with support elements all along the 1597 kilometre-long Line of Actual Control (LAC) in East Ladakh with artillery, armour and rocket elements in addition. The Indian Army troops led by Lt General P G K Menon of 14 Corps are on constant vigil and are conducting patrols within limits defined by the Cabinet Secretary in 1976. There has been no accretion of troops from the Indian side since the August 29-31, 2020 incident on south banks of Pangong Tso. That was when the Indian army beat the PLA in the race to occupy commanding heights in the southern bank.While the Army is monitoring the Chinese activity along the LAC, the Indian Navy is keeping a close watch on PLA warship from the Gulf of Aden to the Malacca Straits including the south Indian Ocean. Apart from some research activity in deep south Indian Ocean which is being monitored, the Chinese ships are confined around the Gulf of Aden or Makran Coast off Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-to-discuss-disengagement-at-lac-101625012060549.html

The bipartisan resolution had 41 cosponsors including 17 cosponsors from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.The resolution recognised that when the United States was witnessing a devastating spike in the number of Covid–19 cases, India lifted its export ban on certain therapeutics in response to a request by the US government.It also said that India's pharmaceutical industry is a vital part of the global solution to the pandemic and accounts for over half of global vaccine manufacturing.The resolution titled “Urging the Administration to facilitate assistance in response to the devastating impact of Covid–19 in India” was introduced last month by Congressman Brad Sherman, the Democratic Co-Chair of the House Caucus on India and India Americans, and Rep. Steve Chabot."The resolution stands with the people of India as they collectively work to stem the spread of Covid-19," said Congressman Sherman. "The US must work with our partners around the world to quell the virus everywhere it persists."As a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as well as the Democratic Co-Chair of the India Caucus, Congressman Sherman has worked, alongside the Republican Co-Chair Steve Chabot, to address the devastating effects of this second Covid-19 wave in India.In April, Reps. Steve Chabot, Ro Khanna, Michael Waltz and others joined Congressman Sherman in formally requesting that the White House increase its assistance for India's battle against Covid-19. By early May, the United States had provided more than $100 million worth of medical supplies to India, including oxygen support, personal protective equipment (PPE), rapid diagnostic tests, and therapeutics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-resolution-recognises-india-s-covid-19-help-urges-govt-to-facilitate-aid-101625010051462.html
30-06-2021||India||In India, ‘woke’ politics a liability: Pew survey||Indians, across religions, are not just believers but also conservative in their attitude towards religion. Political support, even for the rationalist and communist political formations, does not change this fact. While they claim to have respect for people from other religious persuasions, they are not very keen on promoting western style secularism, which calls for separation of religion and politics.Some of the most controversial and divisive political positions around religion, such as the bogey of Love-Jihad sustain themselves not on facts but the widespread disapproval of such ideas in principle. These findings, if true, suggest that radical secularism or ‘woke’ politics is unlikely to work politically in India and mainstream politics will continue to pander to conservative values around both caste and religion.These are among the interesting findings of a survey conducted by the Pew Research Centre, a Washington based “nonpartisan fact tank” that offers some useful insights on the role of religion in politics. The survey, Religion in India: Tolerance and Segregation, is based on 30,000 interviews conducted between November 2019 and March 2020.The intersection of religion and politics has always been a contested terrain in India. The Indian nation suffered a partition on religious lines at birth, yet adopted a secular form of state. This question has gained renewed salience since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a political affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), stormed to a parliamentary majority in 2014, becoming the first party to get a majority after 1984. It replicated that feat in 2019. The BJP’s political victory has come on the back of a massive consolidation of Hindu votes, and almost negligible representation of Muslims in the ruling party’s support base or elected representatives.The Opposition, having realised the gravity of political challenge, has tried many tricks to counter the BJP. The most common among them has been what is often described as the “soft-Hindutva” approach. This is characterised by political leaders openly associating with Hindu religious symbols such as visiting temples or even reciting scriptures during political campaign. The success of such as an approach has been mixed, which also means it is difficult to establish a cause-effect relationship. There is also a small but vocal minority which advocates a radical approach to questioning and undermining established religious and cultural norms.It is this background that makes the findings of the survey interesting. Here are some of the key ones:Most Indians are believersIndians are overwhelmingly believers when it comes to God. This trend holds across religions, except among Buddhists where one-third list themselves as non-believers. While the overall share of non-believers is small across major religions, the probability of finding a Muslim or Sikh non-believer is three times that of finding one among Hindus and Christians. The disproportionately large share of non-believers among Buddhists seems to be driven by the conversion of Bhim Rao Ambedkar to Buddhism in 1956. 89% of Buddhists identified themselves as members of the Scheduled Castes (SC) in the survey. “It does seem like the concentration of Buddhists who are also Dalit and atheist is higher in Maharashtra (5% of Maharashtra’s total population vs. 0.5% nationally). Of course, though, the overwhelming majority of Indian Buddhists (85%) are located in Maharashtra”, Neha Sahgal, associate director of research at Pew Research, told HT.Voting for communists and rationalists does not change faith in a big wayWhat is also interesting is that one’s attitude to God does not change significantly with political persuasion. The share of believers among those who voted for the Communist Party of India (CPI), Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI (M) and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) does not differ significantly from the group which did not vote for such parties. This is contrary to perceived wisdom, given the fact that the leadership of the communists and DMK does not acknowledge religion in their political positions. However, this statistic does explain why the CPI (M) was so vulnerable to a Hindu backlash when it supported a Supreme Court decision (now stayed) allowing entry to women of all ages in the Sabarimala shrine in Kerala, which was against established custom.On the face of it, communal harmony coexists with segregationA large majority of Indians, across religious persuasions, sees respecting other religions as an important part of being Indian and true to their own religion. This feeling exists despite a majority of Hindus, Muslims and Christians seeing each other as very different from other religions and displaying a high desire for religious segregation, especially when it comes to marriage. The statistics speak for themselves. 80% and 79% of Hindus and Muslims believed that respecting other religions is a very important part of their religious identity. To be sure, experts believe that such responses might not reveal the true picture. “That people tend to hide or underreport politically incorrect views or responses in surveys is a well known fact and the scale of communal polarisation in India could be far greater”, said Neelanjan Sircar, assistant professor of political science at Ashoka University and a visiting fellow at Centre for Policy Research.66% Hindus and 64% Muslims also thought that they were very different from each other. 67% and 80% of Hindus and Muslims, respectively, believed that it was very important to stop women from their community from marrying outside their religion. The numbers are not very different even when it comes to men marrying outside their religion.To be sure, the high preference levels for communal harmony could be a result of a tendency to appear as being politically correct among respondents. When asked whether they saw religious diversity as beneficial to their country, only 53% (52% Hindus and 56% Muslims) said yes.What makes people outcastes from their religion?Eating prohibited meat (beef among Hindus and pork among Muslims) is the biggest disqualifier when it comes to being seen as part of the community. 72% Hindus and 77% Muslims believe that a person cannot be a Hindu/Muslim if they eat beef/pork. Sikhs and Jains are also highly disapproving of eating beef. While this is the common factor among both Hindus and Muslims, the two groups differ on other triggers of being considered outcastes. Observing festivals of other religious communities is a bigger taboo among Hindus than Muslims. Muslims are relatively more forgiving when it comes to observing other religious festivals than not participating in their own rituals and festivals. “Disrespecting India” is also a big trigger for being considered an outcaste, both among Hindus and Muslims. These statistics underline the political risk which a politician advocating tolerance of eating beef or pork, or questioning “nationalism” would attract.The fear of perceived religious transgressions is what feeds communal politicsWhy does something like ‘Love-Jihad’, a term used by many Hindu majoritarian organisations to claim large scale inter-religious marriage and conversion of Hindu women, manage to find political traction in India? Almost all Indians do not report having ever faced religious conversion in their lives. The occasionally rare instances of conversion, even when they occur, are present across all religions. What explains the paranoia such issues generate then?One possible explanation could be the fact that most Indians are not averse to politicians influencing religious affairs. Politicians may be exploiting entrenched religious fears, such as aversion to inter-religious marriage or the disproportionate opposition to a uniform civil code among Muslims – 74% Muslims support allowing Muslims to go to their own religious courts to settle a family dispute as opposed to just 30% Hindus – to build a political constituency around such issues. That preference for an authoritarian leader is almost the same among many Indian religions, including Hindus and Muslims, must be encouraging such tendencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-india-woke-politics-a-liability-pew-survey-101625007559312.html
30-06-2021||India||Chhattisgarh health minister has doubts on CM’s announcement on pvt sector role||Raipur: Chhattisgarh health minister T S Singh Deo on Tuesday struck a discordant note on the government’s announcement of a plan to provide grants to the private sector to open hospitals in rural areas of the state, saying he only heard about the reported move through the media.“If you are promoting private doctors funded by the government, who are again going to charge people for treatment, it will be against the concept of free healthcare. If they are funded by the government and they are working without charging people, then there is no objection in giving them grants,” the health minister said, according to news agency Press Trust of India.Singh Deo’s remarks come days after chief minister Bhupesh Baghel directed officials to seek the support of the private sector to strengthen health infrastructure in rural areas and has asked the industries department to draft an action plan to see how the private sector can be provided grants to set up hospitals. In Saturday’s statement, Baghel spoke about taking help from the private sector to make services of specialist doctors available in rural areas.Singh Deo said: “A discussion in this regard has not been held with me so far and I came to know about it through the media. I am assuming that it must be a proposal as no discussions have been held at the cabinet level in this connection”.The minister said he was in favour of the universal healthcare scheme right from the beginning and recalled the Congress had referred to ‘right to health’ in its manifesto for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. “Chhattisgarh’s Congress unit and the AICC also spoke about introducing a universal healthcare scheme in 2018 state Assembly polls and 2019 Lok Sabha elections,” the minister said.Activists have also questioned the decision of the state government while the opposition claimed that the state government is not taking the decision ‘unanimously’ and infighting is clearly visible.“Providing health services to the public is the responsibility of a welfare state and the right to get these services is a constitutional right. To provide health services to the people is the only way is to strengthen the public health system ..The state government’s decision to privatize health services is in stark contrast to the concept of a welfare state,” said Alok Shukla, convener of Chhattisgarh Bachao Andolan. Former Chief Minister and BJP leader Raman Singh said Singh Deo’s public statement reveals the infighting that is going on in the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-health-minister-has-doubts-on-cm-s-announcement-on-pvt-sector-role-101624996219623.html
30-06-2021||India||40-yr-old woman reported missing by husband found locked in bank. She had a plan||Shillong: A 40-year-old woman, reported missing for two days, was found on Monday in a Meghalaya bank, starving and dehydrated. It turns out, police said, that she was trying to pull off a bank heist but got a couple of things wrong. One was that every fourth Saturday in a month is a bank holiday.Isabella Marboh, who was sent to a hospital after she was found was formally placed under arrest by the police in Shillong on Tuesday.When she entered the bank a short distance from her house on Friday evening, Marboh thought she had the perfect plan. On her visits to the bank, Marboh had apparently noticed that no one went into the bank’s server room.The plan was to hide in this room when it was time for the bank to close for the day, get into the room where the bank kept the money and take all the cash she could carry when the bank reopened the next day.On Friday, police said, she left home telling her family that she was stepping out to buy vegetables. Instead, she went to the bank, ostensibly to deposit some money and quietly parked herself in the server room.When the bank closed, she went straight for the strong room. But it turned out that she did not have the requisite tools. She tried to prise it open with a pair of scissors but didn’t get far. A police officer who spoke on conditions of anonymity said they did find some tools used by carpenters in her hand bag but did not elaborate. There is no clarity on how she expected to break into the strong room.It is around this time, the officer said, that Isabella Marboh figured that the CCTV camera would have recorded her. So she broke them without realising that the footage was still safe.Marboh planned to leave the bank the following morning when it opened. But June 26 was a bank holiday; all second and fourth Saturdays are.She had brought a stock of chocolate bars and ORS fluid to keep her going for the planned overnight stay in the bank. She had to make her stock last through the weekend.By the time the bank manager opened the premises on Monday morning, she was “dehydrated and weak” and the CCTV cameras were broken. The manager called up the police and her husband, who had been desperately looking for his wife for two days and had floated multiple appeals to find her on social media.According to news website East Mojo, announcements to seek help to locate the missing woman were also made via the public address system in Bishnupur. She didn’t respond to them.Shillong city superintendent of police Vivek Syiem told HT on phone that the woman has been sent to the Shillong Youth Centre quarantine centre where she is awaiting her Covid test report. The SP said of all the angles that he could think of in case of a woman reported missing, an attempted bank heist certainly wasn’t one. “She has been booked under various offences which include criminal trespass, burglary, breaking and entry amongst others and we are awaiting the test report before producing her in court.”Later, her family distanced themselves from her. “We would like to clarify that we have no knowledge and we do not condone the actions committed by Isabella. The act was her own personal choice, and the families don’t stand by her acts,” read a statement issued by Isabella Marboh ’s family on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/40yrold-woman-reported-missing-by-husband-found-locked-in-bank-she-had-a-plan-101624995084012.html
30-06-2021||India||Old allies planned and murdered former BJP corporator, say police||Bengaluru: Police investigating the murder of Rekha Kadiresh, the 45-year-old former corporator who was hacked to death on June 24, have said that personal rivalry is the motive behind the murder. So far, police have arrested seven people including Rekha’s sister-in-law in the case. Talking to HT, a senior investigator, who didn’t want to be named, said that from the investigation so far, police have learnt that the plan was made by the accused after they felt Rekha was side-lining them. So far, the police have arrested Peter, Surya, Stephen, Ajay Mala, Arun and Purushottam. Among them, Peter, the prime suspect in the case was a close associate of Kadiresh. “Kadiresh had a criminal past. In fact, it was a gang rivalry that caused his life in 2018. Peter was his right-hand man before Kadiresh decided to enter politics. Realising that the criminal past would not help win an election, he made his wife contest the election. Even during this time, Peter was a close ally of Kadiresh,” said the official. Following this murder, even though Peter remained with the Kadiresh family, Rekha wanted to move past the criminal past of her husband. “She began to keep Peter and other associates away from her political activity, which irked Peter,” said the officer. The side-lining meant that the financial aid Peter received from Kadiresh stopped over a period of time. “In fact, Peter was in the middle of constructing a new house, which he was doing with the money he was getting from Kadriesh’s family. Once the money stopped and Rekha began to distance Peter from her, he planned the murder,” the officer added. Talking about the involvement of the sister-in-law, the officer said that Mala, the elder sister of Kadiresh, and her son, were in touch with the alleged killers and thus were arrested. He added that while Peter was planning the murder, he realised that Mala too facing a similar problem, where Rekha was distancing her. “Even Mala had a criminal background. She was involved in sales of illegal alcohol and some drug-related cases. Rekha had kept them away from her political activities. So, Peter approached Mala for help,” he added. Police who recreated the crime said that the suspect felt it was a well-planned conspiracy since many CCTV cameras in the locality were unable to capture the crime. Around 10.30 am on June 24, while Rekha was walking home after taking part in a free meal distribution programme at her home in Chalavadipalya, a gang led by Peter waylaid her. “They chased her down and stabbed her multiple times, particularly on the neck and the throat. There were more than 10 stabs on her body. She was taken to Victoria Hospital but wasn’t treated there in view of Covid-19. She was declared brought dead at KIMS Hospital around 11 am,” the officer explained. Even though the attackers had turned the CCTV camera away, eyewitness accounts and a mobile phone video helped the police quickly identify the attackers. Soon after the murder, Peter and Surya fled towards the Tamil Nadu border in an autorickshaw . “During the investigation, we have questioned more than 50 people, who we suspected were in constant touch with the suspect. One of them was of particular interest since we knew he was close to Peter. During his interrogation, we learnt that Peter was using a new mobile number since the murder,” said the officer. The tracking of the new number revealed that these men were moving between locations and finally, police were able to track them down to Sunkadakatte, the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/old-allies-planned-and-murdered-former-bjp-corporator-say-police-101624994237744.html
30-06-2021||India||SC notice to govt on dropping of charges against Lankesh’s killer||New Delhi The Supreme Court on Tuesday issued notice to the Karnataka government and state police on a plea filed by slain journalist Gauri Lankesh’s sister challenging the dropping of charge under the Karnataka Control of Organized Crime Act 2000 (KCOCA) against one of the accused. Lankesh was shot dead in Bengaluru in September 2017.Kavitha Lankesh, working as a filmmaker, had approached the court for staying the Karnataka HC order of April 22, 2021 which had quashed the charges under KCOCA against accused Mohan Nayak who is one of the accused facing trial in Gauri Lankesh murder. Pursuant to this order, Nayak had applied for bail in the Karnataka high court and was awaiting a decision.A three-judge bench of the top court headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar issued notice on the petition and observed that the Karnataka high court shall pass bail order without being influenced by the April 22 order under challenge. The bench posted the matter for hearing on July 15. The Karnataka Police is yet to file an appeal against the HC order in question. Senior advocate Huzefa Ahmadi appearing for Lankesh pointed out Nayak’s involvement in multiple murders involving activists Narendra Dabholkar in 2013 (Pune), Govind Pansare in 2015 (Kolhapur, Maharashtra), and noted Kannada writer MM Kalburgi in Dharwad (Karnataka) in 2015.According to the petition filed through advocate Aparna Bhat, Nayak was involved in arranging logistics for the killers both before and after the crime. It stated that the HC erred in setting aside the order of the Bengaluru Police Commissioner passed in August 2018 invoking KCOCA against Nayak and the subsequent supplementary charge sheet filed by the Special Investigation Team under provisions of KCOCA .The police claimed Nayak to be part of a crime syndicate operated by Amol Kale. Over the past decade, two charge sheets were filed against this syndicate and hence Lankesh claimed that the invocation of KCOCA against Nayak was fully justified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-notice-to-govt-on-dropping-of-charges-against-lankesh-s-killer-101624993638387.html
30-06-2021||India||To get better prices, BSY flags off ‘Kisan Rail’ with 250 tonnes mangoes for Delhi||Bengaluru: Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Tuesday flagged off a Kisan Rail from Yelahanka railway station in Bengaluru with 250 metric tonnes of mango from Chintamani taluka to ferry the fruits to the national capital, in the hope of getting better prices for farmers’ produce. “Kiran Rail scheme plays a crucial role in providing good prices for the farm products and thus enhances farmers’ income,” Yediyurappa said on Tuesday. The chief minister added that since June 20, at least 1,250 metric tonnes of mango have been sent to Delhi, which, according to experts, gives farmers an additional ₹10 per kg for their produce. The rail services, which were introduced in August last year, give 50% subsidy in freight rates for transportation, with an aim to expand the market for the farming community, which has been hit hard due to the Covid-19 pandemic. While the Kisan Rail service, which was announced in the 2021-22 Union budget, has been functional in full steam, most farmers in Karnataka struggle have struggled to make the best use of the same to fetch good prices, largely due to the Covid-19 induced pandemic and its impact on economic activities. Though agricultural activities were allowed to operate even during the nationwide lockdown announced on March 24 last year, farmers have been unable to sell their produce in markets, resulting in more losses and piling debts. The state is also at the receiving end of heavy rains that have added to the possibility of crops getting damaged in several parts of the state. Between June 1 and June 23, Karnataka received 197.1 mm of rains, 35% excess from the normal 145.8 mm rainfall, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD-Bengaluru). However, several regions in the state have also received deficient rains, impacting sowing of crops and causing huge losses, farmers and activists said. Gopal, an office-bearer of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS), a farmers’ union, said there is barely any prices available for the produce in the market, adding that they have not received any support from the government--Union or state. The Covid-19 pandemic has also triggered a mass reverse migration of workers across India with people going back to their villages and home-towns from urban centres. The reverse migration has also added pressure on the already small-land holdings and those dependent on them. The Karnataka government is yet to release payments for the Minimum Support Price (MSP), according to state agriculture minister BC Patil. Patil said that around ₹200 crore was released a couple of weeks ago and more would follow in the next few days. Meanwhile, small farmers and vendors said they were reeling under huge debt due to poor business during this year’s lockdown, which came into force due to the ravaging second wave of the pandemic. In May this year, Yediyurappa announced a ₹1,250-crore financial package, aimed at providing relief to unorganised workers and the farming community. The financial package involved a one-time payment of ₹10,000 for about 20,000 flower growers and 69,000 farmers, who produce fruit and vegetables costing the exchequer a total of around ₹81.73 crore. The package also included the extension of the loan period for short, medium and long-term availed by around 425,000 farmers and others by three months, which would entail the government bearing the interest payment of ₹134.38 crore. Citing the package would do little to alleviate their suffering, several farmer unions have claimed that they are yet to receive the money.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-get-better-prices-bsy-flags-off-kisan-rail-with-250-tonnes-mangoes-for-delhi-101624993577656.html
30-06-2021||India||SSLC exam decision not unilateral: CM||Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Tuesday cleared the air on conduct of the Karnataka Secondary School Leaving Certification (SSLC) examination, after the health and education ministers locked horns over the announcement.Announcing the dates of the Class 10 examinations, S Suresh Kumar, Karnataka’s minister for primary and secondary education, on Monday said that the two exams for Class 10 will be held on July 19 and July 22 respectively. A total of 876,581 students are eligible for the SSLC exams which were delayed due to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.The decision drew criticism as the third wave of infections, expected by the end of the year or earlier, is likely to impact children below the age of 18. Moreover, this age category is yet to be eligible for vaccination in India.However, hours after the decision was announced, state health minister Dr K Sudhakar said at a press conference that he was not aware of the examination dates, as he had not yet spoken with the education minister. He added that he did not know whether the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) was also consulted regarding the matter.“I am unaware of this decision, and I need to consult the education minister on this announcement. I cannot say whether the exams shall be conducted or not. The Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) will give its opinion on this,” said Sudhakar.He added that the education department is yet to submit the number of teaching and non-teaching staff for vaccination before the exams.Responding to this allegation, education minister Kumar said that officials of the health department were kept in the loop before making the decision. “The commissioner of the health department was present during the two-hour-long meeting with district administrations on holding SSLC examinations, and also directed district administrations on following the SOP,” he said.While this issue expectedly caused confusion within the cabinet, CM Yediyurappa intervened and dismissed allegations of lack of communication. He confirmed that the education minister took the decision after consulting him.Later in a tweet, Yediyurappa said: “Minister of education S Suresh Kumar had discussed with me in advance and took the decision to schedule the SSLC exam in July. The decision was taken after a thorough discussion of the subject and is in the best interest of the students. It is not a unilateral decision. Let there be no confusion over the subject.”After the CM’s tweet, health minister K Sudhakar, who an evening before stated that he was unaware of the decision, retracted his statement, saying that the education minister had discussed with health experts before taking the call, and CM Yediyurappa was also informed.“He (Kumar) told me last evening that he had discussed with the CM regarding the decision as I was in another meeting, I was not aware of.... in the evening he informed me about it. I think the discussions were also held with the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC),” he said.During the early weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic, too, the government had drawn criticism over the lack of coordination between the departments, with the then health minister Sriramulu and medical education minister Sudhakar occasionally competing with each other, creating confusion.Subsequently, Sriramulu, who is now the social welfare minister, was divested of the health and family welfare portfolio by the chief minister, which was then allocated to Sudhakar with the intention that one minister handling the related portfolios amid the pandemic would be beneficial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sslc-exam-decision-not-unilateral-cm-101624993517695.html
30-06-2021||India||Amid Delta+ spike, K’taka tightens curbs for visitors from Maha, Kerala||Bengaluru In a bid to restrict the spread of the new Delta Plus variant of the novel coronavirus, the Karnataka government on Tuesday made it mandatory for all travellers coming into the state from neighbouring Maharashtra to carry Covid-19 negative certificates. “Negative RT-PCR certificate not older than 72 hours or vaccination certificate of at least one dose of Covid-19 shall be compulsorily produced by the passengers coming to Karnataka by flight, bus, train, taxi, personal transport, etc. This will also be applicable for all the flights originating from Maharashtra to Karnataka,” according to the guidelines released on Tuesday. The state government directed that airlines shall issue boarding passes only to passengers carrying RT-PCR negative certificates or proof of at least one dose of vaccination. Similarly, district authorities in regions like Kodagu, Dakshina Kannada and Mysuru also have imposed similar restrictions on those coming in from neighbouring Kerala, which like Maharashtra, continues to reel under the impact of the pandemic. Dr K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education on Tuesday travelled to Kodagu, Mysuru and Dakshina Kannada districts and held meetings with officials to review the Covid-19 situation there. “Among the ones (districts), these places have a high positivity and there have been higher deaths. On this, I called for a meeting to discuss the same,” Sudhakar said on Tuesday. The minister said that the positivity in Mysuru was coming down but the fatality rate continues to remain at 3.85%. Sudhakar has also directed officials to undertake a death audit in the district, which is about 125 kms from Bengaluru. One of the two Delta Plus variants in Karnataka is from Mysuru district and Sudhakar said that a genome sequencing lab will be set up in the district. Karnataka has seen a steady decline of new Covid-19 infections in recent weeks, prompting the BS Yediyurappa-led government to ease lockdown restrictions that have been in place since mid-April. Sudhakar also said that he will visit Delhi to meet union government ministers and officials to request a higher allocation of vaccines for Karnataka. Karnataka has administered a total of 2,24,58,057 doses of Covid-19 vaccines until 7.47 pm on Tuesday, according to data from the CoWin portal. Of this, the first dose accounts for 1,87,76,663 while the second dose accounts for 36,81,394, data shows. The state administered 2,51,185 doses until 7.47 pm on Tuesday, according to information on CoWin. “I will be visiting Delhi in the coming days and will be discussing with the union health minister to allocate more vaccines to the State. But I have never said we are short of vaccines in the State and we have never stopped vaccinating people. Everyday over 2-3L people are being vaccinated. The moment we get vaccines from the union government, we will distribute them,” Sudhakar said. The minister claimed that no other state has administered as many vaccines as Karnataka had in south India. Karnataka was placed in the ‘fourth or the fifth position’ in the entire country, he said. The health minister’s denial of any shortage of vaccines in Karnataka came amidst suspension of the vaccination programme in government hospitals and primary health centres (PHCs) in Mysuru for the third consecutive day on Tuesday. “I have never said we are short of vaccines in the state, and we have never stopped vaccinating people. Every day over 2-3 lakh people are being vaccinated. The moment we get vaccines from the union government, we will distribute them,” he said. Karnataka recorded 3,222 more infections, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department, released on Tuesday. The positivity rate stood at 2.54% as the state conducted over 126,000 tests, including 83,874 RT-PCR tests.There were 14,724 recoveries that brought down the active caseload to 85,997, government data shows. The fatality rate continues to be high at 2.88% as 93 more succumbed to the virus, taking the toll to 34,929.

Keshap will depart for New Delhi following the retirement of Smith, the US state department said.“Ambassador Keshap will bring a wealth of experience to the role, having served previously at US embassy New Delhi and as deputy assistant secretary of state for South Asia,” the state department spokesperson said.Keshap most recently served as the principal deputy assistant secretary of state for the bureau of East Asian and Pacific affairs in the state department and as the US envoy to Sri Lanka and the Maldives. He has also been active in advancing the US agenda for the Indo-Pacific.The appointment of Keshap, a career member of the senior foreign service, “will reinforce the close US partnership with the government and people of India, demonstrated by our collaboration to overcome global challenges like the Covid-19 pandemic”, the spokesperson said. The ambassadorial position in New Delhi is among several key posts around the world that are yet to be filled by the Biden administration. The previous ambassador, Kenneth Juster, was a political appointee of the previous administration and stepped down following Donald Trump’s defeat in the 2020 election. Smith carried the highest US foreign service rank of career ambassador. His appointment was announced a day after the US began rushing equipment and materials, including oxygen-related gear and raw materials for Covid-19 vaccines, to support India’s response to a deadly second wave of coronavirus infections.Keshap’s appointment comes at a time when the focus in the region is on the fallout of the withdrawal of US and NATO troops from Afghanistan. Indian officials believe the drawdown of American forces could be completed as early as July, well ahead of the Biden administration’s deadline of September 11. The deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan amid a surge in attacks by the Taliban has become a cause for concern across the region. The son of Keshap Chander Sen, a UN development economist from the Punjab, and Zoe Calvert, a member of the US foreign service, Keshap served at the US embassy in New Delhi during 2005-08 and was involved in negotiations that led to the India-US civil nuclear agreement. His parents met and married in London and Keshap was born in Nigeria in 1971. He also served as deputy assistant secretary of state for South Asia during 2013-15 and did a stint as director of the office of human rights, humanitarian and social affairs during 2008-10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/biden-administration-names-atul-keshap-as-new-charg-d-affaires-in-india-101624993337622.html

We as an NGO are representing a vast majority of hospitals and have given a letter of intent to have 100 million doses for India. It is currently being processed,” Dr Girdhar Gyani, AHPI director general said.He said the AHPI has also approached the manufacturer directly and is waiting to see how that will materialise.As the Johnson&Johnson vaccine is a single-dose vaccine, while others in the Indian market require two doses, it is eagerly awaited. Experts believe it will be cost-effective and will be especially beneficial for the rural population.“J&J being a single-shot vaccine has tremendous value for a country like India. There is so much hesitancy prevailing and it would be easier to convince people to go for vaccination if it were just one dose. It is also difficult for the rural population and those Below the Poverty Line have to keep track and get their second dose,” Dr Gyani said.India is currently administering Oxford-AstraZeneca’s vaccine, produced locally by Serum Institute of India under the brand name Covishield, and Covaxin which is being manufactured by Bharat Biotech. Russia’s Sputnik V has been approved for emergency use in the country.The vaccine is likely to cost ₹450 to 550 per dose, if procured through the EU route, he said. “We have data from 750 hospitals that want the vaccine. They wanted 6 million doses. We have not asked for any specific brand. Once we get the confirmation we shall again take a revised estimate from hospitals. In any case, we are targeting tier-II/III cities where vaccines have not reached,” he said.Dr Gyani also pointed out that trials may not be required for the vaccine in India.“According to our understanding of the policy, if a vaccine is approved by other developed countries, it will get approval in India. Of course, formal process of approval will be required but trials may not be needed as clarified in the case of Pfizer,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-in-india-100-million-doses-of-j-j-vaccine-likely-to-be-procured-from-eu-101624992788697.html

It gave me a report. At Dompara, some people shouted slogans at the NHRC team. Some of the agitators were apparently under the influence of alcohol... Rasheed did not lodge any police complaint. If he files one, we will certainly look into it,” Khan said.Rasheed is among the seven people in the NHRC panel, which includes a member of the West Bengal Human Rights Commission and a member of the West Bengal State Legal Services Authority. The panel is led by Rajiv Jain, the former Intelligence Bureau chief who assumed charge as NHRC member on June 2. Other members include National Commission for Women member Rajulben L Desai, NHRC’s (director) investigation Santosh Mehra and DIG (investigation) Manzil Saini, West Bengal Human Rights Commission registrar Pradip Kumar Panja and West Bengal State Legal Services Authority member secretary Raju Mukherjee.Also Read| Violence after Bengal polls was premeditated: ReportThe panel members have split themselves in two teams that are visiting north and south Bengal districts. They have already met members of more than 100 families. A camp was held in the eastern outskirts of Kolkata on Monday, where many people came to give their statements.On June 21, the Calcutta high court’s five-judge bench headed by acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal dismissed a petition by the West Bengal government seeking recall of the June 18 order that asked the NHRC to probe allegations of human rights violation during alleged violence soon after the results of the recently concluded assembly polls were announced.The high court asked the NHRC to submit its report by June 30, which is the next date of hearing of this case.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, including Leader of the opposition in the West Bengal assembly Suvendu Adhikari and Lok Sabha member Locket Chatterjee raised the allegation of attack on social media and demanded action.Debabrata Majumdar, Trinamool Congress legislator from Jadavpur, said, “I heard local people protested because the NHRC team was accompanied by many outsiders.

30-06-2021||India||Our anti-drone technology can stave off threats: DRDO chief||Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) chief G Satheesh Reddy on Tuesday said that the counter-drone technology developed by his organisation could provide the armed forces with the capability to swiftly detect, intercept and destroy small drones that pose a security threat.He said DRDO’s anti-drone system would give the military both “soft kill” and “hard kill” options to tackle the new and fast-emerging aerial threat. The first refers to jamming the hostile drone, while the second involves a laser-based kill system.Reddy’s comments came two days after small drones were used to target the Jammu air force station. The June 27 attack was the first-ever offensive use of drones to target an Indian military facility.DRDO’s counter-drone technology uses a variety of methods to neutralise the danger from such aerial attacks, officials familiar with it said on condition of anonymity.The officials explained how the system works. The solution consists of a radar system that offers 360-degree coverage with detection of micro drones when they are 4km away, electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors for detection of micro drones up to 2 km and a radio frequency (RF) detector to detect RF communication up to 3 km“The RF/Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) jammer can detect the frequency being used by the controller and jam signals from a distance of 3 km. The laser-based hard kill system can neutralise micro drones at distances between 150 m to 1 km. The system is integrated through a command post,” said one of the officials cited above.DRDO demonstrated its counter-drone technology to different security agencies at the Hindon air force station in January 2020 and at the National Security Guard (NSG) campus in Manesar in August 2020 and January 2021.“The radar detects micro drones and hands over the track for soft kill and hard kill after due verification by a sensor. Once confirmed by RF detection and verified by EO/IR sensor, the system is ready to jam RF/GNSS signals or use laser weapon as per standard operating procedures,” said a second official.The system was deployed for VVIP protection duties during Republic Day 2020, the visit of US President Donald Trump to Motera stadium in Ahmedabad, Independence Day 2020 and Republic Day 2021.“Prototypes for one vehicle-based and one ground-based set up have been prepared and evaluated by DRDO,” the second official added.DRDO has transferred the technology for the production of the anti-drone system to Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), and also written letters to the three services informing them about the system’s capabilities, as reported by Hindustan Times on Tuesday.DRDO is also ready to transfer technology to private companies to produce the anti-drone system.The Jammu drone attack is a watershed in asymmetric warfare and underlines the need for the armed forces to build capabilities to counter the aerial threat, experts previously said.Chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat on Monday said that India has to start preparing for future generation warfare. He said the three services, DRDO, academia and other stakeholders were working together to develop technology to counter the threat from drones at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/our-anti-drone-technology-can-stave-off-threats-drdo-chief-101624993037673.html
30-06-2021||India||Forces on alert amid more drone sightings in Jammu||JAMMU: Three army teams reported drone sightings near military installations in Jammu between 1am and 4.30am on Tuesday, an indication that terrorist groups could be trying to replicate Sunday’s drone strike at the Jammu air force station.“The army informed us that they spotted drones over Kaluchak, Ratnuchak and Sunjuwan early Tuesday. We are looking into it,” Jammu’s senior superintendent of police Chandan Kohli said. This is the third straight day that security forces have spotted drones near military installations.The first sighting on Tuesday was reported at 1.08am at Ratnuchak. Two hours later, military personnel at Kaluchak camp 300 metres away spotted the drone at 3.09am and finally at 4.19am, a drone was spotted near Sunjuwan, seven km away. Kaluchak and Ratnuchak are smaller military stations.The Sunjuwan military station, the largest of the three, was the target of a pre-dawn attack on 10 February 2018 carried out by Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists. Six soldiers and a civilian were killed in this attack. The Kaluchak military station was attacked by terrorists on May 14, 2002 who hijacked a state roadways bus and used it to storm into the camp.A six-member team of Delhi Police officers has also reached Jammu to analyse the threat posed by the drones. “The team has come to be part of the probe and at the same time analyse the modus-operandi of the terrorists because Delhi is the capital and is densely populated ,” a person familiar with the development said, reflecting the concern that terrorists could next use drones to carry out attacks in cities like Delhi too.The use of a small drone to carry out attacks is counted by security analysts as a watershed in asymmetric warfare in India. But it has been used elsewhere, by Islamic State fighters for one, to target forces in Iraq and Syria for years that prompted the United States and drone manufacturers to spend millions of dollars on research to stop what are sometimes called, the “killer bees”.As reported by HT on 20 October 2020, India’s intelligence community did warn that terror groups based in Pakistan were attempting to replicate the IS successes in use of cheap drones to carry out small bomb attacks.Initial investigations into Sunday’s attack have pointed to the role of Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) in the drone strike at a Jammu air force station. Two Indian Air Force personnel were injured in the explosions that took place within six minutes of each other on Sunday. The first blast ripped off the roof of a single-storey building at the high security technical area of the airport manned by the IAF in Satwari area on the outskirts of the city.Jammu and Kashmir police chief Dilbag Singh confirmed suspicions about the involvement of the Pakistan-based LeT. “The same group may also be behind the drones spotted near a military facility on Monday”, Singh told private news channel NDTV..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forces-on-alert-amid-more-drone-sightings-in-jammu-101624992977614.html

By filing this petition, Maheshwari has ensured that no order is passed by the top court without hearing him. The UP Police will also be required to serve a copy of its petition to Maheshwari’s legal team prior to the hearing.Also Read| Trouble mounts for Twitter amid new FIRs over map rowIn a related development, the Karnataka high court adjourned proceedings in Maheshwari’s petition on the request of Uttar Pradesh Police. On a request made by advocate P Prasanna Kumar representing UP Police, the single-judge bench of Justice G Narendra adjourned the matter to July 5. Though no reason was cited by Kumar, it is understood that time was sought to facilitate hearing of the appeal in the Supreme Court.Law officers assisting the UP Police were tight-lipped about the contents of the appeal even as they hinted that the matter will be mentioned for urgent listing before the top court.The Uttar Pradesh Police had earlier summoned Maheshwari for questioning in connection with the viral video.

30-06-2021||India||Trouble mounts for Twitter amid new FIRs over map row||Madhya Pradesh police registered an FIR against Twitter India managing director Manish Maheswari on Tuesday, the second complaint in as many days against the company’s officials over a distorted map of India, showing both Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh outside the country, displayed on its website.The map was discovered on Monday, and taken down the same day.On Monday evening, Bulandshahr Police registered an FIR against Maheshwari and Amrita Tripathi at Khurja Nagar police station on the basis of a complaint by an advocate and office-bearer of Bajrang Dal, Praveen Bhati, Bulandshahr senior superintendent of police S K Singh said.Maheshwari’s lawyer has previously clarified, in a different case, that he in charge of sales. Tripathi tweeted on Tuesday that she was in charge of partnerships at Twitter India. The FIR was registered under section 505(2) of the Indian Penal Code ((statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes) and Section 74 of the IT (Amendment) Act, 2008.In his complaint, Bhati said that he came across the distorted map on Monday while browsing the company’s website, Suresh Kumar, CO of Khurja Nagar said. Bhati added that the map was meant to “hurt the sentiments” of Indians.The Bhopal case was filed on a complaint by Sadbhavana Adhikar Manch, a Bhopal-based organisation, that alleged that Twitter was creating unrest and hurting the sentiments of people.“On Monday, the management of Twitter India crossed all the limits and uploaded a wrong map which hurt our sentiments. They tried to divide the country,” said Manch chief Durgesh Keshwani, also a member of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.Bhopal cyber cell superintendent of police Gurukaran Singh said, “We received a complaint in the morning. After investigation, we found that Twitter India tried to promote enmity and hatred among a class of people, so we have registered a case against them.” The case was filed under section 505 (2) of the IPC.Earlier in the day, state home minister Narottam Mishra instructed the police to initiate legal action against Twitter. “Something or the other has been going on continuously against the country for a long time. Sometimes unrestrained words are spoken against Bharat Mata and sometimes a wrong map of the country is displayed on Twitter. These issues cannot be taken lightly,” Mishra said in a statement posted on Twitter.Twitter declined to comment on the two developments.Twitter has been in the eye of controversy over the past few months. On May 20, it labelled a tweet by Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Sambit Patra “manipulated media” prompting a Delhi Police investigation. The special cell of Delhi Police questioned Maheshwari in late May.The company then missed a May 25 deadline to comply with the new guidelines for intermediaries and social media firms, and an official in the IT ministry previously told HT that the company would lose the protection it enjoyed as an intermediary under the country’s IT law as a result.The Ghaziabad Police has been wanting to question Maheshwari over a video clip that went viral earlier this month. The police believe Twitter did not do enough to halt the circulation of the clip which they believe misrepresents the nature of an attack on an elderly Muslim man as a communal hate crime. The Karkataka high court gave the Twitter executive protection from arrest and told the Ghaziabad Police that they could question him virtually, a ruling that has since been challenged in the Supreme Court.The map that caused the latest controversy was part of a larger image depicting the world map on the company’s website under the careers sections on the page titled Tweep Life. While it showed the disputed Aksai Chin area of Ladakh, illegally occupied by China, as part of that country, it depicted the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir as a separate country.The misrepresentation caused an uproar online amid the ongoing impasse between the government and the micro-blogging firm.This is the second time that Twitter has run into trouble over a map in the past year. In October last year, the Centre had served Twitter with a notice over the geotag for Leh showing it as a part of China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trouble-mounts-for-twitter-amid-new-firs-over-map-row-101624992677720.html

The new guidelines mandate that the social media firms appoint a compliance officer, liable for non-observance of rules, a grievance redressal officer and a nodal officer. Google and Facebook have both said they have complied with the guidelines.Issues regarding user safety and compliance with the new guidelines were part of the conversation, the person quoted above said on condition of anonymity. The issue of end-to-end encryption and the feasibility of traceability was also discussed. The matter was raised by Congress MP Karti Chidambaram, the person added. “Both companies told the panel that they did not read emails or messages exchanged between anyone as they were end to end encrypted,” the person said. “The panel was informed that adopting traceability would have to be a global practice, and doing it just in India is not really possible.”Also Read| Facebook to release its first compliance report in JulyFacebook-owned WhatsApp has already challenged the traceability clause in the court, arguing it invades privacy and negates end-to-end encryption.BJP MP Nishikant Dubey asked Google about whether it listens to conversations on “Ok Google”, its voice command-based platform, another person said.In a statement later, Google said it welcomes the chance to engage with policy makers and ensure the safety of its users. “We always welcome opportunities to engage in dialogue with the policy makers and share details of our efforts in combating illegal content and ensuring the safety of users across our platforms,” a Google spokesperson said. “We have consistently invested in significant product changes, resources, and personnel and have made significant progress in balancing the openness of our platforms with the responsibility of keeping the community safe in compliance with the local laws in the country.”HT reached out to Facebook but did not receive a response immediately.Also Read| WhatsApp, Facebook widely used for news, trust in television low: ReportThe panel, which is headed by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, has also decided to send a letter to Twitter, seeking an explanation over briefly locking out Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and Tharoor from their accounts for alleged copyright infringement. “The panel has sought an explanation from Twitter as to why they had to lock the two accounts instead of taking down the content,” the second person said.On Friday, Ravi Shankar Prasad said he was denied access to his account by the company, which said he violated the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).

The last meeting of the council of ministers was held on April 30.A senior functionary who did not wish to be named indicated that the meeting is likely to discuss how the vaccination drive is gaining pace across the country.“The prime minister might also apprise the ministers of the recent relief packages announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and ask them to spread the message to the public about the measures taken by the government to mitigate the pain and problems of the people,” the functionary said.Over the past month, a series of review meetings have been chaired by the prime minister to oversee the work undertaken by various ministries in the last two years of the government’s term in office.According to a person aware of the developments, ministers who gave presentations on the achievements of their respective sectors were also asked to provide details of the key schemes that will require additional funding.“There are many schemes that require more funding but with the additional pressure on resources because of the pandemic, there is a need to rationalise the allocation. The review exercise also sought to assess which of the social schemes have scope for further enhancement,” the person cited above said.Wednesday’s meeting also comes in the wake of speculation that a cabinet expansion is on the cards.Modi also held meetings with chief ministers of various states, including the election-bound states of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand where the BJP is in power.The Union government has been on an overdrive to dispel perceptions about its lack of preparation for the second wave of the pandemic. Severe shortages of essential medical care including oxygen, drugs and hospital beds were reported from across the country, exposing the deficiencies in the healthcare system.Amid fears that these deficiencies may cast a shadow on the forthcoming set of assembly elections in seven states, the BJP has begun preparations to change the perception on the ground.On Saturday, party national president JP Nadda chaired a meeting with several Union ministers, national general secretaries of the party and senior party members to tick-tock other parties’ preparation for the anticipated third wave. The meeting also discussed how coordination between the party and the government can be improved so as to create more awareness about the social welfare schemes and the steps taken by the government to offer relief during the second wave.With the economy and employment taking a hit in the wake of the pandemic, the government has stepped up efforts to provide relief. On Monday, Sitharaman announced eight new schemes to boost the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-to-review-vaccine-drive-with-council-of-ministers-today-101624992557706.html

Health minister M Subramanian on Tuesday said that it will be set up in Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University located in Chennai to study Covid-19 variants. After holding a review meeting on Tuesday with the institution’s senior members, including vice-chancellor Dr Sudha Seshayyan, the minister told reporters, “This is already a nationally accredited microbiology and immunology lab, and soon it will function to research on the Delta Plus variant.” The university is currently researching diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, HIV and leptospirosis. Tamil Nadu has reported nine Delta plus variant cases so far. “Having a lab of our own will give us better advantages,” he said. The state has already written to ICMR to set up the lab. The union health ministry had also written to the state to take immediate measures as the Delta plus variant is of concern due to its characteristics of being highly transmissible and stronger bonding to lung cells’ receptors. The union had also asked the state to send adequate Covid-19 positive samples to INSACOG, a consortium of designated labs for whole-genome sequencing. Since the second wave saw a high prevalence of more transmissible variants associated with reinfection and vaccine breakthrough cases, Tamil Nadu began the exercise to identify the variants circulating in the state. The state has sent a total of 1,159 samples to Bengaluru-based lab InStem for whole-genome sequencing. Results from 772 samples showed that the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) was the most commonly reported in 556 samples (72%), followed by the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant in 65 samples (8.4%). The Delta Plus variant of SARS CoV-2 was reported among Delta strains. The samples are of positive cases taken between December 2020 and May 2021 in Tamil Nadu.

On June 23, Alipiri police in Tirupati found the charred body of the woman in a suitcase in bushes near Sri Venkata Ramana Ruia (SVRR) government general hospital. With the help of forensic experts, police identified the body as that of M Bhuvaneshwari, from Ramasamudram village in Chittoor district. Police said she was working as a software engineer with an IT company in Hyderabad. Alipiri circle inspector Devendra Kumar said the woman, along with her husband M Srikanth Reddy, from Badwel in Kadapa district, and their 18-month-old daughter, had been residing in Tirupati for the last three months due to Covid-19 pandemic. According to the police, the video footage obtained from the CCTV cameras showed Reddy entering the apartment complex with a red suitcase and after sometime, leaving the apartment, rolling it along, and carrying his daughter in one hand. The CCTV camera footage also showed him moving around the hospital area in cab. Police picked up the cab driver, who confessed to have helped Reddy in disposing the body. “We have launched the manhunt for Srikanth Reddy, who had been absconding since the incident happened. We are yet to gather complete details about him,” Kumar told HT. Preliminary investigations have revealed that Reddy, also a techie, lost his job during the pandemic, which led to frequent quarrels between the wife and husband. “He might have killed Bhuvaneshwari in a fit of rage during an argument,” a police officer said. Before absconding, Reddy told his wife’s family that she died of Covid-19 and hospital authorities conducted the last rites as per protocol, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/burnt-body-of-woman-found-in-a-bag-police-on-lookout-for-husband-in-andhra-101624992017563.html
30-06-2021||India||Andhra govt to merge anganwadis with schools||Hyderabad: The Andhra Pradesh government has decided to do away with anganwadi centres in rural areas and merge them with pre-primary and primary schools to form “Foundation Schools”, with effect from the current academic year, people aware of the development said. Anganwadi centres, set up under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme of the central government way back in 1975, have been functioning as rural childcare centres, providing health care facilities and nutritious food to children up to six years of age, besides taking up non-formal pre-school teaching. According to a senior official from the state women development and child welfare department, a total of 55,607 anganwadi centres with the total strength of 870,000 children are currently functional in Andhra Pradesh. Of these, 11,448 anganwadis are located within the premises of local schools. The state government has been providing nutritious food to children from the age of seven months to six years in these anganwadis. “Now, all these anganwadi centres will be converted into Foundation Schools, which comprise pre-primary classes, Class 1 and Class 2. They will teach Telugu and English, besides moral science, teamwork and self-awareness,” the official said on Tuesday. The proposal was discussed at a convergence meeting of the school education and women development and child welfare departments convened by chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy in May. At the meeting, it was decided to bring anganwadi workers into the teaching stream at the foundation schools. Officials also proposed to the chief minister that as per the Centre guidelines, anganwadi teachers would have to study diploma courses in teaching methods where they are taught easy ways to teach children. “They would be absorbed into the education department as special grade teachers through promotions,” the official said. As regards health-related activities of anganwadi centres, which are being taken care of by anganwadi workers, it was proposed that all these activities be brought under YSR Village Clinics and urban clinics being set up by the state. The health, nutrition awareness, health screening, vaccination for immunisations and referral services, presently being looked after by anganwadi centres, will be shifted to YSR Village Clinics, the official added. It was also decided that classes 3, 4 and 5 of primary schools will be transferred to nearby upper primary schools and high schools. The upper primary schools will be converted into high schools. At the meeting, the chief minister suggested that all foundation schools should be set up within one kilometre‌ radius of villages and high schools should be within three km radius so as to reduce the transportation cost of students, the official said. Meanwhile, the state government’s proposal to merge anganwadis with foundation schools triggered protests from anganwadi workers. “The proposed changes have created a lot of insecurity among us. The government has not made it clear on what basis these changes are being made without any prior notice,” K Subbaravamma, general secretary, Andhra Pradesh Anganwadi Workers and Helpers Union, told HT. She said the anganwadi workers were extending six different types of services including neo-natal care and prevention of malnutrition, but not just pre-school education. “The merger of anganwadi centres with pre-schools is against the spirit of the ICDS project,” Subbaravamma said. The official quoted above, however, said the CM had given a clear instruction to the officials that not a single employee of anganwadi centres should be laid off. “There is no closure of any anganwadi centres, but they are only being merged with the foundation schools as part of the reforms in the education system,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-govt-to-merge-anganwadis-with-schools-101624991957664.html
30-06-2021||India||Kerala HC stays demolition of houses close to sea in Lakshadweep||The Kerala High Court on Tuesday stayed the demolition of houses and structures in Lakshadweep situated close to the sea for flouting coastal norms. People living in at least 100 houses were served notices by the island administration, and aggrieved parties later moved the court. In their petition, two residents of Kavaratti said since the sea was their main source of living, they have been staying close to it for years, and the order to demolish their dwellings was illegal and arbitrary. They were served notices last month saying that their structures were against the integrated island management plan, and they lie within 20 metres from the high tide line. NEED QUOTE HEREBut petitioners contended that all dwellings were constructed before the enactment of the island management plan which came later and cannot be applied retrospectively. They also argued that a special permit was not required to construct any building on their land, that the notices were arbitrary and with ulterior motives. and that the notices were a clear infringement of the rights of scheduled tribes. About 90% of the island’s population are Muslims and they come under the scheduled tribe category. The administration cited many existing laws to buttress its point and said most of the buildings under notice were constructed illegally and against the integrated island management plan. After hearing both sides, a single bench of Justice Raja Vijayaraghavan stayed all proceedings till further notice. Last week, the high court stayed two other controversial orders of administrator Praful Khoda Patel relating to the closure of dairy farms and exclusion of meat from the midday meal scheme.Residents of the island have been protesting against some of the regulations brought by the new administrator for more than a month, saying they will dilute their customs and traditions. They are up in arms against the draft Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation (2021) that proposes to develop the islands as a major tourist destination, proposed goonda act and plan to ban cow slaughter on the island. Meanwhile, filmmaker Aisha Sultana who returned to Kochi, after being questioned for five days by the Lakshadweep police, in connection with a sedition, said she will continue her fight for the self-respect and identity of the island people. Talking to a news channel, Sultana said she will make a movie on her experience. A sedition case was slapped on her by the island police for calling the administrator a bioweapon during a panel discussion on a news channel. Later, the Kerala High Court had granted her anticipatory bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-stays-demolition-of-houses-close-to-sea-in-lakshadweep-101624991897619.html
30-06-2021||India||Madras HC questions TN govt over panel on NEET||The Madras high court has ordered notice on a petition moved by the state BJP unit challenging the former justice A K Rajan-headed committee, constituted by the new Tamil Nadu government, to study the impact of the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) on students from socially backward classes. The court has directed the state to respond in a week and the union government is also at liberty to submit its stance on the issue. The interim orders were passed by the first bench, comprising chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy on a writ petition filed by BJP’s state general secretary Karu Nagarajan, seeking to quash the order that constituted the 9-member committee. The court took note of the plea that there isn’t much room for the state to look for an alternative in the light of the Supreme Court’s August 2017 judgement (in the case of R Nakkiran versus the state of Tamil Nadu) that directed the state to implement NEET. The justice Rajan committee had also sought suggestions and objections from the public before June 26 on the matter. The plea had stated that the committee is ‘arbitrary, illegal, unconstitutional and unreasonable. Advocate general R Shunmugasundaram submitted that the move was backed by the party’s election manifesto as well as people’s demands. NEET is an emotional issue in the state where several students died by suicide either due to failure in the exam or due to fear of failure. Before NEET came into Tamil Nadu in 2017, entrance to medical colleges was based on class-12 marks. The state is of the view that medical aspirants from rural and poor backgrounds were discriminated against by competing with other students, who could afford coaching for NEET from top institutions. The previous AIADMK regime had introduced a horizontal reservation of 7.5% for government school students who cleared NEET for admissions into medical colleges.The case has been posted to next Monday.Health minister M Subramanian accused the BJP of double speak. Last week chief minister M K Stalin stated that the DMK and AIADMK were on the same page on the issue and asked the BJP in the assembly if they will lend their voice when Tamil Nadu seeks an exemption from NEET. The national party’s legislative party leader Nainar Nagendran responded that they would support a decision taken through legal means. “Nainar Nagendran said that they will support any legal decision but, in a contradiction, they have filed a writ petition against it which shows their double speak to the whole world,” Subramanian told reporters. He added that the AIADMK, which leads the NDA alliance, should also make clear its stand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-hc-questions-tn-govt-over-panel-on-neet-101624991717570.html

30-06-2021||India||India records large deficiency as monsoon enters break phase: IMD||The country recorded a “large deficiency” of rain on Tuesday, which was 60% less than normal, due to the ‘break monsoon’ period that began on Monday, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The shortfall was 43% between Monday and Tuesday.The southwest monsoon has weakened in the past week, or taken a ‘break’, as weather scientists put it.“The models indicate that a very weak or break monsoon period will continue till July 5. Such a phase is part of the monsoon’s internal dynamics. Sometimes it’s in an active phase and sometimes it moves over to a very subdued phase. We can predict these fluctuations,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences.Experts say the ‘break monsoon’ phase happens when the monsoon has already covered the entire country. “The monsoon trough moves to the foothills and wind flow is mostly westerly, there is little contribution from Bay of Bengal and hence little convective activity. During break monsoon phases, rains are limited to northeast India. But this time the trough is not near the Himalayan foothills, but the monsoon flow itself has weakened,” said O P Sreejith, head, climate monitoring and prediction group, IMD.IMD thinks the monsoon will remain “extremely subdued” till at least July 5. “We do not have model outputs for dates ahead of that. There is no indication of any low-pressure area developing over the Bay of Bengal before July 10. Low-pressure systems help monsoon advance, but other factors could also help,” said R K Jenamani, senior scientist at national weather forecasting centre, IMD.Scientists had predicted this last week. “Up to the first week of July, there are no indications of monsoon reviving. The cross-equatorial flow has weakened, and the pressure gradient is less. Normally, monsoon flow moves from high-pressure to low-pressure areas. The monsoon current itself has weakened, so its onset is unlikely over the remaining parts of the country till it revives,” Sreejith had said on June 26.Overall, the country has recorded 13% excess rain since June 1 with 3 of 36 subdivisions recording “large excess” (60% or more), 15 recording “excess” (20% to 59%), 11 recording “normal” (-19% to 19%), and seven recording “deficient” rain (-59% to -20%).“We expect monsoon rains to be only 10 to 12% excess for June. In July, the normal thresholds also increase because normally more rain is recorded in July, but let’s see how monsoon makes up for the gap,” Jenamani added.The northern limit of southwest monsoon (NLM) continues to pass through Barmer, Bhilwara, Dholpur, Aligarh, Meerut, Ambala, and Amritsar. It has been at the same position for a week now.“Prevailing meteorological conditions, large scale atmospheric features and the forecast wind pattern by dynamic models suggest that no favourable conditions are likely to develop for further advance of southwest monsoon into the remaining parts of Rajasthan, west Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Punjab during the next five days,” IMD said in its bulletin on Tuesday.Subdued rain is very likely to prevail over northwest, central and western parts of Peninsular India during the next five days. Isolated/scattered thunderstorms accompanied by lightning and rain are also likely over these regions during this period.Under the influence of strong moisture-laden southwesterly winds, widespread rain is very likely over Bihar, West Bengal, Sikkim and the other northeastern states in the next five days.Subsequently, moist easterly winds are likely to pick up in strength, causing enhanced rain all along the Himalayan foothills of north Bihar, north Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand from July 1 to 3, leading to increased inflow into the rivers originating or flowing through these regions. Isolated heavy to very heavy rain is very likely over Uttarakhand and the Himalayan foothills of east Uttar Pradesh during July 1 to 3.Strong surface winds, with speeds reaching 20-30 km/hr, are likely to blow over Haryana and west Uttar Pradesh on June 30 and July 1.Moderate to severe thunderstorms accompanied by frequent cloud-to-ground lightning are very likely over Bihar, Jharkhand and Gangetic West Bengal during the next 24 hours. IMD warned that this could cause serious harm to both people and animals staying outdoors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-records-large-deficiency-as-monsoon-enters-break-phase-imd-101624991177581.html
30-06-2021||India||Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha told to prepare for a ‘normal session’||New Delhi: The union government has asked Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to prepare for a “normal session” of Parliament that is likely to begin from third week of July, two officials familiar with the matter said.“The tentative schedule of the session is from July 19 to August 13. The Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary affairs, headed by defence minister Rajnath Singh will meet to decide the schedule,” said said one of the people cited above, who asked not to be named. The communication to the presiding officers was sent three days ago.The last three Parliament sessions were cut short due to the coronavirus disease pandemic, with the winter session in both Houses being skipped altogether. HT reported on June 8 that the session is likely be held in July, the normal schedule of the monsoon session, quoting a top functionary.The second official added that an ebbing second wave of the pandemic coupled with the full vaccination of more than 75% of the MPs (across both houses) means that a full session could be conducted as per the usual schedule.Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla recently told HT that the upcoming session will follow usual Covid safety protocols, but that vaccination will not be a pre-requisite for attendance. The last session saw mandatory and regular RT-PCR tests.At least 40 bills and five ordinances are awaiting Parliament’s approval and a normal session that usually lasts for a month, can give the government enough room to push through its legislative agenda. The Opposition too, can demand discussion on issues that could not be accomodated in the past few session due to paucity of time. “Subjects such as the economic situation, vaccination policy, spiraling price rise and fuel price hike are some that we want to take up,” a senior Opposition leader said on condition of anonymity.Five ordinances are currently in force. The Homoeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Ordinance, The Indian Medicine Central Council (Amendment) Ordinance, The Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Ordinance, The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance and The Tribunals Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance need to be replaced with bills as the Indian Constitution gives a window of only six weeks from the beginning of a parliament session after ordinances are rolled out.The second wave of the pandemic has now seen a steady drop for seven consecutive weeks in the country. The seven-day average of new infections touched a peak of 391,819 new cases a day on May 9, has dropped to 48,423 cases a day in the past week, a drop of over 88% from the peak.The rate of vaccinations, meanwhile, has picked up pace with the introduction of a new vaccine policy starting June 21. Between June 21 and June 28, nearly six million doses of the vaccine were administered across the country every day on average – the highest ever. Till Tuesday evening, 56.3 million Indians had received both doses of the vaccine and another 211 million had received one dose. That means around 28.5% of the eligible population (those over the age of 18 years) has received at least one shot of the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ls-rs-told-to-prepare-for-a-normal-session-101624991117625.html
30-06-2021||India||After protests over ‘forced conversion’, Sikh woman married within community||An 18 year-old Sikh woman from Srinagar, whose alleged abduction and forced conversion to Islam sparked protests in Kashmir, married a man from her faith at a ceremony arranged by her parents and community leaders on Tuesday.The woman, who was sent to her family after she appeared in court on Sunday, married Sukhbir Singh, also from Srinagar, said Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) Delhi unit president Paramjit Singh.“I met the family of the girl. This issue was settled today. The girl was married by her family to a person she wanted. She knew the person,” Singh said. He also refuted reports of the woman’s marriage to her alleged abductor, a 29-year-old Muslim man.The woman was not available for comment, and it was unclear whether she had converted to Islam, or acted out of her free will. The man is in police remand till July 1. His family could not be reached for comment.The controversy broke on Saturday after the woman’s family filed an abduction complaint and protests sparked largely helmed by SAD leaders. On Tuesday, a delegation led by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader RP Singh met Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy in Delhi.“The delegation submitted a memorandum about the alleged forced conversion and wedding of Sikh girls in Kashmir. I will discuss the matter with the Union home minister (Amit Shah) about the action that is required to be taken,” said Reddy.But in Srinagar, local leaders appeared to dial down the intensity of the protests, calling for communal harmony and saying that they did not want any anti-conversion law.“The majority community has to take care of the minority community. A law can’t do it but only mutual love and brotherhood can do it,” Paramjit Singh said. Sikhs form roughly 2% of the population of Jammu and Kashmir.He also condemned the statements made by some leaders and reached out to the Muslim community. “Although I have no concern with them but since a Sikh came from Delhi and gave a statement, I apologise for that…we also met people from Mirwaiz (Umar Farooq) and Muslim organisations. The way all of them collaborated with us, we won’t forget that for the rest of our lives,” he said.On Monday, SAD leader and Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee chief Manjinder Singh Sirsa alleged that four Sikh women were forcibly married and converted to Islam in Kashmir.Kashmir divisional commissioner Pandurang K Pole said that he has no information on the issue.“I will have to find out how much truth is in these claims,” he said.At least one of these four women approached the Jammu and Kashmir high court in May, seeking protection from family and police and saying that she changed her religion and married a Muslim man willingly.The court granted Viran Pal Lour, who became Khadeeja after marrying Manzoor Ahmad Bhat on January 20 this year as per Islamic rituals, police protection.In a statement, Mutahida Majlis-e-Ulema, a prominent Islamic religious body headed by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, refuted the claims of forced conversion.The chairman of All Parties Sikh Coordination Committee, Jagmohan Singh Raina, said that outsiders were trying to provoke the situation. “There were many wrong statements like claims of abduction at gun point and other things. Many outsiders have exploited the situation rather for their vested interest,” he said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-protests-over-forced-conversion-sikh-woman-married-within-community-101624991057568.html
30-06-2021||India||Govt apathy to migrants unpardonable, says Supreme Court||Citing the tribulations of the migrant workers during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Supreme Court on Tuesday held that “the apathy and lackadaisical attitude by the ministry of labour and employment is unpardonable”, and directed the Centre to make the national portal for registration of unrecognised workers operational by July 31 so that various benefits could flow to the marginalised section.The bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and MR Shah also ordered all states and Union territories to implement the “One Nation One Ration Card” scheme by July 31 to help beneficiaries, especially migrant workers, to avail of subsidised food commodities from anywhere in the country.The court, which passed a slew of directives in the matter registered suo motu (on its own motion) to ameliorate the miseries of the migrant workers affected by the pandemic, took a stern view that the national portal for the registration of unorganised workers remained in limbo even after 30 months of the central government’s assurance to the Supreme Court on making the facility fully functional by the end of 2018.Relying on a survey by the National Statistics Office (NSO) in 2017-2018 that reckoned the number of persons in the unorganised sector as 380 million and 94% of the total workforce, the bench bemoaned the fact that unrecognised workers might have failed to avail of the benefits available to them under the laws during the pandemic because of the laxity by the Union labour ministry in operationalising the portal for registration under the National Database for Unorganised Workers project.“When the unorganised workers are waiting for registration, and are waiting to reap the benefit of various welfare schemes of the states and the Centre, the apathy and lackadaisical attitude by the ministry of labour and employment is unpardonable. There was urgency in the portal to be finalised and implemented looking at the pandemic and dire need of unorganised workers to receive the benefit,” regretted the bench, adding that registration was the first step to grant benefits to migrant workers.“The attitude of the ministry of labour and employment in not completing the module even though directed as early as on August 21, 2018 shows that ministry is not alive to the concern of the migrant workers and the non-action of the ministry is strongly disapproved,” maintained the court as it rejected a request by the ministry to give it at least three months more to operationalise the portal.It directed the secretary, ministry of labour, to ensure that the national portal commences by July 31, and called for a compliance report by the end of August. The court also asked states and Union territories to cooperate with the Centre and upload the data of the workers on the portal “at the earliest, but not later than December 31, 2021”. It further directed states and Union territories to register all establishments and license all contractors who must furnish particulars of the migrant workers employed with them.Shortly after the nationwide lockdown was imposed last year, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers spilled out on the to the highways, walking and cycling hundreds of kilometres back to their homes in the hinterlands. Many went without food for days, boarded packed trains back to their homes, faced hostility and bias as ‘outsiders’ and perished on the way. Their plight prompted the Union and state governments to set up relief measures. On the implementation of One Nation One Ration Card scheme, the court called it “an important citizen centric reform” to extend food security to migrants who were covered under the National Food Security Act Scheme as it emphasised that providing food security to impoverished persons was the bounden duty of all states and governments.“When migrant workers are spread throughout the country, each state has to implement the scheme, which is a necessary welfare measure towards food security to this class of persons. The states are duty-bound to implement this scheme, which is a welfare scheme in the interest of poor and marginal sections of the society,” said the court, directing all states to implement the scheme by July 31 so that nobody is denied ration for not being in his native state.According to the Centre’s submissions in the apex court, three states -- West Bengal, Assam and Chhatisgarh -- were yet to implement the scheme, while Delhi had not implemented it fully. The scheme is currently functional in 32 states and Union territories and allows eligible beneficiaries to get food grain under the National Food Security Act from fair price shops across India without securing a new ration card.In other directives, the bench told the states to frame proper schemes for distributing dry ration to migrant workers who may not have ration cards while obligating the Union government to allocate additional foodgrains in terms of demands made by the states. Community kitchens, the court said, must also continue till the pandemic prolongs. The court noted as many as 2.8 crore were identified as migrant workers by the states during the first Covid-19 wave and that dry ration should be made available to them.About the coverage of rural and urban population under National Food Security Act, 2013, the court noted that state-wise coverage was determined by the then Planning Commission (now Niti Aayog) by using the household consumption survey data for 2011-2012 and if a fresh survey were to be carried out now, number of beneficiaries would go up drastically benefitting the large number of eligible persons.The bench urged the central government to carry out a fresh survey to redetermine the total number of people to be covered under the rural and urban areas of the states so that more persons eligible for the benefits under the act could also be covered.At the same time, the court refused to issue any directive to the Union or the state governments to implement direct bank transfer to the migrant workers. “The direct bank transfer, being matter of policy and being in domain of the state, no direction can be issued by this court. We only observe that in event any person is entitled for direct bank transfer as per the existing scheme in any state, he can avail the said benefit by the mechanism as provided in the policy decision,” it held.With these directions, the bench drew the curtains on the public interest case that it had registered last year and passed orders from time to time.Meanwhile HT also reached out to the labour ministry for a comment over the current status of this registration portal. DPS Negi, Director General of labor bureau, the data arm of the ministry, said that the issue of registration portal pertains to the Labour Welfare Department. Director General Labor Welfare Department, Ajay Tiwari did not respond to the repeated calls from HT.HT also talked to Union Labour and Employment Minister Santosh Gangwar over the issue.Gangwar said that he does not have the immediate knowledge of the directions that Supreme Court has given, however, he assured that the ministry will abide by all these directions. He added that he would review the status of the registration portal tomorrow and update HT with the details on it. The story will be updated after a response from the minister.“We had floated tenders to implement the scheme twice, but no bidder could be selected due to technical issues. That’s why the scheme got delayed in Assam. We have finally zeroed in on one bidder after the third tender. Negotiations are underway with the latest bidder, and we are confident of launching the scheme soon,” said a senior government officer on condition of anonymity.West Bengal food and supplies minister, Rathin Ghosh could not be contacted but a senior officer of the department said on condition of anonymity that the government has started the paperwork for implementing the “One Nation One Ration Card” scheme. “Chief minister Mamata Banerjee announced on June 14 at the state secretariat that the Bengal government will implement it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-apathy-to-migrants-unpardonable-says-sc-101624991058214.html
30-06-2021||India||Violence after Bengal polls was premeditated: Report||A fact finding team set up by a civil society initiative, Call for Justice, has said in its report that the simultaneous beginning of violence across villages and towns in West Bengal hours after the poll verdict came in were “not sporadic but premeditated, organised and conspiratorial” , a finding that is likely to open a new front in the ongoing hostilities between the state’s ruling Trinamool Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government.The committee, headed by former chief Justice of the Sikkim High Court Permod Kohli, and comprising former chief secretary of Kerala, Ananda Bose, former DGP of Jharkhand, Nirmal Kaur, past president of ICSI Nisar Ahmed and former additional chief secretary of Karnataka, M Madan Gopal submitted its report to minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy on Wednesday. HT has seen a copy of the report.The BJP has alleged its workers and supporters have been the target of post-poll violence in West Bengal and has accused the TMC government in the state of failing to take action against the perpetrators of the crimes.The TMC says the BJP is a sore loser and has been building a narrative against it.The BJP expected to unseat the TMC and win over 200 seats in the state but could manage only 77. The TMC has alleged that action by enforcement agencies against its leaders since, the Governor’s ongoing criticism of the way the state is run, and proceedings against the state’s former chief secretary initiated by the Union government are all motivated by this loss.The report echoes the Union government and BJP’s position about “demographic changes in border districts” on account of the state’s “porous borders” with Bangladesh, and the resulting “increase in unlawful activities in these areas”. It calls for an investigation by the National Investigation Agency into the post-poll violence in this context. It also seeks the creation of an “empowered committee... to study the demographic changes that have taken place over the past few decades, specifically in the border districts”.“The Home Ministry will study the report and will try to implement its recommendations,” Reddy told reporters after the group submitted the report to him.The report also criticises the state’s police (“victims who gathered courage and went to the police were either turned away or asked to settle the matter with the culprits”) and says many people left “their homes in villages for safer destinations, to shelter camps within and outside the state.” It puts on record the state government’s silence in sharing its views on the post poll violence with the committee.“These are some wild allegations raised by a team, the members of which have no connection with Bengal. They have done what they have been instructed to do. The reality is somewhat different. There were some incidents of post-poll violence after May 2, till the time, when law and order was with the ECI. Even TMC workers were killed during that period. Ever since Mamata Banerjee took charge on May 5 there has been no such incidents. On the contrary there is a split in the BJP as the leaders are nowhere to be seen. BJP workers are now feeling ashamed of what they have said and done on the orders of their leaders,” said Kunal Ghosh, TMC spokesperson.The committee has also asked for a special relief package to be declared by the state government that includes resettlement and rehabilitation and interdisciplinary proceedings against “delinquent officers” who failed to discharge the duties in protecting lives and destruction of properties.In an address to party workers in Bengal on Tuesday, BJP president JP Nadda said, “The report says the violence was a well-planned conspiracy and criminals were involved with political workers. It says men were killed and women raped. Elections were held in so many states but nowhere did we witness such violence. Women faced most of the attacks although the chief minister of the state is a woman.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/violence-after-bengal-polls-was-premeditated-report-101624990997564.html
30-06-2021||India||Moderna’s Covid vaccine approved for use in India||India on Tuesday approved the import of US pharmaceutical major Moderna’s mRNA technology-based coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine, paving the way for the entry of the first international vaccine against the infectious disease into the country.On behalf of Moderna, Indian pharmaceutical company Cipla Ltd applied to the country’s drugs regulator, the Drugs Controller General of India, for grant of approval to import the vaccine to India.“An application received from Moderna through an Indian partner of theirs, namely Cipla, has been granted new drug permission for restricted use that is commonly known as emergency use authorisation. This is the first internationally developed vaccine for which now such permission exists today, and this potentially opens up a clear possibility of this vaccine being imported into India in the near future. Let’s see how this opportunity will be used for accessing the vaccine in the country. There must be other formalities that they will have to follow but a very important licensure has been given,” said Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, during the Union health ministry’s media briefing on Covid-19 updates.Also Read| Moderna shares jump to all-time high amid Delta variant fearModerna is donating an unspecified number of doses to India through the World Health Organization (WHO) and Gavi’s COVAX mechanism; Cipla is facilitating this, and the approvals are part of the process. In a statement, Cipla said it is “supporting Moderna with the regulatory approval and importation of vaccines to be donated to India. At this stage, there is no definitive agreement on commercial supplies.” It wasn’t clear how many doses will be imported, and when.An official said the approval was not limited to donations. “Cipla has been given a licence to import, and it is applicable to the Moderna vaccine import in general, under which they are also allowed to distribute it here; since it is still under emergency use authorization retail sale of the product is not allowed. It does not matter whether the doses are a part of some donation or otherwise being exported by the US company, Cipla is now authorized to import the Moderna vaccine,” the official aware of the matter in the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) said on condition of anonymity.“Even though it is totally up to them how much they want to import and when, it is likely that about 7 million doses are imported, and the process should start in next 5-6 days. Moderna has definitely got the first mover advantage...,” the official added.In a statement, Moderna said the government of India issued a registration certificate and a permission to import the Covid-19 vaccine for restricted use in an emergency situation. “I want to thank the government of India for this authorization, which marks an important step forward in the global fight against the pandemic,” a statement by the company’s CEO said.Previously, news reports in May, citing unnamed people, said Cipla was considering spending up to $1 billion to import 50 million doses of the vaccine. HT learns that Cipla has also sought indemnity for the Moderna vaccine, much like other international vaccine makers negotiating their entry into India. The government is yet to take a call on indemnity for any foreign vaccine maker.“Moderna is coming in the ready-to-inject form. There is no manufacturing base as of now, like in case of Sputnik V, but we also hope that in the future, Moderna will produce this vaccine on Indian soil; and make this, therefore, into a made-in-India vaccine. There will be no need for a bridging study that has been already clarified, but recipients of first 100 doses of the vaccine will be closely watched. So, now there are four Covid-19 vaccines approved: Covaxin, Covishield, Sputnik and Moderna; our vaccine basket is now richer by this addition,” Paul added.Also Read| Efficacy against Covid-19, safe for kids?

In normal cold chains, where the temperature is between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius, an unopened vial can stay effective for 30 days.The mRNA vaccines teach human cells how to make a protein, or even just a piece of a protein of the virus, triggering an immune response inside human bodies. The benefit of mRNA vaccines, like all vaccines, is that those vaccinated gain protection without ever having to risk the serious consequences of getting sick with Covid-19.According to the evidence generated through clinical trials, in people aged 18 years and older, the Moderna vaccine was 94.1% effective at preventing laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 infection.Experts welcomed the clearance of an mRNA vaccine.“There are likely going to be small numbers for next many months, so unlikely (to be a) major contribution to public health. But it is very valuable as a process and for a small group of people for whom other vaccines may not work well,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, physician-scientist, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.In early June, after reports of a partnership with Moderna surfaced, Cipla said in a statement that it is “in the process of seeking clarity and guidance from the Government of India for exploring the possible road map for vaccine importation to India.” “At this stage, no definitive terms have been finalized and hence, the Company cannot comment further,” read the company statement.Paul also mentioned during the media briefing that the government was making necessary efforts to also bring in other foreign vaccines to India and that the sticky indemnity issue is under consideration and examination.“Our efforts to invite, and to have other internationally developed vaccines, specifically Pfizer and J&J, continue. Those processes are on, and we are also looking at increased production, and availability, of our own vaccines that are being manufactured already in our country. We look forward to the vaccination programme gaining further momentum.”“We have had multiple sessions with Pfizer; going through the agreements that are required for such an arrangement to be operationalised, and exchange of information and thoughts, and inputs are going back and forth. The process is very much on and we have done an intensive meeting last week. We are looking forward to receiving the feedback from their end now,” he added.In an emailed response, a Pfizer company spokesperson said: “We continue to engage with the government to make our Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine available for use in the country.”A Johnson & Johnson India spokesperson said: “At Johnson & Johnson, we remain fully focused on bringing a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine to people in India. We are in ongoing discussions with the Government of India and are exploring how best to accelerate our ability to deliver our Janssen single dose COVID-19 vaccine to India.”J&J already has a manufacturing tie-up with Biological E, which is also making a protein sub-unit vaccine of its own.To facilitate the entry of foreign made vaccines into India, the government earlier made regulatory modifications.On June 2, the national drugs controller announced that Covid-19 vaccines approved by specific countries and WHO would no longer require post-approval bridging trials and batch testing in India.“If the vaccine has been certified and released by the national control laboratory of certain countries or if it is listed in the WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL), it can be exempted from the aforementioned requirement,” stated a letter issued by CDSCO that is headed by the drugs controller.However, additional scrutiny and review shall continue, DCGI said, and before the vaccine is rolled out for further immunisation programmes, the first 100 beneficiaries shall be assessed for seven days for safety outcomes, along with other procedures for the filing of applications and timelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modernas-covid-vaccine-approved-for-use-in-india-101624990937539.html
30-06-2021||India||Central Vista revamp: New Parl, Vice Prez house will be first to be completed||The vice president’s enclave and the new Parliament House will be the first buildings to be completed, and work on shifting the national museum to the North and South Block will commence last, in the elaborate plan for the Central Vista revamp that requires moving people and offices over the course of the next six years.Documents seen by HT and officials aware of the matter said that the project’s progress and completion is built around finding temporary space on the Vista itself for the people working in buildings that will be renovated.The Central Vista Avenue, for which no staff needs to be relocated, will be completed by December 2021, officials said. They explained that the vice president’s estate, coming up on a corner of Rafi Marg that currently houses hutments and barracks, will be the first to be taken up because offices and people working there are the easiest to relocate (and do not need to be in the Central Vista at all).North and South Block, which house the Union home, finance and defence ministries, apart from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), will be the last to be vacated because these crucial departments will need to be set up in their newly built offices first.It is this carousel of movement – with the aim of minimally disrupting key government work – that will shape the schedule of the ₹13,500 project. A lack of space in Delhi’s power corridor means that buildings need to be vacated in phases, and ministries moved to new structures before tearing down old offices and rebuilding them.“The priority will be to first shift those existing ministries to the new buildings…we will not make the ministries in the North and South Block move twice where they are inconvenienced with moving to temporary accommodations first,” a senior official of the Union housing and urban development ministry said on condition of anonymity.Two other buildings that also don’t need any major structures to be torn down are the new Prime Minister’s residence to come up at a 15 acre plot near South Block, and the New Parliament at plot number 118 of the Parliament House Estate.At the heart of the scheme is the sprawling 25 acre campus of the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) – one of the few large open spaces in Lutyen’s Delhi with roughly 500 employees.IGNCA will be shifted first to Janpath Hotel and then to Jamnagar House by 2023, and the existing buildings at the IGNCA campus torn down to make space for the first three secretariat buildings. They are likely to be ready by May 2023 to receive officials from some major ministries, including those housed at Shastri Bhawan and Krishi Bhawan, though the final schedule is yet to be drawn.These decades-old bhavans will then be rebuilt as modern secretariat buildings and once ready, in the summer of 2024, they will take in more officials from across central Delhi. With each tranche of shifting, more buildings will free up for reconstruction. The final three secretariat buildings will be ready by June 2025, according to people familiar with the matter and official documents.Once all the secretariat buildings are functional – earliest by June 2025 -- work will begin on shifting the North and South Block ministries out of the heritage buildings. Then, the final stage of the Central Vista will commence by shifting antiquities from the National Museum.“We will start the work on that at a much later stage…work will start only after those ministries have been moved to the new common secretariat buildings first,” said the senior ministry official quoted in the first instance.A tentative completion timeline of the central public works department (CPWD) -- the nodal agency for the project -- showed that an underground Automated People Mover (APM) for Union government employees and a central conference centre will be the final two projects to finish by September 2026 and December 2026, respectively.The chief architect for the project, HCP Design, Planning and Management Pvt Ltd, began the work for the site map and retrofitting plan for the North and South Block before the pandemic but it was stalled due to a surge in infections and Covid-induced lockdowns, HT has learnt.“The retrofitting of North and South Block will be executed at a much later phase of the redevelopment. Relocating the ministries that presently function from the North and South Block to the proposed office buildings will be the first step. Detailed documentation and site study will follow to understand and analyse the space and the state of the structure. Specialist consultants will assist us with the retrofitting process,” the firm said.For now, completion schedules are finalised only for the Central Vista Avenue –which comprises Rajpath, leading from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate — and the new Parliament. “The new Parliament building is expected to be completed by the winter session of 2022. Central Vista Avenue is expected to be completed by end of 2021,” HCP said. Earlier, the government had planned to finish the new Parliament in time for India’s 75th Independence Day on August 15, 2022.According to the proposal submitted to the environment ministry last year, around 458,820 square metre of built-up area will need to be demolished. This includes the current building of IGNCA, Shastri Bhavan, Krishi Bhavan, Vigyan Bhavan, vice-president’s residence, National Museum, Jawahar Bhavan, Nirman Bhavan, Udyog Bhavan, Raksha Bhavan and INS Hutments. The main building of the National Archives will not be demolished, but its annexe will be razed.The project to modernise India’s power corridor was first proposed in 2019 but quickly ran into controversy with opposition parties, civil society members and activists first questioning the need for the revamp and later the decision to continue with the project in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic. But the government repeatedly defended the project, saying decades-old buildings were run down and needed a facelift.On May 31, the Delhi high court turned down a petition that sought to halt a part of the redevelopment work and called the Central Vista an “an essential project of national importance”.The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to stay the Delhi high court decision of May 31 which allowed the Central Vista project work in the national capital to go on. The high court had dismissed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) that sought stoppage of construction activity, terming it “motivated”.Under the project, a “Nav Bharat Udyan” is also going to be built on the western banks of Yamuna as part of the Centre’s plan to extend the Central Vista axis from India Gate till the river. It was earlier expected to be unveiled by August 15, 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-vista-revamp-new-parliament-vice-president-s-house-will-be-first-to-be-completed-101624990877593.html
30-06-2021||India||Security huddle over J&K drone sightings||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday chaired a meeting of top ministers to discuss a long pending policy on management of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) or drones and ways to deal with emerging security challenges, said people familiar with developments.The meeting occurred in the backdrop of twin drone attacks at an airforce station in Jammu on Sunday and another thwarted attack in the early hours of Monday. Three army teams reported drone sightings near military installations in Jammu between 1am and 4.30am on Tuesday, indicating terrorist groups could be trying to replicate Sunday’s strike.The meeting in Delhi was attended by Union home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh, civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri and national security adviser Ajit Doval. There was no official communication on what transpired at the meeting.Singh earlier held a meeting with Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria on the National Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) traffic management policy, said one of the persons cited above.Aspects such as airspace management, the regulatory framework for the use of drones, their utility as future delivery systems, air passages in which they can be allowed to operate and security issues were discussed at that meeting, HT has learnt.At the meeting Modi chaired, discussions also touched on the need for a policy to deal with emerging security threats and “non-traditional” strategic challenges, news agency PTI reported.IAF, army and navy are among the key stakeholders in UAS traffic management. Air defence units of IAF are responsible for monitoring all manned and unmanned air operations in the country’s airspace. The task of these units is to ensure all aircraft operations in the country are identified and in line with the details submitted in the flight plans.A little after 1.30am on Sunday, two drones carrying explosives hit the Indian Air Force (IAF) station in Jammu, leaving two personnel injured. The blast at Jammu airport, which is used for VVIP movement and armed forces’ strategic operations, took place at 1.37am, causing minor damage to the roof of a building, and the second one – weaker in intensity – was reported at 1.42am in an open area.Experts said this was the first time drones were used in an attack on a major installation in the country.Two more drones were spotted over the military area around 11.45pm on Sunday and 2.40am on Monday, prompting soldiers to open fire at the devices which flew away.There have been several incidents of Pakistan-based terrorists using drones in the border areas of Jammu and Kashmir to drop arms, ammunition, drugs and money to fuel terrorism in the region. But experts said Sunday’s attack represented a new security threat.Director general of Jammu and Kashmir Police Dilbag Singh told PTI that the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a terror outfit based in Pakistan, is suspected to be responsible for the attack.”In all likelihood, the unmanned aerial vehicles have flown in from across the border and returned after the operation...We are still probing the case and will extend all our findings with other security agencies,” Singh said.On Tuesday, the first drone sighting on Tuesday was reported at 1.08am at Ratnuchak. Two hours later, military personnel at Kaluchak camp 300 metres away spotted the drone at 3.09am and finally at 4.19am, a drone was spotted near Sunjuwan, seven kilometres away. Kaluchak and Ratnuchak are smaller military stations.“The army informed us that they spotted drones over Kaluchak, Ratnuchak and Sunjuwan early Tuesday. We are looking into it,” Jammu’s senior superintendent of police Chandan Kohli said.Discussions on a draft policy on drones have been on for over two years. The draft policy says the integration of UAS into the National Airspace System (NAS) presents a raft of challenges, both technically and operationally. Integrating the UAS operations within the current air traffic management (ATM) systems may bring in the need to equip UAS with additional hardware on board, it adds.The objective of the policy is to enable more types of unmanned aircraft operational scenarios, increase the ease of compliance for the unmanned aviation industry while ensuring safety and security.The ability to identify and track a UAS flying in the Indian airspace will prove to be a very important capability while enabling high density, complex UAS operations, the draft policy states.On March 12 this year, the Centre notified the Unmanned Aircraft System Rules that spell out the terms of usage of drones by individuals and businesses apart from laying down the ground rules for research, testing, production, and import of such vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/security-huddle-over-j-k-drone-sightings-101624990818290.html
30-06-2021||India||Delhi: SC dismisses plea against work on Central Vista redevelopment||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed an appeal against a Delhi High Court ruling that allowed construction work at the Central Vista Redevelopment Project during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and endorsed a ₹1 lakh penalty imposed by the high court on the petitioners.“If Covid-19 was of concern, how would one project alone be the concern of the petitioners,” a three-judge bench of the top court headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar said.The top court echoed the high court’s 31 May order that described the petition by Anya Malhotra, a translator, and Sohail Hashmi, a historian and documentary filmmaker as “motivated” since the plea did not raise objections about construction at other sites.“The impression before the high court is fortified before us that as a PIL (public interest litigation) petitioner, did you conduct your research about other similar construction projects in the city? You were selective about this one project only. The high court says it is a motivated petition as you have insisted upon the closure of one public project and not any other.”The bench said the view taken by the Delhi High Court “is a possible view” and that the “challenge” was “untenable as the petitioners have not pointed out as public-spirited persons, whether the petitioner made any enquiries about other public projects in the city.”The Central Vista Avenue Redevelopment project is part of the larger Central Vista project, which includes construction of a new Parliament building, Central government offices, including a common Central Secretariat, a new residence for the Prime Minister and the Vice President, and central conference facilities.On behalf of the petitioners, senior advocate Siddharth Luthra submitted that the petition did not seek a complete stoppage of work. Luthra said their only aim was to highlight a public health and safety issue as on May 3, when the petition was filed before the high court, the positivity rate in Delhi was 29.74% and the average number of daily deaths was around 353 a day.“Since it (construction work) had the potential of being a super spreader activity, on account of the to and fro movement of the workers from the site to their accommodation at Sarai Kale Khan, Karol Bagh, Kalkaji, Nizamuddin etc., it was posing a grave risk to the health and safety of the workers and the residents of Delhi,” the petition said.Luthra stated that according to Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) guidelines that came into effect from April 19, only those construction activities were permitted that provided on-site accommodation for workers. This was lacking in the case of the Central Vista project, Luthra pointed out, stressing that the same was arranged subsequently.“When the petition was filed, the project was non-compliant with DDMA regulations,” the senior lawyer said.The bench, also comprising justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Aniruddha Bose, asked Luthra if he should have proceeded once the project managers complied with the guidelines. “If you are a public-oriented person, once there is a compliance report, should you pursue the petition so vigorously. Once it comes on record that the project is compliant, you must end there.”Luthra submitted that the high court was free to give a finding on merits, but the scathing observations affected the reputation of petitioners and the cost imposed had a chilling effect on citizens’ right to question the actions of the government. The bench observed, “Genuine PILs have done wonders but questionable PILs have caused problems to our (judicial) system. PIL has its own sanctity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-sc-dismisses-plea-against-work-on-central-vista-redevelopment-101624988658121.html

30-06-2021||Today's||A century later, the Chinese Communist Party is at the crossroads||The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is celebrating its grand centenary on July 1. Founded by Bolshevik Russia-inspired Chinese Marxists in Shanghai in 1921 amid the chaos of China’s post-imperial fragmentation, the CCP survived, seized power, restored order, outlasted its mentor, the Soviet Communist Party, and became the arbiter of the destiny of not just China, but in some ways, of the world.So daunting were the early challenges to the Party from a plethora of opposing armed political factions that only two out of the thirteen delegates who attended the first CCP Congress in 1921 lived to see the proclamation of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949. One of them was Mao Zedong, whose ruthless beliefs that “a revolution is not a dinner party” and that “political power grows out of the barrel of a gun” gave the CCP an edge over its competitors. When Mao’s PRC was established in 1949, it was through such a bloody process against all odds that the new State’s outlook was militaristic and hostile. Following in the footsteps of Vladimir Lenin’s “revolutionary terror”, Mao never hesitated to brutally safeguard his revolution and forcibly transform “backward” China through the catastrophic Great Leap Forward (1958-1962) and Cultural Revolution (1966-1976). Tens of millions of Chinese perished in these social re-engineering experiments, laying bare contradictions between the CCP’s motto — “serve the people” — and the people’s unwillingness to be railroaded and sacrificed at the altar of the Party’s ambitions.Despite Mao’s colossal errors, the CCP hung on to power during its first three ruling decades due to sustained State repression and the aura of the 1949 revolution. After Mao, the Party could not count on prolonging its rule without drastic reforms. In came Deng Xiaoping, who embarked on the “second revolution” that saved the CCP from decline and decay.The economic liberalisation Deng introduced in the 1980s was an unprecedented experiment in State-guided capitalism, reliant on foreign investment from the West. Although this was a far cry from Maoist dogma, flexibility had been a hallmark of the CCP’s history throughout. Before 1945, it partnered with arch adversary, the Kuomintang (KMT), against imperial Japan, and in the early 1970s it aligned with the capitalist United States (US) to thwart the communist Soviet Union. Pragmatic adjustments at timely junctures explain the resilience of the CCP.Yet, there is an intransigent core which has been key to the CCP’s self-preservation. When the Soviet Communist Party imploded in 1991, many expected the CCP to follow. But Deng and his successors never let up on authoritarian tendencies for fear of losing control. The CCP’s merciless crackdown during the Tiananmen Square uprising in 1989, and its campaigns of harsh suppression of ethnic minorities in Tibet, Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, were justified as necessary for the Party to sustain its rule. China’s “modernisation” under the Party came at a heavy human and ecological cost. Since becoming the CCP’s boss in 2012, President Xi Jinping has re-tightened control over civil society and the private sector, and launched a ferocious disciplinary clampdown against corruption by “tigers and flies” in the Party. Xi has revived glorification of Mao by imposing “a correct view of history” and resurrected China’s ancient Confucian values and imperial traditions — a mix of old and new — to consolidate his power and propel China’s rise to the centrestage in world politics.A coldblooded politician like Mao, Xi has amended China’s constitution to indefinitely remain at the helm. His “Chinese Dream” comprises achievement of two centenaries – a “moderately well-off society” by the CCP’s centenary in 2021, and a “fully developed nation” and “strong country” by the PRC’s centenary in 2049. In February 2021, Xi declared that China had accomplished the “arduous task of eradicating extreme poverty”. With sights set on the 2049 milestone, he has launched audacious international projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and flexed military muscle against rival nations. Can the CCP carry on as China’s almighty institution until 2049 and beyond? Sinologists Minxin Pei and David Shambaugh assess that Xi is overplaying his hand and setting the CCP up for doom. Multiple contradictions are arising between a Party operating under Xi’s megalomaniacal cult of personality and a fast-changing, relatively well-off Chinese society that will not willingly accept neo-Maoist propaganda or be satisfied with grandiose nationalistic visions of China as the number one power in the world.The fate of the CCP also depends on the wary international community. The global backlash against China’s mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic and its human rights abuses, and the intent of the US and its partners to halt China’s push for global hegemony, indicate harder times ahead. Xi warned the CCP in 2020 of a “period of turbulence” when “we will face more and more headwinds in the external environment.” Still, like his hero Mao who steered the Party through extreme difficulties in its formative decades, Xi welcomes a fight and thrives on confrontation.After 72 uninterrupted years in power and no immediate threat to overthrow it, the CCP can congratulate itself as the most successful communist party in history that single-mindedly converted a weak and poor China into a technologically advanced superpower. But if the CCP forgets its past and fails to reform once again, the “third revolution” of Xi Jinping could be the Party’s swansong.

30-06-2021||Today's||Lessons from the AIDS epidemic to help India fight Covid-19 equitably||In a recent address at the international AIDS society to mark 40 years since HIV was first reported, Dr Anthony Fauci juxtaposed the chronic AIDS crisis with the contemporary Covid-19 pandemic. Fauci, who spearheaded global health interventions even during AIDS, noted that in the four decades, 76 million people had been infected by HIV in contrast to one year of Covid-19 which saw more than 91 million infections. In terms of fatalities, 2% of those with Covid-19 succumbed to the disease, whereas 43% of people died of AIDS and other HIV-related illnesses.Reiterating the urgency of ending HIV, Fauci acknowledged the debt Covid-19 vaccinologists owed to decades of ongoing HIV research. Nearly 90% of Covid-19 vaccines developed at a record pace today used diagnostics, animal models and clinical trials networks from previously “unsuccessful” HIV vaccine trials. HIV genomic sequencing also inspired stabilising the Sars-CoV-2 “spike protein” resulting in “maximal immunogenicity”, crucial for efficacious vaccines today.India, with the third-largest HIV epidemic in the world (2.1 million infected people), the second-highest Covid-19 infections and third-highest Covid-19 deaths, must heed important lessons from the global AIDS crisis while combating Covid-19.Also Read | India’s vaccine strategy is neglecting the vulnerable, poor. There is a way outFirst, AIDS established the epidemiological value of involving affected communities in the planning and implementation of research and care. Not only does emergency medicine require community trust to be effective but it also enhances public health based on a collaborative approach. India’s response to AIDS integrated the granular, social expertise of “target communities” (such as sex workers, and people from the transgender community) and their everyday assessments of risks. India’s Covid-19 responses must likewise engage vulnerable communities (for example, the rural poor) not only with the aim of securing medical compliance with vaccines but importantly building a bottom-up, community-based public health system. This includes incorporating the abilities of vulnerable groups to anticipate infections and fortify local care networks. In a health emergency, such a system can play a vital role in communicating risk and protective guidelines in terms people easily recognise and encouraging local forms of behavioural surveillance led by community leaders and grassroots health ambassadors.Second, AIDS established the practice of “harm reduction”, which entails lowering risk behaviours in the absence of total risk elimination. Harm reduction is imperative because biomedical risks are always socially patterned and located within structures where inequalities and stigmas are rife. The mutating Sars-CoV-2 pandemic is ideal to harness harm reduction approaches especially for marginalised groups by building their structural capacities during health emergencies and in everyday life. Harm reduction propagates that disproportionate risk and suffering necessitates differentiated health interventions. Vulnerable groups in India facing challenges to physical distancing, overcrowding, nutritional deficits and infectious disease burdens must be aided by State interventions for income support, debt relief, cash-transfers, free food rations, internet data (for telemedicine) and door-to-door pharmacies throughout lockdowns. Despite structural constraints, vulnerable populations also create their own harm reduction strategies, which must be recognised without shame or blame. The same logic can also crucially help contain and address vaccine hesitancy in which hesitant communities are encouraged to see vaccination as a form of harm reduction rather than a threat or hazard.Also Read | In India, ‘woke’ politics a liability: Pew surveyThird, the AIDS experience morally compels India to nuance its health data. Metrics have the potential to allow vulnerable groups to make sovereign claims on public health. The moral and material force of “grassroots metrics” comes from evidence and risk assessments from vulnerable communities themselves. Indian public health data during Covid-19 insufficiently reflects binaries like urban/rural, young/old, compliant/hesitant, which while functional fail to ensure an intersectional approach to health justice or take into account the shifting nature of categories. Indian health data must also make space for vulnerabilities beyond just age and comorbidities, accounting for the socio-cultural and politico-legal textures of at-risk groups. Vulnerability metrics must reflect the intersections of caste, class, gender, ethnicity and religion and how they react with specific forms of labour, occupational exposures, residential segregation, welfare exclusions etc. To scale up socially viable primary healthcare, Indian data must first deepen our understanding of the social world.Fourth, AIDS reinforced the need for evidence-based non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs). These are crucial for multiple reasons: To reduce the everyday burden on fractured medical systems including hospitals; to build public health infrastructure based on community health strategies even after vaccinations; to counteract catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditures caused by neoliberal pharmaceutical markets (including black markets for oxygen and life-saving drugs) on vulnerable people’s lives; to respect people’s refusals of biomedical care premised on personal histories of violence and harm by profit-oriented medical systems; to encourage ethical and effective home-based care; and to reduce post-treatment toxic infections and mental health withdrawals. NPIs in Covid-19 must complement biomedical and biosocial public health responses.Also Read | Scientifically Speaking : 20 years later, what we know about the human genomeFifth, AIDS put social justice at the heart of disease control. Globally, between 1996-2003, when anti-retroviral therapy (ART) was extensively promulgated most beneficiaries were in high-income countries while a majority of HIV patients were in low-income countries. Ironically, this was also the period of maximum AIDS deaths. India must negotiate neoliberal vaccine regimes by transforming its trounced vaccine nationalism to ensure that lack of Covid-19 vaccines doesn’t maim the marginalised at any cost. Social justice during infectious disease outbreaks involves recognising the nuances of where an individual is structurally placed and requires social epidemiological models to predict and propagate last-mile health services for communities which have barriers to health access and retention.Learning from the injustices of AIDS, India’s Covid-19 response must frame its health and development agenda within concrete socio-cultural determinants of harm, healing and well-being. Critical inter-epidemic lessons must drive equitable global public health in India.Nikhil Pandhi is a doctoral candidate in medical and cultural anthropology at Princeton University.

30-06-2021||Today's||India’s vaccine strategy is neglecting the vulnerable, poor. There is a way out||Are we pushing our older and vulnerable population into harm’s way and delaying vaccination for the poor?The government says that a third wave is a distinct possibility in the near future. It has consistently maintained that older people, i.e., 45+ and among them, the 60+ are especially vulnerable to severe outcomes, reiterated in the new affidavit to the Supreme Court. Also, recent studies show that a single dose offers only limited protection against infection from the Delta variant and somewhat better, but still low protection, against hospitalisation. Two doses are needed for sufficient protection, especially for older persons.Yet, currently, three out of four first doses and two out of three total doses are going to the youngest 18-45 age group, while the vulnerable 60+ get just one out of 10. 90% of all jabs are first doses. We are vaccinating very few of the 60+ and also delaying their second dose, leaving them vulnerable to the third wave.Also Read | In India, ‘woke’ politics a liability: Pew surveySince May 1, the youngest have got over five times the number of doses given to the oldest and most vulnerable age group (60+). If these doses had gone to the oldest instead, we could have had 100% coverage (first doses) of the most vulnerable 60+ by now. As it is, less than half of them have received one jab and the delay in the second lifesaving dose has meant that only one out of six are fully vaccinated.Some states show it’s possible to be more responsible. In Rajasthan, Tripura, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Uttarakhand, Mizoram and Goa, more than three-fourths of the 60+ have got their first dose. Achieving these levels needs hard work and rural outreach, taking vaccines closer to people. But states, especially now, are chasing numbers and the young are many and easily available.How soon can we reduce the gap? Given the improved supply, we can, by the end of July, give first doses to all 60+ and second doses to all who got their first jab more than eight weeks ago. The first cohort needs about 40 million doses and the second cohort about 35 million, a fair 60% share of the planned 120 million that the Centre’s affidavit says will be available in July, and a much smaller share of the 220 million expected by the chair of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation in India.Like in the United Kingdom, which inspired the 12-week gap (we extended it up to 16), we should reduce the gap between doses for the oldest age group and fully vaccinate them as quickly as possible. Among the 18-45, those with co-morbidities can be prioritised, as done for the 45+ earlier.Not just the young, the new vaccination policy also privileges the rich. For a family of five, Covaxin costs ₹14,000 in the private sector while it’s free in the public sector. If you can afford it, you can get vaccinated faster because the private sector has vaccine stock while the public sector often does not. As the health minister said on April 25, “Undoubtedly, the private and corporate sector route will empower a large number of people to get themselves quickly vaccinated … those who can afford to get them at the private and corporate sector rates shall go ahead.” A faster vaccination schedule for richer people is thus part of stated policy.But private presence is limited and very spatially concentrated. Half the districts have no private vaccination sites and over three-fourths have less than five. On June 21, when we vaccinated more than eight million people, nine states accounted for eight out of ten private sites and in each of them, most sites were in a few major urban districts. For example, in Telangana, Hyderabad and its surroundings accounted for 150 of 157 sites, while Kolkata, its neighbour, North Twenty-four Parganas and West Bardhaman, made up 212 of 241 sites in West Bengal.We need to reduce the private allocation or revert to the previous arrangement. Private sites can still vaccinate. Their supplies should be replenished based on use. The continuing reservation of 25% of vaccine production for less than 4% of vaccination sites is mindless. Low private demand will not even help to cross-subsidise, which the government has openly admitted as an objective in the latest affidavit.Also Read | Learn from the second wave, be cautious and get vaccinatedBut, it’s not all bleak.Crowded vaccination centres and long waits usually deter women from vaccination. The changes since May 1 led to rising gender inequity. The gender ratio worsened in almost all states (Andhra Pradesh a notable exception), with a higher share of 18-45 in vaccination associated with a worse gender ratio. Four out of five districts saw worse gender outcomes. Perhaps, men were more likely to go and women dissuaded from going to paid urban vaccination sites, which had much of the vaccine stock in May. However, as vaccines became available at public vaccination centres, this inequity has reduced and is now back to levels of late April.The other improvement is in spatial equity. Even in April, about 35 districts accounted for 25% of all vaccinations and 113 districts (about 15% of all districts) for half the vaccinations. Many of these are large urban centres with richer people but also admittedly with a high share of infections. Over May and till June 21, this became worse and in early June, only 25 districts were responsible for a quarter of all vaccinations. Since June 21, this has improved. And last week, about 47 districts accounted for a quarter and 148 for half the vaccinations, indicating that vaccines are being spread out more widely.A more equitable vaccination policy is achievable, especially after the ramp-up post June 21. Two of four major inequities, gender and geography, have been mitigated to some extent. We need to fix the other two, by focusing on the vulnerable and the poor.Partha Mukhopadhyay is a senior fellow, Centre for Policy Research The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/indias-vaccine-strategy-is-neglecting-the-vulnerable-poor-there-is-a-way-out-101625042180759.html
30-06-2021||Today's||Scientifically Speaking | 20 years later, what we know about the human genome||Twenty years ago, the first draft of the human genome was published in Nature and Science. The Human Genome Project was the most costly and ambitious biological enterprise in history. Astoundingly, it came in under the budget of $3 billion allocated by the United States Congress in 1990.In 2003, a more complete genome was publicly released, but gaps remained. At the time, eight per cent of the most challenging and repetitive parts of the 3.057 billion chemical letters of DNA that make up the human genome remained unmapped. Those challenging gaps were finally sequenced and posted this May to much less fanfare.In the early days of the Human Genome Project, DNA sequences were handwritten in notebook pages and faxed between groups. Keeping pace with early history of the Internet, the Human Genome Project sparked collaboration, open sharing of data, and made bioinformatics mainstream to all biologists.Also Read: Scientifically Speaking | Knowing how coronavirus hacks cells will help stop itHowever, the race to sequence the human genome didn’t simply catalyse the creation of the infrastructure and tools needed to handle large amounts of data. It also accelerated the development of new fields such as genomics, systems biology, and computational biology. Today, sequencing genomes is a million times cheaper than it was two decades ago. Consequently, millions of people have had their genomes sequenced.Genomes have helped in ancestry analyses and in identifying risk factors for diseases. With faster and cheaper DNA sequencing, we have entered the era of personalised medicine, which allows for individualised therapies that target molecular signatures of diseases that vary from person to person. Next-generation sequencing has also allowed us to design molecular vaccines, and to track mutations in viruses and variants during the current pandemic.Genes are the functional units of the genome that contain instructions for how to make proteins. Scientists initially thought that the human genome would contain 50,000 to 100,000 genes. It came as a surprise to us that our genomes are nowhere close to being the largest, nor do they contain the most genes. With a genome of 43 billion base pairs (14 times larger than the human genome), the Australian lungfish — an air-breathing distant relative of the first fish that walked on land 380 million years ago — holds the distinction of the largest animal genome sequenced.Humans have around 20,000 to 30,000 gene (depending on how a gene is actually defined) and each gene gives rise to three proteins on average. But even at the higher end of the range, this means that genes make up only one per cent of our genomes.We made pivotal discoveries in the first decade of the draft human genome. We know that the 99% of the genome that doesn’t code for genes is not fluff. Parts of it act as dials controlling the activity of genes. We also know there are switches that aren’t embedded in DNA which can respond to environmental signals to change the fate of cells. This extra layer on top of our genetics is spawning research in the field of epigenetics.But in my view, the biggest development in genomics came in the second decade of the century from outside the field, with the discovery of the tools to edit the genome itself. This genome editing technology, called CRISPR, which won its discoverers the Nobel Prize in Chemistry last year, allows us to edit any part of the human genome.Earlier this year, the New England Journal of Medicine published landmark research on two patients who received CRISPR gene-editing based therapy for sickle-cell disease and beta thalassemia. Both patients seem to have been cured of these severely debilitating genetic disorders, a truly monumental breakthrough. Doctors removed stem cells from bone marrow and edited a faulty gene using CRISPR. Billions of gene-edited cells were introduced into patients’ bodies.On Saturday, the same journal published interim results on the treatment of amyloidosis with CRISPR. With the ability to edit genes inside the body directly, we have entered the genome editing era.We know we can edit human genomes. But we do not know enough about the effects of making gene changes for complex diseases. Most diseases are not like sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia: they do not have a clear relationship between one gene and its effects. Instead, most diseases progress through the effects of multiple genes and environmental factors.Right now, much of the medical applications of genomics are geared to genes of known function. But there are many genes for which we don’t know function yet. An ambitious goal for the next decade would be to find out what the remaining genes actually do. An even more ambitious (and likely unachievable) goal would be to map the network of how genes interact with one another and with the rest of our cells.In addition, some of the unbridled optimism that many diseases would be cured easily once the genome had been sequenced is gone, firmly replaced by the understanding that human biology is more complex and messy than we had realised back then.Finally, we cannot lose sight of concerns in science that correlate with inequities in broader society. Who benefits from discoveries made from genomics? People of African ancestry, for example, are the most genetically diverse people on the planet. The rest of us are descendants of small populations that survived the journey out of Africa around 60,000 years ago. Yet people of African ancestry are underrepresented in genomic databases, which contain a disproportionate number of sequenced genomes of people of European ancestry. Just as vaccines are a common resource for all humans, so should genomes be.Anirban Mahapatra, a microbiologist by training, is the author of COVID-19: Separating Fact From Fiction.

30-06-2021||Editorials||Living together, separately||The findings of the latest Pew survey on religion in India raise questions that lie at the heart of India’s contemporary political debates. The survey shows that while an overwhelming majority of Indians are believers, they also recognise the importance of respecting other religions as a religious virtue. This respect for other religions co-exists with a high support for religious segregation, not just on questions such as marriage but even in choosing neighbours and friends. Defying taboos related to food is among the biggest triggers for being considered an outcaste from one’s religion. If these findings are true, it confirms what is anecdotally known: Indians are largely conservative when it comes to religion.Also Read | On migrant workers, SC issues a stern reminderBut since this is the first such survey, and there is no comparative historical data, it is hard to know whether conservatism has increased or decreased over time. When seen with the tectonic shift in Indian polity since 2014, it raises other questions too. Is the BJP’s rise a reflection of this conservatism? Or has its rise made Indians, especially Hindus, more conservative, even intolerant, vis-à-vis other religions? Or have these two reinforced each other? The report indicates that Hindus who support the BJP are slightly more conservative than others. For example, 72% Hindus who favour the BJP think that it is very important to stop Hindu women from marrying into other religions. For Hindus who had an unfavourable view of the BJP, this number is just 57%. But the key factor is that even among the BJP’s opponents, segregation is a majority view. Regressive views span religions: 42% of Muslim men, compared to just 32% women, think that the practice of triple talaq should exist.While it is tempting to conclude that existing social barriers are insurmountable, it is also true that more Indians than at any point in history are defying caste and religion structures in making life choices, including marriage. The trend of voters flipping between the BJP and its opponents in national and state elections also shows political choices are complex, beyond the religious outlook of the party. The larger political message from the survey is that while the entrenched conservatism among Hindus might give the BJP an edge, it is not the only explanation for the party’s political rise. The larger social message is that India has a long way to go in becoming a truly harmonious society, where citizens don’t just live together, separately and peacefully, but coexist in all senses of the term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/living-together-separately-101625050101298.html
30-06-2021||Editorials||On migrant workers, SC issues a stern reminder||A two-judge bench of the Supreme Court (SC), on Tuesday, gave a slew of directives to the Centre, the states, and Union Territories (UTs) to provide relief to migrant workers, whose lives and livelihoods have been severely affected by the pandemic. Calling the Centre’s attitude towards the migrants “lackadaisical,” SC directed it to ensure that the proposed national database for unorganised workers (NDUW) is operational by July 31 so that welfare benefits can flow to the marginalised sections. It also ordered states and UTs to implement the One Nation One Ration Card (ONOR) scheme by July 31 to help beneficiaries, especially migrant workers, avail of subsidised food commodities anywhere, irrespective of their home location.Also Read | India’s vaccine strategy is neglecting the vulnerable, poor. There is a way outThe SC’s order can have far-reaching impact if appropriately implemented. It is also a reminder to the State that welfare of migrants must not be restricted to pandemic-related benefits; and that the failure to put in place a policy framework exacerbated the crisis of 2020. The directives also expose India’s low state capacity in providing effective interventions. For example, NDUW was supposed to be functional in 2018. There has been some progress on ONOR over the past year, but issues of accessibility need to be addressed. It is a smartphone-based app, works in select ration shops, and uses finger-based authentication, which has proved to be unreliable in some cases.Migrant workers form 94% (380 million) of India’s workforce. They come from the most disadvantaged sections of society and the poorest of the regions (primarily north and east India), and are often forced to migrate (primarily to west and south India and urban centres) to improve their socioeconomic status. Their long march home in 2020 highlighted their precarious existence, and the duty of the Indian State to provide relief. SC’s stern order is welcome.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/on-migrant-workers-sc-issues-a-stern-reminder-101625049321071.html
