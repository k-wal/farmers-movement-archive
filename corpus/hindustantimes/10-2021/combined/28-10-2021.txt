This way, the land and population ratio is a mismatch in the country which needs focus,” the NGT chairperson said.“India’s contribution to global warming is 3%, but it is among the worst sufferers of the same in the world. Significantly, a study says in the past 50 years India’s population multiplied three times and its agriculture land grew by 20%,” the NGT chairperson added.“Law has its role and it can take care of a situation where there is violation. In case of a situation that is not in the law, a new law can also be made,” he said, addressing a technical session on “role of environmental legal framework in climate action” at the conclave. The NGT chairperson said there are existing laws on plastic waste, e-waste, hazardous waste and other categories to deal with all types of situations. “Conservation of energy is a key issue,” said the NGT chairperson.UP’s law minister Brijesh Pathak pointed towards the state’s focus on laws to deal with situations for better implementation of rules.During the session, 18 new continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations were also launched that would function in different cities of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ngt-chairperson-for-focus-on-poverty-pollution-and-population-101635445788103.html

The bird was later released in Okhla bird sanctuary after receiving necessary treatment. “We saw the Hobby struggling to free itself at the other side of the bridge in Okhla bird sanctuary around 7am. Though we removed the manjha, the bird did not fly as it was injured. A fellow birder, Dr Diwakar Rao, volunteered and took the bird to a wildlife rescue centre nearby, along with a forest official. The bird was saved but the problem of manjha persists,” said Jaswinder Singh Waraich, a Noida-based birder.This is not the first such incident where a bird was stuck and or injured by a manjha, said the birders.“Just about ten days ago, we untangled another Hobby, which was stuck in manjha and was hanging by a tree. It is a very common sight here. We often remove as much as manjha as we can and also request the forest department to do so,” said Rohit Sharma, another birder based in Noida who helped rescue the bird.“There are several cases of bird injuries, primarily due to nylon manjha. It is referred as Chinese manjha but is locally manufactured. Today, the Eurasian hobby brought to us was unwinded from the manjha but was stressed and had mudded wings. It was later released after a thorough cleanup,” said Muhammad Soud, who runs an NGO ‘Wildlife Rescue’ in Delhi’s Wazirabad. A small but graceful falcon that performs a fast flight in pursuit of flying prey, the Eurasian Hobby is about 33cm in length. One of the rare winter visitor, the Eurasian Hobby is a passage migrant and comes to this region for about a month or a few weeks.Meanwhile, an official from the forest department said manjha is a menace for the sanctuary. Many such kite strings are found in the sanctuary due to the kites that fall here from neighbouring residential areas such as Jamia Nagar.“Manjha, especially Chinese manjha, is a menace as it makes its way to the sanctuary and does not decay quickly. We are writing an official letter to the police stations of the concerned areas to check and curb the sale of Chinese manjha in their areas as it is a threat to the birds in the sanctuary,” said P K Srivastava, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/falcon-caught-in-manjha-rescued-in-okhla-police-help-to-sought-fight-menace-101635444350044.html

Members of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and its youth wing Bajrang Dal stopped their agitation after the police assured them they would take necessary action. Umanand (who goes by his first name), leader of the VHP, Gautam Budh Nagar, said, “ We have video evidence to prove that pro-Pakistan and anti-India slogans were raised during a religious procession taken out on the occasion of Barawafat or Milad-Un-Nabi (a day marking the birth and death of prophet Mohammad) on October 19.”He claimed 36 people had raised slogans, of whom only three were arrested. “We demand that all the culprits be booked for sedition,” he said.According to Noida police, pro-Pakistan slogans were allegedly raised during a religious procession here in the city, after which three people were arrested on October 20, a day after the procession, and charged with Section 153 of the IPC (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot). The arrests were made on the basis of a purported video, which surfaced on social media, said police“Some pro-Pakistan slogans were raised during the procession of Barawafat on October 19 in the city. We detained three men, who were instigating others to raise slogans. Today (Thursday), the protesters demanded we book those who raised the slogans for sedition. We are still investigating the matter and will take appropriate action,” said Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, Noida. The protesters also disrupted traffic on Thursday. “The traffic was diverted via Sector 10-21 route in view of the gathering on the road outside the police station. Efforts are on to restore normalcy,” said Noida traffic police on Twitter.Protestors also claimed that similar slogans were raised after Pakistan beat India in the T20 World Cup cricket match held on October 24; however, no proof has as yet emerged.Notably, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday said sedition charges will be invoked against those celebrating Pakistan’s victory against India in the recent T-20 World Cup match.“Those celebrating Pakistan’s victory will face sedition,” a tweet posted from the official handle of Adityanath’s office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/rightwing-groups-want-sedition-charges-for-those-who-raised-pro-pakistan-slogans-101635443991373.html

As all steps, including power supply through aerial bunch conductors, have in the past failed to check line losses in these areas. The LESA would soon start the work to connect the houses with armoured cables from poles, said the official on the condition of anonymity.“The aim is to reduce the line loss through armoured cables. Power theft by using shunts, which is a frequent practice in these areas, will be made difficult with laying of armoured cables, which are highly insulated with three extra protective layers to keep it away from unwanted cut or damage. These cables are laid down from meter to pole so that they cannot be breached and tampered with,” the officer said. Meanwhile, chairman of UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Committee Avadhesh Varma said, “We fight for honest power consumers not for the cheats. Due to some power stealers the situation remains worrisome, especially, in Chowk, Thakurganj and Aminabad areas. Cheats have been adopting different techniques to steal electricity. If the department has decided to supply power from poles to houses through armoured cables, then there is nothing to worry for genuine consumers.” He added, “The line loss in Aminabad, Chowk and Thakurganj remains above 30% due to power pilferage as electricity stealers are using new ways of tampering. Armoured cables will be of limited use in absence of strict monitoring by the officials. ”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lucknow-lesa-to-lay-armoured-power-cables-to-check-pilferage-101635443927935.html

28-10-2021||Noida||Traffic police prohibits entry of heavy vehicles in Ghaziabad||In order to decongest the areas with the most crowd during the festive season, the Ghaziabad traffic police have issued a diversion plan barring the entry of heavy traffic vehicles (HTVs) in the city from October 29 to November 7. They have also diverted autos from some stretches to alternate routes during the same period. According to the diversion plan rolled out on Thursday, the traffic police said all heavy vehicles entering the city from the Lal Kuan intersection (on GT Road) will be diverted to Loha Mandi and then will have to take the Vivekanand Flyover to proceed to Hapur Road and ALT Centre, Raj Nagar. “From there, vehicles can proceed to their respective routes towards Meerut, etc. Likewise, the heavy vehicles travelling from Mohan Nagar will use the rotary near the Hindon river Metro station and can proceed to ALT Centre. We have also decided that all autos plying between Lal Kuan and Mohan Nagar will use the Thakurdwara Flyover and not the surface road,” said Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic). Apart from the diversion for heavy vehicles, the plan also includes another diversion for autos which ply between the Old Bus Station and Chaudhary Morh. “All the autos plying on this route will be barred from doing so November 2 to November 5 to avoid congestion in markets such as Chopla, Turab Nagar, Gandhi Nagar, etc, in the Old City. The entire diversion plan is aimed at decongesting areas in the city where there is heavy rush during the festival. As long as the diversions are in place, there will be two big temporary parking spaces where people can park their vehicles and go to the markets on foot,” said the SP. The two temporary parking spaces have been proposed at Nehru Yuva Kendra at Ambedkar Road and at the Ghanta Ghar Ramlila ground, adjacent to GT Road. Traffic officials said they will take strict action against those persons whose vehicles are found parked on the roadside as such a situation will lead to traffic congestion, which in turn will spike the air quality index reading. “We have asked the traffic police to coordinate and manage various congestion points during the festival. Vehicular pollution due to congestion contributes to the city’s air pollution levels,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board. Ghaziabad city already implemented a Graded Response Action Plan to curb air pollution as directed by the Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and the adjoining areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/traffic-police-prohibits-entry-of-heavy-vehicles-in-ghaziabad-101635443567959.html

The decision of the repair work was taken in the wake of the audit conducted after the collapse of Himalaya Bridge in 2019. According to BMC officials, these 14 bridges were added to the list as the audit found them to be vulnerable. A BMC official from the bridges department said, “Overall, there are 50 such small bridges that are being taken up for repair and reconstruction in phases. We are also going ahead with similar works for the Bandra skywalk in the coming days.” The total cost of the work on the 14 bridges is around ₹5.45 crore and the repairs are expected to be completed by the end of 2022. Of the 14 bridges, repairs on three bridges are major, while on the remaining 11 are minor. The bridges up for minor repairs are the bridge one near TB Hospital on Acharya Donde Marg, foot overbridge at AK Marg in Mahim and one bridge on Arthur Road in Chinchpokli. Further, the 11 bridges that will be taken up for major repairs include Sion Subway both the north and south side, Sion hospital flyover, Nanalal D Mehta flyover, Tulpule flyover, Sarasvati School foot overbridge, Sion pumping station foot overbridge, GTB station foot overbridge, JK chemical culvert, Lovergrove culvert, Cleaveland culvert and Kamlanagar Vehicular culvert. The bids for their repairs have been floated by the BMC. In the earlier list of 14, six bridges are going to be taken up for major repairs and eight for reconstruction post demolition. The vehicular bridges that are going to be repaired or reconstructed include one in Malwani area in Malad, Hindustan Nallah Bridge on Charkop Road, vehicular bridge connecting Lokhandwala and Laxmi Nagar in Andheri west and vehicular bridge crossing Mithi River on Andheri-Kurla Road. Further, the BMC tender document has stated, “Vehicular traffic in the construction area shall be regulated with the help of the Traffic Police Authority. However, pedestrian movement in the area should not be affected during the entire construction period. Hence, before starting the work barricading, signals, warning signals etc shall be provided, in order not to affect the pedestrian movement and the utilities.” Meanwhile, part demolition of Bandra skywalk is expected to start post Diwali for which the bids were floated in August 2021. The BMC has decided to demolish and rebuild part of the city’s first skywalk in Bandra East. The decision has been taken by the BMC owing to structural defects pointed out by a third-party auditor. Owing to this, traffic on the station road leading to Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) is expected to be hit. According to BMC officials, the stretch between Bandra East station and Western Express Highway will be demolished and rebuilt at the cost of around ₹16.20 crore. In 2019 during monsoon, a portion of the skywalk at Bandra (East) fell, injuring a woman. Apart from the Bandra skywalk, more 23 skywalks are due to undergo major repairs or demolition and reconstruction. Post the, the Himalaya Bridge collapse at CSMT in March 2019, the BMC had appointed Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI) suggesting major repairs for all 24 skywalks including the one at Bandra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/14-more-bridges-in-mumbai-to-undergo-repairs-101635442847977.html
28-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Snatcher held for targeting two politicians at Connaught Place||A 29-year-old man was arrested on Thursday for snatching the mobile phone of a woman politician on October 23 in Connaught Place. Police said his attempt to snatch the phone of a second woman politician, half an hour later the same night, was foiled.Police said the man allegedly snatched the mobile phone of Nutan Singh, national chief general secretary (women’s wing) of Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party (Union minister Pashupati Kumar Paras’s faction), while she was in the outer circle with five people, including her husband Neeraj Singh, around 10pm on October 23.Within half an hour, the scooter-borne suspect tried to snatch the cellphone of Amba Prasad, Congress legislator from Barkagaon constituency in Jharkhand’s Hazaribagh district. The woman MLA was speaking to someone over the phone and was with her relative when the man attempted to snatch her phone away near PVR Plaza in the inner circle of Connaught Place, but failed, police said.Both the politicians registered cases at the Connaught Place police station and an Inspector (anti-terrorist officer, ATO), who was looking after the work of the station house officer (SHO) in his absence, began an investigation. The teams scanned nearly 20 CCTV cameras and found that both the crimes were committed by the same suspect who was riding a scooter, said a senior police officer, who did not want to be named.The CCTV cameras installed near both the crime spots only captured the scooter but its registration number was not clear. Investigators scanned more cameras on the routes that the suspect took. Since he fled towards Daryaganj, they suspected that he could be from that area. Through the human intelligence network and examining dossiers of habitual criminals from that area, the team identified the suspect as one Tauseef Khan and caught him with the scooter that he used in the crime. They also recovered the Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party (RLJP) leader’s stolen cellphone, said the officer quoted above.“We arrested the snatcher and recovered the stolen phone,” said deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Deepak Yadav.According to Delhi Police data, Delhi reported 5,108 snatching cases till October 15 this year -- 851 more than the number reported during the same period in 2020.Police said that Khan was found to be involved in at least three more crimes, including that of sexual harassment. Unlike most snatchers who work in pairs, Khan worked alone, police said.Expressing happiness over the recovery of the stolen phone, the RLJP leader’s (Nutan Singh’s) husband Neeraj Singh praised the Delhi Police team for their swift action. Neeraj Singh is also an office-bearer in the same party.“We were walking in the outer circle when a scooter rider took a sharp turn in front of us. I was scolding the rider for his rash riding when he suddenly snatched my wife’s phone from her hand. Before we could react, he sped away with the phone. I think he had already identified my wife as a soft target,” he said.He said a police team reached the crime scene within two minutes after they informed the police control room. They took the couple to the police station where their complaint was recorded and converted into a first information report (FIR).“The inspector and his team showed us some CCTV camera footage and we identified the suspect’s scooter. They assured us they would recover the stolen phone and did so within four days,” he added.Congress MLA Amba Prasad, who is the youngest legislator in the Jharkhand Legislative Assembly 2019, could not be reached for comment despite multiple calls and a text message.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhisnatcher-held-for-targeting-two-politicians-at-connaught-place-101635442667782.html
28-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai crime branch unearths illegal share trading worth ₹6,840 crore, arrests four||Mumbai crime branch has busted a major illegal share trading racket and arrested four accused from Ghatkopar in the case. A scrutiny of the computer systems of the four accused, conducted in the presence of senior Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE) officials, has revealed that in the past seven months, they had allegedly unlawfully carried out share trading worth ₹6,840 crore, outside the legitimate systems of BSE and NSE. The police suspect that the accused have evaded multiple government taxes, causing a loss to the government exchequer, worth thousands of crores of rupees. The four alleged illegal share traders also used hawala channels for money transactions, said the police.According to the police, illegal share trading – commonly known as ‘dabba trading’ – is a proxy unauthorised market with its own trading laws and legislation. It is a process through which a broker routes the client to trade outside the stock exchange. The bucketing acts as an operator who functions away from crowded business areas. Dabba trading is also done through various apps for buying/selling stocks in illegal market. With the help of a software, transactions occur in various parts of the country.The police said based on reliable information, crime branch unit-7 officers, along with BSE assistant general manager Kiran Sawant and NSE chief manager Prakash Tanna on Wednesday raided two flats in a building in Vikhroli. “The officers discovered that 11 persons were unlawfully trading in shares without having permission or licences for it. When NSE and BSE officials inspected the Tally software in the accused people’s laptops and computers, it found that the turnover of illegal share trading of an accused, Rajesh Patel, 33, was of ₹4,900 crore between July and October, while another accused, Shailesh Nanda, 38, had a turnover of ₹1,300 crore between June and October. The third accused, Dinesh Bhanushali, 38, had a turnover of ₹639 crore between April and October,” said a police officer, requesting anonymity of name.The fourth accused has been identified as Mahesh Kataria, 38. The others present at the spot during the raids were the employees of the four accused, said the police. The crime branch has seized cash worth ₹5.9 lakh, 45 mobile phones, three pen drives, five laptops, a computer, seven hard disks and a note-counting machine from the accused. “The accused, by means of illegal trading, allegedly evaded security transactions tax, capital gain tax, state government stamp duty, SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) turnover fee and exchange trading revenue, causing huge revenue losses to the exchequer,” said another police officer.Further probe has revealed that the accused had allegedly used code names for their investors. The police are trying to crack these code names.The accused allegedly accepted money from investors through hawala using code words and did not give any contract note for sale and purchase of shares and crucially, did not inform SEBI.It is suspected that all these transactions were done in cash through Angadiya facility and the accused invested black money in it, said the police. The police are also investigating if the money was used for any illegal or terrorism-related activities. The four accused were remanded in police custody till November 2 by a local court on Thursday. More arrests are likely to take place in the coming days.Considering the high magnitude of the case, the case has been transferred to the economic offences wing (EOW) for further investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-crime-branch-unearths-illegal-share-trading-worth-6-840-crore-arrests-four-101635442547808.html

Champat Rai, general secretary of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, received them at the Ram Janmabhoomi. Trust members Dr Anil Mishra and Vimlendra Mohan Pratap Mishra were also present. According to the Hindu epic Ramayan, Sita, Lord Ram’s wife, was held captive by demon king Ravan, at Ashok Vatika. In a tweet earlier this year, the Indian high commissioner to Sri Lanka had made the announcement about dedicating a stone from Sita Eliya (Ashok Vatika) for construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. “A stone from Sita Eliya in Sri Lanka for the Ram Temple in Ayodhya will be a pillar of strength for India-Sri Lanka ties. This stone was received at the Mayurapathi Amman Temple by HC-designate of Sri Lanka to India HE Mr. Milinda Moragoda in presence of the High Commissioner,” the tweet read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/sri-lankan-delegation-brings-sacred-stone-from-ashok-vatika-to-ayodhya-101635442488541.html
28-10-2021||Mumbai||Active Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra dip to 18,748||Maharashtra’s count of active Covid-19 cases on Thursday dropped to 18,748, down from the 19,480 on Wednesday and 22,981 on Tuesday.State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said the reduction in active infections showed that the Covid-19 pandemic is under control. “The government had been focussing on critical patients, ramping up the number of tests, isolating the patients as well as providing timely medication,” said Dr Awate.Mumbai has the most active cases at 4,944, followed by Pune and Thane with 3,929 and 3,005 patients respectively. The fourth and fifth positions are occupied by Ahmednagar (2,048) and Raigad (659) respectively.The number of active cases during the peak of the second wave earlier this year had reached 600,000. For months till Tuesday, Pune was leading in the number of active cases, followed by Thane. The third position had been alternatively held by Mumbai, followed by Ahmednagar and Satara in recent months. However, on Wednesday, Mumbai overtook Pune in terms of active cases.Dr Ishwar Gilada, secretary-general, Organised Medicine Academic Guild, said there is nothing to panic if Mumbai has the highest number of active cases. “Since we have less than 500 new patients daily in Mumbai, we are doing well in containing the virus. We should ideally rejoice with masks,” said Dr Gilada. “However, we need to be cautious and adhere to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” he added.Maharashtra on Thursday recorded 1,418 Covid-19 new cases and 36 deaths.Mumbai recorded 324 new cases and six deaths, with its toll reaching 16,235. The total number of Covid-19 patients right from the outbreak last year has now reached 6,607,954.There were 114,099 tests done on Thursday, while the number of recoveries clocked 2,112.

28-10-2021||Mumbai||SC decision on NEET fair to lakhs but we have been cheated: 2 petitioners||Weeks of waiting finally concluded on Thursday as the Supreme Court (SC) stayed an order by the Bombay high court (HC), thus making way for the announcement of the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-UG) results.Undergraduate medical and dental aspirants have been on the edge waiting for the National Testing Agency (NTA) to announce results for NEET-UG, the exam for which was conducted on September 12. A petition by two aspirants from Solapur demanding a retest for thems, however, was delaying this step.“Over 16 lakh students appeared for the NEET exam and more delays in the process of announcing results directly affects the academic year of first-year students. The previous batch already faced a lot of trouble and we are hoping we don’t face a similar fate,” said Anirudh Pai, a NEET-UG aspirant. He added that while he feels bad for the two students who were wronged “by the system”, delaying results of everyone else would be a huge punishment for all.The Bombay high court (HC) last week directed the NTA — the nodal exam conducting agency — to conduct NEET examination afresh for two candidates who approached the judiciary. These students in their plea mentioned how on the day of the examination, on September 12, both students were handed a question paper and answer booklet with mismatched code numbers. This automatically meant their answer sheets were not accepted by the automated system and therefore left them with no answer booklets to base their score on.“I have attempted the exam with all my knowledge, but due to the error on part of the invigilator, my answers do not match the question paper so I have been marked zero in the exam. None of this is our fault but the judiciary has punished us in this bargain,” said Abhishek Kapase, 19, one of the two students from Solapur who approached the Bombay high court (HC) earlier this month.Both Abhishek and Vaishnavi Bhopale, 19, were appearing for NEET from the same centre in Solapur this year and both were facing similar trouble — the code on their question paper and answer booklet did not match. What’s worse is that both students brought this to the notice of the invigilator, but received no help.“Just like every other medical aspirant, we have spent the last two years preparing for NEET and appeared for the exam with all our knowledge possible. Because of this decision now, we will end up wasting an entire academic year and will have to appear for NEET again’ next year. How is this fair to us?” asked Bhopale.While most parents are happy with the decision of the apex court staying the Bombay HC order and making way for NEET-UG results, some feel the two students should have been given a chance to prove their case.“While the SC has given importance to the larger interest of students, considering the lives of 16 lakh students, their decision has been unfair to these students. Their precious year goes waste, and so does their hard work of the last two years,” said Brijesh Sutaria, parent of a medical student.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sc-decision-on-neet-fair-to-lakhs-but-we-have-been-cheated-2-petitioners-101635441833227.html
28-10-2021||Lucknow||Diwali fair aimed at bringing biz to small traders, says UP CM||LUCKNOW Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday inaugurated the grand Vikas Deepotsav Mela (Diwali fair) at the Jhulelal Park here, calling it an attempt to bring smiles to the faces of people from the lower strata of society who suffered the most during the pandemic crisis. Highlighting the UP government as a pro-commoner government, the CM also felicitated street vendors, cleanliness staff and Covid warriors on the occasion. “Due to Covid crisis, our people, especially those into small businesses, were grappling to meet out their financial needs for the last one and a half years. The aim of organising the Diwali fest is to bring business to these people. More than 1,500 street vendors and other small traders/artisans have been roped in for the fest in order to bring smiles on their faces this Diwali. A similar fest is being organised at around 217 places in UP, including 200 nagar palikas,” said chief minister Yogi Adityanath while inaugurating the event based on the theme ‘Vikas Deepotsav’. The CM accused all previous governments of being insensitive towards people from the lower strata of the society. “No previous government has felicitated street vendors and traders on such a grand platform because they were insensitive towards them. In our regime, around 8 lakh street vendors have been felicitated with ₹10,000 loan under the PM Swanidhi Yojna, around 45 lakh families have been provided accommodations, 2.61 crore people given toilets, 1.41 crore people got free electricity connections while 1.51 lakh families were given free gas connections under the Ujjwala scheme,” he said. “During the regime of previous governments, people feared while celebrating their festivals, feared taking the name of Lord Ram or Krishna. The difference is much visible now. There have been no riots in the last four and a half years of our regime and people are free to celebrate in their own way. On November 3, we would be lighting around 9 lakh earthen lamps in Ayodhya,” said Yogi Adityanath. He also urged people not to pollute river Gomti. The chief minister said while other countries were still grappling with Covid and lockdowns, the situation was under control in UP. The CM’s address was followed by a grand laser show and Gomti Arti. “It’s a historic moment for us. We haven’t witnessed any such event along river Gomti in the past. The laser show was mesmerising and the illumination at Chhattar Manzil too was beautiful,” said Saheba Hussain, a college-goer, who visited the fest. The venue had around 1,500 stalls and a food court where people were seen enjoying Awadhi cuisines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/diwali-fair-aimed-at-bringing-biz-to-small-traders-says-up-cm-101635441467679.html
28-10-2021||Mumbai||38 years on, CBI court in Mumbai acquits Chhota Rajan in the first case against him||A special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court on Thursday acquitted gangster Rajendra Sadashiv Nikalje aka Chhota Rajan, 38 years after he was booked for the first time for attempting to murder a police officer in 1983. This was the first major case registered against Rajan. Police said before this Rajan, used to black market tickets outside a cinema theatre in Chembur area. Special CBI judge A T Wankhede acquitted him. Counsel Tushar Khandhare who represented Rajan said the case dates back to 1983. He said the incident took place after a police team attached to Tilak Nagar police station apprehended Rajan while smuggling liquor in a taxi. The team comprised six policemen – two officers and four constables. Rajan was accompanied by two others. After the police stopped the taxi, Rajan flashed a knife and attacked one of the police officials and injured him. The Tilak Nagar police had arrested Rajan and one of his aides who was later acquitted by the court, whereas the other accused was absconding. When Rajan was arrested in Indonesia in October, 2015, and brought to India, Mumbai Police had handed this case to CBI. CBI had filed a closure report in the case saying that it could not find witnesses and even the weapon as the case was old. The Special court had rejected the plea for closing the case and had asked the agency to continue the trial. Special Public Prosecutor, Pradip Gharat had argued before the court that the three police constables who had deposed against Rajan had narrated the incident well and defence could not prove otherwise. However, Khandhare who argued for Rajan told the court, “Despite the incident taking place in the day in a crowded place near Rajawadi Hospital in Ghatkopar, the police failed to examine any independent witness. The weapon cannot be foisted upon me as there are no panch witness at the spot. Rajan is not directly involved in the case.” After hearing both the sides, the court acquitted Rajan per section 235 (1) of Code of Criminal Procedure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/38-years-on-cbi-court-in-mumbai-acquits-chhota-rajan-in-the-first-case-against-him-101635441407968.html

BJP’s Ashish Shelar has said that Shiv Sena had announced to waive off property tax on the flats which are less than 500 square feet (sq ft), but in reality, only a part of the tax was waived off. “Only general tax of the property tax was waived off by the Shiv Sena-led civic body after making the announcement in the last civic polls. Other taxes recovered as part of the property tax continue to be levied on these flats. The announcement is nothing but cheating the people of the city,” he said. Shelar said Mumbai has 1,536,380 flats of up to 500 sq ft, paying collective taxes of ₹670 crore. “The burden is bearable for BMC if it gives total waiver to the flat owners. BMC gives 50% waiver in premium to builders but is not ready to extend the waiver in property tax to Mumbaiites. The state government’s decision taken on Wednesday to not revise the property tax is just hogwash,” he said. On Wednesday, the state cabinet decided to not increase the property taxes for buildings and lands in Mumbai for the financial year 2021-22. The decision was taken in the wake of the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and is said to cost the exchequer a burden of ₹1,042 crore in the financial year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bmc-waiving-off-only-part-of-property-tax-for-flats-less-than-500-sq-feet-bjp-101635440807862.html
28-10-2021||Mumbai||Travel in Mumbai: Public transport share slipped by 13% points in 12 years||Over 400km of metro rail corridors, 1,200km of an additional road network, 530km of dedicated bus lanes, multiple inter-state and intercity bus terminals, passenger water terminals, cycle tracks are some of the infrastructure projects that are envisaged in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) in the next two decades. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) on Thursday released the Comprehensive Transportation Study (CTS) outlining some new projects and implementation of proposed projects in MMR. It also said that the share of public transport has dropped considerably between 2005 and 2017. MMRDA officials described the decline in the use of public transport in MMR as a “danger signal” and “serious issue” which needed to be addressed immediately. SVR Srinivas, Metropolitan Commissioner, MMRDA, said the share of suburban trains, Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) Undertaking buses has gone down in the 12 years.“In the past 10 years or so, a serious trend has been observed. The share of public transport in MMR has dropped from 78% to 65%. The share of railway and BEST buses also has reduced. This means that private vehicles have tremendously increased. This is a danger signal according to me,” Srinivas said during the unveiling of the CTS.According to the report, the trips of two-wheelers and cars have increased nearly twofold during the period. In 2005, MMR had 0.63 million trips in cars and 1.05 million two-wheeler trips. This increased to 2.34 million two-wheeler trips and 1.59 million car trips in 2017. Interestingly, though the trips of suburban trains increased from 6.98 million to 8.11 in the 12 years, the percentage of people reduced from 51.8% to 43.2%.Srinivas added, “In a city like Mumbai which grows vertically, the share of public transport should increase and this is dangerous. We are at a point of inflexion and need to take immediate steps. Unless we have more people using public transport, we cannot cope with the demand.” He added that with the implementation of the CTS they intend to increase the share of public transport to 75.4%.The first Comprehensive Transport Study was released in 2008 based on which several projects were implemented in Mumbai and MMR, including the 6.45-km Santacruz-Chembur Link Road, Mumbai Urban Transport Project (MUTP), which included suburban railway projects, 11.4km Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar metro line, and 16.8-km Eastern Freeway project.The CTS 2021-2041 largely consists of projects proposed or planned earlier. The new study, meanwhile, is divided into the short term plan (till 2026) medium-term (till 2031) and long term (till 2041). The study recommended a 487-km metro network, 232-km suburban rail network, 533-km dedicated bus lanes/BRTS, and an additional road network of 1,264-km by the horizon year 2041.Tourism and environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, who is also the guardian minister of the Mumbai suburban district, said developed nations largely depend on public transportation. For Mumbai, the dependency would come when there are additional BEST buses, more metro lines. “Today we have 3500 buses, we will be able to fully utilise the public transport potential when we have 10,000 buses,” he said.State urban development minister Eknath Shinde said that like suburban railways, Metros will have to be the lifeline of MMR which will help reduce the private vehicles on the roads. He also said that the projects need to be completed in a time-bound manner to see their full impact. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said, “Planning is a continuous process. The transport system is the bloodstream of our city and our needs are increasing and planning is a must to follow these needs. Today, the percentage of people travelling through public transport has reduced as seen by the numbers. But it will increase only when we give a clean and neat public transport system to people. However, we should not kill the environment while going for development.”Some of the projects proposed in the CTS include a four-lane tunnel under the Sanjay Gandhi National Park between Borivali and Thane, as 20.75km of Metro line between Taloja and Kalyan, Nariman Point-Cuffe Parade missing link, Thane coastal road, Metro line between Siddhivinayak (Prabhadevi) and the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport. The estimated cost for all projects to be completed is over ₹4 lakh crore. The MMRDA expects that nearly ₹48,761 crore will come from private participation, ₹93,933 crore would come from the Centre through either share or subsidy, and ₹803 crore from development charge.The study further recommended four interstate Bus Terminals, 13 inter-city bus terminals, five inter-city rail terminals, five major and 14 minor truck terminals and 25 passenger water terminals by the year 2041. As a part of an immediate requirement, the study has also recommended various traffic management measures such as junction improvements, flyovers, elevated roads, road-over bridges, subways, and cycle tracks.The study recommended the construction of 322km of metro lines or 14 metro corridors, 172km of additional suburban railway, 319km dedicated bus lanes or Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS), 824km of additional road network in the MMR by 2026. The estimated cost of these projects is ₹3.13 lakh crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/travel-in-mumbai-public-transport-share-slipped-by-13-points-in-12-years-101635439367796.html
28-10-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh has seen eight-fold increase in solar power generation capacity since 2017: Yogi Adityanath||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday said Uttar Pradesh has brought its solar power generation capacity up to nearly 2000 megawatt (MW) from 250 MW in 2017, an almost eight-fold increase. He also stated that Uttar Pradesh now has the best water resources in the world.“By March 2022, we are going to add another 1000 megawatt production (of solar power),” he said at the opening ceremony of the two-day “UP climate change conclave-2021.”“We believe the earth is our mother. Hence, in every ritual, we pledge to save the earth, life on earth, and even the universe,” Yogi Adityanath said at the meet in Lucknow.The climate change conclave has been organised to discuss measures for reducing carbon footprints. Experts from the field related to environment sciences are participating in the meet.“Earlier, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) used to point out shortcomings, but our government took it seriously. Illegal slaughterhouses were stopped and after initial hurdles, people themselves came forward to stop them,” Yogi Adityanath said.“In the past five years, we have planted 100 crore trees and now our capacity is such that we can plant 100 crore trees in one year. In all 16 lakh street lights have been replaced with LED ones,” the chief minister said, sharing his government’s efforts to reduce carbon emission.He said community/public toilets are going to be constructed at each village in addition to the toilets built in individual houses in villages. A large pit for compost making has been made mandatory in every village.“When our government took over, 256 development blocks were put in the dark zone but now UP has the world’s best water resources. Dolphins are visible in the Ganga in Varanasi and Kanpur, where they had not been seen for years together,” the CM said.He said biofuel needs greater focus, pointing out that the season for stubble burning is nearing.“Despite an increase in the number of tigers in the state, man-animal conflicts have gone down. This became possible after awareness, sensitisation and (imparting) training to people living in forests and rehabilitating them,” the chief minister said.Three eco-tourism circuits were launched during the programme: the Agra-Chambal, Varanasi-Chandrakanta and Gorakhpur-Sonibarwa circuits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-has-seen-eight-fold-increase-in-solar-power-generation-capacity-since-2017-yogi-adityanath-101635439247584.html

The case was still pending in the court,” the official said.The CBI officials then collected details about other cases and scanned the documents related to them. “The team also collected documents which here written by Narendra Giri himself. The CBI also took samples of signatures made by Narendra Giri which will be matched by his signature in the purported suicide note,” the official said. It is worth mentioning that CBI is still to receive the forensic report of the suicide note found at the spot where Mahant’s body was found.The CBI team, the official said, has also questioned persons close to Narendra Giri along with persons known to prime accused Anand Giri.

Upon inspecting, it was discovered that no action had been taken against at least 55 structures. Further, an inquiry revealed that by the time they issued notices to building owners, the buildings had either been constructed or were nearing completion, indicating possible collusion. The matter is being investigated,” Sanjiv Singla, joint commissioner, MCG, said.Singla said that show-cause notices have been issued to the officials concerned to explain their version of events.“A few MCG officials and I will be conducting a survey in these areas to ascertain the exact cause behind inaction and verify if there are more such illegal structures where action was evaded,” Singla said.Singla said that the three officials have to submit their answers by the end of this week and if their version of the matter is found to be dissatisfactory, further action would be taken against them as per the law, including the possibility of a vigilance wing probe.A senior official said that they have also received verbal complaints from residents against the three officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/three-mcg-enforcement-officials-under-lens-due-to-inaction-over-55-illegal-constructions-101635438229401.html

However, flats that were occupied were not sealed, officials said.RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement), said that the sealing drive started around 11.30am and continued till evening. “The flats in the complex were constructed without permissions. A complaint on this matter was received by the department after which a detailed investigation was carried out and it was found that these flats were constructed illegally. Notices were issued to the property owners, landowners and other stakeholders seeking explanation how these flats were constructed, but the replies were unsatisfactory,” he said.DTCP officials likened the Rakshak Plaza issue to illegal residential complexes in Sai Lane and Sector 66, for which restoration notices were issued in the past few months.Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner (enforcement), said that an enforcement team carried out the sealing drive with the support of a police contingent. “We have made it clear to the property developers and dealers that no sale or purchase of these flats would be allowed as these are illegal. We also request homebuyers to refrain from buying properties in illegal complexes,” he said.In another matter, a delegation of residents from Malibu Towne called upon Bhath on Thursday morning, requesting that the residents’ versions be heard over the demolition of a few facilities and structures in the township. “We have requested the department that gates, generator and other facilities in the colony have been set up to ensure the safety of residents and such these should not be removed. If there is a need, we can get these regularised,” Vijay Shivnath, an RWA member, said.However, Bhath said that action was taken in the colony after complaints were lodged by the residents themselves. “A memorandum has been submitted by the residents and we will look into the details and necessary action will be taken as per the law. We will ensure that residents don’t face any problem but violations would not be allowed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/vacant-flats-shops-in-rakshak-plaza-sealed-dtcp-deems-constructions-illegal-101635438227621.html
28-10-2021||Gurugram||Waste collection mafia: One booked for extorting money from Palam Vihar residents||The police on Wednesday booked a private waste collection vendor for allegedly extorting money from residents of Palam Vihar for door-to-door garbage collection. According to the police, they are trying to identify 20 such operators, who threaten residents to pay them instead of opting for the authorised waste collection agencies appointed by civic bodies.The Municipal Corporation of Gururgam (MCG) also filed a complaint in this regard, following which the suspect, identified as Naveen Kumar, a resident of Carterpuri village in Sector 23A, a repeat offender, was booked.Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that Kumar was earlier arrested for brutally assaulting a resident after he was stopped from collecting garbage. “He was already lodged in Bhondsi jail and will be taken on production remand. His associates are working on his directions and are threatening residents to pay money to get garbage collected,” he said.A case was registered under sections 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 341 (wrongful restraint), and 384 (extortion) of the Indian Penal Code at Palam Vihar police station on Wednesday.Sangwan said Kumar was not allowing garbage collection vehicles of the MCG to enter the area and that his gang threatened to kill the drivers. “These private vendors have spread their network in the area and are charging residents between ₹100 and ₹500 to get their garbage collected. Those who refuse to pay are assaulted and their lives threatened. We will start taking strict action against anyone indulging in these activities,” he said.According to the police, the gangs hire vehicles to collect garbage and pay the drivers 20% of the total collection.Hari Om Attri, the joint commissioner of MCG (HQ), said that they have also written to their authorised vendors to collect garbage door to door and to complain against anyone hindering their work. “We will reach out to the police if we receive any complaints as this nexus is growing in many areas and it is becoming difficult for the authorised vendors to operate in the area,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/waste-collection-mafia-one-booked-for-extorting-money-from-palam-vihar-residents-101635438167474.html

Malik said that he has been let off probably because he is a friend of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) zonal director Sameer Wankhede. He has also questioned why the cruise ship was released despite having organised the party without any permission.Khan is the managing director of Fashion TV India, according to his LinkedIn profile. Hindustan Times was unable to reach Khan for comment.“NCB claimed that a rave party was about to happen at Cordelia cruise. It was organised by Fashion TV and its India head Kashiff Khan without any permission, then why the cruise was allowed to sail (even after the raid). What is the relation between the organiser and Sameer Wankhede and why no action was taken against him? I am expecting answers from (Sameer) Wankhede,” Malik told reporters and questioned Wankhede’s integrity.Malik has also questioned the background of the organiser. “Why over 1,300 people present at the cruise were not scanned if there was a rave party and only 13 were targeted? We believe the entire case is related to the organiser, who is also Wankhede’s friend,” Malik said.On Wednesday, Malik alleged that Wankhede let an international drug lord, present in the rave party off the hook and instead framed “certain individuals”.Malik has levelled a series of allegations against Wankhede since Aryan Khan, son of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, was arrested by an NCB team that claimed to have busted an alleged drugs party on the Cordelia Cruise ship, which was on its way to Goa on October 3, off the Mumbai coast. A total of 20 people, including two Nigerian nationals, have been arrested so far, in the case. On Thursday, he again reiterated that it is was a false case, after the Bombay high court granted bail to Aryan and two others.“Aryan Khan and two others have been granted bail in the cruise raid case by the Bombay high court. Only yesterday, the other two accused got bail. In such a case, the bail should have been granted by the Esplanade court, but advocates representing the NCB made all the efforts to ensure the jail term of the accused got extended by making new arguments every day. They want to scare them. At last, they got bail. I am repeating this again, it is a false case. They were deliberately framed by (Sameer) Wankhede. The case can be quashed if the accused approaches the high court with evidence,” Malik told reporters.“The officer (Sameer Wankhede) who arrested them has approached the high court with a plea that the Mumbai Police should not be allowed to investigate the complaints against him. Police said if we have to arrest him then a prior notice of 72 hours will be issued in advance. Till yesterday, he was requesting the Mumbai Police not to arrest him and today he approached the high court. He had requested security from the Mumbai Police and now what has changed within a week that he lost his faith in Mumbai Police. It is a fact that he has done forgery, and thus is scared of the police,” he added.On Wednesday, Malik said he had proof that an international drug lord was present at the Cordelia cruise rave party along with his girlfriend, but the NCB team, led by Wankhede, chose to let him off, as the drug lord was his “friend”. Malik claimed he has the pictures and video footage to corroborate this and could share them with the NCB if the agency approached him.The high profile matter took a further twist when Prabhakar Sail, a witness in the case, alleged on Sunday that Wankhede and some other NCB officers had sought ₹25 crore from actor Shah Rukh Khan as extortion money to release Aryan. Following Sail’s allegation, a vigilance probe was ordered into Wankhede’s conduct and Mumbai Police too started a probe in this matter.Malik has maintained that the rave party was organised without any permission including from the Mumbai Police or the state home department. The only permission they had was from the director-general (DG), shipping.Meanwhile, the OBC cell of BJP has announced to stage agitation at the party’s Nariman Point office on Friday under the leadership of OBC morcha chief Narendra Gaokar. Party’s vice-president Chitra Wagh too has condemned Malik for revealing personal information of the first wife of Wankhede. “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray takes action for the remarks on Twitter, but in this case, where a woman is being publicly insulted, he has maintained silence. This has been time and again witnessed in the country, that whenever Congress comes to the power Dalits and backward classes are targeted,” she said. On Thursday, the state NCP chief Jayant Patil stood by Malik and said that the charges against Kiran Gosavi, who is also one of the witnesses in Aryan Khan case, and allegations of extortion by Sail are serious in nature. He also said that NCB is harassing and defaming people and Malik is trying to prove misuse of the central agencies in Maharashtra.“(Kiran) Gosavi has been arrested for cheating. He was also part of the raid and is also accused of extortion to the tune of ₹18 crore to ₹25 crore in the Aryan Khan case. The accusation was made by one of his colleagues. Both the offences are serious in nature. In the entire matter, political misuse of NCB is also coming to the fore as similar things have happened with Malik’s relative (son-in-law Sameer Khan who was arrested by NCB for alleged possession of drugs). Today whatever Nawab Malik is saying is with evidence and it shows the entire NCB action is to defame and harass people by putting them behind the bars. Today it is about Shah Rukh Khan’s son and it may have happened with others as well, thus it requires a detailed probe,” Patil told reporters.He said that the investigation will help in bringing out the fact that Wankhede used a fake caste certificate to get a government job as an IRS (Indian Revenue Service) officer.“The point Nawab Malik is trying to make here is that the central agencies such as the income tax (I-T), Enforcement Directorate (ED) or NCB are being misused for harassing and defaming people and this need to be seen objectively and the evidence appeared so far need to be probed,” he pointed out.He also said that they are expecting the NCB vigilance team that arrived in Mumbai to investigate the charges against Wankhede will work to bring out the facts and not to conceal them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/why-no-action-was-taken-against-organisers-of-cruise-rave-party-nawab-malik-asks-101635437567826.html

This will not only help control carbon emission but also floods,” said Sandeep Malvi, additional commissioner, TMC.At present, the city witnesses 1.02 metric ton equivalent carbon dioxide emissions per person.“Based on the current carbon emission and the number of tons each initiative will help reduce, we have an approximate figure planned. Around 5.11 lakh ton of carbon emission can be reduced by the year 2025-26 if we look at 2017-18 as the base year of these initiatives. We have accordingly prepared a plan that will be executed in various departments including solid waste management, transport, residential, industrial and government buildings, streetlights, water supply, disaster management and biodiversity,” said an officer from the Pollution Control Department.As per TMC, 2,65,604 tons reduction in solid waste management, 2,45,562 tons residential and industrial buildings, transport department can reduce around 15,677.28 tons, streetlights will reduce 6,443 tons, government building reduces 947 tons, water supply can reduce 9,611 tons, disaster management and health department will reduce 49.44 tons of carbon emission.Under Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray’s leadership, 43 AMRUT cities from Maharashtra have joined the UN Race to Zero.

He said the officer was removed from Darbhanga earlier after complaints against him and was transferred to Bagaha. “But the DSP was purposely brought back to Darbhanga on deputation as part of conspiracy to influence polls. We had complained to the EC about his deputation on October 23, but the state administration made him in-charge of 25 booths only recently, ignoring the poll panel. What is surprising there is no notification of his deputation from Bagaha in all websites concerned we searched. This means his posting was done in a hush-hush manner,” Yadav said. The opposition leader also demanded that the EC deploy adequate central paramilitary force at all booths in Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur, where bypolls are to be held on October 30. Yadav’s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the ruling Janata Dal (United) are locked in a tight fight in the two seats. Meanwhile, on Thursday evening, RJD leader and Rajya Sabha member Manoj Jha met the Chief Election Commissioner in New Delhi while party delegation met Bihar’s Chief Electoral officer H R Srinivasa in Patna to highlight the posting of alleged tainted officers and demand their removal from election duty. When contacted, Srinivasa confirmed that an RJD delegation had met him but declined to elaborate. RJD’s state spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwary, who was part of the state delegation, said the CEO assured them of adequate deployment of paramilitary force both in Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-bypolls-dsp-removed-from-poll-duty-after-tejashwi-s-red-flag-101635437212281.html

However, they would be required to take all precautionary measures against the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to the suspension of such physical meetings on March 22, 2020.According to sources, more than 2,000 prisoners had written a letter to inspector general (prisons) Mithilesh Mishra before Durga Puja, requesting for resumption of physical mulaqats (meetings) in jail and had threatened to go on hunger strike from October 28 if their demands were not met.On Thursday, hundreds of prisoners, including 50 Maoists, went on hunger strike to press their demand of resumption of physical meetings with their family members and permission for outside food, as was the norm before outbreak of Covid. The agitated prisoners alleged they could not even talk privately with their spouses during e-mulaquat system. Following their hunger strike, the Beur administration allowed outside edible items and the IG assured them to fulfil the demand at the earliest. During the pandemic, family members were allowed to speak to inmates through video calls via a system called e-Mulaquat, introduced last year by the Bihar government. Prisoners are allowed “e-mulaqat” with family members thrice a month for 15 minutes each.However, several inmates complained of long waiting hours and denial of permission to their family members despite having registered themselves with valid IDs. A jail official, on the condition of anonymity, said prisoners often suffered mentally and psychologically because of long incarceration pending trial. “These problems aggravated during the pandemic. These physical meetings, where they can see their family members and advocates will help them feel better,” he said.The total capacity of prisons in Bihar is 46,669, while the number of inmates had gone past 72,823 till August 30, as per official data. In Patna’s Beur Model Prison, the number of inmates has reached 5,110 against its capacity of 2,360.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-hunger-strike-prisoners-in-bihar-allowed-to-meet-kin-get-outside-food-101635437210725.html

However, the BMC has appealed to senior citizens and children below 5 years of age to avoid visiting the zoo in view of Covid-19. According to the BMC, citizens can visit it between 9.30am and 6pm, however the issuing of tickets for entry will be stopped by 4pm, unlike the earlier 5.15pm. In a statement the BMC said, “Senior citizens and children below the age of five should avoid visiting gardens and zoo. Masking while in the public area will be mandatory for visitors and they also will not be allowed to store their belongings as the facility for storage in the zoo for the public is temporarily closed. Visitors are also appealed to not throw away their single-use masks and gloves if required in the premises but only in the designated disposal bins placed.” The BMC has further said that gates and ticket counters will be shut immediately, in case of crowding at any given time owing to following social distancing norms due to Covid-19. Further, the zoo opening up its gates once again would also mean that the public can expect to get the first glimpse of the two new additions to the colony of Humboldt penguins. Of the two penguin chicks born this year, one has been identified as a male who is named Oreo, the gender of the other chick is still to be determined. The zoo authorities are in touch with a Hyderabad based-diagnostic centre for it. The Byculla zoo was opened on February 15 this year, after the first Covid wave, but was shut in no time owing to concerns related to the second Covid wave. Besides penguins, citizens will also be able to catch a glimpse of the Royal Bengal tigers named Shakti and Karishma, which were brought from Siddharth Garden and Zoo in Maharashtra’s Aurangabad city in February 2020, just before the country went under a nationwide lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-byculla-zoo-to-open-it-gates-from-november-1-101635435768688.html

The Thane Anti Extortion Cell had arrested Jalan in 2018 in connection with an alleged betting racket.“Since Singh’s whereabouts are unknown and we are receiving multiple reports about him being in various locations in India and abroad, we had sought the warrant so that if and when he is arrested, bringing him back to Thane for inquiries would be easier. A non-bailable warrant provides enough basis for a local magistrate to grant transit remand to the investigating agency,” an officer with the Thane Nagar police station said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-sessions-court-issues-non-bailable-warrant-against-parambir-101635435767476.html

Patel was a panch in a few cases registered by the NCB previously.The senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Nawab Malik had tweeted a few days ago, attaching the front page of three separate panchnamas signed by Patel as a panch witness. Malik had alleged that Patel was also a friend of NCB’s zonal director Sameer Wankhede. “Vigilance team of NCB had summoned me and accordingly, I appeared before the team in Bandra,” said Patel. “They only asked me regarding a case number 94/21 — the cruise drug bust case in which Aryan Khan has been arrested. But I am not a witness in that particular case,” he added. He added that the NCB vigilance team asked him a few more questions, as to how I came in contact with Wankhede and that he replied that a few years ago we met at a function through a common friend. Being an ex-serviceman, whenever asked, I extend help to various government agencies, he added. The NCB vigilance team on Thursday also interviewed and recorded the statement of advocate RB Gupta, the notary before whom Prabhakar Sail, a panch witness in the cruise ship drug bust case, has affirmed his revealing affidavit. The vigilance team visited Gupta’s office at Wadala in the afternoon and brought him to CISF Mess at Bandra to record his statement, said an NCB officer. NCB has initiated the vigilance enquiry after Sail, who claims to be the personal guard of Kiran Gosavi - a key witness in the cruise drug bust case revealed in a notarised affidavit that he overheard Gosavi talking to another person about ₹18-crore deal, of which ₹8 crore was alleged to be paid to Wankhede. Sail also alleged that as per the direction of Gosavi, he collected two bags containing ₹50 lakh from an individual after the raid at the cruise ship and handed the bags over to Gosavi at his residence in Vashi. Subsequently, he handed over an amount of ₹38 lakh to another person. Sail was present at Green Gate when the NCB team led by Wankhede searched guests set to board a holiday cruise set to sail for Goa. He claimed that all the panchnamas were recorded at the NCB office, where the agency’s officers took his signatures on several blank papers. On Wednesday, one more panch witness in another NCB case has revealed that the agency officials had forced him to sign some blank papers, some of which were used to prepare panchnama.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/drugsoncruise-case-ncb-records-statement-of-fletcher-patel-101635435227583.html

Visitors from far flung areas dropped in to become a part of the one-of-its-kind event. “People’s response to the event is overwhelming. We never thought that the products would be in such great demand. We our thankful to the UP government and especially those people who accepted our concept that aimed at generating employment and utilising cow dung creatively. This will help check people from abandoning their cows,” said Lakshman Patra, sangathan mantri, Sahkar Bharti (a cooperative) that set up one of the stalls at the venue. Among other products, Lakshmi-Ganesh idols were in demand. “Due to the upcoming festival of light, idols of Lakshmi-Ganesh are in demand,” said Anuradha Srivastana, motivator\trainer of a self help group, associated with Sahkar Bharti. She said the work of preparing artefacts from cow dung started a couple of years back. “We started the work in order to generate employment and also check the abandoning of cattle. When people will get money for the dung, they won’t abandon animals that have completed their lactating cycle,” she added.So far, around 1,700 self help groups (SHGs) associated with Sahkar Bharti are making several products. “Initially, the cost of 1 kg cow dung was ₹5. Now, when the demand increased, the cost is up to ₹40. Through innovation, women associated with the SHGs are generating ₹150 to ₹250 a day,” she added. “Before coming across these products, we never thought that something can be prepared from cow dung,” said Sudha Sharma, a housewife who thronged the stall along with her family members. Several similar stalls remained crowded on the day. The Diwali fest is an initiative of the district administration and LMC. Gomti Arti and a grand laser show highlighting the UP government’s achievements were part of the Mela. The Nawabi era Chhattar Manzil was used as a canvas for the laser show. “It’s a good initiative. After the pandemic situation, this was a much needed relief that will help people unwind themselves,” said Praveen Mishra, a private employee, who visited the fest. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/cow-dung-diya-stalls-a-major-attraction-at-diwali-mela-venue-101635434687450.html

For a few months now, the group had been working towards beautifying the Lotus Lake in Nerul. Advocate Pardeep Patole, one of the active members of the group, had filed a PIL and had got a favourable order that directed the local body to clear the debris and encroachment. Last week, NMMC cleared the encroachment after which the volunteers in the group decided to plant trees at the place. Around 35 native plants were planted in the area around the lake by the volunteers of the group.“Apart from making sure that the encroachers don’t return, the plants will add to the beauty of the lake. We would continue to take up the issue with the NMMC till the illegal chestnut farming in the lake is stopped. The lake that once bloomed with lotuses has none blooming due to the chestnuts,” Patole said.He added that the staff from the garden department of NMMC supported the drive by digging pits for them to plant.Dharmesh Barai from NGO, Environment Life group, said, “Instead of artificial beautification of the lake, it should be natural. We would soon get the water tested to find if there are any chemicals in it. The plantation will act as a boundary wall and will protect the lake.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nerul-residents-on-plantation-drive-to-protect-lotus-lake-101635434212298.html

They have now come down by 5%. “Green leafy vegetables were the ones that were hit the most by the rates. But now, the rates are going down and by post Diwali, it will go down even more,” Shankar Pinglay, director of APMC vegetable market, said.The rates of coriander leaves in wholesale were around ₹50 to ₹60 in the beginning of the month and they were being sold at ₹100 by retailers. The rates of coriander leaves have now come down to ₹35 to ₹45 while some of the retailers continue to charge ₹100 for the same. A few have come down to ₹60.“Due to the increase in price, very few are purchasing coriander leaves and hence we too get very less for the sale. Prices of other greens like methi, palak and vegetables like lady’s finger, capsicum, green peas, onion too have increased,” Ali Kazi, a vegetable retailer from Nerul said.Meanwhile, the residents who have been burning a hole in their pocket by purchasing the vegetables claim that even if the wholesale market rates go down, the retailers continue to charge higher prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vegetable-prices-drop-by-5-at-apmc-market-in-navi-mumbai-101635432951888.html

28-10-2021||Mumbai||Cycle track at Powai Lake: Experts, activists not convinced with officials’ assurance||The past two months have seen a flurry of activities surrounding the construction of a cycle track at Powai Lake by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Citizens have written to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, asking that the plan be nixed, while political parties have opposed the project. A public interest litigation (PIL) has also been filed in Bombay high court (HC) by two researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B), while a Mumbai-based non-governmental organisation (NGO) has petitioned the National Green Tribunal (NGT) against the project. There have been multiple protests by citizens at the site, and the forest department has responded to the controversy by saying, for the first time, that the lake is a wetland and must be protected as such.State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, along with officials and experts involved, are urging environmentalists to reconsider their stance, pointing out that the project’s broader vision also includes restoration of the water body – a long-standing public demand – and the first ever baseline study of Indian marsh crocodiles, which inhabit the lake. Thackeray has also publicly said that not a single tree – of the about 71 that lie in the path of the cycle track – will be cut. Adverse impacts to biodiversity have been a foremost concern of environmentalists.Speaking to HT, additional municipal commissioner (projects) P Velarasu described the cycle track proposal as a place-making exercise, which will lead to the creation of valuable public space in the city’s eastern suburbs. “If you look at south Mumbai, there is Marine Drive and Worli Seaface. In western suburbs, there is Juhu and Bandra. But the eastern and central suburbs – where real estate development is concentrated and population is booming – do not have an equivalent space. That’s what we are trying to create, as an alternative to malls and other forms of indoor recreation,” he said.Officials also cited the example of other Indian cities with prominent urban lakes, such as Hyderabad, Bhopal and Bangalore, which have been developed into free, accessible public spaces. “Every lake in every city around the world has been protected by making use of it as an urban, open space that is natural. It is a model of sustainable development,” said Thackeray, in response to a question by HT.Emphasising that the ecological integrity of Powai Lake is paramount, Thackeray added, “I’m an environmentalist too, and that’s what the Powai Lake rejuvenation project is about. Currently, the lake is dead ecologically. It has sewage ingress from properties surrounding it, and certain illegal constructions have been brought to our notice. The cycle track will be an important intervention. Contrary to what is being alleged, it will protect the lake from encroachments and incentivise proper environmental management. To refuse to see the project in this light, and then to spread lies, is a disgraceful act in the name of environmentalism.”Of about 38 inlets currently letting raw sewage into the lake, six have already been closed by BMC. The cycle track, which consists of a gabion structure made of rocks, will also be lined with over 2,000 indigenous trees. Instead of gabion structures, BMC had considered using other materials such as timber, steel and concrete, but decided against them owing to the disturbance they might cause to the environment. As per an estimate provided by BMC to the heritage conservation committee, the project will stand to benefit around 10 million citizens. BMC has also deployed six devices to monitor the lake’s oxygen levels, in addition to one aeration barge. Another seven aeration fountains are proposed to be installed.A senior expert involved with the project, seeking anonymity of name, highlighted that Mumbai currently has only 0.9 square metres (sq m) of developed open space per person, far lower than the 10-12 sq m recommended in the Centre’s Urban and Regional Development Plans Formulation and Implementation Guidelines. “The existing land use study for Mumbai, undertaken pursuant to the 2034 development plan, shows that we can increase this to about 1.1 sq m per person if certain open spaces are developed to allow public access. Powai Lake is one such space,” the expert said. For comparison, the United Kingdom has about 20 sq m of developed open space per person, while in the United States of America, it is 24 sq m. “In a city where we are so strapped for room, the Powai Lake project will serve a greater public good,” the expert added. Environmentalists and even urban planners, however, remain staunch in their scepticism of the project, which can be traced back to 2016 proposal by BMC, titled ‘Green Wheels Along Blue Lines’. This proposal involved building a 39-km long, fenced jogging and cycling track to replace informal housing settlements along the Tansa pipeline, which were demolished in 2016 as per an HC order. In fact, the Powai Lake cycle track will be connected with an older track that exists parallel to the Tansa pipeline, as per drawings accessed by HT.Hussain Indorewala, architect and researcher with the Collective for Spatial Alternatives, highlighted that the project does not promote sustainable transport. “It will encourage only cycling for leisure. It’s not the same as building cycle tracks on arterial city roads, which would be a more effective way of reducing vehicular pollution. So perhaps the purpose is recreation and beautification, not sustainable mobility. But even for such projects, there has to be a careful study and mapping of existing land uses, socio-ecological impacts and cost-benefit analysis. Have the project proponents studied whether the cycle track will disrupt existing land use, such as fishing or collecting fodder? These assessments should be done beforehand, not only because it’s required by law, but as a matter of good practice,” he said.Others pointed out that despite BMC’s “noble” intentions, important details regarding the project have been shrouded in mystery. Official plans and budgets have not been placed in the public domain, and BMC has not solicited any public feedback or hearings, as it would mandatorily have to for any other project covered under the Centre’s environment impact assessment (EIA) notification. “Our fear is that the cycle track will reduce the contours of Powai Lake and open up lands around the lake for development. If the project is truly in public interest, then why should BMC be reluctant to take citizens into confidence? It is being built using taxpayers’ money after all,” said Amrita Bhattacharjee, environmentalist who has worked with the Save Aarey movement and has been campaigning against the cycle track.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cycle-track-at-powai-lake-experts-activists-not-convinced-with-officials-assurance-101635432047072.html
28-10-2021||Mumbai||Ulhasnagar residents fear no steps taken to resolve slab collapse incidents||Despite 13 people losing their lives in the last six months to various slab collapse incidents in Ulhasnagar, residents continue to live in fear as no major steps are being taken to resolve the issue.On Wednesday midnight at around 12.15 am, a portion of the slab above entry gate of the Sherawali Kunj Building near Yatriniwas Garden in Ulhasnagar Camp 2 collapsed. Following this, 10 families vacated the building.Though the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC) has started to identify, audit and vacate such structures in the city, the work undertaken is at a very slow pace and hence not effective in controlling such collapses, complained the residents.A slab collapse in the five-storey Paras Building located at Gandhi Nagar in Ulhasnagar Camp 5 killed a 25-year-old resident, Akash Poptani.Earlier in May, in two separate slab collapse incidents, a total of 12 residents were killed. Followed by the two incidents in May, around 1,500 buildings in Ulhasnagar built during 1994-98 using low quality sand were served notices to carry out the structural audit.The civic body has also formed a panel of structural engineers to carry out the structural audit of unsafe buildings. UMC announced to bear the cost of the audit for 116 of the 179 listed buildings that fall in the C1, C2A, C2B and C3 as per the inspection carried out by the panel.Apart from these, thousands of buildings are still to get the audit done.Kajal Mulchandani, a 35-year-old resident and social activist from Ulhasnagar, said, “The civic body has initiated some action in the city after the two incidents in May. However, there are no major changes in the situation. UMC, though, had served notices to 1,500 buildings to carry out structural audits; there is no clarity on how many have actually done it. There should be a constant effort from the civic body to get it done.”UMC civic chief, Raja Dayanidhi, claimed that the civic body is prioritising those buildings that are extremely dangerous or in the dangerous category and need to be repaired or vacated immediately.“The other buildings that were sent notices are also given regular reminders to get the audit done. The residents are, however, reluctant to do the audit claiming they cannot spend on the audit. There are a lot of such hurdles from the residents’ side due to which the audit of all these 1,500 buildings is stuck,” he added.Social activist, Sashikant Dayma, claimed that the problem is with the material used for construction of the building and not how old the buildings are, and the UMC is losing this focus. “Paras Building, whose slab collapsed, was not in the list of 1,500 buildings. So, what is the point of this list?”MP Shrikant Shinde claimed that a dedicated cluster policy for the city is in the pipeline. “Once the policy is sanctioned, the residents can go for regularisation and redevelopment of their respective buildings. Ulhasnagar city has no empty space compared to other cities like Thane. In Ulhasnagar, because of the space constraints, we’ll have to impose a separate policy. The government will finalise a policy by November.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ulhasnagar-residents-fear-no-steps-taken-to-resolve-slab-collapse-incidents-101635431992584.html
28-10-2021||Lucknow||2022 UP polls: Priyanka to address rally in Gorakhpur on Oct 31||After launching her party’s election campaign early this month in Varanasi, the Lok Sabha constituency of PM Narendra Modi, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is set to address a public rally at Gorakhpur on October 31.As Gorakhpur, the seat of Gorakhnath Math, is considered chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s area of dominance, the rally is going to draw a major attention. Her rally will also be the Congress’ second major political event in Purvanchal region after the Varanasi rally held on October 10.“Yes, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will address a rally in Gorakhpur on October 31. Senior Congress leaders, including Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) president Ajay Kumar Lallu, are camping for the rally in Gorakhpur,” said a senior Congress leader aware of the efforts being made for mobilisation of people for the Gorakhpur rally.“Yes, Congress will challenge chief minister Yogi Adityanath is his bastion. There is a great enthusiasm among the people about the rally. The Congress worked for the sugarcane growers in Purvanchal region by setting up sugar mills. It also set up canals to take water of the Gandak for irrigation and also worked for poverty alleviation in the region. The non-Congress governments have, however, pushed the area on path of backwardness and we will bring development in the region,” said UPCC president Ajay Kumar Lallu.Priyanka, who addressed “Kisan Nyay” rally in Varanasi and launched her party’s three “Pratigya Yatras” in Barabanki this month, is expected to focus her campaign on the BJP government’s failures in her party’s bid to reach out to the people of Purvanchal region and present the Congress as an alternative in 2022 UP assembly elections.The Congress also proposes to launch its fourth “Pratigya Yatra” from Gorakhpur after Diwali to take promises Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has made and will make to the people ahead of the 2022 UP polls.Besides promising 40 percent Congress tickets to women, the party has also announced smartphones to 12th class pass girls, electric scooties to graduate girls, 50 percent cut on power bills, waiver of power dues of Covid-19 period, a financial assistance of ₹25,000 for the poor families hit by Covid-19 and up to ₹10 lakh free treatment in government hospitals for patients suffering from any ailment.A promise of ₹2500 per quintal minimum support price for wheat and paddy and ₹400 per quintal state advised price for sugarcane has also been made to the farmers in addition to the promise of farm loan waver. “We feel there is a lot of excitement about the Gorakhpur rally. It’s going to be a big success and issues like rising unemployment and inflation and those concerning farmers etc are going to come into focus at the rally,” said senior Congress leader and former union minister RPN Singh.“This is election time and what the Congress is doing now should have been done much earlier. The Congress needs to change its electoral strategies and must explore options for an alliance with like-minded parties to make a mark in 2022 assembly elections,” said professor SK Dwivedi, former professor, political science, Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/2022-up-polls-priyanka-to-address-rally-in-gorakhpur-on-oct-31-101635431026895.html
28-10-2021||Patna||Bihar DSP removed from election duty in Kusheshwar Asthan after RJD redflag||PATNA: Days ahead of Saturday’s bypoll, a deputy superintendent of police, or DSP-rank officer Dilip Kumar Jha, was removed from election duty in Kusheshwar Asthan on orders of the Election Commission, people familiar with the matter said. The decision to remove the officer came after the opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal led a sharp campaign, accusing the official of acting in a partisan manner and claiming that he was recently posted at Biraul sub-division as a part of an effort to influence polls.Dilip Kumar Jha has been replaced by another officer on the orders of the senior superintendent of police following EC’s intervention in the matter, a person aware of the development said on condition of anonymity. Jha could not be contacted for his comments.RJD leader and leader of opposition in the assembly Tejashwi Yadav fronted his party’s opposition to the officer, pointing that he was transferred from Darbhanga a few months back after complaints against the officer and sent to Bagaha in Pashchim Champaran 200km away.“But the DSP was brought back to Darbhanga on deputation as part of a conspiracy to influence polls. We complained to EC about his deputation on October 23 but the state administration still made him in charge of 25 booths only recently. What is surprising is there is no notification of his deputation from Bagaha though we have searched in all websites concerned. This means that the posting of the officer was done in a hush-hush manner,” Tejaswi Yadav said.Yadav, who also sought deployment of additional central forces, said the RJD was being careful about such matters for the bypolls.“We have been victims of deceit and manipulation in assembly polls last year. We are alert this time and want the election to be fair,” the 31-year-old, widely seen as RJD founder Lalu Yadav’s political heir, said.The Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal (U) and RJD are locked in an intense fight in bypolls on the two seats, Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur, necessitated due to the death of the MLAs.In the national Capital, an RJD delegation led by Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Jha also approached the Election Commission while a third team met Bihar’s chief electoral officer HR Srinivasa in Patna to seek removal of partisan officers from poll duty.Asked about the RJD complaints, chief electoral officer HR Srinivasa said an RJD delegation met him pertaining to the posting of some officers on election duty and other demands. He, however, declined to comment further.RJD’s state spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwary, who was part of the delegation that met Srinivasa, said the state’s top election official assured them of adequate deployment of central forces at polling booths in two constituencies. “ We have been also assured that matter regarding the deputation of DSP Dilip Kumar Jha would be looked into,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-dsp-removed-from-election-duty-in-kusheshwar-asthan-after-rjd-redflag-101635430247326.html
28-10-2021||Lucknow||BJP has forgotten promise to distribute laptops: Akhilesh Yadav||Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav on Thursday accused the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of forgetting its poll promise to provide laptops to meritorious students in Uttar Pradesh even though the Yogi Adityanath government had completed four-and-a-half years in power.Akhilesh Yadav was speaking at a programme organised to honour meritorious students at Durga Inter College in his parliamentary constituency Azamgarh in eastern Uttar Pradesh.After addressing the gathering, Akhilesh distributed laptops to the meritorious students who excelled in class 10 and 12.“The students sitting in front of me are meritorious. When their results were declared, I thought the BJP government will honour them because the BJP had promised to give tablets and laptops to meritorious students who opt for further studies. It had also said data will be provided free and some institutes will be connected to free wi-fi facility,” Akhilesh Yadav said. “The BJP has completed four-and-a-half years in power. Now, UP’s 24 crore people want to know when the BJP government will give laptops to meritorious students,” he said. “Today, I read in newspapers that they are going to give some tablets. I want to know which tablet they have been giving to the children for the last four-and-a-half years?” the SP chief said.He also said that the new generation needed gadgets for acquiring knowledge and the SP government gave them laptops during its tenure.“When the laptops distributed during the SP’s tenure are turned on even today, the pictures of netaji (Mulayam Singh Yadav) and me appear on the screen. No one else appears there.” The SP chief said that now that he (Akhilesh) is distributing free laptops, the chief minister is quite worried about who is coming to power in UP 2022. If the CM turns on the Samajwadi laptops, he will get to know who is coming to power in the state, the SP chief said. “But our chief minister will not operate the laptop, because he doesn’t know how to do so,” he claimed.He alleged that quality of the construction of expressways in Uttar Pradesh had deteriorated. Hitting out at the government for inflation and rising fuel prices, he said, “This government is indicating to everyone the need to ride bicycles.” Alleging that a minister’s son mowed down four farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri earlier this month (October 3), Akhilesh said in future, they may crush the Constitution.Eight people, including four farmers, were killed in Lakhimpur Kheri district of Uttar Pradesh on October 3. Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni’s son Ashish Mishra is one of the accused who have been arrested in the case.He accused the present government of ruining the 102 and 108 ambulance services.Reacting to Akhilesh Yadav’s allegations, BJP Kashi region spokesperson Navratan Rathi said, “SP chief Akhilesh Yadav should know that the BJP is working continuously to fulfil its poll promises. Most of the promises, which were made in the poll manifesto, have already been completed in the last four-and-a-half years. As far as distributing laptops and tablets concerned, tablets and smartphones will be given to the students soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-has-forgotten-promise-to-distribute-laptops-akhilesh-yadav-101635429946936.html

Mandi, which is the second largest Lok Sabha constituency in the country after Barmer in Rajasthan, also boasts of the world’s highest polling station, which stands at an altitude of 15,256 feet above sea level. A polling station had been set up in the tiny hamlet for the first time during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Sub-divisional magistrate Mahender Pratap Singh said, “We are proud to have the highest polling station in the world. We have decided to decorate the polling station, which has been set up in a government building, to welcome voters.” Villagers are also excited to cast their vote and have decided to dress in their traditional attires to celebrate the festival of democracy, the SDM said. The village, which is close to the Chinese border, has 47 voters, of which 29 are men and 18 are women. Agriculture is the mainstay of the villagers. Booths at great heightsIn the Jubbal-Kotkahi assembly, Adail village, which is situated 8,500 feet above sea level, is the highest polling booth in the assembly, while Pambad (6,204 above sea level) is the highest polling booth under the Arki assembly segment and Agahar (2,100 ft) holds the distinction in the Fatehpur assembly. The hill state has numerous remote areas and Shaakti in GHNP under the Banjar assembly in Kullu district (Mandi Lok Sabha constituency) is the most far-flung polling station and the polling party will have to trek 24 kilometres on foot to reach the booth. In the Fatehpur segment, Sath-Kuthera in Kangra required the polling parties to trek 6km while in the Jubbal-Kotkhai segment, Dhansar was the most far-flung booth, requiring a 2-km trek. Tough topographyHimachal Pradesh chief electoral officer C Paulrasu said, “Special arrangements have been made to transport EVM machines to the polling stations located at high altitudes. As many as 40 electronic voting machines and Voter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) machines have been sent to Kaza of Lahaul-Spiti district under the Mandi parliamentary constituency through helicopters amid tight security.These EVMs and VVPAT machines will be used in 29 polling stations set up in Kaza. “The Mandi parliamentary constituency has a tough topography as it constitutes remote tribal areas and moreover there is chance of fresh snowfall in the higher reaches. We have asked the administration to deploy adequate men and machinery to ensure smooth polling in these areas,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mandi-bypoll-voters-to-deck-up-in-traditional-attire-at-tashigang-world-s-highest-polling-station-101635428747127.html

Gosavi, according to Pune police, was arrested in the case lodged four years ago. He was on the run and introduced himself as Sachin Patil during his stay in Lucknow, Jabalpur, Hyderabad and Fatehpur, police said.“Gosavi was projecting himself as a member of Stop Crime NGO and CIBCA detective agency. He also claimed to run an export-import business. We were searching for him based on his social media photos,” Amitabh Gupta, Pune Police commissioner told HT.He said that the Pune Police earlier arrested Gosavi’s assistant, Sherbano Kureshi, in the cheating case. The case pertains to allegations of Gosavi cheating Chinmay Deshmukh of ₹3.09 lakh under the pretext of getting him a job in Malaysia. The police said that the recipient of the money was Sherbano Kureshi. On 2019, the Pune Police filed the chargesheet in the case.The Pune Police denied any relation between the arrest and the ongoing controversy regarding Gosavi’s presence in the cruise ship during the raids carried out by NCB following which actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan, Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha were arrested for alleged possession of drugs. All three were granted bail by the Bombay high court on Thursday and are expected to walk out of jail on Saturday.Earlier, a lookout notice was also issued to prevent Gosavi from leaving the country.

Singh was in three-day police custody from Thursday morning to Sunday morning.Two separate FIRs—the first for mowing down of four farmers and the second regarding the killing of four others — were registered at the Tikunia police station after the October 3 incident. In the first case, 13 people including the minister’s son had been arrested so far.A police official said SIT members questioned Singh for over six hours. The investigators remained mainly focused on extracting details of other people involved in the attack on BJP workers and setting ablaze the two vehicles present in the convoy of union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra.The SIT was also likely to take Gurwinder to the site of incident on Friday to recreate the sequence of events to connect the missing links between the mowing down of four farmers and the ensuing violence, said the official. On October 3, violence had erupted after Ashish Mishra’s car allegedly mowed down four farmers near Banbirpur village under Tikunia police station limits of Lakhimpur Kheri. Four others, including two BJP workers, Shubham Mishra and Shyam Sunder, journalist Raman Kashyap and Hari Om Mishra, the driver of Ashish Mishra’s car were also killed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lakhimpur-violence-accused-quizzed-about-others-involved-in-killing-of-bjp-workers-journalist-and-driver-101635426226643.html

28-10-2021||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai house help, family arrested for extorting Rs4L from Ulwe employer in fake rape case||The NRI Coastal police have arrested a 19-year-old house help and her family along with a social worker for extorting ₹4 lakh from her employer in Ulwe after filing an alleged fake rape case.Dipesh Tripathi, a resident of Ulwe Sector 20, has been arrested by the NRI police for the alleged rape. On October 18, Prajakta Tripathi (38), a resident of Ulwe, had hired a 19-year-old as house help and on the same day asked her to accompany her husband to the market.Later in the day, the help approached NRI Coastal police and registered a case of rape against Tripathi claiming that he had given her spiked drink and raped her in his car for an hour, following which he was arrested.“From the CCTV footage, we found that she was with him in the car for 22 minutes and visited four shops as well. When Tripathi’s wife was approached by a social worker claiming to ‘settle’ the case, our suspicion was confirmed,” senior police inspector Ravindra Patil from NRI Coastal police station said.The social worker told Prajakta that the house help’s family was in touch with her and was ready to take back the case if they paid ₹10 lakh, which was negotiated to ₹4 lakh.On Tuesday, the case of extortion was registered against the house help, her mother, brother, a relative and the social worker after the police verified all the call recordings given by Prajakta. All the five accused were nabbed red-handed while accepting the money.“Tripathi is still in our custody and we would soon file a ‘B’ Summary report in court for the case being a false one,” Patil said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-house-help-family-arrested-for-extorting-rs4l-from-ulwe-employer-in-fake-rape-case-101635424546844.html
28-10-2021||Mumbai||Thane court issues non-bailable warrant against ex-Mumbai top cop Param Bir Singh||A court in Thane on Thursday issued a non-bailable warrant against former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh in an extortion case registered earlier this year.The development came hours after the crime branch of the Mumbai Police moved an application in the Sessions Court to issue a non-bailable warrant against its previous top boss in the case. The court will hear case on Friday.Maharashtra: A court in Thane has issued non-bailable warrant against former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh in the extortion case pic.twitter.com/kKnbkieS44The crime branch claimed that the IPS officer was untraceable. On Monday, the Maharashtra government informed that it had started a process to declare Singh as absconding. A case of extortion was registered on July 23 against Singh, Sachin Waze, who was dismissed from the forces, and others at the Goregaon Police Station in the city, following which the investigation was handed over to the crime branch.Singh had earlier alleged that former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh had indulged in "malpractices" and asked suspended Waze- and other officers to collect ₹100 crore every month from restaurants and bars in the country's financial capital.Also read | Mumbai ex-top cop Param Bir Singh may have fled India using forged passport: Probe agenciesHe had made the allegations in a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray days after he was shunted out from the top job, following which Deshmukh, a leader of the Nationalist Congress Party, put in his papers as the minister, although he denied the accusations. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) are probing the allegations made against Deshmukh by Singh.Recently, Thackeray said there was a case in the state where the complainant had gone missing."…Today we have a case where the complainant is missing. He gave a complaint making serious allegations, but is now missing. We do not know where he is. This is something that also needs to be looked into," he said. Although the chief minister did not name anyone, his remarks were apparently targeted at the senior IPS officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-court-issues-nbw-against-ex-mumbai-top-cop-param-bir-singh-101635423726896.html
28-10-2021||Mumbai||Thane civic body starts door-to-door survey to take stock of people vaccinated||The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has started a door-to-door survey to understand how many in the city have been vaccinated.Although the TMC has inoculated more than 16 lakh beneficiaries with at least one dose of the vaccine, there are many who have not received even a single dose. Within the first few days of the survey, it has come to light that 33.03% of the vaccine-eligible population within the city has not received even the first dose of vaccine.“We started this survey from Monday in different parts of the city. Irrespective of the social or economic situation, we noticed that there are a few who aren’t keen on taking the vaccine. In areas where we noted more such people, we set up a small centre within the society premises. However, the reluctance to vaccinate persisted among the residents. This week, with the help of religious leaders of different faiths, we have set up a mass vaccination drive in Mumbra. Gradually, we shall focus on other wards in the city as well,” said Sandeep Malvi, additional commissioner, TMC.A team of four in every ward is visiting homes within slums as well as high rises in order to get a figure as to how many have been fully vaccinated or not vaccinated at all.“In every ward, we have set up a team that visits each society or cluster of buildings to collect vaccination data. Based on the demographic and the reason for reluctance, we shall develop various ideas to attract more people to get vaccinated,” added a senior civic officer.Meanwhile, an officer who was part of the door-to-door survey said, “There are some who have recently recovered from Covid, a few others who are facing health issues and need to consult their doctor before taking the vaccine. However, there are many others who continue to feel that the vaccine is not safe and hence are sceptical about getting jabbed.”From among the target population of around 18 lakh within Thane city, there are around 38% senior citizens and 31% in the 45-59 years age group who have taken the first dose but not yet take the second jab. Similarly, in the 18-45 years age group, there are 68% who are waiting to get their second dose.“Some among them must have taken their second dose at other municipal corporations as well or some who had visited Thane for the first dose must have taken the second dose as per convenience. As all these are assumed figures including the target population for vaccination in each city, it will be difficult to claim that we have 100% vaccination. Despite this, we are aiming at vaccinating as many as possible,” added Malvi.It was only after August that the supply of vaccine doses gained momentum. Those who have been jabbed during that time will only be due for their second dose by November.“I took my first dose of the vaccine in September. I will be due next week for the second dose. I had to delay the vaccination process as I was detected Covid positive and was advised by the doctor to take the vaccination after all post-Covid symptoms subside,” said Shashank Kankal, a 48-year-old resident of Patlipada, Thane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-civic-body-starts-door-to-door-survey-to-take-stock-of-people-vaccinated-101635423169657.html
28-10-2021||Lucknow||Slain sharpshooter of Mukhtar gang had planned to target trader leader in Lucknow||LUCKNOW Dreaded sharpshooter of Mukhtar Ansari gang, Ali Sher, 34, who along with his accomplice Kamran, was gunned down by the UP Special Task Force (STF) in Lucknow’s Madiaon area on Wednesday night, had a 24-year-long criminal history, said police.The sharpshooter’s mobile records also revealed that he was planning to target a trader leader in Lucknow. Ali Sher’s name surfaced in 20 criminal cases, including the murder of politician, Jeetram Munda, in Ranchi district of Jharkhand, said an STF official. Munda, a BJP leader, was shot dead in a hotel in Ranchi on September 22, after which the police declared a reward of ₹1 lakh on Ali Sher’s head.The official said Ali Sher entered into the crime world after a case of rioting, and criminal intimidation was registered against him in a clash with some people of his native village Bairideeh in Azamgarh in January 1997. “Between 1997 and 2002, seven cases were registered against him at Devgaon police station in Azamgarh before his name surfaced in the murder of a contractor in Bardah area of Azamgarh. Thereafter, Ali Sher got the patronage of jailed gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari and he emerged as one of the dreaded shooters the latter’s gang,” he said.The official said Ali Sher’s name came to fore in six murders and many cases of attempt to murder between 2002 and 2021. As many as 20 criminal cases were registered against him Azamgarh, Mau and Ranchi (Jharkhand) between 1997 and 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/slain-sharpshooter-of-mukhtar-gang-had-planned-to-target-trader-leader-in-lucknow-101635422387751.html
28-10-2021||Pune||Poona’s coffee connection: An affair that began in 1839||Archives tell stories. They can capture lives, and what people meant to others, and preserve them long after memory has faded. Many years ago, while going through the digitised copies of the newspaper “Jnanaprakash” at SPPU, I came across an interesting report, probably from 1864. “The coffee plantations at Mundhwa and Hadapsar in the Haveli taluka have been ruined due to a dispute between the owners. It’s a pity because we have heard that the coffee was praised by the Europeans living in the Cantonment area”, the report read.This piqued my interest. I had never heard of coffee plantations in Pune till then. What further excited me were two reports I found shortly after in another newspaper.On July 26, 1834, “Bombay Courier” translated and reproduced a report that had originally appeared in the Marathi newspaper “Darpan”. “At the request of Lord Clare, Mr William Sundt, an East Indian gentleman, well known for his skill and ingenuity in practical mechanics, has erected in the Government Garden at Dapooree, a machine to raise water from the river, for the purposes of irrigation”, it said. The engine by which this was affected was as simple as it was ingenious, consisting of three forcing pumps which were worked by a windmill, and were capable of raising, in ten hours, 3,444 hogsheads of water from the river, which flowed from 50 to 60 feet below the level of the garden. “When we consider how much good might accrue to the Dukhun, were a number of such works constructed along the Rivers which run through the country, we cannot help lamenting that the government does not adopt a more liberal system of fiscal administration, which might encourage the expenditure of capital on such works of general utility”, it concluded.Another report in the very next issue of the same newspaper mentioned that Sundt was planning to erect the same “machine” at his farms in Mundhwa.Was this the same coffee plantation “Jnanaprakash” had mentioned? Who was Sundt? And who were the “other owners”?I kept on finding missing pieces to this jigsaw puzzle for the next several years with the help of Revenue, Land, and Horticultural Reports published in the first half of the 19th century. William Sundt and William Webbe were two enterprising and respectable Anglo-Indians who had well-cultivated gardens in the villages of Mudhwa and Hadapsar. Besides growing oranges, grapes, and other fruits, they turned their attention to the cultivation of the coffee plant.Their affair with growing coffee began in 1839. The Bombay Chamber of Commerce considered it excellent both in quality and “cleanness”, and said it would fetch the same price as the best Mocha coffee or about 2d. the pound ( ₹14 the Surat man of 40 pounds). To encourage the experiment, the Government granted Messrs. Sundt and Webbe ten acres of land close to their garden. Red gravelly soil, according to Sundt, was the best suited for the coffee plant.The plant when young requires a great deal of shade. When about a year old it is planted in open ground where for at least four years, it must be screened for the extreme heat of the sun.To shade the coffee bushes, Sundt grew castor-oil plants around the young trees.He thought that much of the Poona soil was admirably suited to the coffee plant. He particularly recommended some spots of red gravelly soil between Khandala and Karla.In 1842-43, Sundt and Webbe grew plants from seed furnished to them by Colonel Capon which he had brought from the city of Mocha, Yemen. The next year, they had seven thousand seedlings in their nursery ready for planting, and several berry-bearing trees which were fair specimens of fine coffee plants. A sample of coffee was submitted to the Chamber of Commerce who considered it “equal to Mocha coffee”. They successfully cultivated the crop for the next few years. The coffee beans were sold all over Bombay and Madras Presidencies.William Webbe and William Sundt were among the first generation of surveyors and draughtsmen who drew the maps of British India. Webbe was the “half-caste” son of a British sergeant, according to the “Historical records of Survey of India – Vol. 3”, written by Col RH Phillimore. Webbe was apprenticed and educated at the Madras Surveying School. Sundt, who was the son of a Captain of the Madras Establishment, left the Orphan Asylum of that Presidency to enter the Quarter-Master-General’s Office in 1806, in which he was employed as “Surveyor and Draughtsman”. He had accompanied both, Major-General Sir John Malcolm’s missions to Persia as a surveyor – 1799 to 1801 and 1809 to 1810 – and compiled the maps. He is also credited for drawing the first maps of Malwa, along with the divisions of districts.Malcolm’s memoir mentions that several maps published by the Survey of India Office would not have been possible without the participation of Sundt and Webbe.Sundt and Webbe were later transferred to carry out the Revenue surveys in Gujarat, after which they were employed in the Survey of India Office in the Bombay Presidency. When James Sutherland chose to make Poona his headquarters after becoming the Deputy Surveyor-General of India in 1822, he brought them to the city to work under him. The historical records of the Survey of India are replete with praises showered upon them for their professionalism, keen intellect, and skill in drawing maps.It appears that Sundt and Webbe, who had closely worked with each other in the Survey of India Office, formed a partnership of sorts in Poona, and ventured into horticulture post-retirement.After successfully dabbling with coffee, Sundt devoted his attention to growing sugarcane. He brought cultures from Mauritius, and within a couple of years had mastered the art of growing sugarcane around Poona. His was probably the first sugarcane farm around Poona if one has to believe the Horticultural Reports published by the government.According to the Horticultural Report published in 1839, the government made several extensive purchases of canes from him. They were distributed for cuttings in the Ahmednagar and Poona districts. When Thomas Williams, Revenue Commissioner, Bombay Presidency, encamped at a village near Ahmednagar, he found that seven bighas were cultivated by one individual, and the specimen of the produce “looked very good”. They were about “three times the size of the common cane”.Sundt and Webbe also set up a unit to manufacture jaggery. They sold kakavi (molasses) in the markets of Poona and Bombay.Sundt passed away in 1856, after which Webbe became the sole owner of the farms. This was challenged in the court by one Mrs Loster, who was an illegitimate daughter of Sundt. She and her husband were helping Sundt run the farm in his last days. The judge ordered both the parties to jointly manage the farms.The fate of the farms and the coffee and cane plantations thereafter is not known. While the Western part of Maharashtra is now famed for its sugarcane plantations, coffee is not cultivated in the region anymore.I hope someone someday follows the footsteps of Sundt and grows coffee “as good as Mocha” in Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/poonas-coffee-connection-an-affair-that-began-in-1839-101635421966517.html

28-10-2021||Lucknow||Allahabad University cancels even semester exams||Allahabad University (AU) has decided to cancel the exams of even semesters that were to be held in offline mode from November 23. This decision was taken in a meeting of examination committee held on Thursday. “The offline exams of the even semesters (2, 4, 6, 8) stand cancelled and the students will now be promoted to the next semester on the basis of their internal assessment marks,” said university’s public relations officer (PRO) Jaya Kapoor while confirming the development. In the online meeting chaired by vice chancellor prof Sangita Srivastava and attended by Allahabad University controller of examinations prof Ramendra Kumar Singh among others, it was also resolved that the students will be promoted to the higher semester and their classes will start after Diwali vacations in hybrid (online/offline) mode.“The classes will, however, continue in offline mode from December 17 keeping the then prevailing Covid conditions in view,” said the university’s PRO citing the decisions taken in the meeting. “As decided in the virtual meeting, the annual exams will be held after second week of March 2022 in offline mode strictly following the Covid guidelines,” she added.Controller of examinations (CoE) prof Ramendra Kumar Singh wrote a letter to all deans and heads of departments besides principals of constituent colleges on Wednesday informing that the semester examinations will be conducted in offline mode. In protest against this decision, the students started a demonstration on the varsity campus on Thursday morning. The students gathered at the students’ union building and even disrupted post graduate classes being conducted in offline mode there.They were demanding that when the classes had been held in online mode, the exams too should be held in virtual mode only. They also reached the CoE office and raised slogans against the decision following which an emergency meeting of the examination committee was convened.Earlier in the first week of April this year, AU had postponed all exams, being held at Allahabad University and its constituent colleges, including those being held in online mode. AU and its constituent colleges were completely closed till April 21. Later, even the summer vacations of AU were started early in a way that the days lost in offline teaching could be compensated. However, as the situation of Covid-19 pandemic was not completely under control, though the campus of AU was opened in phased manner for administrative officials and later for teaching faculty members, but the teaching at AU was kept restricted to online mode. This continued till last month even though many of the departments conducted seminars, meetings and courses in offline mode. A section of student leaders on the campus had continued with their agitation for starting teaching in offline mode. In the meantime, research scholars were asked to come to their respective departments and continue with their research work. Later, even hostels were opened for them. But after resorting to online mode of teaching till September, varsity authorities decided to open the departments for offline teaching starting from October 1. However, barring few departments, most of the departments has witnessed thin attendance of students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/allahabad-university-cancels-even-semester-exams-101635421846422.html

28-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Police summon NCB witness, BJP worker Manish Bhanushali||Mumbai Police on Thursday summoned BJP worker Manish Bhanushali who was a witness in the drugs in cruise ship case for questioning. Manish Bhanushali was among the nine independent witnesses of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), which also includes KP Gosavi, who were involved in the cruise ship raid which led to the arrest of Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan along with others.While a photo of NCB’s ‘key witness’ Kiran Gosavi with Aryan Khan went viral, Bhanushali was seen with Arbaaz Merchant, another arrested in the case who is accused of possession of drugs.Earlier this month, two complaints were filed against Bhanushali regarding his role in the raid. On October 13, a lawyer Kanishk Jayant alleged criminal conspiracy by Bhanushali and four others including Gosavi and requested Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale to file an FIR for extortion and their suspicious role in Cordelia Cruise Drug Case.Bhanushali along with Gosavi were also among those who were present in the NCB office when Aryan Khan, Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha were taken to the NCB office. The FIR filed by advocate Jayant questioned how the NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede allowed Gosavi and Bhanushali to take physical custody of Aryan Khan, Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha.Another lawyer Sudha Dwivedi on Tuesday approached MRA Marg Police Station for registration of an FIR against Bhanushali, NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede, Shah Rukh Khan's manager Pooja Dadlani and three witnesses in the drug case - Prabhakar Sail, Manish Bhanushali and Kiran Gosavi - over allegations of extortion. The MRA Marg Police Station however did not register the FIR. Dwivedi alleged that Bhanushali and others allegedly committed ‘extortion by threat of accusation of an offence’ in the case.Bhanushali, earlier this month, accepted that he was escorting Arbaaz Merchant out of the International Cruise Terminal. He, however, denied dragging any of them. He also claimed that he was an informer in this case.Kiran Gosavi, who is the key witness, according to the NCB, was arrested on Wednesday by the Pune Police. The Pune Police said that Gosavi was arrested for his alleged role in a 2018 cheating case. Pune Police commissioner Amitabh Gupta told HT that the Mumbai Police is yet to seek custody of Gosavi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-summon-ncb-witness-bjp-worker-manish-bhanushali-101635419381680.html
28-10-2021||Chandigarh||Savouring simple pleasures of a window seat to Ladakh||It had been a while since I stepped out of the house, let alone enter an aeroplane. But having received both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, I recently decided to join the rest of India in 2021’s hottest tourist destination, Ladakh. When they learnt of my plan, my friends chastised me for breaking the cardinal rule of visiting Ladakh on a motorcycle, as I opted for the faster and more convenient mode of air travel. “At least take a window seat,” one of my friends begged me, acutely aware of my disdain for window seats. After much accosting, aided by some lovely photographs from Instagram, I finally relented and occupied a window seat, ready to fly to Leh. Little did I know, though, that this would be my best decision in recent times. No sooner did my flight take off from Chandigarh than Punjab’s lush fields filled the view, only to be replaced by the verdant, rolling hills of the Shivaliks. As the plane ascended, I tried concentrating on my Kindle, but the magnificent spectacle captivated me. Leh was still far, but snow-capped mountains filled the panorama as far as the eye could see from the plane’s window. The tall trans-Himalayan mountains seemed to salute us, standing tall and mighty like sentinels posted to welcome us, while a small village here or there added to the mystical, infectious charm of Ladakh even before I had officially set foot there. Below us, the mighty Indus flowed across the foothills, embellishing the mountains like a necklace of pearls. I first sat in an aeroplane when I hit my teens and like most children, found myself drawn to the window seat. Despite my Punjabi relatives’ bad attempts at cracking unimaginative jokes and advising me not to throw my hands outside the window, I used to love watching large cities like Delhi, Bombay and Calcutta merge with the infinite sky, even if this moment lasted for a few minutes before the flight ascended. With time, however, I outgrew my fascination for window seats. I preferred aisle seats, which offered more flexibility and space to wrap up pending work on my laptop. My recent flight to Leh turned out to be a literal and metaphorical ride through various emotions. I stopped everything that I was doing and admired every second of the journey, falling in love with the natural beauty that cannot be seen anywhere else, untouched by urban pollution. I also saw my childhood flash in front of me, recollecting the several adventures I accompanied my parents on. They passed on their travel bug to me, always encouraging my sister and me to explore as many places as possible. I recalled the simpler days of childhood when a window seat was all it took for me to experience a bout of euphoria that today, only a cup of piping hot, spicy masala chai gives me. With a good cup of masala chai becoming rarer each day, it might be a good idea for all of us to take the window seat sometimes, doing nothing but admiring the cities float by under blankets of cloud which challenge our imagination every moment of the journey. I look forward to my next adventure on a window seat, with only a cup of masala chai to keep me going till then! rishabhkochhar92@gmail.com The writer is a Chandigarh-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/savouring-simple-pleasures-of-a-window-seat-to-ladakh-101635419866165.html

The government’s assurance in the high court came on a petition filed by Wankhede who complained that he was being personally attacked by the state government.Wankhede, who is leading the federal drug enforcement agency’s investigations into the cases registered after a raid on a cruise ship, wanted the high court to bar the police from arresting him.

He also wanted the probe to be transferred from Maharashtra and entrusted to a federal agency such as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).A public prosecutor, appearing for the Maharashtra government, said the police received four complaints and was at the stage of conducting a preliminary inquiry to establish the veracity of the complaints.After the public prosecutor assured the judges that the police will give him three days’ notice before taking any steps, the bench disposed of the petition.The three-day notice will give Wankhede sufficient time to petition a court against the move.Also Read: NCB Hq also got cruise ship tip but decided not to act, Sameer Wankhede went aheadWankhede’s decision to rush to the court for an arrest shield comes after the Mumbai police started inquiring into the complaints received against the NCB officer, apart from two complaints against the Maharashtra minister and leader of the ruling Nationalist Congress Party (NCB) Nawab Malik.Nawab Malik has been continuously attacking the revenue service officers for the last few days, especially after startling revelations by Prabhakar Sail, an independent witness in the NCB’s cruise ship drug raid case in which Aryan Khan, son of actor Shah Rukh Khan is arrested by the agency along with several others.Aryan Khan, friend Arbaaz Merchant and model Munmun Dhamecha, who were arrested by a team led by Wankhede on October 3 after a raid on a cruise ship have all been in custody for 23 days.A controversy erupted after Prabhakar Sail, one of the witnesses cited by the NCB for the raid, filed an affidavit sworn before a notary on October 23, alleged that he overheard his former employer Kiran Gosavi, also a witness in the Aryan Khan-cruise drug case, talking to a person about settling the matter for ₹18 crore and that amount of ₹8 crore would be required to be paid to Wankhede.Sail, who said that he worked as the bodyguard of Kiran Gosavi, also a witness in the Aryan Khan-cruise drug case, also claimed that the NCB officers led by Wankhede got him to sign on blank papers that were later filled up by them.Sail’s statement was recorded by a special police team set up to probe the six complaints including four against Wankhede. “He has shared all details to substantiate his claims,” Sail’s lawyer Tushar Khandare said on Wednesday.Kiran Gosavi, who went missing after the Pune police reopened a probe against him in another case, was detained late on Wednesday. The Pune police said Gosavi will be formally placed under arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncbs-sameer-wankhede-asked-hc-for-arrest-shield-told-he-will-get-3-day-notice-101635418666040.html

It is utterly humiliating to make women go through such harassment and NCW strongly condemns the shameful incident. The Commission has taken suo motu cognisance in the matter,” read a press note released by the NCW.According to reports, the sleeves of women candidates who appeared for the prelims of Rajasthan Administrative Services preliminary examination on Wednesday were snapped off using a pair of scissors by male security guards at several exam centres, including in Bikaner. At the same time, reports also alleged that men wearing full sleeve shirts were asked to take the exam shirtless.“Chairperson Rekha Sharma has written to Chief Secretary, Government of Rajasthan seeking strict action against those responsible in violating the right of women to live with dignity. The Commission has also sought an explanation as to why no female guard was deputed to search female candidates at the center,” the statement read.@NCWIndia has taken cognisance of the incident. Chairperson @sharmarekha has written to Chief Secretary, Rajasthan to take strict action against those responsible. NCW has also sought an explanation as to why no female guard was deputed for checking the female candidates. https://t.co/GS65FT9Y00The objectionable move was apparently adopted to ensure "strictness" in view of the malpractices reported during the Rajasthan Eligibility Examination for Teachers (REET) earlier this year.

28-10-2021||Mumbai||Aryan Khan case: Bail not a rule, but exception in cases under NDPS Act, says NCB||Additional solicitor general Anil Singh said Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan was not a first-time but regular consumer of drugs and he was in touch with peddlers.Singh, arguing before the Bombay high court for the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in the drugs-on-cruise case in which Aryan has been arrested along with others, said a peddler, Achit Kumar, was arrested based on the star-son’s statement.“There was mention of bulk drugs. Considering that, the offence is non-bailable,” Singh said, adding all the offences in the case are non-bailable under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.However, former attorney general of India Mukul Rohtagi, making his final arguments on behalf of Aryan, said he knew nobody on the ship except Arbaaz and Achit.  "Achit was arrested after four days. He was said to be dealer and had 2.4 grams (of drug), but a dealer should have 200gm," Rohatgi said.Singh further said that Aryan's lawyers have argued bail is a rule, but that is not case under the NDPS Act. “Bail is not a rule. Supreme court judgements say under NDPS act, bail is not the rule, but exception. The SC says it is a heinous crime worse than culpable homicide and has to be dealt with stringently,” he said. “If a person might have not committed a crime but attempted it, that itself is a crime,” the ASG said.“No recovery does not mean the person has not committed the offence. There was no recovery still the person can be held liable,” he said.Responding to Rohatgi’s argument that no test was done on Aryan and hence, the arrest was wrong, Singh said if there was no consumption, why should the test be conducted. “My case is of possession. You were found in possession. Aryan Khan was found in conscious possession of contraband. He has accepted it in his statement and panchnama.This is the third day in the bail application hearing of Aryan in the Bombay high court. Aryan was arrested with others after the NCB conducted a raid on the Goa-bound cruise off the coast of Mumbai late on October 2.At present, Aryan is lodged at the Arthur Road Jail along with Merchant, while Munmun Dhamecha, another accused in the case, is at the Byculla women prison.The ASG submitted chats of Aryan with Arbaaz Merchant, a friend and accused in the case, to Justice Nitin Sambre. He said the chats revealed there was an attempt to deal in drugs on commercial quantity. “Eight persons were apprehended on the ship. It cannot be a coincidence, we are investigating,” Singh said.“From the eight persons arrested at the terminal, we have seized commercial quantity. The cruise trip was just for two days. It is a case of conspiracy. It cannot be a coincidence they gathered with multiple drugs,” he added.Singh said that Aryan's lawyers have claimed they were not found in possession of drugs and later added it was in small quantity."Arbaaz has been found in possession. Aryan had knowledge (of the same). He was aware and it was consumption for both. They specifically said it was for cruise journey."Concluding his submissions, Singh said the arrests were legal. "Conspiracy is difficult to prove, the conspirators know how they conspired. I leave it to the conscious of the court," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/aryan-regular-consumer-of-drugs-in-touch-with-peddlers-asg-anil-singh-for-ncb-101635414510167.html

Also read: BSF jurisdiction: Capt backs move, says force not going to take over Punjab“The meeting has been postponed due to Shah’s visit to Gujarat,” said a person privy to Capt Amarinder Singh’s efforts to resolve the standoff between the Centre and farmer unions and who was part of the delegation On Wednesday, Capt Amarinder Singh said he had been discussing various options with the Union home minister and others. “I think I can help in finding a solution as I have been the chief minister of Punjab and am also an agriculturist,” he said at a press conference in Chandigarh. While there could be no pre-decided formula for the resolution of the farmers’ stir, something would emerge during the talks as both sides, the central government and farmers, want a resolution to the crisis triggered by the farm laws, he said, clarifying that he had not met any farmer leader. Capt Amarinder also said he had deliberately not intervened in the matter as the farmers did not want politicians involved. Made to resign as the chief minister following months of tussle and turbulence in the Punjab Congress, Capt Amarinder has already announced that he is launching his own party. He had earlier said that any seat sharing arrangement with the BJP for the Punjab elections would be subject to a resolution of the farmers’ issue in their interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-amarinder-s-meeting-with-amit-shah-on-farm-stir-postponed-101635412485646.html

According to the current guidelines, only government employees and those involved with essential services are allowed to travel on the Mumbai suburban trains, in addition to the fully-vaccinated citizens above 18 years of age who have completed at least 14 days since the administration of the second dose of their vaccine.The suburban local trains are sometimes referred to as the “lifeline” of Mumbai, with as many as 80 lakh passengers using the railway services on a daily basis before the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak.Meanwhile, the weekly positivity rate in Maharashtra has gone down to 1.45% with a dip in the number of Covid-19 cases. According to the World Health Organisation, the positivity rate should remain below 5% for an outbreak to be considered under control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-local-trains-back-on-track-with-full-capacity-restrictions-unchanged-101635393773125.html

28-10-2021||Patna||Bihar government all set to phase out single-use plastic, thermocol products||In a push to protect the environment, the Bihar government has started taking steps to phase out single-use plastic and thermocol products. The state government in June decided to put a blanket ban on single-use plastic and thermocol products from December 25, while the department of forests, environment and climate change has asked manufacturers, dealers and traders to clear their stocks comprising these materials before the deadline. At a meeting earlier this week, they were also asked to explore dealing in alternatives of single-use plastic and thermocol products. In June 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the country will eliminate single-use plastic in July 2022, and all states were asked to follow the target.Also Read: Teachers in UP see red over order to collect plastic wasteIn Bihar, where the ban will be enforced later this year, the products associated with single-use plastic and thermocol are disposable glasses, throwaway cutlery, and covers of packed foodstuff. “These [materials] have been in rampant use these days. You will find it everywhere. People have been using it for convenience, but it’s been highly harmful for the environment. It cannot be destroyed and the only way to get rid of it is to stop manufacturing it. That is why the government is putting a complete ban on these products,” said Deepak Kumar Singh, principal secretary of Bihar’s forest department. Violating the ban in Bihar will be treated as a punishable offence, the official said, attracting fines and/or jail time under the Environment Protection Act, 1986. “Those who have been handling these products, either manufacturing them or importing and selling them, need to be made aware of the ban,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-government-all-set-to-phase-out-single-use-plastic-thermocol-products-101635392504333.html

The maximum temperature was 28.2 degree Celsius on Wednesday which was three degrees below normal and the minimum temperature was 14.6 degree Celsius – two notches below normal.IMD has forecast the minimum temperature in the national capital to remain around 14 degrees Celsius till Friday, and possibly dip to 13 degrees by Saturday. The maximum temperature, meanwhile, is expected to remain below 30 degrees Celsius till the end of the week.Delhi’s air quality was in the “poor” category on Thursday morning. Data from the Central Pollution Control Board showed that the hourly air quality index (AQI) at 8am stood at 261. On Wednesday, the average 24-hour AQI had been 232, which is also in the “poor” category. AQI reading between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.Also Read: Delhi: In first for the season, temp below 15°C as AQI worsensOn Wednesday, the Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, Safar, said, “Effective fire count of stubble burning in the northwest region of Delhi is 656 and its share in PM2.5 is 16% as transport level winds are north westerly. Calm local winds combined with highly favourable transport level winds (North-north westerly) enhance stubble burning related intrusion. Any increase in fire counts in the next 3 days would increaser finer particle levels of Delhi.”Particulate matter are extremely small and are graded by measuring their diameter in microns. The most important types of particulate matter are PM2.5 and PM10 (both microscopic in size) from a public health perspective. Prior to Wednesday, the highest contribution of stubble burning in Delhi’s air was 15% on October 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-air-quality-likely-to-deteriorate-to-very-poor-onthursday-101635391243679.html

28-10-2021||Delhi||Moved SC against Delhi govt's ration delivery: Centre||The Centre on Wednesday told the Delhi high court that it has moved the Supreme Court against the state government’s doorstep ration of delivery policy — one that has led to a months-long battle between the Union and state governments.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh was informed by Monica Arora, the Union government standing counsel, that they moved the apex court against a September 27 order of the high court that paved the way for the scheme by allowing the Delhi government to cut supply to fair price shops (FPSs).In that order, the Delhi government the high court ordered the curtailing of the supplies to FPSs on account of those who have opted for the doorstep delivery of foodgrains. While noting that there was no stay on the implementation of the doorstep delivery of ration scheme, the court also directed the Delhi government to issue communications to all FPS dealers, informing them of the particulars of cardholders who have opted to receive ration at their doorstep.On Wednesday, the Delhi government told the court that it has filed an application seeking a modification in the direction where the court directed that detailed information of the card-holders be disclosed to FPS dealers.Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for the Delhi government, said that people with vested interests were trying to scuttle the roll out of the scheme, and beneficiaries were being misled by false rumours and incorrect information through posters and pamphlets.Saying that 6.9 million people out of the total 7.2 million registered beneficiaries opted for the scheme, Singhvi apprehended that the data of those obtaining the doorstep delivery of ration would be misused.“…that the data sought by the petitioner association such as details of the head of the family, his/her Aadhaar number, mobile number, residence etc. is confidential in nature, and the disclosure thereof would be counterproductive to public interest… that the disclosure of such information by these persons / beneficiaries under the NFSA to the government has been made in a fiduciary capacity and it is incumbent on the government to protect their right to privacy,” it added.However, the court said that the information had to be given since the verification of the numbers cited by them was needed. It said that there should be some transparency and in any event such information can also be availed through Right to Information Act.“We are not asking you to part information about the Aadhaar card. Being the fair price owners they will have basic information as to who is the head of the family, ration card number, address, how many members in the family, allocation of food grains…Whatever is there is in the ration card,” justice Sanghi said.The court also said assuming that the petition by the ration dealers’ association is dismissed, it would still not solve the dispute between the Union government and Delhi in implementation of the scheme.To this, Singhvi said that the Delhi government does not have any problem in sharing the information with the court, but that such confidential details cannot be given to FPS dealers. He said if required, he will file the information to the court in a sealed cover.The court issued notice to the Centre and the ration dealers’ association. It also sought the response of the Centre and the Delhi government on a plea by the association seeking other modifications in the September 27 court order.The Delhi government’s doorstep delivery of ration scheme was launched on March 25, but the Union food and consumer affairs ministry wrote to the Delhi government on March 19 raising two objections — the use of the term “mukhyamantri (chief minister)” for a scheme involving the distribution of food grains allocated under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), and that any change in the delivery mechanism requires an amendment in NSFA that can be done only by Parliament. The term “mukhyamantri” was later dropped from the scheme’s name.HT reported on October 19 that the Centre filed an application in the high court saying that the Delhi government may launch its scheme for the doorstep foodgrains delivery, but cannot take steps that mitigate the National Food Security Act (NFSA).The Delhi government has maintained that the scheme does not violate the NFSA, and that several states were already running similar programmes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/moved-sc-against-delhi-govt-s-ration-delivery-centre-101635385521892.html
28-10-2021||Delhi||90%+ in Delhi have Covid antibodies: 6th sero study||More than 90% of Delhi’s population likely has some form of protection from Sars-Cov-2, the preliminary findings of the latest serological survey in the Capital suggest.Samples from 28,000 people were tested to see if they had antibodies to the virus, which causes Covid-19, and over 90% of them turned up positive, an official aware of the matter said, citing the study’s report submitted to the government.“A high sero-prevalence is good news, this means a good chunk of the population will be protected from the infection,” the official said, asking not to be named.It was not immediately clear how many of these people had antibodies as a result of an infection or vaccination. But the survey, a Delhi government health official told HT last week, covered these details.According to the first official quoted above, the preliminary report includes details such as district-wise, age-wise, and gender-wise sero-prevalence and a more detailed report is likely to be submitted around Diwali, which will be celebrated on November 4.The current round, the sixth such study in the Capital, was the first full sero study after the devastating April-May wave of infections. The last survey, for which samples were taken in April, showed an antibody prevalence rate of 56%.For the latest round, the sampling was done in September and the officials determined vaccination status as part of the process.A portion of the samples collected will also be analysed for level of antibodies, which could help researchers estimate how protected the population could be. These test results are awaited from the laboratory at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS).“This round of the survey was conducted in great detail, so it will take some time to analyse the data. A more detailed report is likely to be submitted in early November, around Diwali,” the second official quoted above said last week.These numbers could explain why Delhi’s cases have remained low despite the city having lifted most curbs on activities. The average weekly positivity rate of samples has remained under 0.10% since late July.Experts have previously warned against focussing on concepts of herd immunity and population immunity — the principle that says if enough of the public is protected, there will be a wall of protection from the virus.The Sars-Cov-2 virus has mutated on multiple occasions to make past protection redundant to some extent and become so transmissible that it raised the threshold for such protection.The previous five surveys returned readings of 56.13%, 25.5%, 25.1%, 29.1%, and 22.6% respectively.The current findings strengthen what was earlier found in a study from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) that collected data at the peak of the second wave showed a seropositivity of 67% in Delhi.Further, a sero survey among staff members in the Council of Science and Industrial Research in Delhi showed a seroprevalence of 80% after the second wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/90-in-delhi-have-covid-antibodies-6th-sero-study-101635383387518.html
28-10-2021||Delhi||15 hurt near Singhu in police action against UP farm group||At least 15 people were injured on Wednesday after hundreds of members of the Hind Mazdoor Kisan Samiti (HMKS), a farmers’ union from Uttar Pradesh, allegedly clashed with the Delhi Police after they were stopped from moving towards the Singhu border where hundreds of other farmers have been sitting on a year-long protest against the Centre’s three farm laws, senior police officers aware of the development said.The officers said the members of HMKS wanted to go to the Singhu border to protest against the killing of Lakhbir Singh, a Dalit farmer who was allegedly lynched on October 12 at Kundli near the border.Police said Singh’s family members were accompanying the protesters towards the Singhu border, where they had planned to protest against the protesting farmers, pay “Ardas” (a Sikh prayer) to Singh, perform a “hawan” and demand compensation from the government for the family.The protesters alleged that they were headed towards the border peacefully when the police personnel resorted to the lathi-charge.“We were a disciplined group of protesters from Meerut and Muzaffarnagar who were moving towards the border peacefully. Suddenly, the Delhi Police personnel launched a lathi-charge on us. At least a dozen protesters, including Lakhbir Singh’s wife and daughter, were injured. Many more of us also suffered bruises. We are now sitting at the border to demand justice,” said Hind Mazdoor Kisan Samiti spokesperson Manish Singh.The Delhi Police refuted the allegations of lathi-charge, and said that only “mild force” was used to disperse the protesters because they were creating a ruckus and trying to remove the barricades placed at the Singhu border. “The action was taken to prevent a law and order situation and a possible skirmish between the two opposite groups of protesting farmers,” a senior officer who asked not to be named said.Farmer leader and member of Samyukt Kishan Morcha, Darshan Pal, said, “We got to know that this group (HMKS) had come at the border with the deceased’s family member who wanted to conduct a havan at the protest site. This is another mischief by BJP-RSS as they want to disrupt the peaceful protests at Singhu border.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/15-hurt-near-singhu-in-police-action-against-up-farm-group-101635379976262.html
28-10-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The coconut man of Nehru Place||Such tall multi-storeys. Such a crowd of busy pedestrians. And he is sitting cross-legged on the ground, with his little basket in front of him. His statue-like stillness is accentuating the fast life around him. Like a hand immersed motionless in a stream that dynamically feels the shock and animation of the stream’s fast-flowing water.Ranjeet has been selling coconut slices in the commercial plaza of Nehru Place for more than 20 years. He seems frail and far too advanced in years for such demanding work. “I’m do kam assi,” he says, implying that he is two years short of 80.Many people on reaching this age exile themselves irreversibly into a deeply secluded existence—they stay at home and read the newspaper from first page to last, watch TV in the afternoon, and stalk their grandchildren on Facebook. “But I have to marry my two girls, I will have to continue working,” Ranjeet mutters, seemingly shocked at the idea of retirement. He fondly talks of his daughters. “Kavita is in 12th standard, Babli is in 11th.” He attributes the yawning age gap between himself and his children to his late marriage to Srimati Chandravati, “so the children are reaching a marriageable age just when I’ve become too old.” He contentedly informs that he has already married his eldest daughter, Poonam.

Looking about the Nehru Place office buildings, he says he keeps shifting his location throughout the plaza during the day.

28-10-2021||Chandigarh||VIPs’ visit throws Ludhiana road traffic out of gear||Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s cabinet meeting in Ludhiana put the city traffic out of gear on Wednesday. Those visiting the office and shops were hit worst as traffic diversions welcomed them on several routes connecting to Ferozepur Road. Massive traffic jams were witnessed at Bharat Nagar Chowk, Verka Milk Plant Malhar Road and Saggu Chowk at 9am, while commuters were left to find their way through the bottlenecks at Bhai Wala Chowk as no traffic cop was deployed to regulate the traffic. Pankaj Sharma, a resident of Barewal Road, said he was travelling towards the old city, but the traffic was diverted from Ferozepur Road. He said the police should have made a prior announcement about the change in route plan in the wake of the CM’s visit to the city. The diversion on the highway further compounded the problem and led to chaos on the internal streets of the city. Many of those stranded were sharing pictures on social media and narrating their plight. “I had to visit Sarabha Nagar in the morning, but learnt that due to chief minister’s visit, utter chaos prevailed on the Ferozepur Road and surrounding area. So I postponed my plan,” said Divya Jain. As the day progressed, the situation deteriorated further. Around 11am, the cops deployed for CM security were pressed into service as angry residents entered into an argument with policemen who were diverting the traffic near circuit house.Many passengers travelling in local and private buses decided to walk to reach their destination. “It is good that CM has visited the city as it shows that other cities other than Chandigarh also exist in Punjab, but at the same time the visit has exposed poor traffic management of the city police. They are aware of the traffic in the industrial town and the challenges it poses, but still they failed to effectively implement traffic diversions,” said Sarabjit Singh, a resident from Mullanpur, who was visiting the city.Gridlock on NH-44The motorists travelling on National Highway 44 connecting Ludhiana with Jalandhar found themselves in a gridlock after a truck ferrying grain developed a snag at the railway over bridge near Ladhowal on Wednesday morning. On Ladhowal Road, commuters took to social media to seek help from Ludhiana traffic police and national highway authorities for clearing traffic jams. A city resident, Varinder Rana, while sharing a picture of the traffic jam, sought help from police so that the passage could be cleared. Many commuters were diverted towards the Ladhowal bypass. However, situation returned to normal by the afternoon. Despite repeated attempts, comments of joint commissioner of police Deepak Pareek could not be elicited. Para powerlifter denied meeting with Punjab CMRamandeep Kaur, who bagged a gold medal in an international para-powerlifting championship in 2017, was stopped 100 metres away from the circuit house where Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi was holding a meeting with his cabinet colleagues. Ramandeep was here to seek a job from the CM. She said she had been trying to get the job for several years, but all her efforts remained futile. “I have even lost my son in the process,” lamented the 33-year-old powerlifter, who carried with her medals won on national and international levels. She said that sportspersons were being “used as a propaganda tool by politicians”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vips-visit-throws-ludhiana-road-traffic-out-of-gear-101635375641290.html
28-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Railways shell out ₹4.15 lakh as refund to passengers affected by farmers’ protests||The Railways incurred heavy revenue losses due to cancellation or delay in running trains amid last four protests led by farmers wherein rail traffic in the state was blocked. In these four agitations held in the past three months, a total amount of ₹4,15,520 was refunded to passengers, who got their tickets booked from the booking counters at the Ludhiana railway station. According to officials, more than 70% of the reservations are made online and thus, the Railways incurred major losses by issuing refunds there.“We physically refunded over ₹4 lakh at the Ludhiana railway station amid the recent farm protests, but the quantum of loss incurred by the Railways is huge as most of the refund was made online through Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) application. A very few people now book their tickets at the railway station counters,” said a senior official. As per the data, due to the rail traffic disruption amid farmers’ protest on August 20, refund of ₹1,73,110 was released at the ticket counters of Ludhiana railway station after six trains were cancelled and a few were delayed. While passengers were refunded ₹93,460 on September 27 with a total of 25 trains being cancelled in the wake of the Bharat Bandh call by farmers, ₹52,320 was given back to the passengers by Ludhiana railway authorities on October 4. Refund of ₹96,630 was issued to passengers at the Ludhiana railway station after 26 trains plying from or through here got delayed on October 18 due to a six-hour-long farmers’ agitation to protest against the Lakhimpur Kheri incident. According to officials, in normal situations, full refund to the passengers is issued in case the delay of a train is of more than three hours or if the train has been cancelled by the Railways itself due to track repair work or derailment. “In case of farmers’ protests where the trains get stuck, delayed for over three hours or cancelled; the fare for the travel portion is deducted and the rest is refunded. Suppose a passenger is travelling from Delhi to Amritsar and the train got stuck at Ambala due to protest by farmers, in such a situation the fare of his journey from Delhi to Ambala will be deducted and rest will be refunded,” added a senior railway official.In order to get their refund online, passengers have to submit a ticket deposit report at the Railways app.Another senior official said many rail commuters cancelled their tickets even the next day of the protest fearing harassment, causing further losses to the Railways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-railways-shell-out-4-15-lakh-as-refund-to-passengers-affected-by-farmers-protests-101635375281273.html

28-10-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal bypolls: BJP focussed on propaganda over development, says Congress||Launching a scathing attack on the BJP, Congress co-incharge for Himachal Pradesh Sanjay Dutt said the ruling party had adopted an indifferent attitude towards the problems of inflation and unemployment in the state and had given precedence to propaganda. The Congress secretary said that there was anger building among the masses against the ruling dispensation in the hill-state and the BJP was certainly going lose all the four byelections.“Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur has conceded defeat and is now making rhetorical statements against the Opposition,” alleged Dutt, alleging that the BJP was trying to influence the voters by misusing the government machinery and using money power. He said the BJP’s unwarrented statements against Congress nominee Pratibha Singh reflected the anti-women mindset of BJP leaders.He said that during the campaign, the BJP had deviated from the main issues of the people and tried to cover its failures. “Had the centre and state government carried out development, chief minister would not have been roaming streets seeking votes,” he said.Dutt said in the BJP regime the public is reeling under issues of soaring prices of essential commodities and petrol and diesel. “The subsidy cooking gas has been stopped. Similarly, the subsidies on the farming tools and pesticides have also been abolished. Education, health services have collapsed badly in the state. The condition of the roads is not good, and the employees and pensioners are upset,” he said. “In the BJP regime, propaganda never stops, and the only thing missing is development,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-bypolls-bjp-focussed-on-propaganda-over-development-says-congress-101635370960287.html
28-10-2021||Chandigarh||Jai Ram confident of sweeping victory in Himachal bypolls||With the bypolls being seen as a precursor to the assembly elections, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Wednesday predicted that the BJP will retain the prestigious Mandi Lok Sabha constituency, and also win the three assembly segments – Arki, Fatehpur and Jubbal-Kotkhai. Addressing an election rally at Karsog of Mandi district, Thakur said the grand old party had been decimated and only its name remained. Boasting of BJP candidate Brigadier Khushal Thakur’s military contributions, he said, “If we are able to sleep peacefully at our homes, it is only because of our soldiers guarding the border.” On the hot button issue of inflation, the chief minister said it was a global phenomenon that had been caused due to the pandemic. “People must understand that inflation is a global phenomenon due to Covid, and eventually the situation will ease out. During the Congress regime, there was no pandemic, and yet inflation was on all-time high.” He also took a dig at the alleged scams under the Congress regime. “I am confident that like 2014 and 2019, we will again win the Mandi seat with an even bigger margin,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jai-ram-confident-of-sweeping-victory-in-himachal-bypolls-101635370540704.html
28-10-2021||Chandigarh||Bypoll to be litmus test for Jai Ram’s popularity in Himachal||The stakes are high for chief minister Jai Ram Thakur as the Mandi Lok Sabha and three assembly byelections on October 30 are being seen as a test of his popularity with Himachal Pradesh heading for elections next year.All eyes are on the Mandi parliamentary bypoll, where the BJP has fielded Kargil war veteran Brigadier Khushal Thakur against former member of Lok Sabha Pratibha Singh, who is also the widow of six-time Himachal chief minister Virbhadra Singh, as the constituency happens to be the home turf of the chief minister.The Mandi parliamentary constituency has 17 assembly segments spread across Mandi, Kullu, Shimla, Kinnaur, Lahaul-Spiti and Chamba. The Mandi Lok Sabha seat has been lying vacant since April this year, following the death of two-time MP Ram Swaroop Sharma.The result will be all the more significant as the chief minister was seen single-handedly leading the campaign to the byelections with Anurag Thakur, the Union minister for information and broadcasting, being the only leader from the Centre to campaign for the party candidate.Interestingly, this time, the narrative of the Himachal bypoll extend beyond the two primary political parties – the Congress and the BJP – as rebels from both parties have pitched their claims to the sought-after seats. While the elections will have no bearing on the stability of the government, they come at a time when the BJP has changed the guard in many states. Inflation: A hot-button issueWith issues such as inflation, rising prices of oil and unemployment at the centrestage, the election will be no cakewalk for the BJP as it faces anti-incumbency charges. The saffron party has tried to present the Mandi bypoll as a contest between a decorated war veteran and a dynast. However, people want the political parties to talk about real issues. In tribal Kinnaur, which has over 55,000 voters, the locals are seething over the damage to their ecology due to power projects. They see the multiple fatal landslides this year as a consequence of overexploitation of the area’s resources. In Lahaul-Spiti and Pangi, lack of development has been a constant poll plank. A triangular contest in FatehpurThe Fatehpur assembly segment in Kangra district, which fell vacant due to the death of incumbent legislator Sujan Singh Pathania, will set the tone for the 2022 assembly election. as political pundits say “the road to Shimla goes through Kangra.” Polls in the most populous district of the state, which sends 15 legislators to the state assembly, will be a referendum of the BJP’s policies. It is seen that the party which traditionally wins most seats from the district forms the government. This year, the constituency is facing a triangular contest, with Congress’ Bhawani Singh Pathania, the son of the deceased incumbent legislator slugging it out against BJP’s Baldev Thakur and former MP Rajan Sushant who is contesting as an Independent. Sushant’s gains are sure to harm the BJP’s prospects. Applecart precarious placed in Jubbal-KotkhaiThe Jubbal-Kotkhai assembly, is also highly significant, as it falls smack in the state’s influential apple belt. However, here the BJP seems to have shot itself in the foot by denying a ticket to Chetan Bragta, the son of former Minister Narinder Bragta, whose death necessitated the byelection. The decision was taken to discourage dynastic politics. However, Bragta has rebelled and the entire block of BJP workers have rallied behind him. Fallen on hard times in the constituency, the BJP is struggling to find booth-level workers to manage the election. Experts say Congress’ Rohit Thakur and Chetan. The party’s handling of the farmers’ issues will be the determining factor with apple igrown in almost 16 constituencies – Shimla, Kinnaur, Lahaul Spiti, Mandi Sirmaur and Chamba districts. In Arki, the contest is between Congress Sanjay Awasthi and BJP’ Rattan Singh Pal. Former chief minister Virbhadra Singh’s death had necessitated the election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bypoll-to-be-litmus-test-for-jai-ram-s-popularity-in-himachal-101635370000277.html

He also added that the same ploy should also be used to stop the Border Security Force (BSF) from usurping the constitutional authority of the Punjab Police. He declared that his party will move a resolution in Vidhan Sabha to ensure that the House directs the Punjab cabinet to take such a decision. “We want a directive from the House, not an ineffective resolution. We will seek a House directive also to categorically put the onus for implementation of its decision on CM Charanjit Singh Channi,” declared Sukbir, addressing media persons at Rajpura, where Charanjit Singh Brar is the party candidate for the assembly polls. He added that the manner in which former CM Capt Amarinder Singh justified the Central move to increase the jurisdiction of the BSF on Wednesday, proved that the Punjab congress had colluded with the Centre to make this move possible. “Such moves cannot take place in a matter of days. It is obvious that it was discussed earlier under Capt Amarinder Singh’s government. CM Channi was part of the cabinet and also privy to the move. He should not shed crocodile tears on this issue now,” Sukhbir added. Dismissing Channi’s ‘loud claims on investments in Punjab’, he challenged the CM to put on official website the detail of even a single crores or penny’s worthy of investment actually made in the state as a result of his investor’s summit. Interacting with owners of small industrial units, Sukhbir added, “The government would cut red-tape and smoothen the process to establish industry in the state.” The SAD president, accompanied by party candidate Charanjit Brar, paid obeisance at Lord Shiva’s temple in Nalas village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/block-implementation-of-farm-laws-in-punjab-sukhbir-to-cm-101635367479735.html

Even by a conservative estimate, there are thousands of households in the district. The fact came to light during a meeting of the district development coordination and monitoring committee headed by Sangrur Member Parliament Bhagwant Mann in the presence of deputy commissioner Ramvir and sub-divisional magistrates (SDMs) on Wednesday. Committee chairman Mann said, “Officials informed me in the meeting that only 34 households are getting 100-day work under MGNREGA in Sangrur.”Sunam Aam Aadmi Party MLA Aman Arora alleged that hundreds of workers of his constituency were not paid despite their labour. “I have visited Kunran village of Sunam 10 days back. I collected 70 job cards from a particular area of the village. There is no entry in any job card of the work. When there is no entry, labour has no record that they worked. I have a list of 77 people who have not received payment for their work,” said Arora.“The government has declared all villages as Open Defecation-Free (ODF), but there are 117 households in three villages, Shahpur (42), Jharon (54) and Duggan (21), who are eligible for toilets but they have no toilets,” the MLA added. “MGNREGA is a very good scheme, but its condition is bad not only in Sangrur, but across the state. It is unfortunate that Sangrur is a big district, but sarpanches provide employment to their favourites.

BJP responds||BHOPAL/SATNA: A video put out by Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Chouhan of a stopover at a Dalit household in the middle of his campaigning for the bye-elections in Raigaon, over 400km from state capital Bhopal, provoked barbs from his critics on and off social media. They spotted that there was no LPG cylinder around, and the chief minister’s host cooked his meal on a clay stove using traditional fuel. Where is the LPG cylinder given under the Ujjwala scheme, the opposition asked after chief minister Chouhan put out photographs and videos of his stopover, his outreach to the Dalit community ahead of bye-elections to four constituencies; one Lok Sabha seat and three Assembly segments.The Congress, which is in a straight contest with the BJP on the four seats, said the poor could not afford to use LPG cylinders received under the Ujjwala scheme because it was too expensive.LPG rates, last hiked on October 6, have gone up by ₹90 per 14.2-kg cylinder since July. A subsidised cylinder for poor households that got free connections under the Ujjwala scheme in Madhya Pradesh’s Satna district’s Raigaon, where Chouhan stopped for a meal, costs ₹925.5.Congress lawmaker and former minister PC Sharma said: “The chief minister himself exposed that people stopped using gas stoves provided under Ujjawala Scheme due to rise in the price of LPG. The state government’s scheme is not meant for the poor. In Bhind, people are selling the cylinders to ragman.”The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, insisted that Chouhan’s host, Basanti Kol, didn’t use her LPG cylinder for Chouhan’s meal because traditional cuisines taste better when cooked on a clay stove.“Some traditional cuisines taste well when cooked on the earthen stove and that’s why Basanti Kol used it but it doesn’t mean, she doesn’t have an LPG. She has an LPG and used to cook daily food,” said Rajneesh Agrawal, BJP spokesperson.Also Read: Can govt’s targeted welfare override inflation concern?Agarwal added that it was similar to people going for a candlelight dinner. It doesn’t mean that there was a power cut, he said.To be sure, official data does indicate that active domestic LPG connections of state-run oil marketing companies have increased by 78% between April 2015 and April 2021. Domestic LPG consumption, however, went up by just 53.3% between 2014-15 and 2020-21, suggesting that Ujjwala beneficiaries might be using their LPG cylinders to complement rather than substitute their erstwhile methods of using unclean fuel for cooking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/cm-chouhan-s-meal-video-fuels-cong-dart-on-missing-lpg-cylinder-bjp-responds-101635366579715.html

Information that the field staff of the department has gathered shows that 50-55% of paddy harvest is yet to completed. This rabi season, wheat is expected to be sown over 86 lakh acre. “We are already in the middle of rabi (wheat) sowing season, and the optimal time for this would be over by November 15. Our department is watching the scenario, because if the wheat sowing extends beyond mid-November, it could affect the cropping pattern,” said SS Sidhu, director, agriculture department. Intermittent rain when the kharif crop was ready to be cut has added to the delay, with farmers worried over the moisture content. “In Mohali, Tarn Taran and Amritsar districts harvest is at an advanced stage and has been completed on about 70% area. In the rest of state, however, we are way behind harvest targets as compared to the corresponding period of the previous seasons,” said Harpreet Kaur, joint director, statistics, Punjab agriculture department. She added that wheat sowing had not picked up pace, despite the current spell of weather being ideal for it. A shorter window for wheat sowing after khairf harvest usually means that farmers are forced to resort to burning of crop residue to clear their fields quickly. Figures available with the state’s food and civil supplies department show that to date 89 lakh tonne paddy has arrived for procurement against the total expected arrival of 190 lakh tonne. “To date, 46% of total arrivals have reached mandis, we are expecting crop arrival to pick up next week. With so much rain around, paddy has not dried below the permissible limits of 17% moisture content,” said a state food and civil supplies department functionary. According to the research department of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), the best sowing time for wheat is up to November 7, stretching up to November 15. “Our research benchmarks show that for the best possible yield, sowing should be completed by the first week of November. There is no chance for the sowing to be over within the given period,” said an officer with the agriculture department. A professor with the PAU research department added that after November 15, germination take longer and other crop dynamics also change impacting the yield. He added, however, that varieties such as PBW 752 and PBW 771 have shown good results. He added that the Indian Agriculture Research Institute’s (IARI’s) JHD 308 variety is sown over 40% of the total area cultivated under wheat. “Terminal heat stress is a major determinant of yield. Crop which is able to complete its growing time ahead of the days when rise in temperature begins in March-April, gives best yield,” said Navtej Singh of PAU research department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rain-delays-paddy-harvest-in-punjab-pushes-wheat-sowing-behind-schedule-101635366399721.html

Moga senior superintendent of police (SSP) Surinderjit Singh Mand has approved cancellation reports in both the cases. The development comes two weeks after the transfer of former Moga SSP, Dhruman H Nimbale, an IPS officer. During his 54-day tenure, 15 cases of illegal mining were registered; since his transfer, only one case of illegal mining has been registered. Previously, the Moga SSP had issued show-cause notices to Dharamkot DSP, Shubeg Singh and mining officer Jalandhar, Gurtej Singh Garcha, for alleged inaction against illegal mining after the registration of these cases. The district police has also recommended the suspension of Dharamkot DSP for his alleged nexus with the mining mafia. “The recommendation of his suspension is pending with the home department. Now, with the clean chit to the firm, the Dharmakot DSP is also likely to get relief,” said an official of Moga police. THE CASE AGAINST THE FIRMOn September 19, Moga police had arrested eight men for allegedly selling stored sand from the firm’s dump set up at Sherpur Taiba village. The police had also seized eight vehicles, including five tractor-trailers and tippers loaded with sand and three earthmoving machines. On September 26, the police registered a case of theft and illegal mining against M/S and Rana Company, an official mining contractor, for selling its stored sand, without following the legal procedure. As per the FIRs, the state government has allotted a mining quarry of Pipli village in Jalandhar to the firm. Due to monsoon, the company had stored its sand at Sherpur Taiba village, located in Moga, with the permission of the mining department. The Moga police had claimed that the owner and workers of the firm were allegedly selling sand without weighing, without issuing computerised slips and without clicking the pictures of vehicles. Moga SSP Surinderjit Singh Mand, “I have approved the cancellation report of both FIRs. The decision was taken after we did not find any anomalies in the way the firm was operating. Earlier, the firm had not produced slips that are mandatory for transportation of sand. Now, they have produced these slips before us. Therefore, we have initiated the process for cancelling FIRs. This cancellation report will be submitted in a local court.” Sources said that after registration of FIRs, the firm had moved the Punjab and Haryana high court. On October 1, the court had disposed of the case by directing the chief secretary to consider the representation and to pass necessary order in accordance with the law. The chief secretary, then, marked an inquiry to Moga deputy commissioner Harish Nayar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/moga-police-to-cancel-illegal-mining-cases-against-firm-found-selling-sand-101635365679625.html

The affidavit by DGSE further reveals that though the initial salary approved was ₹30,000 per month, Malhotra is withdrawing ₹53,000 from the funds meant for the Society for Promotion of Quality Education for Poor and Meritorious Students of Punjab. He has also been provided an official car. Even as his appointment is not against a cadre post, Malhotra was also entrusted with 60 inquiries against various employees of the department. These details have been submitted following the Punjab and Haryana high court’s directions on the plea of a school principal, Himachali Devi. The petitioner had approached the HC in June 2021 while seeking transfer from Ferozepur to Mohali on the verge of her retirement. During the hearing, it had come to light that two departmental probes were pending against her and were being probed by Malhotra. The court had passed the order seeking details about the OSD’s appointment on July 22, but in the next two hearings, the department had sought time to comply with the directions. The affidavit in question was finally filed for the hearing on October 13. The affidavit filed by DGSE Isha Kalia stated that the petitioner was transferred to a Ropar school in July 2021. Also, the two inquiries instituted against the petitioner earlier in the year and being headed by Malhotra were transferred to another official on July 29. Both these developments took place after the court sought details about Malhotra’s appointment. ‘In view of DGSE’s workload’Malhotra’s appointment was made for one year on August 14, 2017, with an order of the then DGSE, but the approval of the executive committee, Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan, was obtained post facto during a meeting on April 12, 2018. He was appointed with the approval of the competent authority and the approval was obtained from the then education minister, the affidavit stated.The affidavit said that the OSD was appointed on contractual basis keeping in view the DGSE’s workload, although it does not mention when the proposal was made and admits that the post was not advertised.  “It is submitted that the post of OSD was although not advertised as it was not regular sanctioned budgeted post, the decision was taken after the approval of the competent authority,” the department reasoned, adding that Malhotra himself submitted the resume and was considered owing to his qualification as an MBA with a vast experience as the general manager of Punjab State Civil Supplies Corporation Limited. Heading various probes against employees On April 18, 2018, Malhotra was also posted as the assistant project director of the Society for Promotion of Quality Education for Poor and Meritorious Students of Punjab and his salary was fixed at ₹50,000 per month, to be drawn from the society’s funds. He was also given the facility of a vehicle. Later, he got a raise of ₹ 3,000 in June 2019, according to the affidavit. The record submitted in the HC reveals that Malhotra was entrusted with probes against department employees from Class-3 posts to teachers and principals and even district education officers besides many other high-ranking officials. While 24 probes are pending, inquiry reports have been submitted in 37 cases. The department has claimed that Malhotra is not being paid anything for conducting the probes, but any other official appointed for the purpose is given ₹10,000-15,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/osd-appointed-without-advertising-post-punjab-admits-in-hc-101635365627572.html

28-10-2021||Chandigarh||Diwali boom: Festive spirit is back, sales up in Chandigarh markets||Hit by the pandemic in 2020, traders in Chandigarh are reporting an uptick in sales ahead of Diwali this year. Although the footfall hasn’t reached the pre-pandemic levels, the business has improved across markets as Covid-19 cases remain on the lower side.Chandigarh Beopar Mandal president Charanjiv Singh said: “Most markets are reporting good footfall and festive stalls are also a hit. Shopkeepers strictly follow Covid-19 protocol and that is helping customers to feel safe and venture out during the festival season.” Singh, who has a shop in Sector 22, added that people have started shopping for gifts, and gifts including crockery, leather and blankets, have done well this year.In Sector 17, too, people are venturing out especially on weekends, according to president of Business Promotion Council Neeraj Bajaj. “Shopkeepers haven’t arranged for any special melas or functions and we are just decorating the market but people are visiting us for their festival shopping just like the old days,” he said. Other major markets in the city are also reporting good sales in the build up to Diwali. While it was earlier suspected that the Afghanistan crisis will weaken the supply of dry fruits in the city, wholesalers have assured that there is enough for everyone. Ram Karan Gupta, president of the Sector 26 Grain Market Association, who also sells dry fruit on wholesale, said: “We get most of our dry fruit from India and even items like figs which are not grown in India are also available in good supply; so people need not worry.” Gupta, however, added that over the years gifting dry fruits in the festival season is going out of fashion as people have switched to more modern gifts.Business has also started picking up at shopping malls. As per officials of Nexus Malls that operates Elante Mall, sales in the festival season are at over 90% of what they were in 2019. “While footfall is still a bit less than pre-pandemic levels, sales are increasing. The shopping habits of the customers have changed and instead of spending more time browsing products they are making more purchases,” said senior VP, operations and projects, Jayen Naik. Officials added that switching to contactless orders and encouraging the food ventures to start home deliveries had also benefited them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/diwali-boom-festive-spirit-is-back-sales-up-in-chandigarh-markets-101635365561018.html
28-10-2021||Chandigarh||Diwali: Kurali cracker wholesalers stare at another season of losses||With the Punjab government allowing only a two-hour window for bursting firecrackers on Diwali and Gurpurb and Chandigarh imposing a blanket ban, wholesalers at the region’s biggest cracker market in Kurali are staring at another season of poor sales. The fear of Covid-19 and ongoing farmers protests are also likely to hit their business, though there might be some improvement from last year. While the sales had dipped by 50% during the festive season in 2020, the traders expect to do at least 60% sales as compared to the pre-pandemic times.The wholesalers in Kurali supply crackers to Chandigarh, Mohali, Panchkula, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, and various parts of Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. They do a business of nearly ₹7 crore every year.Manik Bathla, a fireworks wholesaler who has been in the business for the last two decades, said: “With just one week left for Diwali, the locals are not coming to buy crackers. We have only buyers from Himachal Pardesh. Even, most of the farmers will not be celebrating Diwali this year due to the protests. People are also scared of Covid-19.”Bathla said that earlier people used to come one month before Diwali to buy crackers but this year the market is wearing a deserted look.Another wholesaler, Pankaj Garg, said that this is the second year when the traders will be facing losses. “The Chandigarh administration’s decision to ban bursting of crackers has also hit our business,” he said. Sundar Lal Manju, president of Kurali Firecracker Dealers’ Association, said there was a slump in the market as retailers were yet to place their orders. “This year small-time businessmen were scared of investing money in this business,” he said.Meanwhile, deputy superintendent of police Bikramjit Singh Brar held a meeting with the wholesalers and directed them to follow all safety norms. The state government has allowed bursting of only green crackers from 8pm to 10pm on Diwali. Green crackers are environment-friendly as they have low noise, no flame, no harmful pollution-causing chemicals, but emit a lot of light.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/diwali-kurali-cracker-wholesalers-stare-at-another-season-of-losses-101635365559598.html

Now, he is forming a new party. People have made up their mind and they want freedom from the Congress and Capt Amarinder Singh.” He added, “Unemployed youth, anganwadi workers and agriculture crisis are Punjab’s issues, but Aroosa is not our concern.”SAD (Samyukt) leader and Rajya Sabha member Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, said, “My party will not have any alliance with Capt Amarinder Singh, because the former CM has already supported the extention of BSF jurisdiction in the state.” In Amritsar, Punjab medical education and research minister Raj Kumar Verka slammed Amarinder for his stand on several issues, including the extension of BSF’s jurisdiction. “Captain Amarinder, you are joining hands with anti-Punjab people. Punjab will never forgive you. You should cooperate with pro-people moves of the new dispensation under chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi. You should not show love with PM Narendra Modi, but show love for Punjab and stand with its government and Congress instead,” Verka, once a staunch supporter of the former CM, added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/only-parties-held-under-capt-for-over-4-years-mann-s-dig-at-excm-101635364959809.html

Punjab is without a regular DGP for a month now, after previous DGP Dinkar Gupta decided to avail a month’s leave following a change in the chief minister. Since then, 1988-batch IPS, Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota, has been holding the charge of Punjab DGP. This is the second time that the UPSC has sought a clarification before holding its meeting to finalise names of three officers to be sent back to the state, which will then pick one from the panel of three. Punjab has not yet replied to the UPSC, with the matter referred to chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and home minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa. The UPSC’s previous clarification, sought last week, was on the date that should be considered as ‘cut-off’ for considering claims of officers whose names had been sent to it. As Punjab had sent the names on September 30, the state had conveyed the same date to be considered as the cut-off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-dgp-appointment-upsc-seeks-clarification-on-joining-date-of-some-officers-101635364239537.html
28-10-2021||Chandigarh||BSF jurisdiction: Capt backs move, says force not going to take over Punjab||Chandigarh Backing the BJP-led central government on the extension of the BSF’s jurisdiction, former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Wednesday slammed the Punjab government over its repeated denial of any serious security concerns. Amarinder, who resigned as the chief minister on September 18 after heading the state government for four-and-a-half years, said there was something very wrong and dangerous happening at the borders, which the state could ill-afford to ignore. A fortnight ago, the Centre had issued a notification to allow the BSF to “arrest, search and seize” within 50km from the International Border in Punjab, West Bengal and Assam. Earlier, the BSF was permitted to undertake such operations up to 15km from the International Border in these states. On Monday, an all-party meeting convened by chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi decided to oppose and reject the Centre’s notification by holding a special session of the Punjab assembly. Hitting out at the Congress regime for opposing the decision, the two-time former CM said the Border Security Force (BSF) was not going to take over Punjab’s administration or be deployed at the Golden Temple. He said sleeper cells of Pakistan’s spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and Khalistani forces were creating trouble and technology becoming more advanced. “Drones with increasing payload are coming from Pakistan and smuggling drugs, weapons and explosive. The capacity and range of drones is increasing, first they came up to just 5-6km from the border, now they reach 31km,” he said at a press conference, adding: “We have to be careful of the clandestine war from across the borders”. Calling for full support by the state to the Centre in the interest of national security, Amarinder said the BSF was here to help maintain national security in the border state. “I am not an alarmist, but my 10 years of experience in the army and 9.5 years as the home minister of the state tells me that something is going to happen. Yet, a home minister who has been in his chair for one month, claims to know more than me,” he said, taking a dig at deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who has succeeded him as the home minister of Punjab. Countering those who mock his concerns of national security, he said it was the duty of every responsible government to tackle such threats. The state government should put the facts before the people and take their help in getting information instead of denying the danger, he added, claiming that political parties were not properly briefed on the issue at the all-party meet held on the issue. While Punjab Police was a first-class and well-trained force, they were, however, not trained to combat such threats, said the former CM, asserting that they needed the help of BSF and CRPF to tackle the problem. He pointed out that even in the days of terrorism, the army was helping out and nobody took over the state government job.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bsf-jurisdiction-capt-backs-move-says-force-not-going-to-take-over-punjab-101635363879447.html
28-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ready to join probe on allegations of links with ISI: Aroosa Alam||Pakistani journalist Aroosa Alam said on Tuesday that she is ready to join any investigation by Indian agencies for her alleged links with the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) as she described the allegations against her as “outrageous and utterly disappointing.” Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who also holds the home portfolio in the state cabinet, last week said that a probe would be carried out to ascertain whether Alam has links with the notorious Pakistani spy agency.“I am ready to cooperate with the central agencies of India if they are opening any probe on the issue. India can even engage third-country investigators to probe the baseless propaganda against me,” Alam told PTI.“Some 16 years ago when I was first refused an Indian visa over some reasons, the Indian government had conducted such an investigation and subsequently a visa was issued to me,” she said, adding that she last visited India in November and former Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh is still her good friend. “Despite this controversy Capt Sahib is still my good friend,” the 67-year-old journalist said.She mocked what kind of ‘raaz (secret)’ the ISI had through her. “The allegations are simply outrageous and utterly disappointing,” she fumed. On Randhawa’s statement that a probe would be carried out to ascertain whether she has links with the ISI, Alam alleged: “Linking me with the ISI can be a brainchild of Navjot Singh Sidhu’s chief strategist (Mohd) Mustafa. He might have advised Sidhu to play an ISI card after badly losing his bid to become the chief minister. The ISI card sells well in India.” She also questioned the jurisdiction of Randhawa to claim that he would probe her links with the ISI. “Randhawa does not know his jurisdiction. However, if he wants to investigate me, he is most welcome,” she said.Randhawa had claimed that Amarinder Singh has been friends with Alam for years, she stayed in India for many years and her visa was extended by the Centre from time to time.Alam, who remained a member of the South Asian Free Media Association (SAFMA) and vice-president of National Press Club (Islamabad), further said she is no longer active in journalism.“Since Capt Amarinder Singh intends to form his own party and may seek alliance with BJP, there has been mourning in the ranks of the Congress, which is a deeply divided house. Sidhu wanted to be the chief minister and he had told the party leadership not to make Randhawa chief minister,” she claimed.“Randhawa knows this and he has a grudge against Sidhu. And here comes a dark horse Charanjit Singh Channi who was given the reins of Punjab which badly hurt Sidhu,” said Alam, who is the mother of known TV host Fakhar-e-Alam, who is currently hosting a programme regarding Men’s T-20 ICC Cricket World Cup in Dubai on Ten’s Sports. Chiding Mustafa for embroiling her in this controversy, she said his wife Razia, who had three ministries in the previous government, now has hardly any in the incumbent set up. “After the setback, Sidhu has literally disappeared on the political map,” she claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ready-to-join-probe-on-allegations-of-links-with-isi-aroosa-alam-101635363579735.html

It will be restored within a day or two. We regret the inconvenience caused to devotees.” Since the new website had gone live, there had been criticism of its presentation. The main grouse of users was that the website previous to the one hacked into provided far more comprehensive information and data on Sikhism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sgpc-website-hacked-into-online-services-hit-101635363519417.html

The power connections are also not being issued to the plot holders even after they have got their plots regularised under the policy floated by the state government in the past.The delegation of colonisers led by chairman Darshan Lal Baweja, president GS Lamba, general secretary Deepak Badyal, among others, also demanded that the government fulfil the promises made in the 2017 election manifesto, which also included the formation of a board for resolving the problems faced by colonisers.Lamba said, “The bureaucracy is misinterpreting an order issued by the high court in the recent past and due to this the NOCs are not being issued against the plots, which have been regularised under the regularisation policy. In the absence of an NOC, the plot holders are not able to get their plots’ registry done. Similarly, power connections are not being issued even after the regularisation of plots. The PSPCL is stating that the power connection will be issued only after the colonisers get the NOC for the entire colony. Why would the coloniser pay a fee to PSPCL separately, if he has already paid or is paying the regularisation fee?”The members stated that the NOC is being demanded against the plots/colonies which were developed even before the PAPRA Act came into existence in 1995.MLA Sanjay Talwar, who had arranged a meeting between the colonisers and the CM, stated that the former were assured that the problems being faced by the sector will be resolved in a few days.Earlier on October 21, the colonisers had stated that they would be forced to hand over the keys of their offices to the government if they failed to resolve the issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-colonisers-seek-issuance-of-nocs-submit-memo-with-cm-101635362212645.html

The study, which was conducted by following up with severe Covid patients discharged from the ICU at PGIMER, analysed the differences in pulmonary function, mental health, and quality of life (QOL) after hospitalisation and has been published in the September edition of US based Cureus Journal of Medical Science. As many as 189 patients, above the age of 18, were admitted to PGIMER’s ICU due to severe Covid infection from January 1 to April 30, 2021 and 145 of them were discharged. However, 31 patients were lost to follow-up. The remaining 114 patients were contacted telephonically and it was found that 21 of them had died during the three-month time period after their recovery. Of the 93 survivors, 81 reported to the hospital to participate in the study. The anaesthesia department of PGIMER studied the pulmonary functioning of the remaining 74 patients who were suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and it was concluded that 61 (82%) of them had abnormal lung function. “It was believed that survivors of Covid-19 pneumonia may have residual lung injury and poor physical and mental health even after discharge. To check the post Covid complications, the study was conducted by the professors and associate professors of the anesthesia department. However, it was found that the serious patients, who require invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) during their hospitalisation, have a greater risk of impaired pulmonary function and reduced quality of life after their discharge,” reads the study. The doctors also concluded that patients need strict follow-up after their discharge from hospitals, as there are high chances that patients who needed mechanical ventilation of getting lung-related problems. There may be a greater need for rehabilitative therapies for such patients, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pgimer-study-82-severe-covid-patients-showed-abnormal-lung-function-101635362211400.html
28-10-2021||Pune||One injured in dacoity onboard Konark Express in Daund||PUNE: One passenger was injured during a robbery aboard Konark Express in Daund area of Pune late on Tuesday night. The police are on the lookout for three persons for the dacoity. The injured was identified as Rakesh Gaikwad (27) who sustained leg wounds as one of the dacoits assaulted him with rocks. Three men managed to enter the Mumbai-Bhubaneshwar Konark Express that had left from Pune and heading towards Daund. The train could not receive the required green signal and had, therefore, stopped, between Pune and Daund. “They must have cut the signal wires. That is their known modus. The train stopped since it could not get the signal. And it was running late as it is due to the double line work that is ongoing and railway blocks. They found the train at a dark time and stationary,” said assistant inspector Yuvraj Kalkutge of Daund Government railway police station. The men robbed one woman, identified as Kalpana Srirame (48), in Sleeper 4 compartment. They fled with mangalsutra of around 18gram gold, according to the police. The three got off the compartment, ran ahead, and forced themselves into Sleeper 4 where they grabbed a 11gram necklace of another woman called Meenakshi Gaikwad (32) who was travelling with her brother, the injured man. “He saw from a distance that someone was robbing his sister and ran after them and jumped out of the train. He caught hold of one of them and pinned him, that is when one of the remaining two returned and attacked him with a stone. He underwent treatment and went home,” said API Kulkutge. The phenomenon of dacoity by cutting signal wires is known along stations that come four stations after Daund while travelling from Pune, according to the GRP officials. “There were a number of such cases from four stations after Daund. In the past few years, this is the first time that it has happened in Daund. We had increased the security in the known areas maybe that is why they targeted a less likely spot,” said API Kalkutge. Two major gangs from the area have been arrested under separate cases in which Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) has been invoked. In the current case, Sections 394 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code was invoked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/one-injured-in-dacoity-onboard-konark-express-in-daund-101635362079553.html

Both seats were won by JD (U) in the 2020 assembly elections.Prasad, who has been away from the state since December 2017 when he was convicted and jailed in fodder scam cases, held election rallies in both constituencies on Wednesday.“Lalu unleashed his tongue while Nitish Kumar’s work speaks for him. Nobody can forget the journey to Kusheshwar Asthan from Darbhanga 16 years ago and the smooth ride today. It would have been better had Laluji talked about what his government had done. People enjoying round-the-clock electricity supply will not like to even remember the lantern age they were condemned to live in earlier,” said Bihar minister and JD(U) general secretary Sanjay Jha, who has been camping in the area for weeks.“If Bihar today has infant mortality rate (IMR) less than the national average, which is reflected through the Centre’s report released on Tuesday, it shows how the Nitish Kumar government has worked at the basics,” he said.JD (U) spokesman Neeraj Kumar said that despite his illness, Lalu Prasad going for campaigning shows he does not have trust in the ability of his son and heir apparent Tejashwi Prasad Yadav. “There has been no change in his approach despite consistent drubbing at the hands of the voters since 2005 and the bypoll results will also be no different. Nitish Kumar has given him enough of political treatment in the last 15 years.

The men showed the products and cash memos for their auction bid to the complainant. The men quoted ₹60,000 for all three products which would cost over ₹2.5 lakh if bought at a legitimate store. However, when the men handed over the bag, they exchanged it with the one that had bricks and a pouch with a glass instead of the laptop, phone, and watch. A case under Sections 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust), and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code was registered at Chandannagar police station. Assistant inspector Gajanan Pawar of Chandannagar police station is investigating the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/man-cheated-of-rs-60k-for-bricks-guised-as-apple-products-two-arrested-101635361839915.html

Out of this, 1,425 were first dose beneficiaries and remaining were second doses. A total of 19 colleges have participated in the drive and had their teaching and non-teaching staff benefit from the drive. The drive was started with the aim to vaccinate both teaching and non-teaching staff and also students with the vaccine as the district administration allowed reopening of colleges post Dussehra. Although the absolute numbers have been low, a significant percentage of the people who have gotten their vaccine through the drive have been those who took the dose for the first time. Majority of the beneficiaries were also aged between 18-45, the youngest of those eligible to get the vaccine. Dr Suryakant Deokar, PMC immunization officer said, “Many of the beneficiaries are first dose beneficiaries however all of these beneficiaries are not necessarily from Pune and so it could be that students who have come from outside districts and those who couldn’t get the vaccine in their district took it through this drive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/special-college-vaccination-drive-gets-slow-response-in-pune-101635361780817.html

They had objected to the same but, the gardener continued the exercise and stated that pruning of trees was being done on orders of higher authorities.Residents Ravjot Singh and Charanpal Singh Aulakh stated that on one hand, the government and administration are encouraging the residents to plant more trees, on the other hand, the civic body is chopping the trees in the name of pruning.Ravjot said,” The authorities should take note of the problem as the green cover is already depleting. Earlier too, incidents have been reported from the area wherein branches of decades-old trees were chopped off and economically weaker sections of the society took those away. This should stop, and efforts should be made to plant more trees in the neighbourhood.”The residents also raised objections against the installation of interlocking tiles around the roots of the trees, which ultimately stops their growth.Area councillor Seema Kapoor said,” No official complaint has been received in this regard. However, I will look into the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/residents-object-to-felling-of-trees-in-ludhiana-101635361659316.html

Presiding over a district-level kisan mela and exhibition organised by the agriculture department, the former health minister said that farmers of the entire nation have been agitating for one year but Narendra Modi-led Union Government has not paid any heed to their plight. He said that in fact everyone talks of grand plans for doubling the farmers’ income by 2022, but in reality no one bothers about their plight for no concrete policies have been made for them. ‘’The use of force cannot solve the problem as it can’t muzzle their voice. Hence, it becomes imperative on the part of the Centre to recognise the pain, pangs and depth of farmers’ emotions and sentiments to reach out to them sensitively to find a viable mechanism to redress their genuine grievances,’’ he added. The three-time Mohali MLA said that the state government has decided to summon the 16th Special Session of 15th Punjab Vidhan Sabha on November 8 to repeal the three black farm laws. Highlighting the need of crop diversification during the kisan mela, Sidhu said that its adoption helps in conservation of natural resources besides to get best price for other crops such as rapeseed and cotton. He said that untimely downpour played havoc for farmers but the state government is committed to compensate the farmers and already ordered a special girdawari to assess the damage. He also called agriculture scientists to develop such methods or pesticides/insecticides to control crop diseases so that yield can’t be affected. He demanded ₹150 per quintal as bonus on paddy from the Union Government to manage the stubble in the field.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/black-farm-laws-should-be-repealed-immediately-mohali-mla-101635361419301.html

The three accused occupied seats on the bus and were aware of the complainant carrying gold ornaments. “The accused and their family members stalk wholesale gold dealers who transport gold from one state to another. They pretend to be pilgrims and live in the vicinity of the houses of people who transport gold. They book themselves on the same bus on which their targets book tickets. When the person is sleeping or not paying attention, they pick up the bag. They tell the driver to stop the bus by citing sudden death of a family member,” read a statement by SP Deshmukh. The complainant had boarded the bus in Hubli and was headed towards Mumbai in a private transport bus registered in the name of a travel company in Karnataka. A case under Sections 379 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) has been registered at Rajgad police station in the case which dates back to October 11.

This year, the variety is limited to 15 types and the sound firecrackers, especially “sutli” (string wrapped cracker) and joined firecrackers (series crackers or laris) seem to have lost their effect According to MPCB, some crackers will burst at even below the stipulated sound levels, with maximum allowable decibel of 125dB for impulse sound pressure single firecrackers and peak allowable decibel at 145dB. On October 20, MPCB conducted its annual firecracker testing programme at an open ground in Tingarenagar, Vishrantwadi where 15 types of firecrackers were tested. Firecracker companies like Anil fireworks, Sivakasi Anil Fireworks, Rekha fireworks, Mahalaxmi industries, Anil Moto Sivakasi, Shree Subhalaxmi fireworks and Ramanna fireworks were on trial. “We tested regular ‘sutli’ crackers with names like Saddam Bomb Green, Jocker Bomb and Maga Bomb which are usually the loudest single firecrackers but this year on the sound pressure level, they recorded between 100.3dB to 99.7dB. There is no noise level limit written on firecracker which is a must,” said Pratap Jagtap, sub regional officer, MPCB. Popular crackers like “Chorsa Garland or the whistling rocket”, “Flowerpot”, “Rocket Bomb” or “7 Shots” too fell short in the noise level test and recorded at 113.6dB, 81.9dB, 64dB, 78dB and 97.8dB respectively. “The idea of holding such firecracker testing is also to create public awareness and upload the data on the website to facilitate customers who buy firecrackers,” said Jagtap. He said that this year as in 2019, there are no green firecrackers on sale or for testing. “Perhaps, they might be on sale on the day of Diwali,” he said.

Chief general manager of CSCL, NP Sharma, said, “This is due to difficulties in procurement. The same company is implementing the PBS system in other cities of the country and due to this, demand of cycles is very high. The launch of the second phase is likely to be delayed by one to two months.” Sharma added that they have already been able to add 400 more cycles and procured parts for more docking stations and the project is going forward as planned.The bicycle sharing project will be launched in four phases. The first phase was launched in August with 1,250 smart cycles and 155 docking stations. The second phase also plans to add 1,250 more smart cycles and 155 more docking stations. By the end of the fourth phase, which is scheduled to be completed sometime in 2022, the project envisions a total of 5,000 cycles and 617 docking stations, making it the densest PBS system of India.Meanwhile, road safety experts are calling for the administration to improve the quality of cycle tracks and build more cycle tracks in the southern parts of the city. The recently released Road Safety in Chandigarh 2020 report points out how the percentage of cyclist fatalities in 2020 was the highest in the past five years. The initial popularity of the system is also dipping. In the first month after its launch, there were an average of 2,742 rides a day. The statistics now indicate that the average number of rides has come down to 1,733 per day. Due to technical glitches earlier, rides were being booked for free, but from September 21 onwards, ₹10 plus GST is being charged per half an hour after which numbers have started coming down.Till date 1,27,469 rides have been booked and 9,94,258.2 kilometres have been covered, bringing the average length per trip to 7.8 kilometers per trip. There are 1,19,577 registered users on the SmartBike app. While officials didn’t share data related to vandalism of these smart cycles, it can be seen at many station that their handles or baskets are damaged. As many as 193 cases of vandalism had reported in the first month of the project, with incidents where some people had also tried to steal these cycles and take them home.The project is being implemented and operated by the concessionaire M/s Smart Bike Tech Private Limited, Hyderabad, for a period of 10 years on public private partnership (PPP) basis with no cost to the administration||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-phase-2-of-bicycle-sharing-project-faces-delay-101635361119238.html

As per the tender, the PMC will provide the necessary space at the civic hospital in Mohammadwadi while TrustHealth Care Foundation will provide the necessary trained and untrained manpower and machinery while also paying the salaries of the employed manpower. The PMC already has 306.87 square metre of space lying vacant on the first floor of the civic hospital in Mohammadwadi. The corporation will not charge the agency any rent while the agency will be allowed to charge only the amount as decided in the contract, which will be 10% less than the CGHS. Determined by the central government, the CGHS rates were updated on May 2, 2021 and are different for NABH/NABL and non-NABH/NABL hospitals. The facility will provide major relief to people living in and around the area as charges will be lower than government charges.Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant health officer, said, “This will be a pilot project and the hospital will be the first-of-its-kind to provide these services at a civic facility. The hospital will provide primary treatment for cancer-like surgeries or chemotherapy but not for complicated treatment such as radiotherapy.

Three teams have been formed by the city police with two of them camping in Uttar Pradesh while one team is carrying out an independent search. Gosavi’s selfie with Aryan Khan, the son of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, and later recording his statement as part of NCB probe went viral on social media.

Covovax is the third Covid-19 vaccine to be tested on children in India, after Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D.PGIMER is among the 10 institutes conducting the trials, which is aimed at checking the safety and immune response of the vaccine. The institute aims to immunise around 100 children, with two doses of 0.5 ml each, on Day 1 and Day 22 respectively.However, the PGIMER has received only 20 registrations from the children volunteering for the trials, so far. Dr Madhu Gupta, professor at community medicine and school of public health and principal investigator of the project, said, “PGIMER has got ethical clearance for conducting the trials. However, now we are waiting to receive vaccine stock from the SII and expecting to start by next week.”‘Vaccine safe, children can volunteer’Dr Gupta added, “In the initial stages of the trials, the efficacy of Covovax is said to be over 90% and it is completely safe. However, not many parents have shown interest in registering their children for trials, so far, but keeping in view the zero side effects being reported post inoculation, parents must end hesitancy and allow their children to volunteer.”While inviting children, the PGIMER authorities said: “Parents of healthy children, who want their kids to participate in the trials, can fill the consent form and send it to the institute through email or text message. The consent form is available at https://forms.gle/rmFo2kJrjwivHaeA8 and can be sent at covovax2021@gmail.com or 7347665382 or 7347665383.”‘Children should not wait for vaccine to start going for school’Meanwhile, Dr Suman Singh, director of health services, Chandigarh, said, “The sero-survey conducted by PGIMER and GMCH-32 showed herd immunity in Chandigarh against the virus. Also, low severity of virus infection was recorded among the paediatric population during the surge. The adults are also vaccinated against the virus and thus, children should not wait for the roll out the Covid vaccine to start going to school.”“Parents must send their children to school as the online classes are already affecting their mental health. Children are safe due to herd immunity and anti-covid vaccines will further help them stay protected”, said Dr Gupta, adding that India may start rolling-out vaccines for children from early next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-vaccine-for-children-pgimer-to-start-covovax-trials-next-week-101635360462989.html
28-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Infra push to tackle soaring dengue cases||Surge in dengue cases has prompted authorities to revamp the health infrastructure to tackle eventualities. The apheresis machine at the Ludhiana civil hospital that had been lying defunct for nearly four years is all set to be made operational as the management has roped in an engineer to fix the snag. An apheresis machine separates blood received from donors into its various components like plasma, platelets and white and red blood cells. The machine bought for ₹42 lakh in 2011 has not been in working condition since 2017. Senior medical officer (SMO) Dr Amarjeet Kaur said, “It is a very effective machine and fresh white blood cells extracted from the donor and administered to the patients show great results. However, due many hiccups, there were no takers for the procedure. Firstly, overhead cost of the procedure was roughly about ₹9,000 and then the persons opting for the procedure had to look for donors. Majority of the patients opted for white blood cells available with the blood bank. Due lack of usage, the machine faced maintenance issues. However, we have roped in an engineer and hopefully it will start functioning again.”‘Rising cases also indicator of more testing’The dengue cases, which were under control till September, have spiraled in the month of October. As many as 643 dengue cases have been reported in the district in the past 25 days whereas the month of September saw 151 cases of mosquito bite. While 23 cases were registered in August, eight were logged in July and two in June.Ludhiana civil surgeon Dr SP Singh said the rising cases were also an indicator of more testing. “Soon after taking charge, I had convened a meeting of private hospital authorities and members of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), asking them to share the details of patients who were turning positive in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a parameter to detect dengue. There is no point in holding the information. It should be known so that timely intervention could be made and preventive measures be taken to avoid further spreading of the infection,” the doctor added. 124 beds earmarked for dengue patientsIn the wake of rising cases of dengue, the health department has increased the number of beds in government hospital across the district. According to civil surgeon Dr SP Singh, a total of 124 beds have been dedicated to dengue patients. In civil hospital alone, the number of beds has been increased from 12 to 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-infra-push-to-tackle-soaring-dengue-cases-101635360340507.html

According to state advisor of Samagra Shiksha RN Singh, as per education department records, there were over 8,000 blind students in the state last year. A monitoring process is also being developed so that the children are able to get maximum benefit from this initiative. The tablets were expected to reach the children by the end of November 2021, said Ritwik Patra, education specialist, UNICEF, UP. The UNICEF office for Uttar Pradesh, in partnership with Samagra Shiksha, Uttar Pradesh and District Institute of Education and Training (DIET) Lucknow took the initiative to provide tablets with accessible software and bundled with accessible learning materials to 1206 children with total blindness identified from 14 districts of Devipatan, Gorakhpur and Lucknow divisions, he said. He said, “The children are identified through Mission Prerna’s SAMARTH programme. At present the tablets are being installed with accessible software. The features will be Artificial Intelligence with the daily use of the smartphone to give people with visual impairment more independence for their daily life activities, no-dependence of Internet connection and Hindi as a medium of operations.” Patra said, “(DIET, Lucknow is helping to develop accessible lessons for children with blindness. Text books of class 1-3 will be bundled with the tablets and the visually impaired children will be able to access these books through the accessible software.” “We are in the process of recording the literature and numerical aspects of books of class I to 3 that will be uploaded in the tablets. We have finalised the script and will begin recording in the next phase. Our aim is to conclude this exercise by the end of this year,” said Pawan Sachan, principal, DIET Lucknow. Patra said, ”We realised during the Covid-19 pandemic that children suffering from blindness remained excluded from the efforts made to continue teaching. Considering this we decided to take up this project.” He said, “Special educators of these 14 districts are being trained so that they can in turn train the children and parents while distributing the tablets. A monitoring process is also being developed so that the children are able to get maximum benefit from this initiative.” Chhavi Agarwal, assiatnt teacher of model primary school Vanpura Kashi Vidyapeeth, who is being trained under the initiative, said, “We are trying to make the best possible learning content for the students suffering from blindness.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/now-tablets-with-study-material-for-visually-impaired-up-children-101635359619121.html
28-10-2021||Delhi||High court seeks time frame for setting up JJBs in all 11 Delhi districts||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Wednesday sought to know from the Delhi government the time frame for setting up Juvenile Justice Boards (JJBs) in all the 11 districts in the city. A bench of justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup J Bhambhani also sought to know from the city government about the allocation of funds they have done in the last couple of years for JJBs in the city along with the amount disbursed.The court was hearing a criminal reference by the principal magistrate of the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB)-2, Delhi Gate, which concerns circumstances when a child in conflict with law (‘CCL’) also happens to be a child in need for care and protection (‘CNCP’).During the hearing, the court expressed concerns over the non-production of the CCL before a magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest.“The question is you can’t stage the hamlet without the Prince of Denmark. The Prince has to make his appearance. Once he is there, only then you can stage the hamlet. That is where it begins. You are saying that there is a problem with juvenile justice boards,” the court said.“What we have done so far is that there has to be appearance within 24 hours regardless of whether the juvenile is in safe custody of the board or guardian or kept in an observation home temporarily. Then within two weeks, the age related documents have to be obtained and furnished to the JJB. Then the board will make a call within two weeks apart from cases where ossification test is required which again has to be done within two weeks,” the court said.The bench also remarked that a society is judged on how it takes care of its children and if we are unable to do that, then “God helps us”.Advocate Nandita Rao, appearing for the Delhi government, informed the court about the institutions available for children and said that there are three types of homes under the Juvenile Justice Act.The court granted four weeks time to the city government to respond on various aspects and listed the matter for further hearing on December 14.Last month, the high court had directed the closure of all cases involving children arrested in petty crimes where the inquiry has been pending and remains inconclusive for a period longer than one year, regardless of whether such child or juvenile has been produced before the Juvenile Justice Boards in Delhi.Petty crimes under Juvenile Justice (JJ) Act are defined as those which entail a maximum imprisonment up to three years. These include offences such as assault, causing simple hurt, theft, forgery etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/high-court-seeks-time-frame-for-setting-up-jjbs-in-all-11-delhi-districts-101635359499192.html

28-10-2021||Delhi||Diyas symbolise Diwali, crackers cause pollution: Delhi environment minister||The Delhi government launched its anti-firecracker campaign ‘Patake Nahi, Diye Jalao’ on Wednesday with the environment minister Gopal Rai lighting a series of diyas at his residence.He asked people to embrace tradition and eliminate pollution by celebrating the festival using earthen lamps instead of crackers. As part of the campaign, 15 teams will cover each of the 15 Delhi Police districts to identify instances of firecrackers being burst or sold leading up to Diwali. Each team will consist of five to seven members.The violators will be prosecuted under sections 188 and 286 of the IPC as well as under the Explosives Act – one which entails a jail term up to three years.The second component of the campaign involves reaching out to RWAs and market associations to discourage bursting of firecrackers, and instead urging people to learn to associate Diwali more with ‘diyas’.The Delhi government has also asked people to report instances of firecrackers being burst or sold by calling 112. All 157 police stations across Delhi have set up a dedicated team of two to deal with firecracker related issues.“The Delhi government appeals to all the people of Delhi to celebrate Diwali using diyas and not crackers. Diye Se Diwali Hoti Hai; Patakhe Se Pradushan Hota Hai’ (Diwali is celebrated by lighting Diyas, crackers only cause pollution),” said Rai on Wednesday, stating before firecrackers existed, celebrations only consisted of lighting diyas.“Some people say that it is a matter of religion and culture, but I want to reiterate that it is not. It is a matter of saving lives. When the tradition of celebrating Diwali started in our culture, there was no existence of crackers. We lit diyas and celebrated it. We need to embrace these traditions to protect lives,” he added.On Karva Chauth, which was celebrated on Sunday, eight people were prosecuted by the Delhi Police for bursting firecrackers across the Capital, Rai then said.Last year, the Delhi government initially allowed green firecrackers to be burst or sold, but later cancelled those licences. This year, the government says a notification announcing the ban on crackers was issued to the police and district magistrates on September 28 itself, pre-empting the authorities issuing any licences to the traders.Large scale bursting of firecrackers, coupled with low temperatures, and stubble fires have caused hazardous levels of pollution in the city. Last year, despite the ban on crackers, Delhi recorded numerous violations on Diwali, as the overall PM 2.5 levels spiked up to 33 times the safe standard at locations such as Vivek Vihar in east Delhi.A senior environment department official said while the authority to penalise people lies with the police, the department will receive daily action taken reports from them every day.“Leading up to Diwali, efforts have been intensified to ensure no firecrackers are sold or burst anywhere,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/diyas-symbolise-diwali-crackers-cause-pollution-delhi-environment-minister-101635359379184.html
28-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC notice to Centre, cops on plea against traffic barricades||The Delhi high court on Wednesday sought the response of the Centre and city police on a plea seeking removal of unnecessary mobile police barricades installed on city roads and in residential colonies.A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh issued notice to the authorities on the plea by Jan Sewa Welfare Society against the alleged “menace of unmindful and erratic installation” of such barricades, pointing out that it is in violation of 2018 guidelines on its use.The plea further said that one of the reasons for huge traffic snarls in the city is the unnecessary barricading of roads by the police.“It is evident that mismanagement and unprofessional attitude of Delhi Police in installation of iron barricades on several roads all over Delhi causes grave hardship and inconvenience to the safety, security and welfare of the public. Many times installation of chained barricades on the roads have proved to be fatal,” the plea said.The plea said that according to the 2018 guidelines by Delhi Police, a mobile barricade installed in the night must have necessary fluorescent paint/reflective tapes and blinkers so that they are visible from far.It also said that the staff deployed on these points must also wear specially designed fluorescent jackets while performing duties at night.“Placement of barricades by police stations should have the prior approval of at least the ACP so that these are not placed at points which cause traffic congestion or unnecessary inconvenience,” said the guidelines, as quoted from the petition.It added that the barricades should be positioned in such a manner that when the traffic slows down for checking, heavy vehicles should not have difficulty moving.“While the checking of vehicles is of prime importance, the safety of staff as well as of road users is also equally important. Placement/distance of one barricade from another be done in such a manner that the staff performing duties can protect themselves in case of any speeding or dangerously driven vehicle hits the barricades,” it said.“While alignment of barricades should be done in such a way as to ensure that traffic slows down for checking, at the same time it should not be placed in a manner that they cannot be negotiated, especially by heavy vehicles,” it addedCentral government standing counsel Ajay Digpaul accepted the notice on behalf of the Union government.The matter will now be heard on November 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-notice-to-centre-cops-on-plea-against-traffic-barricades-101635359020689.html
28-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC seeks clarity on age checks for liquor home delivery scheme||The Delhi high court on Wednesday sought to know from the Delhi government how it would ensure that liquor is not home-delivered to a minor.A bench comprising chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh asked the government the details of the process while hearing a plea by Bharatiya Janata Party leader Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma challenging the government’s doorstep delivery of liquor scheme. “How will you verify the age of the purchaser? You must answer this query. You cannot say you will not answer this,” the court said.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra said that there will be provisions in place such as Aadhaar number or other age proof. According to a new policy, the legal age to consume liquor in Delhi is 21 years.Verma’s plea contended that the new policy was introduced at a time when the national capital was “still grappling with the deadly second wave (of Covid-19) and acute shortage of medicines and vaccinations”, and also overlooked the impact of bringing alcohol into households with domestic and child abuse.Defending the government’s home delivery of liquor scheme, Mehra said that the scheme existed even before the New Excise Policy 2021 came into effect and only its mode has changed.“Before the amendment, the provision was that if an order came by email or fax, it could have been delivered. Now there is an amendment that says that instead of email or fax, on the mobile, or through an application on social media, it can be done. The method and mode have been changed. This (delivery of liquor) has been a part of the provision from the last 20-30 years and has existed even earlier,” Mehra argued.The counsel representing BJP leader Verma said they have challenged the provision as there is no process of age surveillance in the scheme, and liquor could very well be delivered to an underage person at a public place.Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing the Delhi government, said even if a person goes out to purchase alcohol, he will bring it home so the impact on children would be the same.The court asked for the Delhi government to place its reply on record and listed the plea for hearing on November 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-seeks-clarity-on-age-checks-for-liquor-home-delivery-scheme-101635358659154.html
28-10-2021||Delhi||Doctor promised kidney donor, duped of ₹10 lakh in Delhi||The Delhi Police crime branch on Wednesday said they arrested two men for allegedly duping a Mumbai-based surgeon of ₹10 lakh by claiming to arrange a kidney donor for him in Delhi. The police said the two cheated at least five other people in Delhi and other states, including Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, using the same modus operandi.They were part of an organised racket that was in touch with over 50 people who needed medical treatment in Delhi. At least two suspects in the case are on the run, the police said.Joint commissioner of police (crime) Alok Kumar said that they arrested the two men after investigating a cheating case registered on the complaint of Mumbai surgeon Dr Rajiv Chandra, who was duped of ₹10 lakh by the racketeers. Chandra is suffering from congenital kidney disease, for which he needed a transplant. However, none of the doctor’s relatives could donate a kidney, said the joint CP.Chandra came across an advertisement that offered a kidney donor and transplant at a leading hospital in Delhi. His friend contacted one Karan, who promised to arrange a kidney donor and said the transplant would cost ₹22 lakh. The doctor paid ₹4.5 lakh in advance and paid another ₹5.5 lakh on September 16. After taking the money, Karan switched off his phone and fled. “We found that Karan’s real name was Vipin Kumar. We laid a trap and arrested him on October 19 from Kanpur. His interrogation led to the arrest of his associate, Rohit Kumar Yadav, from Pratapgarh in UP,” the joint CP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/doctor-promised-kidney-donor-duped-of-10-lakh-in-delhi-101635358479518.html
28-10-2021||Delhi||Bedridden for a year, elderly couple hang selves at south Delhi home||An elderly couple, who was bedridden for the past year after suffering multiple fractures in a road accident, allegedly killed themselves at their home in south Delhi’s Kalkaji Extension on Wednesday, police said.The couple, aged 74 and 69, retired as teachers from Delhi University several years ago.Police said they found two suicide notes in which the couple said they were ending their lives because they were bedridden.Deputy commissioner of police (southeast) Esha Pandey said that on Wednesday around 3.45pm, a woman informed the police that her parents had taken their lives at home.A police team reached the house and met the caller, who told them that her parents were bedridden and lived by themselves.

She had hired a caretaker for themThe police said that around 2.30pm, the caretaker went to the couple’s house and rang the doorbell several times but nobody responded. The caretaker panicked and informed the couple’s daughter. She immediately arrived and broke the lock with the caretaker’s help. They entered the house and found the couple dead, the police said.“A team inspected the place and found two suicide notes on a table. The bodies were handed over to the family after an autopsy.

28-10-2021||Delhi||All south Delhi wards to get primary health care centre, civic agency says||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has approved a proposal for setting up primary health care facilities in civic wards which still have no such units, even as a few officials pointed out that the shortage of health workers may pose a hurdle in staffing these new units.Col (retd) BK Oberoi, the standing committee chairman, said that primary health care facilities, like dispensaries and mother and child welfare (MCW) centres, can be accommodated in existing municipal buildings such as community halls and office complexes. “In the first phase, we have taken up 10 such wards for setting up health care units. Every left out ward needs to be covered,” the chairman said.Among the areas identified for the project are Sagarpur, Mohan Garden, Tughlaqabad extension, Goyla Dairy and Keshopur. A senior official from the health department said that some of the dispensaries will be set up in porta cabins or modified shipping containers due to space constraints.According to the Centre’s urban primary health care centre guidelines, the civic body will require at least one doctor, one pharmacist, one ward nurse and two multi-task workers for each unit.“The total financial implication in terms of recurring costs for each dispensary will be around ₹58.5 lakh per annum. For the time being, eight dispensaries and two primary health care centres are being opened. The primary concern will be shortage of healthcare staff,” said a senior municipal official, requesting anonymity.The new policy, which was cleared by the standing committee of the south MCD on Tuesday, calls for alternating some staff in nearby health centres as an interim measure to tackle the staff crunch. It also said the hospital administration department is planning a separate proposal for creation of new posts such as doctors, pharmacists and nurses to meet the staff shortfall.The staff and financial crunch had come to the fore earlier when the civic body was unable to expand its services in its Kalkaji colony hospital.Pointing to the shortage of doctors, funds and land, Prem Chauhan, the leader of the opposition, said that the civic body should coordinate with the Delhi government. “There are wards which are full of unauthorised colonies and the municipal corporation owns no land in such areas. Who will bear the additional financial burden? The civic body will later argue that the government is not providing them funds,” he said.Last month, municipal commissioner Gyanesh Bharti pointed out that setting up new healthcare facilities without creating new posts may not be an easy. “Any additional requirement of health staff while operationalising new facilities puts an undue pressure on the department and hampers the normal day-to-day functioning of existing healthcare facilities. The department has to mobilise staff from existing units on alternate days as interim arrangement. Consequently, the quality of services gets compromised,” he said in a letter to the standing committee on September 14, 2021.Col (retd) Oberoi said the civic body will tackle the problems. “In the interim, the corporation will divert health workers from nearby health care centres and ask them to alternate between the two centres,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/all-south-delhi-wards-to-get-primary-healthcare-centres-civic-agency-says-101635358120560.html
28-10-2021||Delhi||Only e-buses will be added to city fleet in future: Kailash Gahlot||Delhi will only procure electric buses in the future, with an aim to increase the share of zero-emission vehicles in public transport to over 50%, transport minister Kailash Gahlot said on Wednesday.In an interview with Hindustan Times, Gahlot said the Delhi government will order 800 CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) buses in two batches — 450 in the first and 350 in the second — to replace cluster buses, which have reached their end of life.“These will be the last batches of CNG buses that the Delhi government will procure. After that, we have decided to procure only electric buses for public transport,” Gahlot said.Delhi currently has a fleet of 6,793 buses, of which 3,760 are run by the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and 3,033 are operated by the Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS) Limited through the state transport department.
28-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: In first for the season, temp below 15°C as AQI worsens||The mercury fell below the 15-degree Celsius mark on Wednesday morning for the first time this winter, with the minimum temperature recorded at 14.6 degrees Celsius — two notches below normal — as Delhi’s air quality deteriorated sharply in the last 24 hours, and was expected to get over the rest of the week.Delhi’s overall Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at 232 (poor), from Tuesday’s reading of 139 (moderate), largely owing to a rise in farm fires across the northern plains as the contribution of stubble burning in Delhi’s overall PM 2.5 concentration touched a season high of 16%, data from the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) showed.Safar, which comes under the Union ministry of earth sciences, has forecast that the air quality will further deteriorate “rapidly” in the next 24 hours to touch “very poor” by Thursday, and then hit the higher end of the “very poor” category by Friday.“Delhi’s AQI is in the ‘poor’ category. The effective fire count of stubble burning in the northwest region of Delhi is 656 and its share in PM2.5 is 16% as transport level winds are north westerly. AQI is now forecasted to deteriorate rapidly and slip to the ‘very poor’ category by Thursday and deteriorate further to the higher end of the ‘very poor’ category by Friday,” SAFAR said on Wednesday, stating that calm local winds, along with highly favourable transport-level winds (northwesterly winds that will bring pollution from Punjab and Haryana towards Delhi) are expected to enhance stubble-burning related intrusion.“Any increase in fire counts in the next three days would increase the finer particle levels of Delhi,” it added.Prior to Wednesday, the highest contribution of stubble burning in Delhi’s air was 15% on October 21.Two stations – Shadipur and Anand Vihar were in the “very poor” category, with readings of 316 and 313 respectively.An AQI between 51 and 100 is classified as “satisfactory”, between 101 and 200 is “moderate”, between 201 and 300 is “poor”, and between 301 and 400 is “very poor”. An AQI over 401 is meanwhile classified as “severe” by the Central Pollution Control Board. The Capital’s air quality deteriorates to hazardous levels every winter, plunging the city into a public health emergency.Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) says while a delayed monsoon has helped control pollution spikes, historical data shows an episodic smog event is generally seen in late-October and early November, coinciding with stubble burning peaks and Diwali.“With the current meteorological conditions, we may see another such event before or around Diwali and the exposure to air pollution during this period is at its peak. With Covid-19 still around, as a community, we may have to avoid exposure to outside air and this is generally seen each year when regulatory agencies ask people to avoid stepping out or exercising during smog events,” she said.Safdarjung,Delhi’s base station recorded a maximum temperature of 28.2 degrees Celsius on Wednesday – three notches below normal, while the minimum was recorded at 14.6 degrees. Mayur Vihar recorded the lowest maximum temperature on Wednesday at 26.8 degrees, while the lowest minimum across Delhi was 14.1 degrees Celsius at Mungeshpur.A Met official says local winds are becoming calm at night, which coincides with a drop in temperature, leading to a spike in pollution late at night and in the morning. “Following the rain, there is also moisture in the air and you are now seeing a slight haze at night. Calm winds mean the contribution from stubble burning and local pollutants are now becoming trapped and similar conditions are expected in the next few days,” said the official who asked not to be named.IMD has forecast the minimum temperature to remain around 14 degrees Celsius for the next two days, and said it could dip to 13 degrees by Saturday.The maximum temperature, meanwhile, is expected to remain below 30 degrees till the end of the week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-mercury-falls-below-15-bad-air-rises-101635357399383.html

But Nitish Kumar formed government through cheating and manipulation. Had I not been outside the state, it would not have happened,” he said at Idgah Maidan in Tarapur assembly constituency, where voting for bypoll is scheduled for October 30, along with Kushweshwar Asthan.Lalu Prasad, who returned to Bihar last Sunday, has been away from the state since December 2017, when he was convicted and jailed in Jharkhand in connection with the fodder scam cases. He last campaigned in an election during the 2015 assembly poll, which RJD and CM Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) fought in alliance.RJD and JD (U) are ranged against each other in bypolls for two assembly seats, both won in 2020 by the JD (U), in a fight that has become triangular after Congress too decided to field candidates from both seats.Training his guns at Kumar, the former chief minister said, “I had said ensure visarjan (immersion) for the NDA government. Now, Nitish is saying I can get him shot. Why will I do it? He will himself die.”The RJD chief, who flew to Tarapur on a helicopter, also addressed a meeting at Kushweshwar Asthan in the afternoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-bypolls-in-his-first-rally-in-6-years-lalu-rips-into-nitish-101635350198477.html
28-10-2021||Lucknow||Anti-India slogans: Three Kashmiri students arrested in Agra||Agra Three Kashmiri students booked for raising anti-national slogans after India-Pak match in T 20 World Cup on Sunday were arrested by Agra police on Wednesday evening. The arrest followed an FIR registered against them at Jagdishpura police station of Agra last night on the complaint of BJP Yuva Morcha leader Gaurav Rajawat. “Three Kashmiri students from Bichpuri campus of Raja Balwant Singh (RBS) Engineering College in Agra were arrested on Wednesday evening. A case has been registered against all three at Jagdishpura police station under section 153A (promoting enmity and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), 505(1)(b) (inducing to commit an offence against the State or against the public tranquility) of the Indian Penal Code, besides Section 66F (cyber terrorism) of Information Technology (Amended) Act 2008,” informed PK Singh, the inspector in charge of Jagdispura police station of Agra. According to the FIR registered at Jagdishpura police station, the complainant Gaurav Rajawat alleged that these three Kashmiri students had raised anti -national slogans like “Bharat desh ke tukde honge” and praised Pakistan by raising slogans of ‘Pakistan Zindabad”. “These three students from Kashmir had shared anti-national chats on social media. This reflects that they have bad intentions of causing lawlessness in the country by disturbing the peace and tranquility of nation and so they should face legal consequences,” said Rajawat. The matter was under investigation, said police sources. Meanwhile, protests were held by right wing organizations at Collectorate and action was sought against the three students. In another development, the management of RBS College closed all its seven institution to protest ‘anarchy’ by student groups led by BJP Yuva Morcha. “College authorities had acted once the matter came to their notice on Monday. These three students from Kashmir were questioned and written clarification was sought regarding exchange of anti-national chats social media after the match result. The trio was also suspended from the hostel as part of disciplinary action,” informed Ashish Shukla, chief proctor, RBS Engineering Technical Campus. “Yet outsiders created ruckus on Bichpuri campus of RBS Engineering Technical College on Tuesday and marred the reputation of the college known for its academic excellence. As a protest, all institutions of RBS College are being closed for an indefinite period,” informed Shukla. Demand for action against ‘outsiders’ was raised by principal and faculty members of RBS College through a press note issued on Wednesday. It may be recalled that members of BJP Yuva Morcha had reached Bichpuri campus on Tuesday and had demanded action against Kashmiri students. These activists had verbal exchanges with college authorities. The college authorities maintained that they had acted against the Kashmiri students who were admitted under PMSSS (Prime Minister Special Scholarship Scheme) through AICTE but the activists of BJP Yuva Morcha sought tougher action against them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/antiindia-slogans-case-registered-against-three-kashmiri-students-in-agra-101635347438750.html

For this purpose, an agency is required for providing field staff / mobile sahayaks.”It mentioned that the government plans to open bids on November 22.The project currently involves delivery of birth certificates, caste certificates, income certificates and drivers’ licence among others. After expansion, it plans to include widow pension, financial assistance meant for construction workers under the Welfare Board, school leaving certificates, transfer certificates, and other documents, said a senior government official, adding: “By March 2022, the project should have 400 services -- covering all aspects of public dealing and governance.”The project was launched in September 2018 with 30 public services such as delivery of caste certificates, marriage certificate, birth certificates, and drivers’ licence. In 2019, the government added 70 more public services to the list, taking the total to 100. The government planned to add more services in 2020 and 2021, but couldn’t extend it because of the Covid-19 pandemic.To avail the services, a citizen has to call the 1076.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-doorstep-delivery-project-to-add-300-services-by-march-2022-101635328717133.html
28-10-2021||Delhi||DDMA allows Chhath Puja celebrations at select spots||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Wednesday allowed the celebration of Chhath Puja in public at designated places with Covid-19 protocols in place, said deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia.“Covid-19 cases in Delhi are significantly low for a while now. Experts are also of the opinion that Chhath Puja celebrations can be allowed with some strict protocols in place. It can be celebrated only at designated spots with strict adherence to social distancing and other Covid-19 regulations. It is a major festival for a large number of Delhi residents celebrate,” said Sisodia at a press briefing after attending a meeting of the DDMA.The DDMA, which lays down or eases restrictions in place to curb the spread of Covid-19, banned the festival at public places including on the banks of the Yamuna and temples, on September 30, evoking sharp political reactions.This year, Chhath Puja will be celebrated on November 10, six days after Diwali. It is a community festival involving worship of the Sun and taking dips in a water body. It is celebrated by people from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand, collectively called the Poorvanchal region.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on October 14 wrote to Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal urging him to allow Chhath Puja celebrations with adherence to Covid-19 protocol. Baijal is DDMA chairperson.On October 12, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia wrote to the Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya, urging the Centre to issue guidelines for the Chhath festival as soon as possible following consultation with health experts.Public Chhath Puja celebrations were prohibited last year too .The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was protesting against restrictions on Chhath Puja celebrations and organised several protests in the last three weeks.Reacting to the DDMA decision, Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta tweeted (in Hindi), “The struggle by BJP4Delhi has succeeded. DDMA and Delhi lieutenant governor has allowed Chhath Puja celebrations. Congratulations and best wishes to all Delhi residents, especially the Puvanchalis.”In the last decade, Chhath has become one of the major festivals in Delhi with the Purvanchalis -- people belonging to areas known as the Purvanchal -- accounting for over one-third of Delhi’s population of around 20 million, according to government estimates and migration data from Census 2011.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ddma-allows-chhat-puja-at-designated-places-with-strict-protocols-101635327757113.html
28-10-2021||Chandigarh||Will form a new party, EC to clear name and symbol, says Captain||Former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Wednesday confirmed that he is forming a new political party in the run-up to the assembly elections early next year, as first reported by Hindustan Times on October 2.“Yes, I am forming a party. My lawyers are working on it. I can tell you the name once the Election Commission approves it. We have made a request for the symbol also,” Singh said at a press conference in Chandigarh that was telecast live on his social media handle.The announcement comes a little over a month since the two-time chief minister stepped down on September 18, after being pushed into a corner by the Congress party’s leadership which first appointed cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Sidhu as president of the state unit of the party against Singh’s wishes, and then summoned a meeting of legislators to remove Singh as chief minister.The party chose Charanjit Singh Channi as its chief minister; elections in the state are due early next year.“We will explore seat adjustment with the Bharatiya Janata Party and breakaway factions of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) but there will be no alliance,” clarified. He also suggested that some leaders from the Congress were in touch but said “I can’t tell you the names.”Singh said he will be meeting Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday to discuss a resolution of the standoff with farmers over the three farm laws passed by the Centre. Farmers have been protesting the laws since November last year.Even as the former chief minister was speaking, Sidhu took to Twitter to reiterate the support of Punjab Congress MLAs for the current dispensation and to criticise Singh.“We, the 78 MLAs of the Congress, could never imagine, what we received was an arm-twisted, ED controlled BJP loyal chief minister of Punjab @capt_amarinder...who sold the interests of Punjab to save his skin! You were the negative force stalling justice and development of Punjab,” Sidhu tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-elections-former-cm-capt-amarinder-singh-will-launch-own-party-101635315575745.html
28-10-2021||World||Radical Islamist group TLP threatens to bring Islamabad to a standstill||Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), a radical Islamist outfit, continued to force the Imran Khan-led government to release their party chief Saad Rizvi and expel the French ambassador as ten of thousands of its supporters marched towards Islamabad.The protesters of the radical Islamist group are now in Gujranwala which is 80kms from Lahore and 220kms from Islamabad. The protests demanding the release of Rizvi also blocked Lahore’s link to Rawalpindi“Police and Rangers are deployed on the route but unlike Wednesday, the law enforcers did not stop the TLP workers on the order from the top as some government functionaries have engaged its leadership in talks,” a government official from Pakistan’s Punjab province told news agency PTI.The move shows a change of strategy as four policemen and as many TLP protesters were killed in clashes along with 400 other people injured. The death toll due to the clashes rose to 19 as 11 TLP workers and eight policemen died following the clashes between the government and the TLP a week ago.The Imran Khan-led government made it clear to the group that its demand to shut down the French embassy cannot be met. The group began demanding the ouster of the French envoy and ban on French imports after French president Emmanuel Macron earlier this year defended the freedom of expression of artists who drew caricatures of Prophet Mohammed, an act considered blasphemy across the globe. The Pakistan government released 350 jailed TLP members to appease the outfit but the group refuses to back down.The Pakistan Railways also suspended railway services for the day between Lahore and Rawalpindi and Islamabad due to the protests. The Imran Khan-led government however announced that the protesters will not be allowed to reach Islamabad, where the group plans to hold a sit-in till the government accepts its demands.The Imran Khan government continued to stress that the police, Army and the Rangers will stop the TLP from entering Islamabad. “The cabinet has decided to treat TLP as a militant organisation and it will be crushed as other such groups have been eliminated. The Pakistani state has defeated major terrorist organisations such as al-Qaeda,” Fawad Chaudhry said earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/radical-islamist-group-tlp-threatens-to-bring-islamabad-to-a-standstill-101635442732437.html
28-10-2021||World||US economy slowed to a 2% annual growth rate last quarter in face of Delta Covid-19 wave||Hampered by rising Covid-19 cases and persistent supply shortages, the US economy slowed sharply to a 2% annual growth rate in the July-September period, the weakest quarterly expansion since the recovery from the pandemic recession began last year.Thursday’s report from the Commerce Department estimated that the nation’s gross domestic product — its total output of goods and services — declined from robust growth rates of 6.7% in the second quarter and 6.3% in the first quarter, gains that had been fueled by vast infusions of federal rescue aid.The 2% annual growth last quarter fell below expectations and would have been even weaker if not for an increase in restocking by businesses, which added whatever supplies they could obtain. Such inventory rebuilding added 2.1 percentage points to the quarter's modest expansion.By contrast, consumer spending, which fuels about 70% of overall economic activity, slowed to an annual growth rate of just 1.6% after having surged at a 12% rate in the previous quarter.Economists remain hopeful for a bounce-back in the current October-December period, with confirmed Covid cases declining, vaccination rates rising and more Americans venturing out to spend money. Many economists think GDP will rebound at a solid annual growth rate of at least 4% this quarter.“The key story right now is the improving health situation," said Gregory Daco, chief US economist at Oxford Economics. “People are feeling a lot more at ease about moving about.”Airlines have reported growing passenger traffic, businesses are investing more and wages are increasing as employers struggle to draw more people back into the job market. A resurgence of consumer spending could help energize the economy as the year nears a close.At the same time, though, rising prices, especially for gasoline, food, rent and other staples, are imposing a burden on American consumers and eroding the benefits of higher wages. Inflation has emerged as a threat to the economic recovery and a key concern for the Federal Reserve as it prepares to start withdrawing the emergency aid it provided to the economy after the recession struck last year.Thursday’s report from the government, the first of three estimates of last quarter’s GDP, showed widespread weakness. In consumer spending, purchases of durable goods, like autos and appliances, fell at a sizable 26.2% rate. Sales of clothing and other nondurable goods slowed to a modest annual gain of 2.6%. And purchases of services rose at a 7.9% rate, down from an 11.5% annual rise in the previous quarter.Businesses, too, held back. Corporate investment in equipment and plants slowed to a 1.8% rate of growth, after a 9.2% annual increase in the April-June quarter. Residential construction declined at a 7.7% rate after an even sharper 11.7% drop in the previous quarter.Last quarter, exports declined at a 2.5% annual rate while imports rose at a 6.1% rate — a surge that has contributed to clogged ports. The gap between exports and imports subtracted 1.1 percentage points from last quarter's annual growth.Opinion polls have shown that the public is growing increasingly concerned about inflation, a trend that has contributed to a decline in President Joe Biden’s approval ratings. Some economists, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell, have attributed higher inflation mainly to temporary factors, notably bottlenecked supply chains resulting from the speed of the economic recovery. Others say they worry that inflation pressures will prove more chronic.The inflation data tied to Thursday's GDP report showed consumer price increases at a still elevated 4.5% annual rate last quarter but down from 6.1% in the second quarter.Republicans have zeroed in on higher inflation this year to support their charges that Biden's economic policies aren't working.Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the top Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, called the new GDP report “awful” and “more proof that President Biden is bungling the recovery.”Biden and his Democratic allies have been trying to push through Congress two major spending bills — one to upgrade the nation’s infrastructure, the other a social safety net bill that involves climate change, health insurance and child tax credits, among other items. On Thursday, the White House unveiled a $1.75 trillion social safety net proposal, scaled down significantly from an initial $3.5 trillion plan that ran into resistance from Republicans and two key Democratic senators.The government’s estimate Thursday of GDP growth last quarter was even lower than economists’ forecasts for a significant slowdown. The effects of the delta variant, in keeping some people away from restaurants, retail shops and entertainment venues, was a key drag on growth.In September, America’s employers added just 194,000 jobs, a second straight sluggish monthly gain and evidence that the pandemic was keeping its grip on the economy, with many companies struggling to fill millions of open jobs.“The delta wave of the pandemic did a lot of damage — it caused consumer to turn more cautious,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “The virus surge scrambled global supply chains and disrupted production in a lot of industries and also created havoc in the job market.”But in recent weeks, viral cases have steadily fallen, and many economists say they think the economy is accelerating again. Zandi is predicting 6% annual growth for the current fourth quarter, and some economists foresee an even stronger rebound, depending on whether viral cases continue to fade and supply shortages begin to ease.For 2021 as a whole, economists generally expect growth to amount to around 5.5%. That would be the highest calendar-year expansion since the mid-1980s and a sharp improvement from the 3.4% plunge in GDP in the recession year of 2020. It would also easily exceed the sub-3% annual economic growth rates that prevailed in the years before the pandemic recession.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-economy-slowed-to-a-2-annual-growth-rate-last-quarter-in-face-of-delta-covid-19-wave-101635440627806.html
28-10-2021||World||India-China standoff: ‘New law will not alter China’s position on border issues’||China’s new land border law will not impact existing boundary treaties or change the country’s position on border-related questions, Chinese foreign ministry said on Thursday.A ministry spokesperson added, without naming India, that countries should avoid speculating about a Chinese domestic law.Beijing’s response comes a day after New Delhi expressed concerns about the legislation.China’s parliament, the National People’s Congress (NPC), passed the law last Saturday specifying how the military and local authorities will govern and guard the country’s 22,000km of land border shared with 14 countries including India. The new law, which will be implemented from January 1, has been promulgated amid a protracted military standoff between India and China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the de facto border, in eastern Ladakh.The law, which says China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are “sacred and inviolable”, merges military defence of China’s land borders with improving social and economic development in border areas.When specifically asked about India’s concerns on Thursday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin said: “We hope relevant countries can avoid making undue speculation about the normal legislation in China. This law has clear stipulations on China’s cooperation with its neighbouring countries and the handling of the land border issues. It will not affect China’s implementation of existing border treaties nor will it change existing practice in our cooperation with neighbouring countries.On Monday, India’s external affairs ministry had put out a statement voicing its concerns about the legislation. “China’s unilateral decision to bring about a legislation which can have implications on our existing bilateral arrangements on border management as well as on the boundary question is of concern to us,” the ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi had said.The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, however, said it will not change China’s position on border issues.“It (the new law) does not mean that there is a change in our position on the border development issue,” Wang said in his response to a question on the implication of the law.Explaining the law, Wang said the law identifies the leading mechanism and duties of the departments of military and localities in implementing the law. “It sets the rules for the demarcation procedures and also covers the areas of defence and management of borders as far as international cooperation (is concerned),” he said.“China has 22,000km of land borders. It has 14 land neighbours. The promulgation of the law is to coordinate and have unified standards for strengthening border management and advance relevant cooperation,” Wang said.“This is an important measure in advancing the rule of law. It is a normal domestic legislation that serves our realistic needs and also conforms to international practice,” he said. “This law has clear stipulations on China’s cooperation with its neighbouring countries and the handling of the land border issues.”Wang only made a passing reference to the Chinese military’s role in border management but the new law strengthens a People’s Liberation Army (PLA) policy to work closely with civilians staying in border areas.“Under the leadership of the Central Military Commission, relevant military organs shall organise, guide and coordinate the defence and control of land borders, maintain social stability, handle emergencies and cooperate in border defence and other related work,” Article 7 of the law says.India and China have been locked in a border row for 17 months, a standoff which has seen a deadly skirmish in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on June 15, 2020, when troops from both sides fought each other hand-to-hand and with rods and stones for hours.Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in the clash, the first fatalities on the LAC since 1975; four Chinese soldiers were also killed and one injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indiachina-standoff-new-law-will-not-alter-china-s-position-on-border-issues-101635420046353.html
28-10-2021||World||UK lawmakers to grill Facebook, Google, Twitter, and TikTok over online safety||British lawmakers are set to grill Facebook and other tech giants Thursday over how they handle online safety as European efforts to regulate social media companies gain momentum.Representatives from Facebook, Google, Twitter, and TikTok will be questioned by members of a parliamentary committee scrutinising the British government's draft online safety legislation.Governments on both sides of the Atlantic want tougher rules aimed at protecting social media users, especially younger ones, but the United Kingdom's efforts are much further along. UK lawmakers are questioning researchers, journalists, tech executives, and other experts for a report to the government on how to improve the final version of the online safety bill.The hearing comes the same week YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat were questioned by a US Senate panel. They provided little firm commitment for US legislation bolstering protection of children from online harm, which lawmakers say ranges from eating disorders, sexually explicit content, and material promoting addictive drugs.Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen appeared before the UK committee this week, telling members that the company’s systems make online hate worse and that it has little incentive to fix the problem. She said time is running out to regulate social media companies that use artificial intelligence systems to determine what content people see.Haugen was a Facebook data scientist who copied internal research documents and turned them over to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. They also were provided to a group of media outlets, including The Associated Press, which reported numerous stories about how Facebook prioritized profits over safety and hid its own research from investors and the public.The UK's online safety bill calls for a regulator to ensure tech companies comply with rules requiring them to remove dangerous or harmful content or face penalties worth up to 10% of annual global revenue. The European Union is working on similar digital rules.British lawmakers are still grappling with thorny issues such as ensuring privacy and free speech and defining legal but harmful content, including online bullying and advocacy of self-harm.They're also trying to get a handle on misinformation that flourishes on social media.Maria Ressa, a Filipino journalist who shared this year’s Nobel Peace Prize for her fight for freedom of expression under grave risks, acknowledged the challenge, telling the committee on Wednesday that a law to curb disinformation is needed.“Regulation is our last hope, Ressa said. “The problem is that you will be a model for everyone else around the world, so you must be a gold standard, that’s tough." At the same time, “doing nothing pushes the world closer to fascism," she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-lawmakers-to-grill-facebook-google-twitter-and-tiktok-over-online-safety-101635408738206.html
28-10-2021||World||Fluvoxamine may reduce risk of hospitalisation due to Covid-19 by 30%: Study||Fluvoxamine, a drug which is used to treat mental health conditions such as depression and obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD), may reduce by up to 30 per cent, hospitalisation in high-risk cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), according to a study published in The Lancet Global Health journal. The research, which arrived at the said conclusion, was conducted between January 15 and August 6 this year.For this exercise, researchers used fluvoxamine to treat 739 patients of Covid-19 from Brazil, while another 733 patients received a placebo (during clinical trials, one group of volunteers receives the drug that is being tested, while the other receives a fake drug, or placebo, which they think is real. This is done to compare the effect of the drug with that of the placebo). Further, every patient who was administered fluvoxamine was tracked for 28 days to check on their health, and to see if they still needed hospitalisation.The study found that in case of fluvoxamine, the number of hospital admissions came down by about 30 per cent as compared to the corresponding figures for the placebo. Also, among patients taking all their drugs, the reduction in hospitalisation was recorded at nearly 65 per cent.Speaking on the research, its co-author Angela Reiersen, an associate professor at the Washington University said, “Fluvoxamine may reduce the production of inflammatory molecules known as cytokines, that can be triggered by SARS-CoV-2, the Covid-19 causing virus.” Reiersen, however, also acknowledged some limitations in the study, including the drug’s absence, despite its wide availability, from the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Essential Medicines List.Fluvoxamine, due to its anti-inflammatory properties, was selected for this exercise. During the early days of the pandemic, it was identified for its potential to reduce the cytokine storm among coronavirus patients. Cytokine storms, which are severe immune responses to Covid-19, can cause lethal damage to organs.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fluvoxamine-may-reduce-risk-of-hospitalisation-due-to-covid-19-by-30-study-101635406168836.html
28-10-2021||World||Those detained being systematically tortured in Myanmar: Report||The soldiers in rural Myanmar twisted the young man’s skin with pliers and kicked him in the chest until he couldn’t breathe. Then they taunted him about his family until his heart ached, too: “Your mom,” they jeered, “cannot save you anymore.”The young man and his friend, randomly arrested as they rode their bikes home, had been subjected to hours of agony inside a town hall transformed by the military into a torture center.“I’m going to die,” the young man told himself, stars exploding before his eyes. “I love you, mom.’”Since its takeover of the government in February, the Myanmar military has been torturing those it has detained in a methodical and systemic way across the country, The Associated Press has found in interviews with 28 people imprisoned and released in recent months. Based also on photographic evidence, sketches and letters, along with testimony from two military captains and an aide to a high-ranking commander, the AP investigation provides the most comprehensive look since the takeover into a secretive detention system that has held more than 9,000 people.While most of the torture has occurred inside military compounds, the military, known as the Tatmadaw, has also transformed public facilities such as community halls into interrogation centers, prisoners said. The AP identified a dozen interrogation centers in use across Myanmar, in addition to prisons and police lockups.The prisoners interviewed came from every corner of the country, and ranged from a 16-year-old girl to monks. Some were detained for protesting against the military, others for no discernible reason. Multiple military units and police were involved in the interrogations, their methods of torture similar across Myanmar.The Myanmar military has a long history of torture, particularly before the country began transitioning toward democracy in 2010. While torture in recent years was most often recorded in ethnic regions, its use has now returned across the country, AP’s investigation found. The vast majority of torture techniques described by prisoners were similar to those of the past, including electric shocks, near-drownings and relentless beatings.But this time, the torture is the worst it’s ever been in scale and severity, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which monitors deaths and arrests. Since February, the group says, security forces have killed more than 1,200 people, including at least 131 detainees tortured to death.“The military tortures detainees, first for revenge, then for information,” says Ko Bo Kyi, AAPP’s joint secretary and a former political prisoner. “I think in many ways the military has become even more brutal.”The military has also taken steps to hide evidence that it has tortured prisoners, with several prisoners saying interrogators brutalized only the parts of their bodies that could be hidden by clothes. An aide to the highest-ranking army official in western Myanmar’s Chin state told the AP that soldiers covered up the deaths of two tortured prisoners, forcing a military doctor to falsify their autopsy reports.A former army captain who defected from the Tatmadaw in April confirmed to the AP that the military’s use of torture against detainees has been rampant since its takeover.“In our country, after being arrested unfairly, there is torture, violence and sexual assaults happening constantly,” says Lin Htet Aung, the former captain.After receiving detailed requests for comment, military officials responded with a one-line email that said: “We have no plans to answer these nonsense questions.”All but six of the prisoners interviewed by the AP were subjected to abuse, including women and children. Most of those who weren’t abused said their fellow detainees were.The AP also sent photographs of several torture victims’ injuries to a forensic pathologist with Physicians for Human Rights. The pathologist concluded wounds on three victims were consistent with beatings by sticks or rods.“You look at some of those injuries where they’re just black and blue from one end to the other,” says forensic pathologist Dr. Lindsey Thomas. “This was not just a swat. This has the appearance of something that was very systematic and forceful.”Photographs taken inside several detention and interrogation facilities confirmed prisoners’ accounts of overcrowded, filthy conditions. Most inmates slept on concrete floors, packed like sardines.Some became sick from drinking dirty water only available from a shared toilet. Cockroaches swarmed their bodies at night. There was little to no medical treatment.Not even the young have been spared. One woman was imprisoned alongside a 2-year-old baby.The interrogation centers were worse than the prisons, with nights a cacophony of weeping and wails of agony.“It was terrifying, my room,” one man recalls. “There were blood stains and scratches on the wall.”Back inside the rural town hall, the young man and his friend survived the night amid a haze of pain. When dawn came, the interrogators sent them to prison.Their small cell was home to 33 people. They lay next to the lone squat toilet.Their fellow inmates shared water and biscuits, though the young man’s mouth was too torn apart to eat.After two days, the families of the young man and his friend paid officials to get them out of prison. Both men were forced to sign statements saying they had participated in a demonstration and were anti-police.For two months, his entire body ached. Even today, his right shoulder — stomped on by a soldier — won’t move properly.“After they caught us, I know their hearts and their minds were not like the people’s, not like us,” he says. “They are monsters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/those-detained-being-systematically-tortured-in-myanmar-report-101635400629828.html

Guterres urged countries to speak with one voice."We can only achieve more stability with a united approach. Together, let us act with determination - and without delay - to help the people of Afghanistan and to secure a better future for all."The UN chief outlined four areas for action, which he said are of regional and international concern, starting with humanitarian relief. He reported that the UN is undertaking a "massive" humanitarian operation in the country, despite enormous obstacles."We have been acting with the cooperation of the Taliban, who have progressively granted access to the areas requested and provided security when needed," he said.Moreover, Guterres thanked neighbouring nations for their assistance with moving aid workers and supplies. He also highlighted the need for continued collaboration on the issue of refugees, saying "international support to hosting countries must match the scale of needs."The UN chief stressed the need to work together to revive the Afghan economy which is on the brink of collapse. "Injecting liquidity into the Afghan economy can be done without violating international laws or compromising principles," he said.Afghanistan's people also need an inclusive and representative government, he added, one which respects international humanitarian law and upholds human rights and fundamental freedoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/act-with-determination-un-chief-calls-for-unity-to-revive-afghanistan-101635391739800.html
28-10-2021||World||‘Europe had most number of Covid cases, deaths last week’: WHO expresses concern||The World Health Organization (WHO) has expressed concerns over the worsening coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic situation in Europe. On Wednesday, the UN health body said that Europe had the maximum number of cases and deaths due to the viral disease over the last week, with a double-digit percentage surge in each.The United Nations (UN) health body also said that new infections in the European region, which stretches as far east as former Soviet republics in Central Asia, witnessed an 18% spike over the last week - a fourth consecutive weekly increase for the region.On the other hand, there was also a 14% surge in Covid-19 related deaths in Europe, the WHO said in its weekly epidemiological report, news agency the Associated Press reported.Britain, Russia, Ukraine among others worst hit by Covid-19According to the WHO’s weekly epidemiological report, the United States had the largest number of cases over the last week at 513,000, followed by Britain at 330,000 and Russia at nearly 250,000.Both Britain and Russia are seeing a surge in their daily Covid-19 cases. While Russia will go into a week-long paid holiday from October 30 till November 7 to curb the spread of Covid-19, the British government is not bringing back any restrictions at present.The WHO also pointed out that other European countries such as Ukraine, Bulgaria, Moldova and Romania among others had some of the highest Covid infection rates per 100,000 people in the previous week, the Associated Press further reported.What are the reasons for the Covid-19 surge in Europe?The WHO said on Wednesday that several factors are responsible for the increased spread of the coronavirus disease in Europe, including low vaccination rates in some countries in East Europe.Ukraine, which is a country in eastern Europe, has only inoculated seven million of its population of 41 million. Russia, on the other hand, has only 36% of its population vaccinated with one dose, according to a report by Al Jazeera last week.Meanwhile, the recent lifting of lockdown and other Covid restrictions, including travel restrictions by many countries in Europe to revive tourism, is also contributing to the surge in cases and deaths in the continent.Mike Ryan, the WHO’s emergency director, told Al-Jazeera last week that “more social gathering indoors after lifting restrictions just as winter sets in is driving a rise in cases in many countries across Europe.”(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-had-most-number-of-covid-cases-deaths-last-week-who-expresses-concern-101635386771486.html

And it is very concerning," Milley told Bloomberg TV."I don't know if it's quite a Sputnik moment, but I think it's very close to that," he said."It's a very significant technological event that occurred... and it has all of our attention."The US Department of Defense had previously declined to confirm the test, first reported by the Financial Times on October 16.The newspaper said the August test launch caught Washington by surprise.The missile circled the Earth at a low altitude and a velocity of more than five times the speed of sound, although it missed its target by more than 30 kilometers (19 miles), according to the Financial Times.China denied the report, saying it was a routine test of a reusable space vehicle.Hypersonics are the new frontier in missile technology, because they fly lower and so are harder to detect than ballistic missiles, can reach targets more quickly, and are maneuverable.That makes them more dangerous, particularly if mounted with nuclear warheads.The United States, Russia, China and North Korea have all tested hypersonics and several others are developing the technology.China in 2019 unveiled a hypersonic medium-range missile, the DF-17, which can travel around 2,000 kilometres and can carry nuclear warheads.The missile mentioned in the FT story is a different one, with a longer range. It can be launched into orbit before coming back into the atmosphere to hit its target.Asked Wednesday about China's test, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby again declined to confirm it.But he said that any major advancement in China's military capabilities does "very little to help decrease tensions in the region and beyond."Such advances, he said, are "paired with a foreign and defense policy approach that uses intimidation and coercion of neighboring nations to yield to China's interests."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-hypersonic-test-like-a-sputnik-moment-top-us-general-101635384543620.html

The 76-year-old pontiff will take the name John XXIII. Cardinal Roncelli is an Italian. A peasant’s son, he was papal envoy in the Balkans and the Near East for nearly 20 years. He is a moderate and equally at ease in palaces and humble homes. He is noted for his sayings. His axiom for Government - “see everything, turn a blind eye on much of it, correct a little.” He is the author of a number of learned works. The successful ballot by the cardinals was the eleventh, on the third day of their secret conclave. The announcement was given to a widely cheering crowd outside St Peters’ basilica by Cardinal Nicola Canali. Bells of all Rome churches and Catholic church bells all over the world burst into joyful peals at the announcement. In Rome the Prime Minister immediately suspended the meeting of the Lower House of Parliament to enable the members to rush to St. Peters to see the new Pope. Exactly an hour after the first smoke signal was given, the new Pope appeared on the balcony and gave the solemn blessing: urbi et orbi (to the city and to the world).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-october-29-1958-italian-cardinal-angelo-giuseppe-roncelli-is-elected-new-pope-101635445128689.html
28-10-2021||India||India is concerned about situation in Afghanistan: Pentagon||Washington: India is concerned about the current situation in Afghanistan, a top Pentagon official has told US lawmakers here.“As I’m sure you’re aware, they (Indians) are concerned about the situation in Afghanistan. They’re concerned about the intersection between instability there and their counterterrorism concerns,” Colin H Kahl, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee during a hearing on Afghanistan, South and Central Asia Security.“They (Indians) want to work with us on those issues, sharing intelligence, cooperating where we can,” he said, adding that there is a tremendous convergence between US and Indian national interests right now “It provides a lot of opportunity for us to cooperate with India, not just on Afghanistan and counterterrorism, but on broader regional security questions, in the Indian Ocean and as it relates to the broader Indo-Pacific,” Kahl said.He was responding to a question from Senator Gary Peters.“India’s policies towards Afghanistan have been conceived largely through the lens of competition and proxy conflict with Pakistan. So it stands to reason that New Delhi should be no less concerned about the possibility that a Taliban government could benefit anti-Indian terrorist groups, especially those oriented towards Kashmir,” he said.“In view of our commitment to joint cooperation and interoperability with this critical partner, and the fact that India is the only designated major defence partner of the United States, I believe it’s important for us to understand how its view towards Afghanistan has and will evolve,” Peters said.Earlier this month, Kahl had co-chaired a US-India Defense Policy Group meeting.Responding to another question from Senator Jack Reed, Kahl said Pakistan is a challenging actor, but it does not want Afghanistan to be a safe haven for terrorist attacks or external attacks.“They continue to give us access to Pakistani airspace and we’re in conversations about keeping that airspace open and happy to talk about that more in the closed session. But for right now, counterterrorism cooperation with Pakistan is pretty good,” he said.“Our inability across multiple administrations to effectively deal with Pakistan is another example of the past being prologue. Managing the security relationship with Pakistan will remain important as we seek to successfully implement a regional counterterrorism strategy with other partners and allies,” Reed said.“That is why it is vitally important for us to reflect upon and study the entirety of the 20-year mission in Afghanistan,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-is-concerned-about-situation-in-afghanistan-pentagon-101635444889446.html
28-10-2021||India||De Kock apologises, says will take the knee in future||Much to the relief of South Africa in the midst of their T20 World Cup campaign, the storm surrounding wicketkeeper-batsman Quinton de Kock’s refusal to take a knee for the game against West Indies has been brought to an amicable end. In a statement released by Cricket South Africa (CSA) on Thursday, the 28-year-old has apologised for his actions and said that he will take the knee for the remainder of the tournament to show solidarity for the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. It means that de Kock will be available for selection for their next game against Sri Lanka on Saturday. “I would like to start by saying sorry to my teammates and the fans back home. I never ever wanted to make this an issue (about myself). I understand the importance of standing against racism, and I also understand the responsibility of us as players to set an example. If I taking a knee helps to educate others and makes the lives of others better, I am more than happy to do so,” de Kock said. The South African players and team management were locked in discussions with CSA’s top officials on Wednesday night. At the end of it, there was consensus that all the players will take the knee in unison from hereon. The controversy had erupted hours before South Africa’s game against West Indies on Tuesday after CSA issued a sudden directive that all the players must take the knee before every match. De Kock did not wish to comply and chose to pull out of the clash against the defending champions, which the Proteas eventually won by eight wickets. De Kock’s refusal was met with criticism from many quarters, especially considering the racial history of the rainbow nation and recent revelations that discrimination and name-calling on the basis of skin colour continued within the South African team well after the end of Apartheid. De Kock – who is a senior figure in the current set-up with 53 Tests, 124 ODIs and 58 T20Is under his belt — insisted that he was not a racist, going on to explain the background of the family that he comes from. “I was quiet on this very important issue until now. But I feel I have to explain myself a little bit. For those who don’t know, I come from a mixed-race family. My half-sisters are coloured and my step mom is black. For me, black lives have mattered since I was born. Not just because there was an international movement. I am not a racist. In my heart of hearts, I know that. And I think those who know me know that,” he maintained. De Kock made it clear that his displeasure was with the timing of CSA’s diktat and the need for all players to do as told when the message previously was that each individual could do as they wanted. “I felt like my rights were taken away when I was told what we had to do. We were previously told we had the choice to do what we felt we wanted to do. I won’t lie. I was shocked that we were told on the way to an important match that there was an instruction that we had to follow. I think it would have been better for everyone concerned if we had sorted this out before the tournament started. There always seems to be a drama when we go to World Cups. That isn’t fair.” De Kock’s rationale will remain open for vigorous debate. If he has a problem with symbolic gestures, after all, he has never objected to playing the ‘Pink ODI’ — an annual fixture in South Africa’s home season — to raise awareness about breast cancer. After scoring a century against West Indies in June this year, he raised his bat and showed the sticker of an organisation that is working for the cause of rhino conservation in South Africa. “I didn’t understand why I had to prove it with a gesture....” de Kock wrote in his statement/ “When you are told what to do, with no discussion, I felt like it takes away the meaning. If I was racist, I could easily have taken the knee and lied, which is wrong and doesn’t build a better society.” South Africa’s first black captain, Temba Bavuma, had in fact defended de Kock’s personal choice in a long press-conference after the West Indies match which centred almost entirely around the de Kock controversy. The wicketkeeper acknowledged that support in his statement.“I just want to thank my teammates for their support, especially my captain, Temba. People might not recognise, but he is a flipping amazing leader,” he said. “If he and the team, and South Africa, will have me, I would love nothing more than to play cricket for my country again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/de-kock-apologises-says-will-take-the-knee-in-future-101635444650927.html

He turned 2-room flat into bungalow||BHUBANESWAR: An Odisha police constable in state capital Bhubaneswar who was arrested and dismissed from service on Sunday converted his modest government two-room flat into a lavish bungalow by unauthorised construction of 8 new rooms, vigilance department officials said on Thursday.Vigilance department officials who conducted Thursday’s raids at multiple locations linked to dismissed police constable Prasanna Behera said they were surprised to find how the former policeman upgraded his modest two-room government accommodation at Kalpana square in Bhubaneswar by constructing 8 more rooms including 3 bedrooms and 5 other rooms including separate drawing and dining rooms, kitchen, puja room and bathrooms.Behera, who was also president of Odisha’s Havildar and Constable Association, was arrested last week for running a bar on the outskirts of Bhubaneswar without a valid licence. It also transpired that he already had eight department proceedings and five criminal cases pending against him. The justice MN Patnaik commission of inquiry that probed into a hooch tragedy that led to 21 deaths in Khurda district back in 2001 had also castigated Behera over his links with liquor mafia.This time, the state government, in view of the evidence available against him, went ahead last week to sack him under Article 311 of the Constitution, a provision that implies he will not be entitled to get pension.A vigilance department official who raided his premises on Thursday said Behera was unlikely to miss the pension.The official said they discovered Behera has a 18,000 square feet furniture showroom in the city worth over ₹4 crore, a plot of land worth ₹45 lakh in Khordha, a flat in the name of his wife worth ₹24 lakh in Sundarpada, Bhubaneswar, insurance deposits over ₹50 lakh apart from some other movable assets such as four-wheelers and two-wheelers.HT reached out to the police constable’s family for his version on the vigilance team’s allegations but his father, Hemant Behera, declined to comment on the raids.Vigilance officials have located 21 bank accounts linked to the constable but are yet to put a number on his deposits.“The vigilance technical wing has also been deputed to carry out valuation of buildings while the finance wing and forest wing personnel along with professional furniture manufacturers have been roped in for valuation of costly furniture items in his showroom,” said an official of the department.Police officials said Behera made his money throwing his weight around as president of constable and havildar association to get better business deals.Behera was first suspended and then arrested for allegedly running a bar at Hotel South City in Patrapada area of the city after Manish Anurag, son of senior journalist Navin Das was allegedly murdered in the hotel on October 9. Manish Anurag was allegedly murdered by his friends, following an altercation with them over payment of a bill at the bar. The next day, his body was found floating in a village pond in the locality.During investigation of the murder case, police found that the license of the bar had expired. Besides, the bar had violated Covid-19 guidelines of the state government by functioning during night curfew in the city. As investigators dug deeper, it turned out that the hotel was owned by a police constable. The vigilance team was later brought into the picture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-constable-s-richness-stuns-raiding-team-he-turned-2-room-into-a-bungalow-101635444348678.html
28-10-2021||India||Equities tumble on RBI move to drain liquidity||Indian shares lost nearly 2% on Thursday in the biggest one-day fall since 30 April amid concerns over the recent Reserve Bank of India (RBI) move to drain cash from the banking system and a downgrade of Indian equities by Morgan Stanley.The Sensex lost 1,158.63 points, or 1.89%, to 59,984.70 while the Nifty fell 1.94% to close at 17,857.25. Both indices saw their biggest drop since 30 April. In intraday trading, the benchmark Sensex plunged as much as 2.23% while the Nifty shed 2.26%.Most Asian markets, too, fell on Thursday amid concerns that the recovery from the covid pandemic will slow as elevated inflation forces tighter monetary policy. Japan’s Nikkei lost 1%, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong declined 0.3%. The expiry of monthly derivative contracts on Thursday exacerbated the losses.RBI on Wednesday said it will conduct seven-day and 28-day variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) auctions worth ₹1.5 trillion and ₹50,000 crore, respectively, on 2 November. The deployment of longer-term operations of 28 days will be the first since RBI governor Shaktikanta Das flagged the move in the 8 October policy.“This increase reinforces the central bank’s discomfort with excess liquidity and shift in strategy to address the surfeit in a more durable basis through longer-tenor VRRR auctions,” said Radhika Rao, an economist at DBS Bank.“This increase marks another incremental step towards an eventual hike in the reverse repo rate, which we suspect will happen in two tranches, and start as early as the December meeting.”The move highlights the RBI’s worries over excess cash in banks, which stands at more than ₹7.5 trillion and may increase inflation. The longer-term reverse repo may also be aimed at managing a potential gush of liquidity on account of a slate of initial share sales in the coming weeks.Nykaa owner FSN E-Commerce Ventures aims to raise ₹ 5,320 crore, while Paytm plans to raise ₹18,300 crore via their initial share sale early next month.Investors also appeared anxious after Morgan Stanley and Nomura downgraded India, citing expensive valuations.Morgan Stanley downgraded Indian stocks to equal weight.“The fundamental leading indicators are positive; we see valuations as increasingly constraining returns over the next 3-6 months, particularly as we head towards Fed tapering, absorbing the impact of higher energy costs and our expectations of a first RBI hike for the cycle in February 2022,” a Morgan Stanley report said.“Notwithstanding the already sharply upgraded consensus earnings through 2021, India’s 12-month forward P/E ratio has moved to an all-time high of 24.1x. As a result, India is the most expensive market in our model on EM-relative 5-year trailing Z-score of P/B and P/E. We believe this might see the index take a breather from here and look for some consolidation, with our India strategy team preferring consumer discretionary and financials while avoiding technology and healthcare,” it added.On 25 October, Nomura downgraded Indian markets to neutral from overweight, citing unfavourable risk-reward given high valuations, as several positives appeared to be priced in even as headwinds are emerging.Instead, the Japanese brokerage firm prefers China and Asean and will be looking for better entry points for India.On 20 October, UBS said that it has an underweight rating on India, calling it “extremely expensive”.Strategists at UBS find Indian equities to be the least attractive as valuations are rising with fading earnings momentum while there is less scope for an economic rebound this year.“This fall in the index has derailed the recent recovery, and we may see a further slide in the following sessions. We reiterate our cautious view on markets and suggest restricting leveraged positions,” said Ajit Mishra, vice-president of research at Religare Broking.Foreign institutional investors have sold Indian equities worth $1.47 billion in the last five sessions. Cumulatively, so far this month, FIIs are net sellers of equities worth $970.82 million.Bloomberg contributed this story.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/equitiestumbleonrbi-movetodrainliquidity-101635444107273.html

Reports said before this book he was reading The Lion's Gate.During his stay in the jail, Aryan Khan was not given any VIP treatment and was treated like any other prisoner, reports said. Shah Rukh Khan was allowed to visit Aryan Khan in person on October 14, when the prison authorities started allowing physical visits of family members of the prisoners. Before that, Aryan Khan was allowed a video call with his parents from the jail premises and a money order to buy food from the jail canteen.Aryan Khan's conduct has been well inside the jail, it has been reported. During a counselling session, Aryan reportedly told Sameer Wankhede that he will work for social and financial upliftment of the poor and the downtrodden and will never do anything that will bring him "publicity for the wrong reasons".

On September 6, the federal agency had questioned West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee in connection with the same case for around nine hours. Ghatak, however, refused to speak to the media after coming out of the ED’s office at Jamnagar House in Delhi late on Thursday night. Ghatak had skipped multiple summons by the agency in the last two months. It has been alleged that illegally mined coal worth crores have been sold in the black market over several years by a racket operating in the western parts of Bengal where the Eastern Coalfields Limited runs several mines. The ED had initiated a parallel investigation after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) launched a probe in the coal smuggling case last year. Abhishek Banerjee’s wife Rujira also came under the scanner of the central agency. Both, however, had moved the Delhi high court challenging summons issued to them. Previously, the ED asked Abhishek Banerjee to appear before it on September 6, while Rujira on September 1. Rujira had expressed her inability to appear before the ED on September 1 by citing the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and requested the agency officials to visit her residence in Kolkata. The Delhi high court had exempted the Trinamool Congress MP’s wife from personal appearance before a trial court, scheduled on October 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-law-minister-questioned-by-ed-for-9-hours-in-coal-smuggling-case-101635443147733.html

He also said that no farmer would have to die by suicide if his party was voted to power.Blaming the state government, he said, “Punjab has all required infrastructure to develop agri-based industry but due to ill-intentions of the present or past government, these could not deliver,” news agency PTI reported.Kejriwal assured that his government would not only provide compensation to farmers who were affected by natural causes but also enhance it in proportion to the production cost. Also read | Punjab polls: Kejriwal on two-day visit to meet AAP leaders, farmers, tradersHe also vowed to pay the compensation for crop failure by April 30, if his party wins the assembly election. “By April 30, crop loss compensation will be credited to the account of each affected farmer and labourer,” he said during an interaction with the farmers in the Mansa district in Punjab.As part of his announcements, Kejriwal also said that he would unveil a “special plan” next month, on which his party is currently working on, for the development of agriculture in the state.“Stubble would be used for power, cardboard and agro-based industries and DAP fertiliser factories, which would also provide employment to the youth of Punjab.

28-10-2021||India||Why is Aryan Khan granted bail today? What will be bail conditions? | 10 points||Aryan Khan was granted bail on Thursday by the Bombay high court after the court completed hearing both the parties for the last three days. For Aryan, there were former AG Mukul Rohatgi, Amit Desai, Satish Maneshinde, Karanjawala & Co's Ruby Singh and Sandeep Kapur, while for the NCB, there were Anil Singh, Advait Sethna and Shreeram. Apart from Aryan Khan, Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha were also granted bail in the connection of the drugs-on-cruise case.Here are 10 points regarding Aryan Khan's bail.1. The high court has not yet issued the complete order with the reasons for granting the bail. Once the order is out, it will be clear what grounds the court considered to grant the three bail.2. Earlier, Aryan Khan's bail pleas were rejected as the NCB contested that the accused belong to influential families and they can tamper with evidence. This can be a likely bail condition for all three.Aryan Khan gets bail in drugs case after 3 weeks, to be back home by this week3. Apart from a fine, the bail conditions may bar all three to travel abroad, as they will have to cooperate with the ongoing investigation.4. These are, however, not the first bail in the high-profile drugs case. Manish Rajgaria and Avin Sahu were granted bail in the same case by a special NDPS court.5. They were granted bail as the NCB "failed" to produce on record any evidence to show that they were connected with any drugs network.6. The case against Aryan Khan was made stronger by the NCB as it connected Aryan Khan with the 6 gram charas found from Arbaaz merchant. The NCB contests that Aryan Khan was in "conscious possession" of drugs, though he himself was not carrying any drugs. The NCB claimed Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant are old friends. The charas that Arbaaz Merchant was carrying was for their personal consumption.7. The NCB presented drugs-related old WhatsApp chats of Aryan Khan in front of the court, while Aryan Khan's lawyers argued that WhatsApp chats can't be admitted as evidence.8. Aryan Khan spent over 20 days in Arthur Road jail, while it has been 25 days after his arrest.9. Aryan Khan and 2 others will finally walk out of the jail once the jail receives the bail order and all the procedures are complete.10. Reports said Aryan Khan was informed about his bail by the jail staff as he was not present in the court on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-is-aryan-khan-granted-bail-today-what-will-be-bail-conditions-10-points-101635440664311.html

The department was aimed at implementing welfare schemes for upper caste poor people.The Cabinet decided to create 4,035 new posts in the medical and health department, including 560 pharmacist posts in YSR Urban clinics and 2190 additional posts including teaching faculty, staff nurses and paramedical staff. “The state government has proposed to fill up 41,000 vacancies in the Medical Health department. So far, 26,917 posts have been filled in the last two and half years, and the remaining posts will be filled soon,” the minister said.The Cabinet has also approved the move to amend the Cinematography Act, 1965 and allow an online ticketing platform managed by AP State Film, Television and Theatre Development Corporation for issuing cinema tickets.Among other decisions, the Cabinet approved extension of the ban on Communist Party of India (Maoist) and other affiliated organisations for one more year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-govt-to-request-centre-to-take-up-caste-based-census-101635440747712.html

The border has remained blocked for almost a year now since farmers launched their protest in the area against three centrally passed agri laws.According to the Delhi Police, while the blockades were being removed, there was still no confirmation on when exactly the movement of vehicles may resume.A PTI report said four of the eight layers of barricades at the border have been removed. However, the cement barricades are still there and the road remains closed for commuters, a senior officer was quoted as saying.According to ANI inputs, police said plans were underway to open emergency routes at Tikri border (Delhi-Haryana) and Ghazipur border (Delhi-UP) that were blocked due to ongoing farmers' protest. “The barricades placed at the borders will be removed after getting farmers' consensus,” the Delhi Police was quoted as saying. There are plans to open emergency routes at Tikri border (Delhi-Haryana) & Ghazipur border (Delhi-UP) that are blocked due to ongoing farmers' protest.

"The entire responsibility to open roads is on the Delhi Police as the way has been blocked towards the other side," he said.Besides Tikri, Kundli, Ghazipur and Singhu are among the key borders along the national capital, besides other places, where the farmers have been staging a stir for the past 11 months.The Supreme Court had recently said the farmers had the right to protest, but cannot block roads indefinitely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-barricades-along-tikri-border-being-removed-say-reports-101635439320746.html
28-10-2021||India||India expects developed countries to do more at COP26 on funds to tackle climate change||India is expecting concrete outcomes at COP26 on developed countries providing more financing and technology for tackling climate change since the country is well on its way to meeting targets set under the Paris Accord, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said on Thursday. New Delhi is also looking towards “very concrete outcomes” at the upcoming G20 Summit in Rome in combating the Covid-19 pandemic and similar challenges in future, Shringla told a news briefing ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s participation in the G20 Summit and COP26 in Glasgow. In a departure statement ahead of his visit to Italy and the UK, Modi said India is taking “ambitious action” on expanding clean and renewable energy and “creating new records in collective effort for climate adaptation, mitigation and resilience”. Modi said he would highlight the need to “comprehensively address climate change issues, including equitable distribution of carbon space, support for mitigation and adaptation and resilience building measures, mobilisation of finance, technology transfer and importance of sustainable lifestyles” at COP 26. He also said he would join other leaders of the world’s largest economies at the G20 Summit in Rome to discuss global economic and health recovery from the pandemic, sustainable development, and climate change. The summit will allow the leaders to exchange ideas on how G20 can be an engine for “strengthening economic resilience and building back inclusively” from the pandemic, he added. India has been pushing developed countries to share more finances and technology to cope with climate change. On the other hand, the developed countries want India to frame updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) or targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Shringla told a news briefing ahead of Modi’s departure for the G20 Summit and COP26 that India has been “one of the best performers” in G20 as far as meeting the commitments of COP26 is concerned. “We are well on our way to meeting our NDC commitments and even doing better than that,” he said. In addition to commitments under the Paris Accord, India has made unilateral announcements that set much higher benchmarks. With developed countries announcing this week that they will miss by three years their promise of $100 billion a year as funding to developing countries to manage the climate crisis, Shringla said India wants clearly defined commitments in this regard. “The problem is that we would like to see such commitments converted into promises. The quantum of such financing is also, in our view, inadequate. You need much more financing in order to reach the goals that have been set...to collectively meet at a global level in order to achieve the 1.5 degrees that we are talking about,” he said. The means of delivering “green financing and green technology” is key to enabling developing countries to meet their climate action commitments, he said. “This is something that...will occupy the leaders and negotiators, this is something that we expect to see some outcomes on, not only in terms of commitments and NDCs...[and] a review of those commitments in Glasgow, but also a review of the financial backstopping that is very important for developing countries and small island states and countries like ours that have [small per capita emissions]...,” he said. India’s contributions to climate change have to be recognised and supported through appropriate finance and technology from the developed world, he added. “We are going to Glasgow with a positive mindset. India has always approached the issue of climate change in a manner that is constructive...We have set targets that far exceed the NDCs within our own country,” Shringla said. Shringla also said the management of current and future pandemics and the global health architecture will be key issues at the G20 Summit n Rome. “The G20 is going to come up with very concrete outcomes on this. There is a suggestion to create mechanisms that would cater to the requirements of future health pandemics...there is some fairly intensive discussions on the sort of architecture that the G20 could create that could supplement international cooperation and collaboration in dealing with future pandemics,” he said. India has been a strong voice for reforming the multilateral system, including the global health architecture with WHO at its centre, the trading system centred round WTO and the international financial architecture to make them more responsive, inclusive and reflective of contemporary realities, he said. New Delhi is also an advocate for equitable and affordable access to Covid-19 disease control tools, including vaccines, through technology transfers, diversification of supply chains and production hubs, Shringla added. Modi will participate in the G-20 Summit in Rome during October 30-31 at the invitation of Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi. From Rome, Modi will travel to Glasgow to attend the world leader’s summit of the 26th Conference of Parties (COP-26) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change under the presidency of the UK. The prime minister will also hold several bilateral meetings in both countries. In Rome, he will meet the Pope, Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman and Indonesian President Joko Widodo. India has backed efforts to create mechanisms for pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, including mobilisation of global financing for this purpose and better coordination between stakeholders for management of common resources to deal with future pandemics. One of the key outcomes of India’s initiative to push for a G20 extraordinary summit on Covid-19 was the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) that benefited more than 45 countries by providing liquidity relief of more than $5 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-expects-developed-countries-to-do-more-at-cop26-on-funds-to-tackle-climate-change-101635437807619.html
28-10-2021||India||Mamata Banerjee lands in Goa on a 3-day outreach. 3 temple stops on her sked||PANAJI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee landed in Goa on a three-day trip, her first as chief minister, on a visit aimed at bolstering the Trinamool Congress’ profile in the state’s political landscape ahead of the state elections expected early next year. Banerjee’s visit is also aimed at signalling to the electorate that her party will make an all-out attempt to carve out space for itself in the state’s politics.Banerjee spent most of her time in Goa meeting party leaders on Thursday. Advance teams of the TMC comprising leader of the Rajya Sabha Derek O’Brien, MPs Saugata Roy, Mahua Moitra and the political consultancy group, Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC) and its founder Prashant Kishor were already in the state.On Friday, she will reach out to fishermen and civil society members at separate interactions scheduled with them. Banerjee is also slated to visit three temples: Mangueshi Temple at Priol, the Mahalsa Narayani Temple at Mardol and the Tapobhoomi Temple at Cundaim in central Goa’s Ponda, an attempt to blur some of the cultural lines that are seen to divide Goa’s political space.The Congress and like-minded parties have traditionally wielded influence in parts of Goa referred to as the old conquests -- Bardez, Tiswadi, Mormugao and Salcete talukas -- territories that were first captured by the Portuguese. Since these are coastal areas and are comparatively more densely populated, these areas, which account for a larger share of Goa’s 40 constituencies, also have a greater share of minority Catholic voters.The Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which largely expanded in Goa at the expense of the MGP, have traditionally been strong in areas known as new conquests -- these were captured by the Portuguese only in the 1700s. According to historians, these areas, unlike the old Conquistas, remained predominantly Hindu because by then the Portuguese rulers had no appetite for conversions.To be sure, the BJP’s move to induct 13 Congressmen over the course of the last four and a half years has disturbed some of these patterns and people in constituencies traditionally represented by the Congress are split between the sitting MLA who has joined the BJP, the Congress who identified replacements of their MLAs who switched sides, and the Aam Aadmi Party which has so far been largely restricted to minority-dominated areas.With the Trinamool Congress mostly recruiting leaders from the Congress, the TMC’s strength appears to lie in areas that were traditionally Congress bastions. However, the party has also brought on board former members of the MGP and secured the support of an independent MLA from BJP and MGP strongholds in an effort to indicate that it intended to get support from both sides of the traditional political divide.It is in this context that Banerjee and her team has more than once over the last few days underlined that the Congress did not respond to its overtures to defeat the BJP.It is not clear how the TMC aggressive moves in Goa will impact the Congress performance. Banerjee’s visit will overlap with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s trip who is expected to reach the coastal state on Saturday.TMC leaders, who launched the party campaign with a sharp attack on the Pramod Sawant government this week, said the BJP was rattled about Banerjee’s visit.“Why hasn’t the BJP responded to Goa TMC’s nine-point charge sheet yet? Why aren’t they giving any answers on unemployment, poor healthcare and infrastructure? Clearly, they are rattled because Goa TMC is a formidable force. This is nothing but their classic diversionary tactic ahead of Didi’s visit,” TMC leader Lavoo Mamledar said, referring to his party’s allegations that ruling Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) workers defaced billboards of Mamata Bannerjee in parts of the state.Chief minister Sawant dismissed the hype around Banerjee’s visit.“Everyone is free to contest elections from anywhere they want… Anybody can come here but that won’t affect us,” Sawant said on Banerjee’s Goa visit, according to news agency ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-lands-in-goa-on-a-3-day-outreach-3-temple-stops-on-her-sked-101635437687485.html

28-10-2021||India||Kerala begins evacuation as Tamil Nadu set to release water from Mullaperiyar dam||After Tamil Nadu announced its decision to open spillways of the Mullaperiyar dam, Kerala on Thursday evacuated 800 families living in downstream areas of the age-old dam. The TN government has informed its counterpart that it will open spillways of the dam at 7 am on Friday. Later, Idukki district collector Sheeba George announced an alert in the district and ordered shifting of people living in areas near the dam. State water resources minister Roshy Augustine said all arrangements have been made and there is no need for any panic. Hailing from the district he has called a meeting of district officials on Friday to monitor the situation. “We will shift 3,220 people belonging to 884 families. We are keeping a strict vigil. We have opened enough relief camps. This is only a precautionary measure and there is no need for any panic,” the minister said adding the TN government hasn’t announced the exact quantum of water to be released. Districts officials said once the water is released it will reach the first downstream village Vallakadavu in 20 minutes and the Idukki reservoir will be filled by noon. Initially spillways of Idukki will be opened to ease the pressure and if needed shutters of Idukki will also be opened. Sluice gates of Idukki were opened two weeks back after catchment areas received heavy downpour. Fast floods and landslides induced by heavy rainfall claimed 40 lives in two districts, Kottayam and Idukki on October 17. The two neighbouring states, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, have been fighting over the water level of the reservoir for many years. Kerala wants a new dam citing frequent tremors and changing rain patterns in the Idukki district where the old dam is situated, but Tamil Nadu opposes it fearing loss of control over the dam. After the 2014 Supreme Court verdict, Tamil Nadu carried out repairs and retrofitted, but Kerala maintained that these measures were not enough to check the dam’s durability. The dam was built under an agreement between the erstwhile royal family of Travancore and the British administration in 1886 to take water to famine-hit Tamil Nadu for irrigation. Post- independence, the dam became part of Kerala, and since then, its main share of water flows to the southern districts of Tamil Nadu. The contentious issue came up before the apex court on Monday after a resident of Idukki, Dr Joe Joseph, approached it with a plea that water level should not go above 139 feet because of heavy rainfall in the area. The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered that the dam supervisory committee’s view to maintain water level at 139.5 feet till November 10 should be met. While hearing the case, the TN counsel said Kerala was whipping up fear unnecessarily but Kerala maintained that a new dam is the final solution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-begins-evacuation-as-tamil-nadu-set-to-release-water-from-mullaperiyar-dam-101635433787213.html
28-10-2021||India||‘Pretending to be blind, deaf’: Rahul attacks BJP over Tripura violence||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday criticised the government over the alleged attacks on mosques and Muslim neighborhoods in north Tripura on Twitter. Gandhi in a tweet said that the government was ‘pretending’ that there is no problem in the northeastern state.Rahul Gandhi’s tweet comes after the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) took out a rally in north Tripura’s Dharmanagar following which a mosque was allegedly vandalised in Panisagar sub-division and houses of people belonging to the Muslim community were also vandalised earlier this week. Police imposed Section 144 of the CrPC in the area following the events. The VHP was protesting the vandalism of Durga Puja venues and temples in Bangladesh. Police officials familiar with the developments told HT that few members of the VHP were involved in acts of arson.“Our Muslim brothers are being brutalized in Tripura. Those who do hatred and violence in the name of Hindu are not Hindus, they are hypocrites. How long will the government continue to pretend to be blind and deaf?,” Rahul Gandhi said in a tweet.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday set up a five-member committee to probe into the incidents of violence. The party’s state in-charge Vinod Sonkar said that the committee contains people from minority communities.“The committee has been asked to visit the (violence-hit) areas and submit its report in the next two or three days. Since our political opponents accuse us of being biased, we asked the members of the minority cell to probe the incident,” Sonkar, a parliamentarian, told HT.The BJP, however, have blamed the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) for stoking violence for political gains. The opposition CPI(M) and TMC attacked the BJP for creating tension among communities and also accused the VHP of flaring tensions. “Few provocative programmes including one at Chamtilla in Panisagar happened, which is condemnable. I appeal to all sections of people to maintain communal unity and integrity,” leader of opposition and former chief minister Manik Sarkar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pretending-to-be-blind-deaf-rahul-attacks-bjp-over-tripura-violence-101635431959884.html

28-10-2021||India||India wants mutual recognition of vaccine documents to boost travel, economic recovery||India has taken up with G20 and partner countries the mutual recognition of Covid-19 vaccine certificates to promote both the resumption of international travel and economy recovery from the pandemic, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said on Thursday. The Indian government has been able to ease travel procedures, including recognition of vaccine certificates, with several countries, including the UK and members of the European Union (EU). Most of these measures are aimed at facilitating Indian professionals and students to return to jobs and educational courses around the world. Shringla told a news briefing that India’s proposal is based on facilitating international travel through the mutual recognition of national vaccine documents, and there was strong support for it in the emerging market economies of the G20, which brings together the world’s 20 biggest economies. “India has proposed to its partner countries, primarily countries that Indian citizens normally travel to, that we should have a mutual (mechanism) that you recognise our vaccine certification and we will mutually recognise your country’s vaccine certification,” he said. The advantage of such an approach is that India wouldn’t need to keep approaching other countries as it adds new vaccines to its stock of nationally approved vaccines. “You recognise the certification that we issue, you recognise its integrity and we will give you mutual treatment. I am happy to say that a number of countries have already agreed to that,” Shringla said. India is working with all its partner countries to have such arrangements to simplify and normalise international travel, he said. “It is an important objective [of] the G20 to not only effect recovery in terms of health but also economic recovery. So business travellers, tourists [who] contribute to the recovery of economies will be greatly benefited from this simplified international travel regime that we are proposing...,” he said. “We will continue to advocate this as a means of better and easier access to citizens travelling all over the world,” he added. Responding to a question on the process for the World Health Organization (WHO) to approve the Covaxin vaccine of Bharat Biotech, Shringla said WHO’s Technical Action Group had sought some more information from the Indian pharmaceutical firm at a meeting held on October 26. “We have information that Bharat Biotech will provide the responses soon. The approval for Covaxin should come quickly if TAG’s questions are responded to effectively. It is a technical and regulatory group,” he said. Emergency use authorisation of vaccines is decided on technical considerations and India is closely following the discussions at the global health body. “We are hopeful that Covaxin will get approval from WHO soon,” Shringla said. He reiterated India’s call for a TRIPS waiver for Covid-19 vaccines and therapeutics at the World Trade Organization (WTO). “We have advocated for technology transfer and diversification of supply chain and production hubs to ensure affordable and equitable access to Covid-19 disease control tools. I am happy to share that G20 has recognised extensive vaccination as a global public good...and I think that is where discussions in the G20 will be relevant,” he said. A proposal piloted by India and South Africa for waiver of intellectual property rights related to Covid-19 vaccines to give poorer countries access to jabs has been backed by the US administration. However, the move has been opposed by EU member states and pharmaceutical companies....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-wants-mutual-recognition-of-vaccine-documents-to-boost-travel-economic-recovery-101635431627004.html

In support of his claims, Nawab Malik has released the 'nikah nama' of Sameer Wankhede's first marriage which was done according to Islamic rituals.Wankhede and his family members refuted the allegations and said that though the nikah-nama is not fake, the claim that Sameer Wankhede is a Muslim is wrong as he never converted to Islam. The wedding was done according to Islamic rituals because of Sameer Wankhede's mother's wish, the NCB official said.Earlier in the day, Sameer Wankhede's wife Kranti Redkar Wankhede wrote to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray against the "continued attack into her family's personal life"."I grew up as a Marathi girl in view of Shiv Sena fighting for the justice of Marathi man since childhood.

28-10-2021||India||Congress ‘limiting itself to Twitter space’ instead of strengthening opposition alliance: TMC||The Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Thursday said that the Congress was “limiting itself to Twitter space” instead of strengthening the alliance of opposition parties against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The remarks were made in an editorial column in the TMC’s mouthpiece daily newspaper ‘Jago Bangla’, news agency PTI reported.“We want an alliance to be formed against the BJP. We have said this to the Congress, too. But it is least bothered and shows a lackadaisical approach,” PTI reported, citing an excerpt from the editorial.“The Congress is limited to Twitter space. The party has taken no initiative to build an opposition alliance. In 2014 and 2019, too, the Congress had done the same,” the editorial further said.Also read | BJP will remain powerful for decades, predicts poll strategist Prashant KishorThe TMC also reiterated that the party would expand its base to other states and put up a fight against the ruling BJP at the Centre. This came on the day party supremo and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee began her three-day visit to poll-bound Goa, her maiden trip to the coastal state.“As I prepare for my maiden visit to Goa on 28th, I call upon all individuals, organisations and political parties to join forces to defeat the BJP and their divisive agenda. The people of Goa have suffered enough over the last 10 years,” Banerjee tweeted earlier in the week.Referring to the Bengal chief minister’s proposal during a meeting of opposition parties on August 20 this year for a joint steering committee, the editorial said there has been no progress on that matter since then. The meeting was convened by Congress' interim president Sonia Gandhi.However, the editorial also noted the TMC would “keep the doors of alliance with the Congress open,” and said, “We have never said that an opposition alliance will be forged without the Congress. But we will not waste our time for them by sitting idle.”Lately, the two parties that have been supportive of forming an united opposition alliance have been making similar remarks about each other. Earlier on Sunday, veteran Congress leader P Chidambaram, who is also the party’s election observer for Goa, told news agency PTI in an interview that the TMC and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) would be “marginal players” and the Congress was "best positioned" to defeat the BJP in the assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-limiting-itself-to-twitter-space-instead-of-strengthening-opposition-alliance-tmc-101635426873480.html

28-10-2021||India||India, Asean agree to build on Indo-Pacific convergences to ensure free and open region||India and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) on Thursday agreed to build on convergences in their vision of the Indo-Pacific to work for a free, open, inclusive and rules-based region against the backdrop of China’s assertiveness. Leaders of the two sides welcomed the adoption of the “Asean-India joint statement on cooperation on the Asean outlook on the Indo-Pacific for peace, stability and prosperity in the region” at their virtual summit. Prime Minister Narendra Modi stressed the importance of strengthening convergences between India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI) and Asean’s outlook on Indo-Pacific to ensure freedom of navigation and overflight in line with international laws. Modi also called for an early review of the Asean-India Trade in Goods Agreement, which has been pending for long, and this was backed by the 10-member grouping. Brunei’s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, the current chair of Asean, said the review should make the pact more business-friendly to support economic recovery efforts. “This special role of Asean, India’s Act East policy which is contained in our Security and Growth for All in the Region, i.e. SAGAR policy, India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative and Asean’s outlook for the Indo-Pacific are the framework for our shared vision and mutual cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region,” Modi said in his opening remarks at the summit. Riva Ganguly Das, secretary (East) in the external affairs ministry, said the joint statement on the Indo-Pacific was “one of the very major highlights of this summit”. The statement “charts a way forward for practical implementation of the convergences in our vision of the Indo-Pacific” to ensure peace, prosperity and stability in the region, she said. Modi also asked Asean leaders to join any of the seven pillars of IPOI. Indonesia is currently a member of the marine resources pillar. The joint statement seeks to build on maritime connectivity between India and Asean states and work done by the two sides since they became summit-level partners in 2002 and strategic partners in 2012. It embraces Asean centrality, openness, transparency, a rules-based framework, respect for sovereignty, non- intervention and respect for international laws, including the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). According to the joint statement, the two sides will support Asean community building and strengthen the bilateral strategic partnership in politics, security, economic matters and development cooperation by using existing Asean-led mechanisms such as the East Asia Summit, and Asean Regional Forum. The two sides will reinforce the Asean-centred regional architecture to deal with challenges and to focus on opportunities “arising from current and future regional and global environments with a focus on the open, inclusive and rules-based regional architecture”. They will explore potential cooperation between in the four areas outlined in the Asean Outlook on the Indo-Pacific – maritime cooperation, connectivity, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and economic cooperation. In addition, the two sides will also explore possible cooperation in areas such as capacity building, scholarships and training courses, enhancing trade facilitation, social infrastructure development, enhanced capacities for response to pandemics and public health emergencies and for vaccine and pharmaceutical research, prevention and management of zoonoses, and maritime transport cooperation. While exchanging views on the Covid-19 crisis, Modi assured Asean of India’s support as exemplified by the provision of medical supplies worth $200,000 for a humanitarian initiative for Myanmar and $1 million for the Asean Covid-19 Response Fund. Hassanal Bolkiah said Asean and India should work on sustainable economic recovery by exploring new opportunities under the “Blue Economy”, including developing key industries that can generate jobs and enhance connectivity, such as fisheries and maritime transport. The two sides also highlighted the importance of greater physical and digital connectivity, and cooperation on digital inclusion to ensure a comprehensive post-pandemic recovery. In the realm of connectivity, secretary (East) Ganguly Das described the eastward expansion of the India-Myanmar-Thailand highway as n important proposal. A report on this is ready and India is waiting for the Asean response on how to proceed, she said. The situation in Myanmar following the military coup in February also figured in the India-Asean Summit and Ganguly Das said the India side remains engaged on providing humanitarian aid, including vaccines and medicines, to the neighbouring country. “As a close neighbour of Myanmar, India will continue to support restoration of peace and democratic process in Myanmar for it to emerge as a stable, democratic federal union,” she said. The two sides also declared 2022 as the India-Asean Friendship Year to mark 30 years of the partnership and decided to hold a series of events round the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-asean-agree-to-build-on-indo-pacific-convergences-to-ensure-free-and-open-region-101635426766533.html
28-10-2021||India||MP woman falsely accused 4 neighbours of gang rape, sentenced to 10 years||BHOPAL: A 46-year-old woman in Madhya Pradesh and her 29-year-old son-in-law have been sentenced to 10 years in jail for falsely accusing their four neighbours of gang rape and fabricating evidence in support of her allegation, a senior public prosecutor said on Thursday.The woman and her son-in-law were in a relationship and decided to frame their four neighbours in 2014 because she did not get along with them, additional district prosecutor Mohammad Azam of Ashok Nagar district, 150km from state capital Bhopal, said.The four neighbours, however, called her bluff during investigations into the First Information Report (FIR) registered on her statement in August 2014 when they persuaded investigators to carry out a DNA test to compare the semen sample from the woman’s clothes with that of her son-in-law, Gopal Rajak.Ashok Nagar’s first additional sessions judge Mahesh Kumar Chauhan on Wednesday sentenced the woman, Guddi Ojha and her son-in-law Gopal Rajak to serve 10 years in prison for fabricating evidence to secure a conviction and criminal conspiracy, six months jail for giving false information to a public servant.Public prosecutor Jafar Qureshi said this was a rare case where the police charged a woman for filing a false case and fabricating evidence and pursued the case to its logical conclusion. The defence lawyer was not available for comments.“In August 2014, the woman, who lost her husband in 2011, filed a complaint that she was gang-raped by four people who lived in her neighbourhood. Police arrested the accused after lodging the FIR under section 376 D. The medical report of the woman confirmed rape and her clothes and vaginal swab were taken for further investigation,” Qureshi said.The accused, however, insisted they were innocent and approached senior Ashok Nagar police officer to seek a DNA test to establish the truth.“The test report revealed that the woman was not raped by any of the four but by some other person,” the prosecutor said. At their request, the police also took samples of the son-in-law.“Gopal Rajak’s sample matched with the sperm samples collected from the woman’s clothes.” Gopal Rajak was arrested.“During interrogation, Gopal Rajak confessed that he was in a relationship with Guddi and they filed a false case to implicate their neighbours, who used to fight with Guddi and Gopal on trivial issues,” police officer VP Singh Jat, who investigated the case, said.“It was a serious case as the woman alleged that the four accused barged into her house and raped her in the night,” said the police officer, recalling how the closely-watched case in the district by politicians and activists took a stunning turn.“During investigations, we also found many witnesses who said the four accused were not present at the same place together but it was DNA test which conclusively exposed the fraud…. We are happy that we succeed in punishing the woman and the man for abusing the law,” VP Singh Jat said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-woman-falsely-accused-4-neighbours-of-gang-rape-sentenced-to-10-years-101635426415800.html

28-10-2021||India||Karnataka HC grants bail to Bineesh Kodiyeri in money-laundering case||The Karnataka High Court on Thursday granted bail to Bineesh Kodiyeri, son of senior Kerala CPI (M) leader Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on money laundering charges linked to a drug haul in Bengaluru last year. The single judge bench of Justice MG Uma granted bail to Kodiyeri under several conditions overruling objections of Additional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi who appeared for the ED. The counsel for the accused Guru Krishnakumar contended that the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) after its detailed investigation failed to find any involvement of Kodiyeri in the drug trade and his transaction with some of the accused were through banks. He also said his client was not aware of the alleged drug dealings of his business partner Mohammad Anoop. But the ED’s counsel said he amassed huge wealth and funding for this came through his business partner who was involved in a drug cartel in Bengaluru. However, the court overruled his contentions. “The bail is allowed subject to conditions,” the judge said while granting him bail. His father, CPI (M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, had to quit last year after the case surfaced and it invited enough embarrassment for the party and government. A small-time actor and cricket player, controversy was Kodiyeri’s companion but he got away due to his high connections. He was also close to many actors and businessmen. The drug case surfaced in August 2020 after the arrest of Anoop Mohammad and two others in Bengaluru and Mohammad later divulged the name of Bineesh Kodiyeri and said he was his business partner. Later the ED took over the case and Kodiyeri was arrested and charged under Section 19(1) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The ED said he pumped in unaccounted for money into the bank account of alleged drug peddler Anoop Mohammad and got hefty returns from it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-hc-grants-bail-to-bineesh-kodiyeri-in-money-laundering-case-101635424006849.html

His reaction came soon after Aryan Khan, Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha were granted bail by the Bombay high court on Thursday. पिक्चर अभी बाकी है मेरे दोस्तOn October 3, Aryan, Arbaaz and Munmun were arrested in connection with a cruise rave party. Their bail pleas have been rejected by the court as the Narcotics Control Bureau claimed that it was a case of conspiracy and they have a connection with the international drug network.Nationalist Congress Party leader Nawab Malik whose son-in-law was arrested by the NCB in a drugs-related case embarked on a mission to expose the central agency as he brought allegations of extortion and forgery against NCB Mumbai zone chief Sameer Wankhede, who is the investigating officer of the Aryan Khan case.The Maharashtra minister was the first person to bring the notice to KP Gosavi and Manish Bhanushali, the two independent witnesses used in the case of Aryan Khan. As he questioned the background of these two witnesses, the minister revealed that Sameer Wankhede had used friends and acquaintances in NCB cases in the past as well. Then he brought the allegations of extortion against Wankhede, while Gosavi's former aide Prabhakar Sail complained that Wankhede made him sign on blank papers.While Nawab Malik's tweet indicates that there is more to the drama, he reiterated that the case against Aryan Khan was a false case. "They were deliberately framed by (Sameer) Wankhede. The case can be quashed if the accused approaches the high court with evidence,” the minister said."The officer (Sameer Wankhede) who arrested them has approached the high court with a plea that the Mumbai police should not be allowed to investigate the complaints against him. Police said if we have to arrest him, then a prior notice of 72 hours will be issued in advance. Till yesterday, he was requesting the Mumbai police not to arrest him and today approached the high court. He is the same officer who requested security from the Mumbai police and now what has changed within a week he lost his faith in Mumbai police. It is a fact that he has done forgery and thus is scared of the police,” Malik added.(With inputs from Mumbai bureau)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-aryan-khan-gets-bail-nawab-malik-says-picture-abhi-baaki-hai-mere-dost-101635422882128.html

This is why we are stressing on double vaccination and other Covid-19 preventative measures,” Aaditya Thackeray said.He also said that people should not delay in getting the second jab of the vaccine. “We are in a zone where people who are delaying in getting the second shot and vaccine-hesitant people pose a challenge in the process of reopening,” Thackeray said.Thackeray said that climate change affects the vulnerable sections of society the hardest. “Greatest inequity of climate changes is that it impacts people who are the most vulnerable and the ones who are least responsible for it. Famines, droughts and other climate change impacts hit mostly people who are from the poor regions of the planet, pollution impacts the working class people,” he said.“We cannot keep mindlessly thriving towards development, we need to rethink highways, mines and railway lines through forests and biodiversity-rich areas. Development is necessary but sustainable development will lead to climate change mitigation,” Thackeray further added.Ahead of the COP26 in Glasgow, the Maharashtra tourism minister said that India will play an important role in the fight against climate change. “We have the power to become a solar energy powerhouse of the world.

The family has sought a compensation of ₹50 lakh, a job assurance and also a probe into Singh’s murder by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), news agency ANI reported.On October 15, Lakhbir Singh was found murdered and his body tied to a barricade near the farmers’ protest site at the Singhu border. Further, a purported video clip of the incident garnered widespread attention on social media where a few Nihang Sikhs could be seen standing near an injured Lakhbir Singh lying on the ground.The Nihang Sikhs alleged that they had punished the man for disrespecting a Sikh holy book, a claim which the family of the victim has questioned. So far, four people have been arrested in connection with the case, according to a report by news agency PTI. Nihangs, an order within the Sikhs, are identified by their distinctive blue robes and swords.Meanwhile, the Delhi Police on Wednesday allegedly stopped and lathicharged a group of farmers from the Hind Mazdoor Kisan Samiti while they going towards the Singhu border demanding justice for Lakhbir Singh, PTI reported. However, the police said that the group tried to create ruckus near the border and some of them tried to break the barricades. The report also showed that the police resorted to the use of “mild force” to contain the situation.The family of Singh -- his wife, three daughters, sister, father-in-law and brother-in-law -- met with the chairman of National Commission of Scheduled Castes (NCSC) Vijay Sampla earlier in the week and demanded justice. Singh was originally from the Tarn Taran district in Punjab.After the meeting, Sampla said that the family told the NCSC that no support was received by them from the Punjab government, religious or social organisations. “However, NCSC will ensure that the culprits are booked under the sections of the (Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes) Prevention of Atrocities Act. Through this Act, the young daughters of Lakhbir Singh will get free education and money for living and the victim's mother will get a monthly pension. Compensation of at least ₹8.25 lakh will be ensured,” PTI quoted him as saying.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhbir-singh-murder-victim-s-kin-submits-memorandum-to-union-home-ministry-demands-compensation-cbi-probe-101635421251612.html

Superintendent of the jail, Satyendra Baisya, said two convicts and three under-trial prisoners have tested positive, while other inmates are going through mandatory testing for the deadly virus. Earlier this month, 88 under-trial prisoners tested HIV positive in Nagaon district of Assam, following which the state government ordered the authorities of other jails to conduct mass testing. Of the two convicts who tested HIV positive at Silchar Central Jail, one was a Manipur resident and the other was a truck driver, Baisya said.“Truck drivers don’t take protective measures. The truck driver who was lodged here was positive. The other convict who later also tested positive, and who hails from Manipur, told us that he made unsafe contact with the truck driver,” Baisya said. Of the three under-trial prisoners, the jail’s superintendent said they were drug addicts who used to share syringes with each other. “Two of the three under-trial prisoners have been sent to Silchar Medical College and Hospital,” Baisya said.Also Read: 88 under trial prisoners test positive for HIV in 2 Assam jailsJoint director of health services of Assam’s Cachar district, Ashutosh Barman, said that of the five HIV-infected prisoners, two are going through antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment at Silchar Medical College and Hospital. “We have an AIDS control body that looks after the health issues of inmates. The team visits Silchar Central Jail every six months and conducts tests on the prisoners,” he said, adding that the five prisoners who tested HIV positive are being kept away from other inmates. Social activist Tuhina Biswas who used to visit Silchar Central Jail in the past to check up on the state of the prisoners, claimed that the health infrastructure inside the jail is poor. “HIV patients need to stay isolated first, which is not possible inside Silchar Central Jail. I would advise the district administration to improve hygiene inside the jail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-inmates-at-silchar-central-jail-in-assam-test-positive-for-hiv-101635420166346.html

The police commissioner did not respond on this latest video.One of the cops, who took part in the checking of vehicles and mobile phones, said the drive had been going on for the last few days and would continue for one more month. “We are checking mobile phones to get any leads on drug peddling,” he said, adding that the searches were going on in three shifts.A senior police official said on condition of anonymity that the checking of vehicles and mobile phones was being done as part of preventing the trade and peddling of narcotic substances. “There is no big issue, as the people are cooperating. So far, we could not find any cases of drug smuggling,” he said.People’s Union of Civil Liberties (PUCL) leader and advocate Jaya Vindhyala said it was illegal on the part of the Hyderabad Police to look into mobile phones in the name of obtaining information on drug peddling.“It is against the Right to Privacy, which is also a fundamental right of an individual, but the police will give it a different interpretation. But they should go as per the procedure, if they really want to check mobile phones. They should first issue notices to them asking them to show their phones. They cannot force the people to part with their mobile phones,” she said.The Hyderabad police also came under trolling on social media for checking mobile phones of the people. “New policing practices alert: stop and search phone chats by the @hydcitypolice. Police are searching phone chats for words like ganja. Wait until they replace them with words like NRC, Modi or BJP,” tweeted one netizen.Another citizen asked: “Is it legal? How can police randomly check phones without any order from court? Not sure an order from police department to their team is legal (sic).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabad-cops-criticised-for-checking-mobile-phones-as-part-of-crackdown-on-narcotics-101635420049868.html

In an affidavit filed in a Delhi court, Rai acknowledged his charges against Nirupam in his interviews to a TV channel, newspapers and other publications were factually incorrect. “I have realised that, in answer to questions posed to me by the interviewers, I had inadvertently and wrongly mentioned the name of Shri Sanjay Nirupam as one of the MPs, who pressurized me to keep the then Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh’s name out of the CAG report on 2-G Spectrum allocation during the meetings in the PAC (Public Accounts Committee) or the sidelines of the JPC (Joint Parliamentary Committee) etc.”Rai said his statements against Nirupam were factually incorrect. “… I understand the pain and agony my statements have caused to Shri Sanjay Nirupam, his family and his well-wishers and thus, would like to offer my unconditional apology for the hurt caused...”In a tweet on Thursday, Nirupam said, “Finally former CAG Vinod Rai tendered an unconditional apology to me in a defamation case filed by me in MM Court, Patiala house, New Delhi today. He must apologize to the nation now for all his forged reports about 2G and Coal block allocations done by the (previous Congress-led) UPA (United Progressive Alliance) Govt.”Also Read: Audit report flags irregularities, violation of rules by NIT KurukshetraNirupam also put out a video saying Rai falsely claimed he pressured him. He called Rai’s reports as CAG on the 2G spectrum and coal block allocation “nonsense”. Nirupam added after several hearings spanning seven years on the 2G allocation, the court also noted that there was no evidence of a scam.” “The entire report was fabricated, and Vinod Rai must also tender an apology to the entire nation for these false reports.”A special court in 2017 acquitted former telecom minister A Raja and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader Kanimozhi in the 2G spectrum scam case.Nirupam said as a PAC member, which scrutinises the CAG reports, he always asked Rai pointed questions related to his reports. “I questioned him over his claim of the scam of ₹1 lakh crore in these allocations. He could never substantiate his report and corroborate the charges of the scams in those allocations... by levelling false charges against me in his book and on TV shows, he wanted to settle a score with me.” Nirupam said Rai would tell people that he harassed him during the PAC meetings by calling his names. “But I had nothing against him. We were doing our duty...”Nirupam said after he filed the defamation suit in 2015, Rai contacted his lawyer and expressed regrets. He added he remained firm on the unconditional apology.HT reached out to Rai but he refused to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-cag-apologises-to-nirupam-in-defamation-case-related-to-2g-spectrum-allocation-101635420048197.html

28-10-2021||India||Sixth sero survey says 97% Delhi residents exposed to Covid-19||97 out of every 100 Delhi resident tested positive for antibodies against Covid-19, according to the preliminary results of the sixth round of serological surveillance for which samples were collected in September end, suggesting almost everyone in Delhi may have been exposed to the infection during the massive second wave of the disease that broke out in April this year. The fifth sero survey in January had found seropositivity to be 56.13% in the capital, officials said. Even in Southwest Delhi, which recorded the lowest sero-prevalence, 93.3% of the samples were found to be positive for antibodies. With 99.8%, East district recorded the highest sero-prevalence. “The report of the sixth sero-survey has come in and the overall positivity was found to be 97%. In all the 11 districts, the positivity was over 90%. The fifth sero survey in January had found seropositivity to be 56.13%,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain. Four previous sero surveys in Delhi had returned readings of 25.5%, 25.1%, 29.1%, and 22.6%.Another sero surveillance was attempted in April, but was halted midway due to exponential rise in the number of cases amid the outbreak of second wave. The researchers were able to collect only about 13,000 samples of the targeted 28,000 and the analysis had found the sero-prevalence to be the same as the round in January. HT reported on Thursday that the preliminary report was submitted to the government and the sero-positivity was found to be above 90%. A detailed analysis of vaccine hesitancy or eagerness and the level of antibodies will be submitted around Diwali. Also Read: All south Delhi wards to get primary health care centre, civic agency saysA portion of the samples collected will also be analysed for level of antibodies, which could help researchers estimate how protected the population could be. These test results are awaited from the laboratory at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS). “This round of the survey was conducted in great detail, so it will take some time to analyse the data. A more detailed report is likely to be submitted in early November, around Diwali,” an official said last week. These numbers could explain why Delhi’s cases have remained low despite the city having lifted most curbs on activities. The average weekly positivity rate of samples has remained under 0.10% since late July. Experts have previously warned against focussing on concepts of herd immunity and population immunity — the principle that says if most of the people are protected, it will form a protective wall against the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/97-people-in-delhi-exposed-to-covid-19-seropositivity-highest-in-east-district-6th-sero-survey-101635419446651.html

I have grown up following the Shiv Sena, which had been fighting for the rights of the Marathi manoos. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Hinduhruday Samrat Balasaheb Thackeray have been my ideals since childhood... Both of them taught us to neither do injustice to anyone, nor tolerate one. Following their teaching, I have been fighting this battle alone against people… attacking my personal life... On social media, people have been making fun [of me],” she wrote in the letter, as translated from Marathi. “Had Balasaheb been around today, he wouldn’t have liked it. He would categorically condemn the personal attacks on a woman and her family indicating how politics has stooped so low,” Redkar wrote, urging Uddhav Thackeray to step in and help. “Today, he (Bal Thackeray) is not alive, but you are there… I am sure that you will never allow any injustice to happen to me and my family. As Marathi manoos, I am looking up to you with hope for justice.”Redkar wrote that she doesn’t want to dive into the politics of the entire episode.Also Read: Aryan regular consumer of drugs, in touch with peddlers: ASG Anil Singh for NCBThe emotional appeal from Sameer Wankhede’s wife came a day after Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik on Wednesday tweeted purported images of Wankhede’s marriage certificate and wedding photo with his first wife, Shabana Quraishi, arguing that the NCB officer allegedly used fraudulent ways to get a job as an Indian Revenue Service officer under scheduled caste category despite being a Muslim.The charge has been refuted by Sameer Wankhede and his family members. On Tuesday, Malik posted a purported image of Wankhede’s birth certificate, in which his father’s name is shown as “Dawood K Wankhede”, while it is “Dnyandev Wankhede” as per the NCB website. The focus in the drugs case involving Aryan Khan shifted to Wankhede after Malik levelled charges against the NCB zonal director heading the probe in the matter. Recently, he cited a letter purportedly written by an anonymous employee of the agency alleging that Wankhede framed innocent people in 26 fake drug cases. He also claimed that Wankhede engaged two private persons to tap the phones of the people to frame them. The NCB on Monday started probing allegations that Sameer Wankhede was part of an alleged ₹25 crore extortion racket after the arrest of Aryan Khan in the drugs case. A vigilance inquiry was ordered after one of the NCB’s witnesses in the case, Prabhakar Sail, made the claim.Wankhede’s wife Kranti Redkar, sister Yasmeen and father Dnyandev met Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former Member of Parliament Kirit Somaiya on Thursday. “They are disturbed by the slanderous and dirty propaganda by the minister (Nawab Malik) against their family members. I strongly condemn such efforts by Malik,” Somaiya later tweeted. Meanwhile, the OBC cell of BJP has announced to stage agitation at the party’s Nariman Point office on Friday under the leadership of OBC morcha chief Narendra Gaokar. Party’s vice-president Chitra Wagh too has condemned Malik for revealing personal information of the first wife of Wankhede. “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray takes action for the remarks on Twitter, but in this case, where a woman is being publicly insulted, he has maintained silence. This has been time and again witnessed in the country that whenever the Congress comes to power Dalits and backwards are targeted,” she said. On Tuesday, Malik posted Wankhede’s birth certificate, in which, his father’s name is Dawood K Wankhede, while it is Dnyandev Wankhede as per the NCB website. The nikahnama also mentioned Wankhede’s father’s name as Dawood.Dr Zahid Quraishi, father of Wankhede’s first wife Dr Shabana Quraishi said the Wankhede family was practising Islam when the marriage with his daughter took place in 2006, otherwise, it would not have happened in the first place. Moreover, Wankhede’s mother Zaheda had told him that her husband Dawood Wankhede converted to Islam.“It was an arranged marriage and we knew the Wankhede family for around four years, prior to the marriage. Each and every member of the family was Muslim at that time. In February 2006, the engagement took place and the nikah was performed after nine months in December, the same year. Before that, we were frequently visiting each other’s residences. Wankhede’s mother was a pious woman and she had told us his father got converted to Islam, after which, his name was changed to Dawood,” Dr Quraishi told TV9 Marathi.“Whatever certificates his (Sameer Wankhede’s) father (Dnyandev Wankhede) is showing, is prior to his marriage with Zaheda and conversion to Islam. Without converting as a Muslim, their marriage would not have happened under Islamic law. Since both the families were Muslim the nikah was performed. Only after this controversy, we have come to know that they were not Muslim,” he told to ABP Majha.The focus in the drug case involving Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan’s son, Aryan Khan, has shifted to Wankhede, with Malik levelling charges against the NCB zonal director, heading the probe in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aryan-khan-drugs-case-sameer-wankhede-s-wife-kranti-redkar-writes-letter-to-cm-101635417766561.html

The Special Investigation Team (SIT), which is looking into the cases against Mavunkal, said a fresh case will be registered against him after recording the statement of the employee before a magistrate.Mavunkal was earlier booked under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act for allegedly raping the daughter of one of his employees.The employee, who has filed the fresh case, said Mavunkal allegedly sexually abused her for months but she was scared to file a complaint as many police officers frequented his house-cum-clinic in Kochi. A rape survivor earlier filed a complaint against Mavunkal alleging he forced her to withdraw the complaint against her alleged rapist.The SIT expects more complaints to surface against Mavunkal. It has found that some of Mavunkal’s clients were given “special massage” which he discreetly filmed.Details of apathy and collusion came to light after his arrest as many top police officers were reportedly close to Mavunkal. He was arrested after five businessmen complained to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan saying Mavunkal cheated them by promising them shares in upcoming international antique museums in Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram. More businessmen filed cheating complaints against him later and prompted the government to constitute the SIT.Also Read: Kerala forest dept seizes suspected whale bones from self-styled antique collector’s houseThe SIT has recorded the statement of Italy-based Malayali Anitha Pullayil, who is believed to have introduced many senior police officers to Mavunkal . He allegedly used his connections with the officers to cheat and intimidate gullible antique buyers. Pullayil has distanced herself from him and said she advised those cheated by Mavunkal to approach the police. She insisted she was unaware of his shady deals and started avoiding him after she got an inkling regarding them. Many police officers regularly visited his house-cum-cosmetology clinic that he ran on the basis of a fake degree.Mavunkal claimed antiques in his possession included the staff of Moses, a piece of fabric from a garment worn by Jesus, and Dahi Handi of Lord Krishna.The Kerala high court on Wednesday granted more time to state police chief Anil Kant to furnish details of Mavunkal’s alleged links with some police officers. The court last month questioned the police protection provided to Mavunkal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-woman-accuses-mavunkal-of-sexual-assault-101635417406320.html

In 2006, when Sameer and Shabana got married, Sameer practised Islam and would occasionally visit mosques, Dr Quraishi said, as reported by PTI."We always knew the Wankhede family as followers of Islam. In fact, I always knew Dnyandev as Dawood Wankhede. We agreed to the marriage of my daughter Dr Shabana with Sameer because we had cordial relations with his late mother Zaheeda," Dr Qureshi said.The marriage between Sameer and Shabana was an arranged marriage that did not last more than a month as the duo got divorced in the same month. Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik has claimed that the wedding was according to Islamic rituals and posted the nikah-nama on social media to substantiate his claim that Sameer Wankhede concealed his Muslim identity and forged documents to claim SC quota in teh UPSC.‘Nikah wouldn’t have been performed if': What Qazi says on Sameer Wankhede's 1st marriageWankhede refuted the allegations and claimed that his mother was a Muslim and the wedding was done according to Islamic rituals as it was his mother's wish. He never converted to Islam and the marriage was also registered under the Special Marriage Act.'How did I allow my daughter to marry a HinduSameer Wankhede's ex-father-in-law said since the controversy over Sameer Wankhede's religion broke out, he was being questioned by people abouthow he allowed his daughter to marry a Hindu. "It became an issue of prestige for me and my family. Hence I am making it clear that when the marriage between my daughter Shabana and Sameer Wankhede took place, the groom was practising Islam. His father's name was Dawood," he said.On Wankhede getting the government job two years after his first marriage, Dr Quraishi said, "You generally don't go so deep into someone else's life. In those days, it was not even practice to find out whether the job is sought through some quota or not."Before his ex-father-in-law, the Qazi who claimed to have performed the nikah said Sameer Wankhede at the time of the wedding belonged to a Muslim family. Otherwise, the 'nikah' would not have been solemnised, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wankhede-family-followed-islam-says-ncb-officer-s-exfatherinlaw-101635416941151.html

28-10-2021||India||BJP forms five-member committee to probe Tripura violence||The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has set up a five-member committee to probe into the incidents of violence in Tripura, where a mosque and shops were set on fire in the Panisagar sub-division on Tuesday.According to the state police, the violence broke out after the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the BJP’s ideological fountainhead, took out a rally against the vandalization of Hindu temples in Bangladesh. Police said some VHP members were allegedly involved in the arson. The BJP has denied the involvement of its members in the violence.Vinod Sonkar, a Member of Parliament and BJP’s Tripura in charge, said the party has set up the committee that comprises members of its minority cell. “The committee has been asked to visit the (violence-hit) areas and submit its report in the next two or three days. Since our political opponents accuse us of being biased, we asked the members of the minority cell to probe the incident.”Sonkar, who will be in Tripura over the weekend, blamed the Trinamool Congress (TMC) for orchestrating the violence. He added the TMC, which is trying to make inroads into the state, is trying to polarise the state along religious lines ahead of the assembly polls that are due there in 2023.“The TMC has no base in Tripura; no party workers are willing to join them so they are trying to create an atmosphere of religious tension and polarisation in the state.”Sonkar denied speculation that some BJP leaders will be joining the TMC in the state. “There is no friction in the party unit.

28-10-2021||India||SP will bolt the door on BJP in UP polls with help from Rajbhar’s SBSP: Akhilesh||Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav will honour meritorious students and address a meeting in his parliamentary constituency of Azamgarh on Thursday. Yadav met party workers in Azamgarh on Wednesday evening and also discussed the strategy for the upcoming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh with party leaders, a SP leader aware of the developments, said on condition of anonymity. Earlier in the day, he addressed a Maha Panchayat in Mau, which was organised by Omprakash Rajbhar led Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) on the occasion of its 19th foundation day. The Samajwadi Party and the SBSP had last week announced their alliance for the 2022 assembly polls in UP, and on Wednesday they gave the slogan ‘Khadeda Hobe’, which translates into a call to “drive out” the BJP from the state. It is similar to the ‘Khela Hobe’ (game on) slogan coined by the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress for the West Bengal assembly polls that resulted in the BJP’s defeat.Akhilesh said Omprakash Rajbhar had shut the door on the BJP’s return to power in the state by walking out of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in early 2019and the SP will now lock that very door, sealing the BJP’s fortune in the 2022 assembly polls, to be organised early next year.Also Read: Lakhimpur Kheri district magistrate removed, 12 IAS officers transferred in UPRajbhar’s party was part of Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha, a coalition of 10 parties that included Asaduddin Owaisi-led All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) and Chandra Shekhar Azad’s Azad Samaj Party. However, these parties were not seen during the Maha Panchayat triggering speculations that the front may have disintegrated following the alliance between the SP and the SBSP, a news agency reported. A political analyst said Akhilesh was queering the pitch in eastern UP with the aim to recover the political ground lost in the 2017 state polls when the BJP stormed to power in the state. The Rajbhar community constitutes about 20% of the population and are concentrated in eastern Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/akhilesh-says-sp-will-bolt-the-door-on-bjp-in-up-polls-with-help-from-rajbhar-s-party-101635406005600.html

28-10-2021||India||BJP defends Goa CM following Malik induced opposition onslaught||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) national general secretary in charge of Goa, CT Ravi virtually ruled out chief minister Pramod Sawant’s resignation by defending him against the allegations of corruption levelled by Meghalaya governor Satya Pal Malik.“The Goa government has done good work during Covid-19. Former Goa governor (Satya Pal Malik) has clarified that he didn’t make any statements on the current Goa CM. The opposition won’t get anything from this controversy,” CT Ravi, also a four-time legislator from Karnataka’s Chikmagalur, said. The opposition has been demanding Sawant’s resignation in the poll bound state after Satyapal Malik-- who held the position of governor of Goa before he was moved to Meghalaya-- said last Monday that “there was corruption in the Goa government in handling everything”. Malik made the allegation recalling his disapproval of some decisions by the Sawant government, including the hiring of a door to door delivery agency during the Covid-19 pandemic. “I am a Lohia-ite. I get very angry when it comes to corruption. I do not take it kindly. On the day when the lockdown was announced, the government said that even the stores selling basic essentials would not be allowed to open but said they would sell door to door. Which was impossible, but they allowed one company to sell basic essentials door to door which had given money to the Goa Government, when people from Congress told me about it, I informed PM Modi ji. ....There was corruption in the Goa government in handling everything… because of that I was sent away from there,” Malik said in an interview to a TV news station. He was governor of Goa from November 2019 to August 2020 before he was moved to Meghalaya.Following his remark Congress leader Digambar Kamat said Sawant had “no moral right to continue” as Goa CM. Goa Congress president Girish Chodankar said Malik’s comments showed that the “BJP made a business of people’s sickness”. Also Read: With eye on state elections, Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee to visit Goa todayIn damage control, Goa BJP spokesperson Damodar “Damu” Naik accused the Meghalaya governor of crossing the line of “ethics and propriety” and asked him to quit his constitutional post if he wanted to criticise “his own government”. “...He should behave within the limits of ethics and propriety. Did he act on it (corruption charges) when he was the governor? To speak about it now and to the media while continuing as a governor is completely wrong and unconstitutional. He should have sent a report to the Union home ministry back then..,” Naik said.This is not the first occasion when Malik’s statements have created a controversy. Earlier this month, he questioned the current security situation in Jammu and Kashmir in the wake of a series of civilian killings by terrorists and suggested that it was a lot better when he was the governor of erstwhile state.  Malik served as the J&K governor from August 2018 to October 2019 before the state was bifurcated into two union territories and its special status abrogated by the parliament. Recently, Malik also appeared to be supporting protesting famers’ demand for strengthening the Minimum Support Price (MSP) regime through legislation, a stand in variance with the Central government. Malik had also criticised Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar for police action against protesting farmers in Karnal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjpdefends-goa-cm-following-malik-induced-opposition-onslaught-101635403304966.html

28-10-2021||India||Kiran Gosavi, NCB witness in Aryan Khan issue, arrested in separate case||The Pune Police on Thursday arrested Kiran Gosavi, a witness in the Narcotics Control Bureau’s (NCB) case involving actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son, Aryan Khan, in connection with a 2018 cheating case.Amitabh Gupta, Pune Police commissioner, denied reports that Gosavi had surrendered. He added the Mumbai Police or any other agency were yet to seek Gosavi’s custody. “They can approach court if they want.”He rejected any political link to the arrest in the case lodged four years back when asked whether it has anything to do with the tussle between the state government and Centre. “There is no politics involved in this matter.”Investigators said Gosavi was on the run and introduced himself as Sachin Patil during his stay in Lucknow, Jabalpur, Hyderabad and Fatehpur. “Gosavi was projecting himself as member of Stop Crime NGO and CIBCA detective agency. He also claimed to run an export-import business,” said Gupta. “We were searching for him based on his social media photos.”The Pune Police filed a charge sheet in May 2019 in the cheating case.Police earlier arrested Gosavi’s assistant, Sherbano Kureshi, in the cheating case. One Chinmay Deshmukh filed the case against Gosavi accusing him of cheating him of ₹3.09 lakh under the pretext of getting him a job in Malaysia. Kureshi allegedly received the money in her account.A lookout circular was earlier issued to prevent Gosavi from leaving the country. Gosavi reportedly claimed on some news channels that he would surrender to the police. Earlier on Monday, the Pune Police formed at least two teams to trace Gosavi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kiran-gosavi-ncb-witness-in-aryan-khan-issue-detained-in-separate-case-101635396644692.html

Bombay HC to continue hearing||The Bombay high court will on Thursday continue hearing on the bail plea of Aryan Khan, who was arrested along with seven others after a raid by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on a cruise ship off the coast of Mumbai on October 2. The 23-year-old and two of his friends - Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha - moved the high court after his previous petitions were rejected by the sessions court and the special NDPS court.Also Read | NCB's key witness Kiran Gosavi detainedThe high court has been hearing Aryan Khan's petition for the past two days. Aryan, the son of actor Shah Rukh Khan, is being represented by a batter of lawyers, including former attorney general Mukul Rohatgi.On Wednesday, the lawyers of the accused told the high court that their arrest violated constitutional provisions, adding that NCB's claims of international trafficking were "absurd and false".Senior advocate Amit Desai, who was representing Merchant, pointed out that in case of minor offences, the settled legal position was that arrest was permitted only in exceptional cases. “Bail is the rule and jail is exception, now arrest is the rule and bail is exception,” Desai said.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, who made the bulk of his submissions for Aryan on Tuesday, argued that the arrest was a direct infringement of constitutional provisions as the arrest memo did not give the “true and correct grounds”.All three have been charged under stringent sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.They have all been in custody for 23 days - through hearings, delays, and bail denials by two other courts.Aryan Khan was arrested on October 3 in a raid led by NCB's Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede who said that 13 grams of cocaine, 5 grams of mephedrone, 21 grams of Charas, 22 pills of MDMA (ecstasy), and ₹1.33 lakh in cash were recovered from the cruise ship Cordelia.At present, Aryan Khan is lodged at Mumbai's Arthur Road Prison along with Merchant.

28-10-2021||India||CVC asks depts to keep an eye on corrupt officers, places of corruption||The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has updated its manual after four years and asked the government departments, undertakings, and administrations to prepare lists of “unscrupulous contractors, suppliers, firms and clearing agents” suspected of corrupt practices. Copies of the lists are to be sent to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).The central anti-corruption probe agency will also pass information pertaining to any corrupt practices of contractors and agents to the concerned departments.The updated manual is the eighth since 1968 and is a compilation of various rules, instructions, and guidelines. It acts as a guidebook for government departments and enforcement agencies in vigilance matters. A drafting committee, headed by chief vigilance commissioner Suresh N Patel and assisted by CBI special director Praveen Sinha, finalised it.For the first time, the CVC has included in its manual the mode of keeping a secret watch on the officers in “Agreed List” of gazetted officers whose honesty or integrity is doubtful. The list is made by concerned government departments in consultation with the CBI.Similarly, it explains the procedure for adding or deleting names from the list of gazetted Officers of Doubtful Integrity, as well as the list of Undesirable Contact Men, prepared by the CBI, suspected of resorting to corrupt or irregular practices in their dealings with official agencies.Another key addition in the document is an “Agreed List of Points and Places of Corruption”, which will be prepared by the CBI after discussions with the concerned heads of department or chief vigilance officers at its local offices at the beginning of the calendar year.Also Read: CBI arrests serving Navy Commander, 4 others for submarine data leakThese procedures have been drawn from CBI’s crime manual updated last year after 15 years. CBI’s manual has not been made public yet.CVC’s latest manual asks authorities to extend all cooperation to the CBI by allowing them to scrutinize relevant records during an investigation, whether preliminary or regular. “If the CBI wishes to check the veracity of information in their possession from the official records, even before registration of a PE (preliminary enquiry) or Regular Case, they may be allowed to see the records on receipt of a request from the Superintendent of Police (empowered under Special Police Establishment Act),” it says.An official, who did not want to be named, said the CVC manual was last updated in 2017 but a lot of changes have taken place since then. For example, the Prevention of Corruption Act has been amended, while regulatory bodies and the government have issued the latest procurement as well as banking/insurance-related guidelines. Subsequently, the CBI also updated its manual last year adding details of procedures to be followed in vigilance/corruption probes.“The latest CVC manual is comprehensive and has several new additions. The plan is to update it annually so that administrative authorities and vigilance officers/agencies empowered to investigate corruption matters have latest information,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cvc-updates-its-manual-after-four-years-101635396224349.html
28-10-2021||India||India at COP26: 450GW renewable energy goal by 2030 likely to be NDC highlight||India’s goal of achieving 450GW renewable energy by 2030 is likely to be the highlight of the country’s contribution to climate change mitigation at the UN-led COP26 summit that begins in Glasgow on Sunday. In a tweet after an inter-ministerial meeting at the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) on India’s stand at COP26, union environment minister Bhupender Yadav on Wednesday said India is on track to achieve the goal. “India under the visionary leadership of PM Shri @narendramodi ji is leading the fight against climate change. As the country remains a ‘high performer’ in the Climate Change Performance Index, India is also on track to achieve the renewable energy target of 450 GW by 2030,” Bhupender Yadav tweeted. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 15 announced that India has installed 100GW of renewable energy. He added that India is the only country among G20 nations that is progressing rapidly to meet its climate goals.India has set a target of achieving 40% of electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030 in its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement. One of the means to achieve the target is installing 175GW of renewable energy by 2022.Under the Paris Agreement, India presently has three quantifiable NDCs. They include lowering the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33-35% compared to 2005 levels by 2030, increasing total cumulative electricity generation from fossil-free energy sources to 40% by 2030, and creating an additional carbon sink of 2.5-3 billion tonnes through additional forest and tree cover.Centre for Science and Environment director general Sunita Narain called the 450GW goal substantial. “It will be difficult to achieve, but we have to see what measures are put in place. There are projections that solar prices would go up because there aren’t enough loans or finance to support the capital cost mainly because the risk is high,” Narain said.Also Read: World on track for 2.7°C temp rise this century, warns UNAn official, who attended the meeting at the PMO, said announcing a distant net zero goal may not be a solution to the present climate change crisis. “So, we may focus on immediate goals. But options are still open. The net zero option has not been closed,” the official said. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, added that since Narendra Modi will be travelling to Glasgow, the Cabinet’s approval was not needed. “It was decided that India will not be an outlier at COP26.”Ahead of COP26, the summit’s president Alok Sharma said on Tuesday that he expects India to incorporate 450GW renewable energy goal by 2030 in the NDC that it will submit. Sharma said every country starts with a different energy mix, but India’s informal goal of 450GW should be formalised in its NDC before the Glasgow talks. The Coalition of Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), a global partnership of 27 countries initiated by India in 2019, will also be launching an initiative to help small island states develop resilience to climate change at COP26.The initiative titled “Infrastructure for the Resilient Island States” will be implemented between 2022 and 2030 in 58 countries in the Caribbean, the Pacific, and the Atlantic, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean, and the South China Sea.India, Australia, and the UK are likely to pledge $10 million each for the project and other CDRI initiatives. Other countries are also likely to contribute. Japan and the US have offered support in kind, mainly in technical expertise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-at-cop26-450gw-renewable-energy-goal-by-2030-likely-to-be-ndc-highlight-101635395744849.html

28-10-2021||India||After Himanta, EC serves notice to Assam minister for poll code violation||The Election Commission of India (ECI) has sought an explanation from Assam urban development and irrigation minister Ashok Singhal for violating the model code of conduct duringcampaigning for bye-elections to five assembly seats in the state, scheduled for October 30. The notice was issued on Wednesday evening following a complaint by Congress MLA and leader of opposition in Assam assembly Debabrata Saikia and it asked Singhal, a senior leader from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), for an explanation by 5pm on Thursday. Earlier in the day, the poll commission had warned Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma to “exercise restraint” and follow the poll code of conduct while making public utterances. The CM had earlier issued an unconditional apology to EC for making promises and assurances in his poll rallies. In his complaint, Saikia alleged that in an election rally at Gossaigaon, one of the five constituencies going to polls, Singhal said there will be no development in the constituency if voters didn’t vote for the BJP and in contrast, the work on an embankment will begin within two months if they voted for the ruling party. The BJP is supporting alliance partner UPPL’s candidate Jiron Basumatary, who has been fielded from Gossaigaon. During the campaigning Singhal made it clear that voting for Basumatary was same as voting for the BJP. “Claps are not enough, you have to give votes. Give from one hand and take from another. First you give then I will give you/return the favour. If tomorrow people from the Congress, BPF (Bodoland People’s Front) and AIUDF (All India United Democratic Front) come and explain otherwise, and ask for votes, then the work of the embankment will not begin,” Singhal had said. BPF and AIUDF are regional opposition parties. “If you support the government, then you will receive more benefits. If you support the BPF, Congress, AIUDF, you will not receive these benefits. Do you want the embankment or not?” the minister asked voters. Also Read: EC warns Assam CM over model code violation, asks him to be carefulAfter going through the transcripts of the speech, the EC held that Singhal had violated provisions of the model code of conduct. “The commission is of the view that by making the above statements, and conducting election meeting without obtaining permission from competent authority, you have violated provisions of the model code of conduct,” the notice issued by the poll body said. Bye-election to Gossaigaon seat is being held since the sitting MLA (Member of Legislative Assembly) from ruling United Peoples Party Liberal (UPPL) Majendra Narzary died due to Covid-19 related complications. Besides Gossaigaon, Thawra, Mariani, Tamulpur and Bhabanipur are going to polls on October 30. Campaigning for the bye-elections ended on Wednesday evening. Counting of votes will take place on November 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-himanta-ec-serves-notice-to-assam-minister-for-poll-code-violation-101635394664191.html

28-10-2021||India||BJP will remain powerful for decades, predicts poll strategist Prashant Kishor||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will continue to be a force to reckon with in Indian politics for decades to come, political strategist Prashant Kishor said during a visit to Goa. The head of the Indian Political Action Committee (IPAC), a poll consultancy firm, believes the BJP will have to be fought for “many decades”.Kishor’s profile as a poll strategist shot up after he helped the Trinamool Congress (TMC), led by Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, retain power earlier this year by giving Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP a rare snub in the state elections.Prashant Kishor is now in Goa, assisting the TMC in finding a foothold to contest elections.While predicting a strong presence for the BJP in the decades to come, Kishor hit out at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, saying he was probably under an illusion that it’s a matter of time until Modi’s power wanes. “The BJP is going to be in the centre of Indian politics, whether they win, whether they lose - like it was for the first 40 years for the Congress. The BJP is going nowhere. Once you secure 30% vote at the India level, you are not going away in a hurry,” Prashant Kishore said. “So do not ever get into this trap that people are getting angry and they will throw away Modi. Maybe they will throw away Modi, but the BJP is not going anywhere. You have to fight it out for the next many decades,” he said at an interaction hosted at the Museum of Goa. “That is where the problem lies with Rahul Gandhi. Probably, he thinks that it is just a matter of time when people will throw him (Narendra Modi) away. That’s not happening,” Kishor said. “Unless you examine, understand and take cognizance of his (Modi’s) strength, you will never be able to put [in place] a counter to defeat him,” Prashant Kishor said. “The problem that I see is that most people are not spending enough time on understanding his strengths, understanding what is making him popular. Only if you know, you can find a counter.” Also Read: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee to begin 3-day Goa visit from todayOn how the Congress party sees the future of Narendra Modi and the BJP, Kishor said, “You go and talk to any Congress leader or to any regional leader, they will say, ‘it’s just a matter of time, people are getting fed up, there will be an anti-incumbency [wave] and people will throw him off’. I doubt it. It’s not happening.”The election strategist cited the example of how the Modi government announced massive increases in fuel prices without “any apparent discontent against the man (Modi)”.Prashant Kishor pointed to a fragmented voter base in the country, saying, “If you look at the electorate level, it is a fight between one-third and two-third. Only one third people are voting for the BJP or wanting to support the BJP. The problem is that the two-third side is so fragmented that it is divided into 10, 12 or 15 political parties, and that is primarily because of the decline of the Congress.”“It’s because the [support for] the Congress has gone down, that 65% has got fragmented, leading to a lot of individuals and smaller parties,” he said. The IPAC has begun surveys on behalf of the TMC in Goa to help the party expand beyond Bengal. In Goa, the TMC has taken on board former Congressman Luizinho Faleiro to lead the party in elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-will-remain-powerful-for-decades-predicts-poll-strategist-prashant-kishor-101635390104005.html

28-10-2021||India||Strategic Forces Command conducts Agni V trial, hits target 5,000 km away||The Strategic Forces Command (SFC) conducted the first user trial of the Agni V ballistic missile from APJ Abdul Kalam Island in Odisha on Wednesday evening to validate the night operations with the missile reaching its target 5000 km away within the stipulated time.The missile, which was tracked by telemetry and radar ships of the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO), took perfect flight trajectory as per accorded parameters and hit the target within 15 to 18 minutes. This was the eighth successful trial of the ballistic missile, which is at the core of India’s minimum deterrence in the background of Chinese increased intermediate range ballistic missile capability and Pakistan’s nuclear ambition.According to people aware of the development, the Agni V missile, which flew at 7.50 pm, was of standard configuration including the warhead weight. The target was hit within the accepted circular error of probability with both the user and the developer satisfied with the result. The motive behind a night test was to test whether the user, SFC, could handle the weapon in day and night operational mode. It is understood that the missile is fully developed and inducted with the SFC at liberty to undertake further trials in case of requirement. The Agni V missile is a three stage solid fueled surface to surface missile with advanced guidance systems.The Agni V test comes after the DRDO successfully test-fired the new generation Agni Prime missile from Odisha on June 28, 2021 with range between 1000 to 2000 kilometers. The new generation missile will ultimately replace all the Agni missiles within this range as the Prime series is more efficient, maneuverable, less cumbersome and a highly accurate platform using both composite fiber and canister casing system. The missile can be fired from mobile launchers and trains, which helps in survival of the weapon for second strike as India is committed to no first use policy.The Agni series of missiles are part of India’s nuclear triad with capacity and capability to deliver nuclear weapons from air through fighters like Rafale and even Mirage 2000 H and from sea through ballistic missile submarines like INS Arihant.While India is expected to commission its second ballistic missile submarine INS Arighat during its 75 year of independence, the developers are also working on a sea launched ballistic missile which has a similar range as the Agni V missile. With a nuclear submarine carrying a missile of 5000 km range, the Indian nuclear triad is expected to cap at this range till such time the government decides to go for longer ranges in case the security scenario deteriorates in Asia. The missile developers on their part are confident that they can deliver far beyond the 5000 km range cap.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/strategic-forces-command-conducts-agni-v-trial-hits-target-5000-km-away-101635389131043.html

Singh held a press conference on Wednesday where he announced the formation of a new political party and about his meeting with Shah.“Tomorrow I am going to meet home minister Shah and 25-30 people will go with me,” he said.The Congress leader's gesture was welcomed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Party general secretary Tarun Chugh said the Centre has been always open to talks with farmers and has welcomed any intervention to resolve the deadlock.Singh's meeting with Shah assumes significance as he has not ruled out the possibility of an alliance with the BJP ahead of the assembly polls in Punjab provided the farmers' issues are resolved.“I think I can help in finding a solution as I have been the chief minister of Punjab and am also an agriculturist,” Singh said yesterday.The BJP too had reciprocated that the party would wait for him to announce his party; however, said it was open to alliance with anyone who puts the nation’s interest first.Meanwhile, addressing the media in Chandigarh on Wednesday, Amarinder Singh did not share the name of his political outfit, but said they will contest the upcoming elections from all 117 assembly seats in Punjab."When the time comes we will fight all 117 seats, whether we fight in adjustment or we fight on our own only time will tell... Plenty of Congress workers is coming in... We are waiting for an appropriate moment," Amarinder Singh said.Singh resigned last month as the chief minister of Punjab and announced that he will be quitting the Congress after months of a rift with party's state unit chief Navjot Singh Sidhu.Also Read | Only ‘parties’ held under Capt for over 4 years, Mann’s dig at ex-CMHe had resigned ahead of Congress legislature party meeting which was called to find a solution to end infighting in the ruling Congress in the state. Singh was replaced by Charanjit Singh Channi as the chief minister of the state.Punjab is slated to go through assembly polls in 2022. In 2017 Assembly polls, Congress had won an absolute majority in the state by winning 77 seats and ousted the SAD-BJP government after 10 years.Aam Aadmi Party emerged as the second-largest party winning 20 seats in 117-member Punjab Legislative Assembly.The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) could only manage to win 15 seats while the BJP secured three seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarinder-singh-to-meet-amit-shah-in-delhi-today-know-why-it-s-significant-101635386544950.html

28-10-2021||India||Partition to electoral rolls: Many challenges before a young India||It was in October 1951 that the first votes were cast in the first general election of independent India. In the 70 years, with 16 instalments since, this fundamental fact of democracy and its facilitator , the Election Commission , have accumulated much appreciation. In the post-1945 world, India becoming and remaining an electoral democracy is indeed worthy of acknowledgement, given the country’s size. This is even more so when one (a) retraces the tentative timeline to that first election, alongside (b) recalling some of the tensions felt in entering this Ambedkarite ‘life of contradictions…’
28-10-2021||India||Number Theory: Curious mix of power subsidies and politics||As the next election cycle nears, politicians are once again promising cheap, even free electricity, to voters. After he assumed charge as the chief minister of Punjab, Charanjit Singh Channi burnt copies of electricity bills and announced restoration of power connections which were disconnected for non-payment of bills. And the Aam Admi Party (AAP), which used the free-power promise effectively in Delhi, is making similar promises in states such as Punjab and Uttarakhand. While there are some benefits to these policies, they can be detrimental in the long term. Here’s why.1. Why pays for power subsidies in the end?There really is no such thing as a free lunch. Power distribution companies (Discoms), which buy electricity from electricity producers (Gencos), are obliged to pay for it at commercial rates. When governments offer cheap or free power to households or farmers, they have to compensate Discoms for the residual amount. This is done in two ways. State governments subsidise or end up taking over the debt of Discoms. This is what happened in the Ujjwal Discom Assurance Yojna (UDAY) when state governments floated bonds worth ₹2.32 lakh crore to retire the accumulated debt of Discoms. Another way in which governments recover the costs of cheap tariffs is by cross-subsidising, which means they raise the price of power for other consumers. In the end, it is the consumer who ends up paying, as commercial users pass on these costs. An October 13 research note by Pranjul Bhandari and others from HSBC Capital Markets and Research has given estimates of this cross-subsidisation of electricity prices in India. The note shows that cross-subsidisation is not enough to recover the costs, creating the burden of large unpaid dues. 2. Outstanding dues to Discoms are worth more than the yearly cost of MGNREGSLatest data from the ministry of power portal (PRAAPTI) shows that total non-disputed payment owed by Discoms in various states to Gencos stood at ₹1.01 lakh crore on October 22. This was ₹79,112 crore at the beginning of the fiscal year. This is more than what is spent on the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Programme in a year. The total overdue payments are divided into two categories: those due for a maximum of 60 days; and those pending for over 60 days. This classification matters because the Discoms are given 60 days’ credit by Gencos. After that, the latter charge penal interest on the outstanding dues in most cases. The electricity portal data shows share of overdue payments which are delayed by more than 60 days has increased by 8 percentage points since the beginning of this year and now account for 80% of the total dues. 3. What is causing this delay in payments by Discoms?According to Sabyasachi Majumdar, Senior Vice President & Group Head - Corporate Ratings, ICRA, the delays in payments to Gencos can be attributed to weak operating efficiencies and financials of the Discoms. Various factors contribute to this. Power tariffs are inadequate in relation to their cost of supply because they are set lower. Sometimes, this is because of inadequacy of tariffs in relation to their cost of supply because of delays in the approval of tariff orders by regulators. There is also the inadequacy of and delays in subsidy payments by state governments, he added. According to a March report from ICRA, subsidy payments by governments were estimated to comprise 16% of discom revenues at an all-India level in 2021-22.A recent Economic and Political Weekly paper by Amandeep Kaur and others on state-level performance of Discoms shows a worsening of financial parameters of over the years. The paper points out that the gap between the average cost of supply (ACS) per unit of power and the per unit average revenue realised (ARR) by utilities increased from ₹0.27 in October 2018 to ₹0.58 per unit Kwh in January. Also, the average aggregate technical and commercial losses (AT&C) by Discoms increased from 19.93% of total energy input received in May 2017 to 26.15% in January (compared to the intended target of 15% under UDAY scheme).The HSBC note referred to earlier notes that a turnaround in financial health of Discoms is a must for India’s transition to a low carbon-emission economy. “Transmission networks need to be upgraded with ancillary services and storage to successfully raise the share of renewable energy over time (this is needed to manage the sudden change in frequencies and supply associated with renewable power). The weak financials of the Discoms also impact other players in the energy arena. Because the Discoms don’t want to let go of paying customers such as corporates, they impose restrictions via policy flip-flops and ad-hoc charges to discourage the private sector from directly sourcing renewable power.” 4. Which states are the worst offenders?Data for October shows that Discoms in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Rajasthan have the highest share of overdue payments to Gencos. While these three states comprise 50% of overdue payments, they are not the ones that have the highest share in overdue payments that are delayed for more than 60 days. Discoms owe over 50% of their overdue amount to independent power producers (IPP) followed by central public sector undertakings (CPSEs). The highest overdue amount is owed to Adani Power (25,611 crore) which comprise around 25% of overall dues to Gencos. How do such moves affect state finances? According to Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA ratings, “Waiver of electricity bills or other forms of subsidy provided by a state government add to its revenue expenditure, thereby widening the fiscal deficit”.   The amount owed by Discoms in 27 states (for whom 2019-20 domestic product and fiscal data is available on CMIE) accounted for 18.4% of the total fiscal deficit of these states. This is a burden which will ultimately show up in state government’s ability to spend money on other heads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/number-theory-curious-mix-of-power-subsidies-and-politics-101635375829052.html

28-10-2021||India||States told to step up vaccine drive with door-to-door campaign||Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Wednesday advised states and Union territories to scale up the national Covid-19 vaccination drive with the door-to-door vaccination campaign ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ over the next one month, especially focusing on covering those beneficiaries due for their second dose in poor performing districts.The minister was charing a meeting with the state health ministers in Delhi.“We’re going to launch a mega vaccination campaign ‘Har Ghar Dastak’. We have decided that for the next one month, healthcare workers will go door-to-door to vaccinate people eligible for second dose and also those who have not taken the first dose, especially focusing on the poorly performing districts...,” said Mandaviya.There are currently 134 million beneficiaries, who have not taken their second vaccine shot even after the prescribed interval, as per the government data. As of Wednesday, 313, 767,852 people have been fully vaccinated while 407,789, 873 have taken their first Covid-19 dose, according to the HT dashboard.“The focus of the meeting was to urge states to take effective steps to ensure no district was left without fully vaccinating its eligible beneficiaries. As much as 77% of the eligible population in India has been vaccinated against Covid-19 with first dose. And 32% of the population has received both the doses. More than 10 crores (100 million) people haven’t taken second dose of vaccine. People who are eligible for second dose should take the vaccine,” he said.The health minister also assured the states that adequate vaccine doses were available in the country to meet the required demand, and at least 120 million balance and unutilised vaccine doses were available with the States for administering currently. “No district should be without full vaccination”, he advised the states, adding that the aim should be “to cover all eligible with first dose by end-November 2021”.The state health ministers were asked to ensure continuous oversight on progress of the national Covid-19 vaccination programme.“Dr Mandaviya urged the states to make regional and local level plans with all the stakeholders to reduce number of people with vaccination overdue. He also urged for innovative strategies to encourage them to achieve their targets to review the planning and execution of district-wise plans for coverage of due beneficiaries of second dose as available on Co-WIN portal,” said health ministry in a statement.Dr GC Khilnani, former head, pulmonology department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, said, “It is important to take both the doses for maximum protection, even if you have been infected in the past.”Apart from the vaccination coverage, Mandaviya also discussed issues related to Covid emergency response package utilisation, and Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission.“It was an elaborate interaction with the states to know what they have been doing for pandemic management, what is lacking and how the Centre can help in achieving their targets. Increasing vaccination coverage was also discussed as it is an important issue that needs extra attention,” said a central government official aware of the matter, on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-told-to-step-up-vaccine-drive-with-door-to-door-campaign-101635367626088.html
28-10-2021||India||India successfully test-fires Agni-5 missile||India on Wednesday announced that it carried out the latest test of the 5,000 km range Agni-5 missile from the APJ Abdul Kalam Island off the Odisha coast, a significant step towards boosting the nuclear deterrence against China.The successful test of the Agni-5 missile is in line with India’s stated policy to have credible minimum deterrence that underpins the commitment to no first use, the defence ministry said in a statement.The missile, which is being inducted into the Strategic Forces Command (SFC), will put India’s credible minimum deterrence on a firm footing as no missile in the Indian arsenal has the range to strike targets deep inside China.“The missile, which uses a three-stage solid fuelled engine, is capable of striking targets at ranges up to 5,000km with a very high degree of accuracy,” the statement added. The missile has been tested several times after its maiden launch almost a decade ago.The latest test comes at a time when India and China are locked in a border row in the Ladakh sector, and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has also scaled up its military activities in the eastern sector, including Arunachal Pradesh.India completed its nuclear trial in 2018 when the indigenous nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine, INS Arihant, successfully completed its first deterrence patrol. India has the capability to carry out nuclear strikes with fighter planes, land-launched missiles and from the sea. The Agni series of ballistic missiles and warplanes such as Rafales, Sukhoi-30s and Mirage-2000s can deliver nuclear warheads. India is also developing a new class of ultra-modern weapons that can travel six times faster than the speed of sound (Mach 6) and penetrate any missile defence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-successfully-test-fires-agni-5-missile-101635367300574.html

He has been associated with several important judgments, including ones on OBC reservation, the 1993 Mumbai serial bomb blasts, and the scope of the Union’s power to remove Governors.
28-10-2021||India||Pegasus row: Opposition welcomes Supreme Court's decision||Opposition leaders on Wednesday hailed the Supreme Court’s decision to form an expert committee to probe the use of Pegasus software in the country with former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi commenting that “the PM is not above the nation.”“Pegasus is illegal. It is not legal in India to do snooping using Pegasus. So, we would like to know, why the Prime Minister is doing an illegal act. He is not above the nation. He is not above the institutions. Was this information that was coming going to the PM’s desk? It would be criminal if he was using it as personal tool,” said Gandhi.The BJP pointed out that it was the government that first mooted the idea of an expert panel. Its national spokesperson Sambit Patra said: “The government in its affidavit to the SC had said “they are of the opinion that to end the false narrative of a certain vested group, it would be fair if a committee of experts is set up to look into the issue.”
28-10-2021||India||Govt looks to revive tourism sector as jab drive gathers steam||Minister of state for tourism Ajay Bhatt on Wednesday lauded the efforts of the Centre to revive the tourism industry which suffered a major setback during the Covid-19 pandemic.While delivering the keynote speech at the two-day Hindustan Times Tourism Conclave in Delhi, the minister congratulated the nation for administering one billion Covid-19 vaccine doses and for attempting to revive the tourism industry despite backlash from international communities.A sudden influx of visitors in the hills prior to the second wave was seen as a major reason behind a sharp surge in Covid-19 infections between April and June, Bhatt said. Foreign media, he added, alleged that Covid-19 protocols and guidelines were not followed by domestic travellers.“It was due to the efforts of health care workers, scientists and the public that we were able to emerge from it,” he said.The 3rd edition of the Hindustan Times Tourism Conclave, held in New Delhi, is centred around the theme, ‘Reviving Tourism-Responsibly in the post-pandemic world’. This event has been organised in partnership with various state tourism agencies — Bihar Tourism, Gujarat Tourism, Chhattisgarh Tourism Board, IRCTC, Jharkhand Tourism, Maharashtra Tourism and Uttarakhand Tourism.MoS Bhatt, who was among several bureaucrats from the tourism industry who attended the event on Wednesday, said discussions around the revival of the tourism industry have largely been due to more people getting vaccinated against Covid-19.“When international tourism was shut in India, we started a TV program called ‘Dekho Apna Desh’ wherein the Ministry of Tourism provided knowledge on various Indian destinations. Following this, we saw an increase in domestic tourism to lesser-known destinations,” he said.To revive the concerned industry and increase travel in unexplored regions, the minister said, the tourism ministry has created special projects such as the Buddhist Circuit Train and a tourist train exploring five northeastern states under the ‘Dekho Apna Desh’ initiative.In addition to these projects, the central government has also worked towards reopening the travel industry on an international level by allowing chartered flights from October 15 and non-chartered ones from November 15. This measure has further been amplified by providing five lakh free Indian visas to international travelers.“It is necessary for us to move swiftly, given that large amounts of the Indian population are employed under the tourism sector,” the MoS said.Based on studies conducted in the employment sector, on every ₹10 lakhs invested by the government, 78 people can be employed in the tourism industry as compared to 45 people in other sectors, Bhatt said. “This means that the tourism business can be a game-changer for the country,” he added.Bhatt also mentioned a national tourism policy that will be developed by closely consulting the state government and other beneficiaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-looks-to-revive-tourism-sector-as-jab-drive-gathers-steam-101635363765775.html

We have increased our waste processing capacity from 17% (in 2014) to 70% now and plan to make it 100%. The country had become Open Defecation Free in 2019, based on third-party verification. Just one city (Purulia) in West Bengal is left that is not ODF free,” said Union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri at the event.Durga Shanker Mishra, secretary of the HUA ministry, said, “Of the 15,000 acres of land under dumpsites, we have freed up close to 3500 acres. In the second phase, we aim to free up the entire area and convert them into green zones.”The AMRUT mission, Puri said, has been scaled up to cover all the cities. He said that just 60% of the country was covered under the first phase of the AMRUT mission. But in the second phase of the mission, the government has decided to cover all the cities.Under AMRUT 2.0, the government aims to make cities water secure by providing a 24x7 water supply in 500 cities, giving incentives to all the local bodies for work towards providing tap connection to each household. The government aims to provide close to three crore tap connections. The mission aims to make 4700 towns/cities water secure, said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-releases-guidelines-for-swachh-bharat-2-0-and-amrut-101635363399370.html

The student was found dead in his hostel room on Monday. He was a native of Hiriyalu in Arsikere taluk, police said on Wednesday.The incident took place on Monday night and the police recovered the video on Tuesday. In the 13 minutes and 21 seconds video, he asks the chief minister, vice-chancellors, and prominent leaders of all parties to overhaul the present education system. In the video clip, he said he was “sacrificing his life” to get people’s attention on the problems in the education system. He also thanked his parents, friends, and teachers for their support. He also appealed to his parents to donate his organs to the needy. The deceased in the video further said that there should not be any discrimination on the basis of one’s profession. “How does it matter what job one does? One can be a scavenger. All should be treated equally,” he said. He further stated that the present education system was of no use. He also appealed that his video should be uploaded on news channels and social media platforms. He also requested that his final rites should take place in the presence of the chief minister, education minister, and religious seers. In the video, he also apologized to his parents for taking his life, following which he hanged himself in his hostel room. The police are investigating the case. Reacting to the incident on Tuesday, higher education minister Ashwath Narayan said, “Now the society is reforming. It will take some time. I respect the feeling of the student. But he should not have taken such a decision.” “In the National Education Policy (NEP), there is an opportunity for those who are interested in any field and they can choose a career in school itself.

28-10-2021||India||Parties make final pitch to woo voters as campaigns for Hanagal, Sindgi bypolls end||Bengaluru As the campaigning for the bypolls came to a close, Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai held seven rallies in Hanagal on Wednesday as the former tried to cover as many places possible on the last day for the October 30 bypolls. In the high-pitched campaigning, which lasted for over 15 days, all the three major parties- BJP, Congress and the JD(S)- spared no opportunity to attack each other on various platforms and issues in an election which Bommai said would become an indicator of what the state can expect in the 2023 assembly elections. For the last 10 days, the chief minister has left no stone unturned to ensure a victory in the two bypoll-bound constituencies--Sindgi and Hanagal--with the latter seat turning into a prestige issue as it comes under his home district Haveri.During the rally in Hanagal on Wednesday hundreds of workers joined Bommai in large numbers to support the BJP. On Tuesday, Bommai even had said that there is a tsunami in favour of the BJP which will have its effect on the party’s performance in the Hanagal Assembly bypoll on October 30.“There is a tsunami in favour of the BJP in the state and it will have an effect on Hanagal. There is massive support to the BJP in every village of Hanagal,” the chief minister had said addressing the members of Bhajandri community in Hanagal town. During the most part of the campaigning, the chief minister and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) took on the Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) for their wrongdoing or inaction but shared very little about the incumbent government’s own achievement or any development in these regions which are among the most backward in the state. Congress too didn’t leave any chances to attack the BJP. On Wednesday as well, senior party leader Siddaramaiah reiterated his charge against the BJP of distributing cash for votes. “Ten to 12 ministers in each constituency are holding a bag of money to distribute it to people to purchase votes,” he said. The Congress and BJP have traded charges of distributing cash to secure support to help secure them a victory. Siddaramaiah even said that he will file a complaint with the election authorities regarding this. The BJP also hit back at the Congress saying that it was party president DK Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah who have used money bags to win elections and subvert processes in past elections while they were in power. Siddaramaiah had even called Bommai a “remote control” chief minister, referring to speculations that he continues to operate under his predecessor, BS Yediyurappa, and the BJP in Delhi. Replying to the jibe, Bommai had said, “Siddaramaiah has called me a remote control chief minister. What he has said is true. My remote control is with the people. Siddaramaiah is under the control of the family (Gandhi’s) in Delhi.” The attacks during the campaign have been more personal in nature rather than on more pressing issues of relief for Covid, flood and drought-hit population of the calamity-prone state. There have been accusations of distributing cash in both constituencies to secure voter support. According to election authorities, a total of 99 flying squads, (54 Sindgi LAC and 45 Hangal LAC), 303 static surveillance teams have been activated, (63 Sindgi LAC and 240 Hangal LAC). “Cumulatively, flying squads, SSTs and authorities have seized cash/ liquor worth Rs. 29792.86.Cumulatively, flying squads have registered FIRs in 53 cases. Static surveillance teams have registered FIRs in 2 cases. While excise department cumulatively have seized 1,027.916 litres of IML & other liquors worth Rs. 4,21,719 and booked 41 heinous cases, 18 cases for breach of licence conditions, 2 NDPS case and 185 cases under Section 15 (a) of Karnataka Excise act 1965,” the state election commission had said in a statement on Tuesday. . HD Kumaraswamy, the former chief minister on Tuesday had said that the BJP is attempting to distribute cash after campaigning ends in a response to an earlier taunt by housing minister V Somanna. The minister had on Tuesday said that everyone (political leaders) can move around for now but “our game” begins from tomorrow (Wednesday).Kumaraswamy said that Somanna must clarify what he means by this statement. “He should openly state what game this is. Is it distributing money as they (BJP) have done no work so far,” he had said. There are a total of six candidates in Sindgi and 13 in Hanagal contesting the polls on Saturday. There are 2,34,000 lakh voters in Sindgi and 2, 04,000 lakh voters in Hanagal, according to election authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parties-make-final-pitch-to-woo-voters-as-campaigns-for-hanagal-sindgi-bypolls-end-101635362921437.html
28-10-2021||India||Karnataka reports 5 more suspected Covid cases of AY.4.2 variant||A day after two suspected cases of AY.4.2 variant of the novel coronavirus was detected in Karnataka , five more cases of the new variant have been detected taking the total to seven, said state health and family welfare commissioner D Randeep on Wednesday. Talking to reporters in Bengaluru on Wednesday he said: “There are seven cases (of AY.4.2) in the state -- three in Bengaluru and four in different parts of the state.” Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said on Tuesday that a government panel of experts is looking into the Delta coronavirus subvariant, AY.4.2, that is believed to have triggered an increase in the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the United Kingdom. The variant was described by technical experts in UK of having a growth rate of 17% compared to the baseline Delta variant and a secondary household contact attack rate of 12.4%, as opposed to 11.1% for Delta. Out of 23,407 sequences identified in the world, 21,848 are from the UK. Randeep also said the government is making a negative RT-PCR test report, obtained 72 hours before arrival, mandatory for those coming from abroad to the state. “The test report has to be uploaded on a portal called Air Suvidha. Other than that, there are no restrictions like quarantining people,” Randeep said. He further said the Centre and the state will initiate certain measures to check the new variant of Covid-19, which has spread in some foreign countries. There are no reports of deaths due to the new variant but one or two people have been hospitalized, he added. Following the discovery of the variant, Karnataka health minister Dr. K Sudhakar had called a meeting of the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Tuesday. Apart from the measures announced by the health commissioner, more measures are expected in the coming days to control the potential spread of the variant. Talking about the new variant resulting in the third wave, experts said that reconfirming the variant is crucial and reports from the national labs should be awaited. Dr. Manjunath, a member of the TAC said that adequate steps should be taken to control the spread, and most importantly people should not get complacent. “Public meetings, especially political rallies that is happening in the state are a cause of the concern,” he said. Meanwhile, Karnataka on Wednesday added 282 fresh cases and 13 deaths, taking the caseload and death toll to 29,86,835 and 38,037, the health department said. The day also saw 349 people being discharged, pushing the total number of recoveries to 29,40,339. Active cases stood at 8,430, according to the department bulletin. Bengaluru Urban accounted for the maximum number of 142 new cases and six deaths, it said. Other districts too reported fresh cases, including 31 in Kodagu, 28 in Dakshina Kannada, and 18 each in Mysuru and Hassan. While nine districts reported zero infections, 17 districts had cases in single digits. Three deaths were reported from Dakshina Kannada, two in Mysuru and one each in Hassan and Tumakuru, the bulletin said. Bagalkote, Bidar, Chamarajanagar, Gadag, Haveri, Kalaburagi, Koppal, Vijayapura, and Yadgir reported zero infections and zero Covid-19 related deaths. The positivity rate for the day was 0.24% and the case fatality rate 4.6%. A total of 1,17,351 samples were tested, including 93,617 today, taking the cumulative number of specimens examined to 5.04 crore. The number of vaccinations done so far in the state rose to 6.44 crore, with 4,90,315 people being inoculated on Wednesday, it said.

The matter pertains to a case filed by Karumalai (who goes by one name), who approached the court complaining that his requests, the latest being on July 19, 2021, was not being considered by respondents (Salem district authorities) for the purpose of issuing patta in respect of government poramboke land to homeless citizens for them to construct their houses. The court said: “It is for the executive authorities to decide how and in what manner land would be allotted to the homeless or how encroachers without any shelter may be rehabilitated elsewhere.” Since the petitioner has said he belongs to a scheduled caste and does not have any land or asset and refers to 75 other families residing in and around Thathaiyampatty Village in Omalur Taluk of Salem district to be similarly situated, the court permitted him to make a fresh representation to the Salem district collector within four weeks. The court said the collector, along with planning authorities, will take “positive steps to introduce a scheme” which may result in the landless and the homeless being allocated housing facilities. “The matter should receive attention of the highest executive authorities, so that a comprehensive plan can be taken in respect of every district and certain cut-off parameters indicated,” the court said. The justices, however, made it clear that the petitioner cannot have a say in choice of land that would be allotted. The court noted that the land, which the petitioner has demanded, has already been earmarked for a school and disposed off the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-hc-asks-tamil-nadu-govt-to-identify-sites-for-accommodation-for-homeless-people-101635362500932.html

Stalin was responding to Vijayan’s letter, received on October 24, that raised the issue of the floods and landslides and fearing that water would accumulate in the dam as rains intensify. He had said there was an urgent need for gradual release of water from the dam through the tunnel to Tamil Nadu.Stalin, in his response letter, said the water level as of 9 am on October 27 was 137.60 feet, with an inflow of 2,300 cusecs. “We are already drawing the maximum quantity of water through the tunnel in Vaigai dam as requested in your letter. Currently, 2,300 cusecs of water is being drawn through the tunnel to Vaigai basin since 8.00 am today (Wednesday),” Stalin said. “The current water level is well within the storage level compliant with the upper rule levels approved by the CWC (Cauvery Water Commission).”Stalin said the state was monitoring the water level closely and officials are in constant touch with a team from Kerala. “I have discussed the above position with the concerned officials and have directed them to continue to closely monitor the water levels and regulate the outflow accordingly,” he said. “In addition, I have specifically asked them to share in advance, all the necessary information on water position and release, if any, so that your government can initiate such precautionary measures needed before the release of water.” The construction of the Mullaiperiyar dam started in the 1880s following a famine which is considered an engineering marvel. The dam was opened in 1895 but the waters and issues over the dam continue to be a dispute between Tamil Nadu and Kerala to this day.Stalin assured Vijayan that his government will ensure that the interests of both states and people are well safeguarded in an effort to strengthen the ties between the neighbouring states. “The government of Tamil Nadu and our people are very concerned about the floods and the resultant damages suffered by Kerala and its people in the last 10 days. I wish to assure you that we will stand with you during these difficult times and would extend any help that is needed for alleviating the sufferings of the people,” he said. “In this regard, I have already instructed the collectors of the border districts of our state to extend all help and ensure the supply of all items needed for flood relief.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-drawing-maximum-quantity-of-water-from-mullaperiyar-dam-stalin-replies-to-kerala-cm-vijayan-101635362499647.html

28-10-2021||India||Toll in Sivakasi firecracker shop blaze mounts to 7||The death toll in Tuesday’s fire accident at a firecracker shop in Tamil Nadu’s Kallakurichi district rose to seven on Wednesday, with recovery of the body of an 11-year-old boy. At least 10 people were injured in the accident.“We received the body of an 11-year-old boy around 3pm today (Wednesday). He was missing since yesterday (Tuesday). The boy happens to be the shopkeeper’s younger brother’s son. So that takes the toll to seven,” said Ziaul Haque, superintendent of police, Kallakurichi. The shopkeeper sustained burn injures and undergoing treatment at a hospital. Police are yet to take his statement.A video from the spot began circulating on the social media that shows a massive explosion turning the night sky into bright orange. The fire can be seen engulfing aerially with people shouting and sound of firecrackers bursting can be heard.Officials said the fire started at around 6.30 pm on Tuesday and it took 11.30 pm for big fires to be put out completely. “There was smouldering up to 4 am,” Haque said. “Three fire engines were continuously throwing water.”The accident happened in Sankarapuram in the district and the injured people, two of them are critical, are being treated at a government hospital in Kallakurichi.The firecracker shop has been having a license to sell fireworks for the past 10 years and it had also renewed the license this year. The shopkeeper stocked up the firecrackers on the first floor and sold them from the ground floor. He also sold grocery items from here which was his alternative business firecrackers were not in business.The fire broke out from here and quickly spread to an adjacent building where a mobile shop was functioning and the owner of this store has died. Opposite the building, two bystanders, who came to a tea stall, are also part of the casualties. The samples from the debris and shop have been sent for scientific analyses to ascertain the cause of the fire.As of now authorities suspect that an electric short circuit could have caused the fire which spread quickly due to firecrackers being stocked one up the other.Public works minister EV Velu visited those being treated in the hospital and later told reporters that all district authorities have been instructed to ensure safety protocols in sale of firecrackers. “The government is being careful that such accidents shouldn’t occur again,” the minister said.Chief minister MK Stalin offered a compensation of ₹5 lakh each for the victims and ₹1 lakh each for those in intensive care. “I was deeply saddened,” Stalin said in a tweet on Tuesday night. “I have ordered for the compensation to be sent from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund.”With a few weeks to go for Diwali, various shops have begun stocking up to sell firecrackers that are predominantly transported from Virudhunagar district’s Sivakasi - the manufacturing hub for firecrackers. This year fire accidents have been reported in Virudhunagar in licensed and illegal firecracker making units where mishaps while mixing chemicals have led to an explosion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/toll-in-sivakasi-firecracker-shop-blaze-mounts-to-7-101635362439326.html
28-10-2021||India||Kerala adoption row: Accused removed from CPI(M) posts||The ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) on Wednesday removed P S Jayachandran, a party leader accused of kidnapping his daughter’s newborn child and later handing it over to Kerala State Council for Child Welfare-run orphanage for adoption, from all party posts and committees, and announced a commission of inquiry on the matter. Jayachandran is a Peroorkada local committee member and a senior leader of the party trade union wing Centre for Indian Trade Unions. A party leader said that the local committee in Peroorkada took the decision on the direction of the district committee. “The CPI(M) is under pressure to take action against him (Jayachandran), but his contention that the party was aware of everything restrains it somehow. Since the case turned into a national issue, the party had to take strict action unmindful of its consequences,” another senior leader said. Two days ago, CPI (M) district secretary Anavoor Nagappan said the party had sought an explanation from Jayachandran, but he went missing. Jayachandran later said he was not absconding and attended some of the party functions.Anupama Chandran, the victim in the case, said the move is an eyewash and demanded a state committee-level probe into the missing child’s case. “Nothing will emerge if the case is investigated by the local committee. I want a high-level inquiry, and women leaders should be part of it,” she said in the state capital on Wednesday. Jayachandran was not available for comment. Earlier, he said the party was aware of everything, but it disowned him when issue took the national stage.A senior leader of the party, who did not want to be quoted, said further action will be taken against Jayachandran and officials of the Child Welfare Committee, who allegedly colluded with him in the adoption. A local court in the state capital will hear the anticipatory bail petitions filed by Jayachandran and five others on Thursday. Last Monday, a family court had stayed the adoption of the baby till Nov 1. In a police complaint filed last week, Anupama alleged that her father took away her newborn child and handed it over to a Kerala State Council for Child Welfare-run orphanage in the state capital after its birth last October. The child was reportedly given to a family from Andhra Pradesh in a hurry, flouting adoption rules, she claimed. But Jayachandran said he sent the baby to the government-run children’s home in Thiruvananthapuram with his daughter’s consent. Chandran signed on a stamp paper to that effect, he said, but the former said she did so under duress. Chandran’s one-day fast before the state secretariat on Saturday for her child attracted national attention. Many senior leaders of the CPI (M), including Politburo members Brinda Karat and M A Baby, decried inaction in her case. Despite the senior leaders’ intervention, the party failed to take action against him. The issue also figured prominently in the state assembly. Opposition leader V D Satheesan termed it an “honour kidnapping” while state health minister Veena George reiterated that all procedures were in place while the baby was given for adoption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-adoption-row-accused-removed-from-cpi-m-posts-101635362379200.html
28-10-2021||India||Sasikala’s rapprochement bid with AIADMK gathers steam||Expelled leader VK Sasikala’s attempts of a rapprochement with the AIADMK seem to be gathering steam. As a prelude to her statewide tour to meet her supporters, Sasikala on Wednesday attended the wedding of her nephew TTV Dhinakaran’s daughter in Thanjavur district. AIADMK’s coordinator O Panneerselvam’s younger brother O Raja also attended the reception before her. This comes at a time when Panneerselvam extended an olive branch to Sasikala by stating that the AIADMK’s leadership will discuss her re-induction much to the annoyance of the party that clarified she will not be taken in. This signalled that Sasikala could continue to count on Panneerselvam though he was the first to launch a rebellion against her in 2017 and for him also to have an option of merging with her while he continues to be sidelined by AIADMK’s co-coordinator Palaniswami. Though Panneerselvam and Palaniswami are jointly running the party following J Jayalalithaa’s death, the duo have often spared on various issues which is the widening space from which Sasikala is hoping to benefit especially given the AIADMK’s loss in the assembly election in May and the rural local body polls earlier this month. She has assured her supporters that she will bring the party together for its eventual victory. Ahead of the wedding reception, on Wednesday morning, Dhinakaran added to the voices supporting Sasikala’s re-entry by telling reporters that Panneerselvam’s statement on Sasikala’s re-entry is a fact. “OPS would usually speak calm and composed. What he said about Chinamma (Sasikala) is right,” Dhinakaran said in Thanjavur. After the AIADMK had expelled Sasikala and Dhinkaran in 2017, he floated the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhgam (AMMK) with his aunt’s supporters aiming to eventually reclaim the parent party. Dhinakaran added that the AMMK and its cadre would stand firm in this goal to establish the ‘real rule of Amma (Jayalalithaa) in Tamil Nadu. After dialling cadres of AMMK and AIADMK and assuring them of her return over several phone conversations, Sasikala will meet her supporters directly in Madurai and Ramanathapuram districts on Thursday and Friday. “It will be meetings without any speeches on a stage,” said a close aide of Sasikala. “On Friday, she will garland the statue of Muthuramalinga Thevar in Goripalayam in Madurai, then the statues of freedom fighters Maruthupandiar brothers in Teppakulam and then she will go to Pasumpon, the hometown of Muthuramalinga Thevar.”Focus on ThevarEvery year leaders cutting across political lines pay homage to Muthuramalinga Thevar whose hometown is in Pasumpon in Ramanathapuram district in southern Tamil Nadu which has a dominant presence of the Thevar community to which Sasikala and Panneerselvam belong. On October 30, on the leader’s 113th birth anniversary, tributes to his statue adorned with a gold armour will be paid by chief minister MK Stalin, Palaniswami and Panneerselvam.Sasikala will do the act a day earlier on Friday. It was a ritual which Jayalalithaa had followed too. Sasikala, who lived with Jayalalithaa for three decades in Chennai’s Poes Garden residence, had ensured the growth of this community by maneuvering their appointments to key posts. The community has in the past favoured the AIADMK in southern districts such as Madurai, Theni, Tirunelveli, Dindigul and Ramanathapuram. But with Sasikala out of the picture for four years and Palaniswami nurtured his community--the Gounder within the party-- as he rose higher within the party to consolidate his position. With such caste equations in play, including the 10.5% internal quota for the Vanniyar community that Palaniswami announced while he was chief minister before the model code of conduct came into effect in February, has made Panneerselvam play a tricky role. He couldn’t have been seen upsetting the Thevar community by going hard at Sasikala so he did make similar statements in favour of her return before elections in March. Fissures in the AIADMKA leader close to Panneerselvam said channels of communication have been open between him and Sasikala. “We don’t know if the cadre and public will accept her (Sasikala). When the party is functioning well as an opposition we don’t know why this confusion keeps cropping up,” the leader said on condition of anonymity. Senior leaders in the party have begun to take sides. While Palaniswami said Sasikala was doing things out of boredom and she will have no place in the party, spokesperson D Jayakumar and the deputy coordinator KP Munusamy too reiterated that AIADMK has already passed a resolution that no one from the party can have a truck with Sasikala which Panneerselvam has signed. Veteran leader JCD Prabhakar, however, told reporters on Wednesday that the leaders shouldn’t be speaking out against each other. “There is nothing wrong with the interview that OPS gave. Everyone’s wish is for the party to remain united,” said Prabhakar.Sasikala has had several plans since her release in February from Bengaluru prison where she served a four-year team in the disproportionate assets case. While Sasikala briefly held the reins of the party after Jayalalithaa’s death and her move to become chief minister was cut short with the Supreme Court convicting her in the case, she wanted to pick up from where she left but the party had vastly changed while she was in jail. Palaniswami, whom she handpicked to be chief minister in her absence, staunchly stonewalled her. Political analysts say Sasikala is trying for a breakthrough. “Sasikala is doing what she should be doing,” says political commentator Ramu Manivanann. “But things are not going the way she expects so she’s finding it difficult. She expects OPS to be more loyal and open but he won’t go with her unless he can secure a greater strength. Her idea is to take control of the party and bring Dhinakaran in. She won’t do business with anyone else. For this, she has to go the hard way, mobilise people in the south as she is going to because she doesn’t have support in the north and western districts. My view is that the AIADMK leadership requires a transition. EPS and OPS have just been stonewalling one another.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sasikalas-rapprochement-bid-with-aiadmk-gathers-steam-101635362319342.html
28-10-2021||India||Some nations trying to seek more control in Indo-Pacific region, says navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh||NEW DELHI: Navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh on Wednesday said some countries were applying “land-centric territorial mindset” attempting to seek greater domination and control in the Indo-Pacific region, in a veiled reference to China’s aggressive moves in the South China Sea where it has long-standing sovereignty disputes with several counties such as Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. In his address at the Indo-Pacific Regional Dialogue 2021, Singh said the reinterpretation of accepted conventions was turning “the global commons into contested seas.” “As the basic precepts of a maritime Indo-Pacific are challenged, competition in the Indo-Pacific is also becoming more diverse, involving levers of diplomacy, commerce, ideology, values, science and technology; apart from the military,” the navy chief said, calling the region the centre-of-gravity of global geopolitics and economics. He said day-to-day competition for “influence, leverage and geostrategic space” was increasingly being witnessed in the Indo-Pacific, which houses 61% of the global population, contributes to 62% of global gross domestic product (GDP) and encompasses 63% of the world’s island nations. Singh said nearly 50% of global trade passed through the Indo-Pacific, and most nations within and beyond the region, had a core interest in keeping it free for commerce. “Which is also why concepts such as like-minded partners, free and open seas, have gained greater currency, concurrent with the growing relevance of the idea of Indo-Pacific,” he added. India is keeping tabs on Chinese moves in the South China Sea and taking steps to ensure that the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) doesn’t muscle its way into the Indian Ocean where combat-ready Indian warships are carrying out round-the-clock surveillance for any unusual activity, as previously reported. From carrying out naval drills with like-minded countries to reaching out to states in the Indian Ocean region, the Indian Navy is focusing on checking China’s rising ambitions in the region and sending out a strong message that Beijing’s power play in South China Sea cannot be replicated in the Indian Ocean. China claims almost 90% of the South China Sea. “Indo-Pacific brings with it attendant and evolving challenges where the rules of the game are changing…As competition becomes more intense in the Indo-Pacific, the value of cooperation will become even more, and not less, significant,” Singh said, stressing on the need to uphold the rules-based system. India is a key player in the region with its warships deployed from as far as the Persian Gulf to the Malacca Strait and northern Bay of Bengal to the southeast coast of Africa. India, the US, Japan, and Australia concluded the Malabar naval drills in the Bay of Bengal earlier this month. Beijing has been wary of the Quadrilateral security dialogue or Quad that was revived in late 2017 by the four countries, and upgraded to the ministerial level in 2019. India is determined to protect its maritime interests while supporting the rules-based international order mandated under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), defence minister Rajnath Singh said in his keynote address at the Indo-Pacific Regional Dialogue 2021. “India is committed to respecting the rights of all nations as laid down in UNCLOS. We are fully determined to protect the legitimate rights and interests of our country in relation to our territorial waters and the exclusive economic zone,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/some-nations-trying-to-seek-more-control-in-indo-pacific-region-says-navy-chief-admiral-karambir-singh-101635362139340.html

In Bettiah in West Champaran, there are historical buildings of kings. We have a hospital and medical college named after Maharani Janki Kuwar. In the vicinity of the campus, we plan to start a light and sound show over the king’s palace. The project is ready and it should materialize soon once we get funds from the Centre under the Prasad scheme. This will be a great boost to tourism at a time we are looking to attract more tourists as the pandemic situation improves.”Prasad said that the state government plans to popularise Mahatma Gandhi’s legacy at Champaran and how he got the title of Mahatma from Bihar.Under the PRASHAD scheme, the state has received ₹650 crore so far for tourism purposes. While some of the funds have already been utilized, work is underway on a few projects.“Around 650 crore was allocated in the previous budget. In the upcoming budget, we will be seeking further funds for improving tourism at Champaran and Valmiki Nagar... We also request UNESCO to invest in Bihar. They will receive all support from us,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/httourism-conclave-bihar-likely-to-seek-additional-funds-for-infrastructure-work-says-minister-101635361599527.html
28-10-2021||India||HT Tourism Conclave: Chhattisgarh looks to promote tourism in Bastar region||Promoting tribal tourism and placing the Maoist-hot bed of Bastar region on the world tourism map is one of the key focuses of the Chhattisgarh government, state tourism board chief Atal Shrivasatva said on Wednesday.Speaking at the HT Tourism Conclave on Wednesday, Shrivasatva, said the state government aims to promote tribal tourism in Bastar and other similar areas which comprises around 32 percent of tribal population.“Bastar is known for its unexplored natural beauty... To encourage tourism in the region, we have developed tribal tourist circuits and ethnic resorts. We are also focusing on the food and culture of Bastar region in districts like Jagdalpur and Sukma. The Chhattisgarh government is presently focusing on the tribal tourist circuit of Bastar to woo tourists,” Shrivasatva said, adding that tribal-dominated divisions like Surguja are also on the tribal tourism map.There is a misconception that Bastar is a strife-torn place as Maoists never hurt tourists or common people, he said.“The Maoists are in ideological war with security forces and the government, not with tourists or common man. Hence, it is only a misconception that Chhattisgarh is violence-ridden state. Everyone should visit the state,” Shrivasatva said.“I feel that in Chhattisgarh, we have a lot of opportunities to enhance and improve the tourism sector within the state. As they say, ‘Prakriti ka Gadh Chhattisgarh’, and we are certainly working to realise it to its fullest. We have developed land banks which we will lease out for 10 years to 30 years and the leaseholder will have free hand to do the constructions with government permission,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-tourism-conclave-chhattisgarh-looks-to-promote-tourism-in-bastar-region-101635361420944.html
28-10-2021||India||HT Tourism Conclave: Uttarakhand eyes sustainable development||The demand for homestays in Uttarakhand has substantially increased since the Covid-19 pandemic, prompting the state government to take additional measures to promote them, officials in the state tourism department said.The state is also working on policies to promote sustainable tourism and ensure safety of tourists, the officials added.Speaking at the two-day Hindustan Times Tourism Conclave in Delhi, Yugal Kishore Pant, additional CEO, Uttarakhand tourism, said while the state government has been promoting homestays for the past five to six years, its demand has increased after the pandemic.“After the pandemic, the demand for homestays has increased leaps and bounds. Now, people have started avoiding crowded places... they are avoiding bigger cities. People are exploring newer or lesser-known destinations. Another major change has been that people have stopped travelling in bigger groups,” he said.According to the state’s tourism department, the number of registered homestays has increased from 1,500 to 3,500 in the past two years.With a relaxation in pandemic curbs, the state has been witnessing a considerable increase in the number of tourists in the past few months.As part of its plan to promote homestays, Uttarakhand, which is largely dependent on tourism for its revenue, has been providing financial assistance and training to its people.Vivek Singh Chauhan, additional director, Uttarakhand tourism, said: “We are not only providing them with financial assistance but also imparting training in hospitality and marketing their facilities.”At the event, Pant also spoke about the impact of climate change on tourism in the state.“The impact of climate change is felt in Uttarakhand, just like other cities in the world. Our focus now is on sustainable tourism and development of the region. We are ensuring that all rules and regulations are being followed; no violations are being tolerated,” he said.Unprecedented rainfall recently claimed at least 40 lives in Uttarakhand. More than 500 people were killed in the 2013 flash floods in Kedarnath, prompting the state government to take a series of measures to minimise impact of natural disasters. The deaths of at least 17 trekkers in the last two weeks in Uttarakhand has also pushed the state government to develop a policy to regulate the activity.“We will not put any restrictions on trekking but provide details about the region, the type of equipment one should carry for trekking, precautionary measures that should be taken, etc,” Singh said.With the tourism sector slowly picking pace, the state government is hopeful of economic recovery.With close to five lakh people employed in the tourism and related sectors, Pant said it will take six months to a year for hotels to run in full capacity.“By the end of this year, our entire population will be fully vaccinated,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/httourism-conclave-uttarakhand-eyes-sustainable-development-101635361059504.html
28-10-2021||India||Cases registered, forces deployed after mosque, shops vandalised in Tripura: Cops||Hours after a mosque, few houses and shops were vandalised at Panisagar area in Tripura on Tuesday evening, police registered two complaints and imposed prohibitory orders in a few areas, a senior police officer said on Wednesday, adding that no arrest was made till late evening.“We have deployed security personnel in the area. There is no report of any untoward incident till now. The local administration has imposed Section 144 (CrPC) at Panisagar and Dharmanagar sub-divisions,” said North Tripura district superintendent of police (SP) Bhanupada Chakraborty. On Wednesday, administration conducted peace meetings in various sensitive areas of the district.According to the police, a protest rally was organised by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) in Panisagar area on Tuesday evening. A section of protesting VHP members allegedly vandalised a mosque at Chamtilla and then moved towards Rowa Bazar, nearly 800 yards away. There, they allegedly ransacked three houses, as many shops and set two shops on fire in Panisagar sub-division, police added.Rowa Bazar is nearly 40 km from India-Bangladesh international border. Soon after the incident, Panisagar sub-divisional police officer Souvik Dey said there was no report of anyone getting injured.Tripura police also issued a clarification on Twitter, saying: “Certain persons by using fake social media IDs are spreading fake news/rumours on Tripura. It is informed that law & order situation in the State is absolutely normal.”“During yesterday’s protest rally in Panisagar, North Tripura, no masjid was burnt and the pictures being shared of burning or damaged masjid or collection of sticks etc are all fake and are not from Tripura. They may be of some countries.”Former chief minister and senior Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Manik Sarkar on Wednesday said the VHP had organised a few protest rallies in different parts of Tripura against the violence during Durga Puja in Bangladesh. “Few provocative programmes including one at Chamtilla in Panisagar happened, which is condemnable. I appeal to all sections of people to maintain ancient communal unity and integrity. I also request police and administration to take active role on incidents.”Spokesperson of ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Nabendu Bhattacharya said, “The percentage of minority in our state is very less and therefore, there should not be any chance of communal violence. We believe that the CPI(M) has a role behind such violent incidents. Their agenda is to create unrest in the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cases-registered-forces-deployed-after-mosque-shops-vandalised-in-tripurapolice-101635360879160.html

At the Hindustan Times Tourism Conclave in the national capital, Abhinav Parmar, project management coordinator of Jharkhand Tourism Development Corporation, said the department is currently focussing on two Centre-sponsored schemes, mainly the Eco-tourism and Prasad scheme.“The Prasad scheme basically aims at uplifting infrastructure in the entire Deoghar district, which is home to the famous Baba Baidyanath Temple. Lakhs of devotees flock to the temple during the Shrawani Mela. We are also focussing on other religious centres like Basukinath and Parasnath,” Parmar said.On the eco-tourism front, Parmar said: “We are taking six destinations under eco-tourism development.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/httourism-conclave-jharkhand-focuses-on-eco-tourism-giving-facelift-to-temple-town-101635360700966.html
28-10-2021||India||Rahul Gandhi to meet fishermen, people hit due to mining shutdown on Goa visit||Senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi will interact with fishermen and with those affected by the mining shutdown during his day-long visit to Goa on Saturday, Congress president of the state unit Girish Chodankar said on Wednesday. The Congress leader who will visit the state barely days after West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee makes her maiden visit to Goa, will also interact with state Congress workers in a bid to ‘energise’ them ahead of the upcoming polls. “Rahul Gandhi will interact with fishermen at Velsao (a coastal village) as well as with the people who will be affected by the railway doubling project (that passes through the same village),” Chodankar said. “Gandhi will also interact with people affected due to closure of mining in the capital city later in the afternoon before heading for a meeting with Congress workers,” Chodankar said. Rahul Gandhi’s visit comes at a time when the party is keen to send out a message to its detractors that the high command takes the upcoming Goa assembly elections seriously and that it is best placed to take on the BJP in the upcoming polls. The Congress is facing competition in the opposition space with the Trinamool Congress now joining the Aam Aadmi Party and existing regional parties like the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party and the Goa Forward Party to take on the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-to-meet-fishermen-people-hit-due-to-mining-shutdown-on-goa-visit-101635360459351.html
28-10-2021||India||Tushar Gandhi moves Gujarat HC against plans to revamp Sabarmati ashram||Mahatma Gandhi’s great-grandson Tushar Gandhi has filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in the Gujarat High Court challenging the state government’s Sabarmati Ashram redevelopment project.The PIL, filed recently, is likely to come up for hearing post-Diwali vacation.The government proposes to redevelop the Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad, a place closely associated with Mahatma Gandhi and India’s freedom struggle, as a world-class tourist attraction spread over 54 acres of land by bringing together 48 existing heritage properties located nearby.On Wednesday, Tushar Gandhi, the son of Arun Gandhi, whose father Mani Lal was the Mahatma’s third son, said in the PIL he has challenged the government’s ₹1,200-crore Gandhi Ashram Memorial and Precinct Development Project because it goes against the wishes and philosophy of the Father of the Nation.He said the Gujarat government has been made a respondent in the PIL along with all the six trusts that take care of various activities of the Sabarmati Ashram as well as the Gandhi Smarak Nidhi -- a charitable trust formed to further activities associated with Mahatma Gandhi -- and also the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) and others associated with the project.“We have raised questions before these trusts as to why they are not fulfilling their responsibility?” said Tushar Gandhi, a writer and social worker.The state should not be allowed to interfere as the constitution of Gandhi Smarak Nidhi says Bapu’s Ashram and memorials should be kept away from government and political influences, he said.When the Gandhi Smarak Nidhi was formed, not a single penny was taken from the government during its initial years. Later, amendments were made to allow for funds from the government to take care of Gandhi monuments, but the role of the state was limited to be that of a funding agency with no right to carry out anything on its own, Tushar Gandhi said.“This is the first time that the government has asked the trusts to step back and let it do all the work. The government has even formed its own trust for the same. We believe the trust formed by the government will become whole and sole for Sabarmati, and other trusts will be made redundant,” he said.He said the petition also raises the issue of spending an amount of ₹1,200 crore as not being justified in the present circumstances.The project envisages developing the Ashram the way it existed during the time of Mahatma Gandhi when it was spread over 35 to 40 acres with 63 heritage properties, 48 of which are still standing.The sprawling premises, also called the Gandhi Ashram, served as Mahatma Gandhi’s residence for several years from where he carried out major political and social activities during the independence movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tushar-gandhi-moves-gujarat-hc-against-plans-to-revamp-sabarmati-ashram-101635360339233.html
28-10-2021||India||India could lose 1.8 to 3.4% of GDP by 2050 due to decline in rice and wheat yields||The G20 countries including the wealthiest like US, European countries, Australia will bear extreme impacts of climate change significantly denting their economies by 2050’s a new report from the Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change (CMCC) said on Thursday.In India, declines in rice and wheat yields due to climate change could lead to economic losses between 43 and 81 billion EUR (or 1.8-3.4% of GDP) by 2050. Without any improvement in coastal protection or infrastructure, in a low emissions scenario projected asset or infrastructure losses can amount to 121.5 billion EUR by mid-century and by 157.3 billion EUR in a high emission scenario.Expected annual damages from riverine flooding by 2050 are estimated to be 376.4 billion EUR under a low emissions scenario and rise to 585.6 billion EUR under a high emissions scenario.The authors of the Atlas refer to three scenarios which are three different development pathways with different levels of greenhouse gas emissions—low, medium, and high. The report comes two days ahead of the G20 summit in Rome on October 30 and 31.Apart from economic losses in India, quality of life and health is likely to be severely impacted, the Atlas has highlighted. Under a low emissions scenario (emissions are substantially lower than in present) projected temperature variations will remain contained under 1.5 degree C, both by 2050 and 2100. But by 2050 under a high emission scenario average temperature could rise to 2 degree C and over 1.3 degree C if there is marginal reduction in emissions or a medium emission pathway. Between 2036 and 2065, maximum temperature of the warmest month in India could rise by at least 1.2 degree C in a medium emission pathway and by over 1.7 degree C in a business-as-usual or high emission scenario.Annual rainfall is likely to record a steep increase by 2050 with an 8% to 19.3% increase in all emission scenarios. India's marine exclusive economic zone (EEZ) has mostly warm coastal waters with a mosaic of ecosystems such as coral reefs, backwaters, mangroves, and seagrasses meadows which makes it particularly vulnerable suggests the Atlas. Sea surface temperatures will increase by over 1.2 to 1.5 degree C by 2050 wile Ph levels, chlorophyll, oxygen levels in marine EEZ will reduce substantially in all emission scenarios. Chlorophyll is an indicator of the biomass available at the base of the marine food web supporting all ecosystem productivity.Fish catch is also likely to reduce by 8.8% to 17.1% by 2050. Under a medium emissions scenario, the population exposed to the annual coastal flood level is expected to increase from 17 million to 21 million by 2050, the report underlined.Epidemiological risks from dengue and Zika will increase due to future climate change in India. Under a medium emissions scenario, 98.1% of the population will be at risk of transmission-suitable mean temperatures for dengue by 2050, whereas 97% will be at risk under a high emissions scenario. In the case of Zika, 97.2% of the population will be at risk by 2050 under medium emissions.“Among the G20, India is lagging behind in the process of transformation of its energy sector; in particular, the country is at the bottom of the ranking for what regards the ‘Efficiency’ composite, which takes into account transmission and distribution losses of the electricity grid, the level of energy intensity of the economy and the access to clean cooking services,” the Atlas said.The research shows that rising temperatures and intense heat waves could cause severe droughts and deadly fires. “Heatwaves could last at least ten times longer in all G20 countries, with heatwaves in Argentina, Brazil and Indonesia lasting over 60 times longer by 2050…in Australia, bushfires, coastal floods and hurricanes could raise insurance costs and reduce property values by $611 billion AUD by 2050,” a statement from CMCC said. In Europe, deaths from extreme heat could rise from 2,700 per year to 90,000 each year by 2100 on a high emissions pathway.The report finds that without urgent action to reduce carbon emissions, GDP losses due to climate damage in G20 countries increase each year, rising to at least 4% annually by 2050.CMCC uses an ensemble of Global Circulation Model (GCM) data as those included in the fifth Climate Model Intercomparison Project for its projections.Donatella Spano of CMCC, who coordinated the report, said “From droughts, heatwaves and sea level rise, to dwindling food supplies and threats to tourism – these findings show how severely climate change will hit the world's biggest economies, unless we act now. As scientists, we know that only rapid action to tackle emissions and adapt to climate change will limit the severe impacts of climate change. At the upcoming summit, we invite G20 governments to listen to the science and put the world on a path to a better, fairer and more stable future.”"This is a very exhaustive report on what would happen with climate change over India. These results are very similar to ministry of earth sciences' climate change report released last year. But they (CMCC) have gone ahead with impacts analysis. The impacts are very adverse. Even with lower emission scenarios impact could be very severe. All countries should commit to reducing GHG emissions. India’s efforts alone will not help. Probably COP 26 Could be our last chance to save our planet. Hope there will be a consensus by developed countries for reducing fossil fuel emissions. I suggest MOEFCC should take up very detailed impact analysis with IPCC sixth assessment results," said M Rajeevan,former secretary, ministry of earth sciences responding to the findings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-could-lose-1-8-to-3-4-of-gdp-by-2050-due-to-decline-in-rice-and-wheat-yields-101635360100658.html
28-10-2021||India||Talks with China to resolve border crisis to continue: Rajnath Singh||Dialogue with China for a peaceful resolution of the border crisis in Ladakh will continue with Indian troops standing firm in the sensitive sector, defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Wednesday as the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is seen to have stepped up its activities not only in the Ladakh area but also in the eastern sector, including Arunachal Pradesh.He made the comments on the situation along the northern borders while addressing the army brass in the national capital during the ongoing commanders’ conference, which is focused on a raft of issues -- the border developments are right at the top.“It is our national responsibility to ensure availability of best weapons, equipment and clothing to our troops braving extreme weather and hostile forces to defend our territorial integrity,” he said.India and China have been locked in a border standoff for over 17 months in the Ladakh sector, and in the midst of that row, the PLA has scaled up its military activities in the east.China’s forces have intensified patrolling in sensitive areas across the contested border in Arunachal Pradesh, and have ramped up area domination patrols for surveillance and orientation of newly inducted troops with a noticeable increase in visits by senior PLA officers, HT reported on Tuesday.The sectors across which the Indian Army has detected PLA’s increased operational tempo include Lungro La, Zimithang and Bum La -- areas of high historical significance in the context of Chinese aggression in the eastern sector -- and counter measures have been taken to boost India’s readiness to handle any contingency.The 13th round of military talks between India and China to cool tensions in Ladakh reached an impasse on October 10, with PLA not agreeing to suggestions made by the Indian Army.The military dialogue took place more than two months after the last round of talks that had led to disengagement of forward deployed troops from Gogra, or Patrol Point-17A, in early August.Despite two rounds of disengagement at friction points this year, the two armies still have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each deployed in the Union territory of Ladakh.The bi-annual army commanders’ conference is focusing on several issues including the situation along the country’s borders, security scenario in Jammu and Kashmir, organisational restructuring, logistics, administration and human resource management, the defence ministry said in a statement.Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane is chairing the four-day conference that ends on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/talks-with-china-to-resolve-border-crisis-to-continue-rajnath-101635359500655.html
28-10-2021||India||COP26: PMO holds meet amid calls for India to up target||Ahead of the Glasgow climate change conference (COP26), the Prime Minister’s Office on Wednesday held a lengthy inter-ministerial meeting on India’s position at the summit, an official aware of the development said.The inter-ministerial meeting was represented by officials of most ministries, including power, new and renewable energy, earth sciences, finance and agriculture, among others.Normally, the Union Cabinet approves India’s stance at climate negotiations, which is then presented and negotiated during the conference of parties. This time, however, the PMO held a meeting to discuss what India’s stance should be at COP26.“Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself will be travelling to the summit, the Cabinet approval was not needed. It was decided that India will not be an outlier,” said a senior official who attended the meeting. The official did not divulge details of what transpired at the high-level meeting.“We cannot give any more details at the moment but it was discussed at length as to what is possible for India respecting various principles of the Paris Agreement,” the official cited above said. “It was a very lengthy meeting. Unusual but all issues related to the negotiations were discussed. Just two days back, the environment minister, Bhupender Yadav, spoke with US special presidential envoy on climate John Kerry, where the minister said that India’s contribution will be communicated to the world at an appropriate time and place,” the official added.He acknowledged that there was a lot of diplomatic pressure on India to make a strong submission at COP 26. “Many foreign delegates who visited us have cajoled us to commit to a net zero target. The options are still open; I would say that no particular decision was arrived at but the options have been discussed,” the official said.Ahead of the Glasgow COP26, its president Alok Sharma said he expects India to incorporate a 450 GW renewable energy- by- 2030 target in the nationally determined contribution (NDC) it will submit.In a press conference organised by Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of journalists and newsrooms, on Tuesday, Sharma said every country starts with a different energy mix but India’s informal goal of 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030 should be formalised in its NDC before COP26. “That’s what I told Indian officials and ministers when I was there,” he said.Sharma didn’t directly respond to a question on whether developed countries would agree to advanced net zero targets to make room for developing countries like India to grow. “That is a discussion that has been raised with me when I was in Delhi in the past and CBDR [common but differentiated responsibilities] is part of the Paris Agreement. My consistent message to every country is that we all need to play our part,” he said, before referring to the 450 GW target again. “I am impressed with the target of 450 GW. What I wanted is for that to be reflected in the NDC. I will be the first person to welcome that loudly if that happens.”At least 120 world leaders, including PM Modi, are likely to attend the summit at COP26 on November 1 and 2. Chinese President Xi Jinping hasn’t confirmed his presence but a negotiating team from China will be present, Sharma said.“Glasgow will be more challenging than Paris. Our overarching ambition is to say at the end of Glasgow that we have kept 1.5 degree Celsius alive,” Sharma said. There is likely to be an agreement at the end of Glasgow which will be a result of two weeks’ of negotiations to say how the world plans to keep global warming under 1.5°C.Most experts agree that the target of keeping global warming to a maximum of 1.5°C over pre-industrial levels has most likely been missed for good.There is no confirmation on what India’s submission at COP26 is likely to be.A 14-to-15-member delegation with officials from the ministries of power, finance, earth sciences, agriculture, new and renewable energy, environment, and water will represent India at COP26. It will be headed by environment minister Yadav. India’s lead climate negotiator is joint secretary in the environment ministry, Richa Sharma.PM Modi is likely to be in Glasgow till November 2 when he and UK PM Boris Johnson are expected to make a joint statement on the Green Grids Initiative – One Sun One World One Grid’ (GGIOSOWOG) at COP 26. GGIOSOWOG will bring technical, financial and research cooperation to help facilitate cross-border renewable energy transfer projects according to the International Solar Alliance. Yadav is expected to lead India during the negotiations in the second week when several issues related to the Paris Rulebook — a set of guidelines for implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement are likely to be debated.While not commenting on whether India will present an updated nationally determined contribution (NDC) ahead of COP26, officials said: “It is not mandatory for India to update its NDC. It can update it during the global stocktaking in 2023. Whatever India announces will be on a voluntary basis.” According to them, “Developed countries have been pushing India to announce a net zero emissions target. But for us our position is clear — action has to be taken based on historical responsibility which means they (developed countries) transition to net zero emissions first leaving carbon space for us to grow.”India will push for climate justice and equity and contribution based on historical responsibility during negotiations with a similar stand as 24 other like-minded developing countries (LMDCs), including China.Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, announced plans to reach zero-net emissions by 2060 at the Saudi Green Initiative on Saturday. The UAE, on October 7, became the first Gulf state to commit to net zero emissions by 2050. Russia and China have also announced plans to transition to net zero by 2060. According to the UN, 130 countries have already set or are considering a net zero emissions target by mid-century. According to the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a non-profit organisation on energy and climate change issues in the UK, a net zero commitment by 2060 is under discussion in India.“Net zero for a later date is on the platter as an option,” a senior environment ministry official said last week.“India should announce an enhanced NDC not because of its responsibility or contribution to the greenhouse gas emissions; but because it is in our best interest. For us climate action is for co-benefit,” said Sunita Narain, director general, Centre for Science and Environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cop26-pmo-holds-meet-amid-calls-for-india-to-up-target-101635359201284.html
28-10-2021||India||‘Can’t give free pass’: SC panel to probe Pegasus||The Supreme Court on Wednesday set up a three-member expert committee, to be supervised by a retired judge of the court, RV Raveendran, to investigate whether the Centre or any state government acquired and used Israeli spyware Pegasus for surveillance of Indian citizens, and to also ascertain details of people targeted.The top court held that the Union government cannot get “a free pass every time” by raising the spectre of “national security” when the issues concern the “potential chilling effect” on right to privacy and freedom of speech. It referred to the lack of a “specific denial” by the government and also its reluctance to file a “detailed affidavit”.Engaging the services of some well-known experts in the field of computer science, cybersecurity and digital forensics, a bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana asserted that “in a democratic country governed by the rule of law, indiscriminate spying on individuals cannot be allowed except with sufficient statutory safeguards, by following the procedure established by law under the Constitution”.
28-10-2021||India||India applies for $2bn loan from AIIB, ADB for vaccine purchase||India has applied for a $2 billion loan from Asian multilateral development banks to purchase around 700 million Covid-19 vaccines as it looks to boost the immunisation rate of the country’s eligible population.Officials in New Delhi aware of the plan said it was not an unusual practice and was meant to leverage India’s membership of multilateral financing institutions as many countries do.The Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Manila are expected to soon process India’s loan request, which will be used to purchase 667 million Covid-19 jabs to vaccinate at least 317 million people in 19 states across the country.“The ADB has agreed to finance $1.5 billion and AIIB will supplement (it) with another $500 million. The vaccines will be purchased (by India) under a competitive process,” DJ Pandian, AIIB vice president for Investment Operations, said in Beijing on Tuesday.The Indian government will put in some $58 million for the project.“The project will support procurement of safe and effective vaccines against Covid-19,” an AIIB project summary says, adding that it will be implemented under ADB’s APVAX, or Asia-Pacific Vaccine Access Facility, mechanism. The finance ministry did not respond to an email query on this matter.A government official aware of the development said requesting anonymity, “Multilateral agencies have been always providing low-cost funds to their members, particularly developing countries for various developmental projects.“For example, ADB has set up about a $9 billion vaccine initiative, known as Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility (APVAX), which offers equitable support to its developing member countries in procuring Covid-19 vaccines.“It is meant for all eligible members, including India. Like any other country, India also gets multilateral fundings for various developmental projects, including funds for healthcare”.“Cost of multilateral funding is usually very low, which helps governments to save on their borrowing costs. It is part of the government’s overall resource mobilisation strategy,” this person added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-applies-for-2bn-loan-from-aiib-adb-for-covid-vaccine-purchase-101635358720671.html
28-10-2021||India||Agra: Three J&K students held for ‘anti-national’ slogans after India-Pak match||Three engineering students from Kashmir, booked for allegedly raising ‘anti-national’ slogans after the India-Pakistan match in T20 World Cup on October 24, were arrested on Wednesday evening after Agra police registered a first information report (FIR) against them, a senior police officer said.“Three of the Kashmiri students from Bichpuri campus of Raja Balwant Singh (RBS) Engineering College in Agra were arrested on Wednesday evening. A case has been registered against all three at Jagdishpura police station under sections 153A (Promoting enmity and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), 505(1)(b) (inducing to commit an offence against the state or against the public tranquility) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) besides Section 66F (Cyber Terrorism) of the Information Technology (Amended) Act, 2008,” said PK Singh, inspector in-charge of Jagdispura police station.The case was registered based on a complaint from Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) leader Gaurav Rajawat, who alleged that the three engineering students had raised “anti-national” slogans and praised Pakistan after India lost to the neighbouring country in their opening match of the T20 World Cup on Sunday.The RBS Engineering College in Agra suspended the three students from College Hostel on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-j-k-students-held-for-anti-national-slogans-after-india-pak-match-101635358179039.html
28-10-2021||India||India focused on free and open Indo-Pacific: PM Modi at East Asia Summit||India is focused on a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific and the principle of the centrality of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in the region, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told an annual summit of 18 regional nations on Wednesday.While addressing the virtual East Asia Summit, Modi also emphasised the importance of resilient global value chains and proposed the idea of developing global standards for cyber security, people familiar with matter said on condition of anonymity.He reiterated India’s commitment to providing vaccines sponsored by the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad to Indo-Pacific countries, and recalled India’s support of $1 million to the ASEAN Covid-19 Recovery Fund.“Reaffirmed India’s focus on a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific and the principle of ASEAN Centrality in the region,” Modi tweeted after addressing the meeting held on the margins of the annual ASEAN Summit under the presidency of Brunei.“India remains committed to strengthening respect for shared values of multilateralism, rules-based international order, international law and sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations,” he said in another tweet.Though the prime minister did not name any country in his tweet, his remarks were an apparent reference to China’s aggressive behaviour across the region, including its territorial disputes with several ASEAN members in the South China Sea.The East Asia Summit was joined by the leaders of ASEAN states and other participating countries such as Australia, China, Japan, South Korea, Russia and the US. The external affairs ministry described the discussions between Modi and the other leaders at the summit as a “fruitful exchange of views”.Modi highlighted India’s efforts to fight the pandemic through vaccines and medical supplies and spoke about the “Atmanirbhar Bharat” campaign for post-pandemic recovery and in ensuring resilient global value chains. The virtual summit also discussed important regional and international issues, including terrorism, the situation in the South China Sea, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and the situation in North Korea and Myanmar. Modi also highlighted the synergies between the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific and India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative.The summit adopted three statements on mental health, economic recovery through tourism and sustainable recovery, which were co-sponsored by India. This was the first time since 2017 that a US president attended the summit, part of three-day high-level meetings hosted by Brunei.Hassanal Bolkiah, the sultan and prime minister of Brunei, said vaccination is key to overcoming the pandemic and called for cooperation among members of summit to ensure vaccines are affordable and accessible across the region. In this context, he noted that several participating countries are among the top Covid-19 vaccine producers and account for more than 70% of global production.Modi will also participate in the ASEAN-India Summit on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-focused-on-free-and-open-indo-pacific-pm-modi-at-east-asia-summit-101635358118997.html

Demanding the withdrawal of the notification extending the jurisdiction of the BSF from 15 km to 50 km along the International Border, Channi said, “If the Centre does not withdraw its notification on the BSF range, we will be forced to stop it by November 8.”“We will also be moving the Supreme Court if nothing is done,” the CM added.On Tuesday, the chief minister convened an all-party meeting on the issue, which was attended by the representatives of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), besides the ruling Congress. However, the Bharatiya Janata Party boycotted the meeting, saying there was no conflict between BSF and Punjab Police.Senior BJP leader Manoranjan Kalia said, “The BSF is a concurrent list subject. Along with the BSF, Punjab Police can also carry out searches and register cases. Drones are used to smuggle weapons and drugs and to stop these illegal activities, BSF jurisdiction has been widened.”Announcing a slew of measures for the state industry ahead of the Progressive Punjab Investors Summit, 2021, Channi said the Cabinet has decided to abolish institutional tax, a long-pending demand of the industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-to-hold-special-house-session-to-oppose-bsf-order-101635358060252.html
28-10-2021||India||PM Modi changed ‘size and scale’ of govt schemes: Amit Shah||Union home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday hailed Narendra Modi as the most successful Prime Minister in the country after independence, saying he has changed the “size and scale” of government schemes that have impacted the lives of the poorest of the poor.“While drafting policies, he looked at the scale and decided that the schemes should be for all. Earlier, schemes were designed with a certain number of beneficiaries in mind, but he (Modi) said they should be for all,” Shah said, while addressing a conference on “Delivering Democracy: Reviewing two decades of Narendra Modi as head of government”, organised by a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-linked think tank, Rambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini.The home minister also took pot shots at the Opposition for accusing the government of copying their schemes. “The Congress says construction of toilets was their idea, but how many were built (during their time)? About 13 crore (130 million) were left to be made.” He used the schemes for construction of toilets and housing for all as a case in point to demonstrate the Modi government’s intent to benefit all sections.“A leader has to handle development, preserve and take forward the culture of the country and ensure security.

28-10-2021||India||‘Some nations trying to seek more control in Indo-Pacific region’: Navy chief||Navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh on Wednesday said some countries were applying “land-centric territorial mindset” attempting to seek greater domination and control in the Indo-Pacific region, in a veiled reference to China’s aggressive moves in the South China Sea where it has long-standing sovereignty disputes with several counties such as Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan.In his address at the Indo-Pacific Regional Dialogue 2021, Singh said the reinterpretation of accepted conventions was turning “the global commons into contested seas.”India is keeping tabs on Chinese moves in the South China Sea and taking steps to ensure that the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) doesn’t muscle its way into the Indian Ocean where combat-ready Indian warships are carrying out round-the-clock surveillance for any unusual activity, as previously reported.“As the basic precepts of a maritime Indo-Pacific are challenged, competition in the Indo-Pacific is also becoming more diverse, involving levers of diplomacy, commerce, ideology, values, science and technology; apart from the military,” the navy chief said, calling the region the centre-of-gravity of global geopolitics and economics.He said day-to-day competition for “influence, leverage and geostrategic space” was increasingly being witnessed in the Indo-Pacific, which houses 61% of the global population, contributes to 62% of global gross domestic product (GDP) and encompasses 63% of the world’s island nations.Singh said nearly 50% of global trade passed through the Indo-Pacific, and most nations within and beyond the region, had a core interest in keeping it free for commerce. “Which is also why concepts such as like-minded partners, free and open seas, have gained greater currency, concurrent with the growing relevance of the idea of Indo-Pacific,” he added.China claims almost 90% of the South China Sea.Meanwhile, defence minister Rajnath Singh in his keynote address at the Indo-Pacific Regional Dialogue 2021, said,“India is committed to respecting the rights of all nations as laid down in UNCLOS. We are fully determined to protect the legitimate rights and interests of our country in relation to our territorial waters and the exclusive economic zone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-veiled-reference-to-china-navy-chief-says-territorial-mindset-evident-in-indopacific-101635345278282.html

28-10-2021||Today's||At COP 26, India’s balancing act and dialogue on material support||The multilateral dialogue at the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26), aimed at limiting average global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, will be rooted in a heightened urgency for climate action. This urgency has been accelerated by the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, which identifies the need for climate action that requires a highly ambitious and unprecedented transformation of systems. In no uncertain terms, IPCC has stated that extreme weather, climate action failure and human-led environmental damage are going to be risks with the highest likelihood (of occurrence) and impact in the coming decade. There is a pre-COP26 consensus for a more aggressive era of climate action, which is the need of the hour. India has its heart in the right place when it comes to adapting to and mitigating the climate crisis. But it faces the challenge of achieving in parallel, its over-riding development priorities of eradicating hunger and poverty, and creating jobs; a vision of sustainable and inclusive development; and its climate action goals. In spite of India’s critical development concerns, its Paris commitments have translated into substantial climate action. India today ranks among the few countries on track to meet most of the climate commitments it made under the Paris Agreement. The country’s renewable expansion rate, among the world’s fastest, has translated into 100 GW of installed renewable capacity and is on track to a stated goal of 175 GW. There is an even more ambitious target — installed renewable capacity of 450 GW by 2030. The 450 GW target would mean that India would generate 60% of its electricity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030, well beyond the 40% target in its Paris pledge. Apart from renewable energy, the National Hydrogen Mission has placed green hydrogen at the core of India’s energy security, and could emerge as a strong alternative to address India’s energy needs.Other goals include land degradation neutrality and making Indian Railways a net-zero carbon emitter by 2030. In parallel, India has activated a far-reaching policy framework to support electric vehicles (EVs), indicating the government’s thrust in moving towards a low carbon transport system. With the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and EV (FAME I & FAME-II); Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes; enhancement of e-charging infrastructure; and reduction of Goods & Services Tax (GST) on EV purchases, this sector can play a significant role in India’s green narrative. India’s climate actions reflect that it is willing to go above and beyond its nationally determined contribution (NDC); in parallel, India has achieved significant milestones in poverty reduction, infrastructure development and health care access.In this context, India’s COP26 outlook can be seen as a balancing act between environmental sustainability and overall development. More importantly, there is strong merit in considering how dialogue at COP26 translates into material support for more sustainability efforts, at the Indian and the global level. This material support has four aspects.First, financial support for the scale of the transformation envisioned. Sufficient financial support can stimulate new clean energy initiatives, strengthen ongoing initiatives, and finance research and development and infrastructure that India needs to leapfrog to a cleaner energy pathway.Second, commitments from developed countries to increase technical and capacity-building support and cooperation. Investment in low-carbon technologies and innovation can help India accelerate its own actions and enhance its ambitions, including accelerating its EV transition journey, ramping up the net impact of India’s current and upcoming renewable assets, and creating feasible options for low/zero-carbon energy pathways.Third, commitments from all governments to scale up their ambition and put in place climate plans that keep 1.5 degrees Celsius within reach, thereby avoiding the worst impacts of the climate crisis and minimising the future cost of adapting to the crisis. Both issues directly impact India’s growth and development potential. And like every other nation, the challenge for India is about increasing its ambition.Finally, to build on India’s adaptation and resilience efforts by enhancing institutional, technological, and financial support and collaboration to leverage the power of nature-based solutions in addressing both climate and nature challenges. And, simultaneously, preserve, protect, and harness our natural assets, including our forests, water bodies and air, thereby leading India towards a low-carbon, climate-resilient future. This latter aspect is founded in an appreciation of India’s sizeable natural assets. For example, our 7,500-km coastline — comprising rich ecosystems with extensive mangroves, seaweed beds, salt marshes and coral reefs that provide essential ecosystem services — can be effectively leveraged for a sustainable ocean economy. About 250 million people reside within 50 km of India’s coast, many of whom depend on the sea for their livelihood. By absorbing heat and CO2, the oceans have so far lessened the effects of the climate crisis. But oceanic CO2 saturation will result in larger volumes of atmospheric emissions, while simultaneously threatening the marine ecosystem.For developing countries such as India, such material and institutional support will greatly enhance the pace of climate action. It will enable India to identify a pathway that balances national developmental needs with global climate priorities. It will also enable participating countries to identify how they can best help each other — and India — to accelerate the shift to a cleaner and greener world.

28-10-2021||Today's||Glasgow, climate, and why India must be the voice of the developing world||As expected, rich countries have now announced they cannot walk the talk — it was actually a formal commitment — to provide $100 billion a year as funding for emerging and poor economies to help mitigate the climate crisis. They have reset the deadline from 2020 to 2023, but, again, there is no guarantee as such. Not surprisingly, most in Asia, Africa and Latin America are hugely disappointed.
28-10-2021||Today's||Our future is at stake in Glasgow||When leaders meet in the United Kingdom (UK) for the 26th conference of parties (COP) to discuss the climate crisis, they do so knowing that this time and there is no going back on the need for urgent and drastic action to combat the crisis. We no longer need science to forecast the possibility of the impacts of a changing climate. We see it in our world – extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and intensity and devastating life and economy. So, what is the agenda for COP26?
28-10-2021||Today's||China’s hypersonic missile test won’t go unanswered||China’s recent hypersonic missile test has evoked undue surprise. Western powers, especially the United States (US), are in the grip of a Sputnik moment — a reference to the psychologically-arresting event when the Soviets launched the first artificial intelligence satellite in 1957. Sputnik itself should never have been treated as a tectonic event. Washington was not far from launching its own man-made satellite, which it promptly did with the Explorer 1 in January 1958; it, thereafter, successfully launched the first of the Corona series spy spacecraft in 1959.
28-10-2021||Editorials||Pegasus: Truth must come out||The Supreme Court of India has appointed a committee to investigate if any Indian agency procured and used the highly sophisticated spyware, Pegasus, to target citizens. Headed by a retired judge, the panel comprises members with domain knowledge of cybersecurity and intelligence. The Chief Justice of India-led bench has said that its objective was to balance the rights of the citizens and the powers of the State, which cannot be allowed “a free pass” by merely citing national security. To this end, the terms of reference and the choice of the experts are sound. The issue pertains to fundamental principles of the rule of law as well as security in an age when technology has complicated both domains.
28-10-2021||Editorials||Tripura: Act firmly against the trouble-makers||North Tripura district authorities imposed Section 144 in the Panisagar and Dharmanagar subdivisions on Wednesday to maintain “peace and harmony” after clashes erupted during a Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) rally on Tuesday. The VHP rally was organised to protest the recent violence against Hindus in Bangladesh. The decision to impose Section 144 was taken after a mosque was allegedly vandalised and several shops, reportedly owned by Muslims, were set ablaze in the district. On Thursday, the police said that fake social media accounts are being used to spread fake news and communally sensitive rumours, and action will be taken against those spreading rumours.The National Crime Records Bureau’s Crime in India 2020 report puts Tripura on top of all states in the Northeast in terms of political conflicts with 0.5% crimes per lakh people in the category against 0.1% in Arunachal Pradesh and zero cases of political conflict in the other states. Tripura, however, fared well in terms of communal and religious violence. The administration needs to keep a strict vigil so that this record remains untarnished.What happened in Bangladesh — temple vandalism and torching of Hindu homes — is unacceptable. But extremism of one kind must not lead to extremism of another kind. It is the duty of the Bangladesh government to crack down on violence and terror, and to its credit, the Sheikh Hasina government is taking strong steps to contain such violence. Similarly, the Tripura government must crack down on any elements disturbing communal peace because this majority versus minority violence can lead to an unending cycle of attacks and counter-attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/tripura-act-firmly-against-the-troublemakers-101635418425997.html
