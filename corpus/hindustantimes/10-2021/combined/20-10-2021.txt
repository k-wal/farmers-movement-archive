20-10-2021||Noida||Health camps, awareness drives for patients of respiratory diseases in Noida||Amid the rising air pollution in Gautam Budh Nagar, the district health department has appointed a nodal officer who has been tasked to hold health camps and awareness drives across the district and to maintain proper stock of medicines and medical equipment for people with lung diseases who are at a greater risk from air pollution.According to health officials, accredited social health activists (ASHAs) and auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) workers have been instructed to carry out awareness drives in rural areas.“The health workers will inform and educate patients at risk of aggravating respiratory illnesses like bronchitis and asthma on precautions to be taken by them in order to avoid air worsening conditions. Besides, people will be advised to wear eye protecting glasses in order to avoid allergic conjunctivitis,”said Dr Amit Kumar, nodal officer appointed for the purpose by the district health department.The officials said that since people working in industrial sectors are exposed to more pollutants, the health department will also hold health camps in those areas.“The health camps will be organised in the industrial areas for those at the risk of respiratory issues due to high concentration of pollutants in the air. Besides, awareness campaigns will also be carried out to inform the workers about preventive measures to be taken in order to avoid any health issues due to pollutants,” said Dr Kumar.The officials will also carry out inspections at government hospitals and health centres in the district to ensure availability of medicines and medical equipment. “During the inspections, we will ensure medicines required for treatment of patients of respiratory illnesses and equipment such as inhalers and nebulisers are in sufficient quantity,” he said.Dr Sunil Kumar Sharma, chief medical officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, said, “The health department has been tasked to take curative measures in case pollution levels in the district increase and respiratory issues among patients are reported. These are precautionary steps and no such cases have been reported so far.”On Wednesday, the air quality of Noida dipped to the ‘poor’ category. According to data from the Central Pollution Control Board, the air quality index (AQI) reading for Noida on Wednesday was 240 (‘poor’) against 79 (‘satisfactory’) a day earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/health-camps-awareness-drives-for-patients-of-respiratory-diseases-in-noida-101634754442560.html
20-10-2021||Delhi||Govt to get initial report of 7th Covid sero survey in Delhi on Monday||The preliminary results of the seventh round of the serological survey conducted in Delhi last month to estimate the population-level exposure to the Sars-CoV-2 virus (which causes Covid-19) are likely to be submitted to the state government on Monday, according to officials aware of the matter. “This round of the survey was conducted in great detail, so it will take some time to analyse the data. However, a preliminary report will be submitted on Monday. A more detailed report is likely to be submitted in early November, around Diwali,” said an official from Delhi’s health department who asked not to be named. Diwali this year will be celebrated on November 7.The complete report will also contain information about vaccine eagerness or hesitancy, which was among the “extensive list of questions” for which data was collected digitally during the survey, said the official. The government roped in three non-governmental organisations to help collect data during the survey. Sero surveys are blood tests that check for antibodies to a virus. They are a good measure of the exposure of a population to the pathogen. They are also a proxy for the level of broad immunity that exists in the population, although the best immunity is that achieved through vaccination.A portion of the samples collected will also be analysed for neutralising antibodies that specifically target the Sars-CoV-2 virus. This will help researchers correlate the level of IgG antibodies detected in semi-quantitative tests (which just show whether levels of an element are high or low) to the level of neutralising antibodies and thereby estimate the protection that a person has from the coronavirus disease. This will be the Delhi government’s first complete survey after the brutal fourth wave of infections, which saw the city add over 28,000 infections at its peak. The last round of the survey in Delhi in April was interrupted due to the emergence of the fourth wave. Just 13,000 samples were collected, instead of the 28,000 targetted. These samples, however, returned a reading of nearly 56%, which means 56 of every 100 residents of the Union territory were exposed to the virus. The previous five surveys returned readings of 56.13%, 25.5%, 25.1%, 29.1%, and 22.6% respectively.However, a study from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) that collected data at the peak of the second wave showed a seropositivity of 67% in Delhi. Further, a sero survey among staff members in the Council of Science and Industrial Research in Delhi showed a seroprevalence of 80% after the second wave. IgG antibodies, which the survey tests for, are developed around 10 to 14 days after the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-to-get-initial-report-of-7th-covid-sero-survey-in-delhi-on-monday-101634754322586.html

20-10-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Stretches of National Highway 9 turning into dumping sites, says NHAI||The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has said that several stretches of the National Highway 9 (NH-9) are slowly turning into dumping sites, and blamed the Ghaziabad municipal corporation for the dumping activity. Officials of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) said that they will start levying a penalty against the corporation for open dumping of solid waste if the civic body fails to address the issue as the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) is in effect in the district. Officials from the NHAI said that they have sent written communications to the district officials and the municipal corporation for the dumping at different underpasses, service roads and side lanes of the highway. “During a meeting held on Monday, We have intimated the issue to the district officials. The corporation officials were also present in the meeting. The garbage dumps were found near Kala Patthar, Khoda, Behrampur, Bamheta, Rauhl Vihar, Bagu and Mehrauli, among other locations. It has come to our knowledge that corporation staff are indulged in such practices as they do not have sufficient landfill sites,” said Mudit Garg, project director, NHAI. Garg further said that the NHAI is also facing encroachment issues in the form of shops and unauthorised stands for auto-rickshaws and buses on the highway. “All the issues have been communicated to departments concerned. On our part, we have prepared dozens of flex boards to send out messages that there should be no garbage dumping, no encroachments and no unauthorised stops on the highway. The issues are prevailing in phase 2 of the corridor and the boards will soon be put up at 15 different locations,” Garg added. The 19.8km phase 2 of NH-9 (including the Delhi-Meerut Expressway) starts from UP Gate and extends up to Dasna. The Ghaziabad municipal corporation denied any dumping of solid waste at the stretches along the highway, but said that the issue could be related to the old garbage collection centres on the service lanes. “We have shut down the garbage processing sites near Raj Nagar Extension and also at Muradnagar. So, there is a gap in processing of about 500 metric tonnes of solid waste (out of an estimated 1,200 metric tonnes generated every day). At present, we are focussing on resolving the issues at the Galand landfill site and a boundary wall is being constructed there. We will take the solid waste there for processing,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner. “As a result of the gap in processing, it may be possible that extra waste from the old garbage collection sites could have spread along the highway. We will get it cleaned up. As regards the garbage reported near Khoda, it is not our jurisdiction area,” Tanwar said. Meanwhile, the UPPCB officials said that they have clearly directed the agency to not dump garbage in open during the period when Grap is in effect. “Open dumping may result in fire incidents which will impact the air quality. We will start levying penalties against the corporation if it fails to check open dumping of waste in the city,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB, Ghaziabad.Ghaziabad traffic police officials said that they have taken up drives to remove encroachments. “We have earlier conducted anti-encroachment drives. We will conduct more drives and deal with squatters strictly,” said Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-stretches-of-national-highway-9-turning-into-dumping-sites-says-nhai-101634754144122.html
20-10-2021||Delhi||Over 900 sites in Delhi violating dust control norms, says CAQM||With an aim to control dust pollution in Delhi-NCR, the Commission for Air Quality Management in Delhi and Adjoining Areas (CAQM) intensified action against construction sites, with state monitoring teams inspecting over 6,500 sites, of which over 900 were found to be violating dust control norms, the CAQM said in a statement on Wednesday. The commission said dedicated teams were deployed in Delhi-NCR states to inspect construction and demolition sites ahead of the peak pollution season in the region. The inspection report showed that surprise checks and inspections at 6,596 construction and demolition sites were carried out, of which 963 sites were found to be non-compliant with various construction and demolition (C&D) waste management rules and dust mitigation measures, as stipulated by the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). “An amount of approximately ₹3.07 crore has been levied as environmental compensation charge on the defaulting agencies, besides orders for stoppage of work at 52 locations,” the commission said. The CAQM said between October 1 and October 15, 112 teams — 37 teams in Delhi, 30 in Haryana, 20 in Rajasthan, and 25 in eight NCR districts of Uttar Pradesh— were constituted and deployed to conduct on-field surprise checks of C&D sites alone. “During this period, 1,268 sites were inspected, of which around 1,017 C&D sites were in Delhi, 98 in Haryana, 89 in NCR districts of Rajasthan, and 64 sites were in the NCR area of Uttar Pradesh,” CAQM said. In Delhi, of the 1,017 C&D sites inspected, 712 were found complying with dust control measures while 305 sites were found flouting norms. All 98 C&D sites inspected in Haryana were found complying. Of the 89 C&D sites inspected in Rajasthan, 86 sites were found to be compliant, the commission said. Similarly, in the eight NCR districts of Uttar Pradesh, only five sites were not complying with the stipulated dust abatement measures while the remaining 59 were following all the prescribed norms, the commission said in its statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/over-900-sites-in-delhi-violating-dust-control-norms-says-caqm-101634754084235.html
20-10-2021||Noida||Air quality in Noida dips to ‘poor’ once again, rain likely on Oct 23||The air quality of the region nosedived from the satisfactory to the poor category on Wednesday. Weather forecasters predicted the city may receive rain in the next few days, that is likely to improve the AQI. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the AQI reading, on a scale of 0 to 500, for Noida on Wednesday was 240 against 79 a day earlier. Similarly, Ghaziabad’s AQI rose from 77 on Tuesday to 278 on Wednesday. The AQI of Greater Noida was 260 against 278 the previous day. An air quality index (AQI) reading between 101 and 200 is considered moderate, between 201 and 300 is considered poor, between 301 and 400 is considered very poor, and above 400 is considered severe.According to private weather forecasting centre Skymet, the region may soon see a light spell of rainfall. “A strong western disturbance is approaching, which may lead to heavy snowfall on the hills and rains in northern regions including Haryana, Punjab and North Rajasthan. This may also lead to rains in Delhi -NCR on October 23 and 24, that may change the direction of the wind and lead to a drop in temperatures,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the maximum and minimum temperature for Noida on Wednesday was 31.1 degrees Celsius while the minimum could not be recorded, against 30.1°C and 20.5°C a day earlier. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the biomass burning has increased and the air quality may drop if there are no rains. “Fire count is 746 and its share in PM2.5 is 12%. Fire emission from upwind region enhances PM2.5 concentration as winds are from the northwest region. Stubble burning share is likely to increase in next two days if there is no rain. The overall AQI is likely to further degrade in the next three days,” said a statement issued by SAFAR on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/air-quality-in-noida-dips-to-poor-once-again-rain-likely-on-oct-23-101634754083036.html

20-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Amid stubble trouble, MC’s own staff add to pollution by burning garbage||Amid rising concern over deteriorating air quality due to stubble burning, the illegal practice of burning dry leaves and organic waste is further adding to the pollution in the city even as the municipal corporation (MC) continues to remain in deep slumber.Apart from streets and roadsides, the illegal practice is also being witnessed in MC’s own parks and secondary dumping points where one can even sight plastic waste being burned, in violation of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) directions. The practice has also caused fire mishaps at several places, including the main dump site on Tajpur road.Residents have also been repeated raising the issue. Honey, a resident of Model Town Extension, says, “MC’s own sweepers can often be seen collecting the waste to one side of the road and setting it on fire. The practice leads to respiratory problems for residents. We have repeatedly asked the sweepers to stop the illegal practice and have also complained to their supervisors but to no avail.”As per the directions of the NGT and solid waste bylaws notified by the local bodies department, a fine ranging from ₹5,000 to ₹25,000 can be imposed on violators, depending on the amount of garbage/waste burned.Darshan Singh, another resident of Haibowal, said, “MC should also keep a check on burning of garbage on vacant plots. Garbage piles up on vacant plots as the owners don’t bother to clean it up and neighbours continue to dump waste in such places. After some time, the waste is burned which adds to the pollution.”MC health officer Dr Vipal Malhotra said directions have already been issued to the field staff to not burn waste, otherwise action will be taken against them. “No recent complaint has been received by the department in this regard, but regular checking is done to stop the practice,” said Malhotra.Despite repeated attempts, Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) chief engineer, Ludhiana, Gulshan Rai, was not available for comments.Body of engineers seeks imposition of penalty on MCThe council of engineers has also written to the chief secretary and principal secretary of the local bodies department to initiate action against erring MC officials. Citing incidents of burning of organic waste and garbage in the green belt near BRS Nagar, Canal Bridge and Subhash Nagar on Tuesday, the engineers’ body demanded that penalties should also be imposed on MC staff concerned.President Kapil Arora said, “MC staff is also involved in the illegal practice. If penalties can be imposed on residents, strict action should also be taken against officials. Burning garbage in the open causes severe damage to the environment while also troubling residents in nearby localities. Aged people and children are the most affected due to the smoke, as it leads to skin and respiratory problems.”“It has been categorically laid down by the Supreme Court that a clean environment is the fundamental right of citizens under Article 21 and it is the duty of the local bodies as well as the state to ensure that public health is preserved at all costs,” said Arora while adding that they will move the National Green Tribunal if authorities fail to take corrective steps in 15 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-amid-stubble-trouble-mc-s-own-staff-add-to-pollution-by-burning-garbage-101634753782490.html
20-10-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: His life with boxes||It’s six in the evening. He’s making boxes. He has been making boxes since 10 in the morning. In fact, he has been making boxes for 40 years. This 50-year-old man must be fed up of making boxes almost all his life.Jamal Khan laughs, bobbing his head up and down. He is sitting cross-legged on the floor in one corner of a little qabristan, or graveyard, tucked within Old Delhi’s appropriately named Mohalla Qabristan. He is surrounded by dozens of boxes he has made since the day began. “These aren’t of wood but of MDF,” he points out. The Diwali festival is approaching, he explains, saying that this is the busiest time of the year for him. “Most people exchange gifts on Diwali and they need the gift boxes.” The rest of the year remains sluggish “but somebody or the other is always in need of boxes.”Mr Khan inherited the profession from his late father, who arrived a lifetime ago in the Walled City from Allahabad in UP. “We first lived in Skakur ki Dandi, then we moved to Turkman Gate, and now I live with my wife and sons in Sheesh Mahal, behind Delite Cinema, which is 10 minutes walk away from here.” Mr Khan began assisting his father in box-making when he was just 10. “May be that’s the reason I don’t get fed up of my work. I never went to school, I never realised there could be other options in life, so I never felt discontented.”He is happy to report that he can’t say the same for his children. The sons are in school and most probably they won’t take up his work, he feels. “They will do what they will want to do,” observes Mr Khan as he concentratedly applies a coating of liquid gum on the surface of a box-in-progress. “When a supplier gives an order for big boxes, I end up making around 50 daily.” Today, the boxes he is making are relatively small and he has rustled out 150.As the twilight sky darkens further, Mr Khan gets up, turns on a lamp, and patiently sits down again. Preparing to give the finishing touch to a box, he suddenly raises his head as if struck by a novel argument. “But I can never be fed up of making boxes. This work has supported my family all these years, and the earnings help me educate my sons.”He now poses for a portrait, declaring he will leave for home some three hours later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-his-life-with-boxes-101634753642430.html

They demanded implementation of the Advocates Protection Act to ensure their safety.Rakesh Chaudhary, president, Awadh Bar Association, Lucknow high court, urged the state government to ensure security on all court premises across the state, on lines of the high court. The Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh had given a work boycott call in protest against the killing of lawyer Bhupendra Singh inside the court room of Additional District Judge, Shahjahanpur, on October 18. In response to the boycott call, lawyers of Lucknow high court, district court and all tribunals boycotted work. “There was a complete work boycott. We have demanded from the state government to implement the Advocates Protection Act to ensure protection of the legal fraternity,” said Sunil Dwivedi, president, Central Bar Association, district court, Lucknow. Dwivedi also demanded that security checks on the court premises be beefed up. “At all entry points in the district court proper checking must be carried out. Entry of unwarranted elements on the court campus must be stopped at any cost,” he added. ‘DFMD a showpiece at dist court’ The Door Frame Metal Detector (DFMD) installed at the entrance of the Lucknow district court (gate number three) is just a showpiece, lawyers said. “Police personnel deployed at gate number three at district court never check anyone. After the Shahjahanpur incident, there will be checking for a few days. Once the issue subsides, security personnel will again become careless,” said Rohit Kant, lawyer, district court.

20-10-2021||Noida||Three persons arrested for raising ‘Pakistan zindabad’ slogans in Noida||Three persons were arrested on Wednesday for allegedly raising “Pakistan zindabad” slogans during a religious procession in Noida’s Sector 8 on Tuesday night, on the occasion of Eid-e-Milad-un-Nabi, Prophet Muhammad’s birth anniversary. The arrests came after a video clip of the procession, in which people could be heard raising pro-Pakistan slogans, surfaced on social media on Wednesday, the Gautam Budh Nagar police said.Police identified the arrested suspects as Mohammad Zafar, Sameer Ali and Ali Raza, all residents of Sector 8. According to the police, they launched a probe after a purported 13-second video of the procession was widely shared on social media, in which a few people could be seen and heard raising pro-Pakistan slogans. The video clip also purportedly showed a group of people holding aloft some flags, including the tricolour, and marching with the rest of the crowd. Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, Gautam Budh Nagar, said the incident took place in Noida’s Sector 8. “In the video, a few people can be seen and heard chanting both ”Hindustan zindabad” and ”Pakistan zindabad”,” the DCP said. Soon after the clip surfaced, members of a few right-wing organisations on Wednesday protested at the Sector 20 police station demanding action against the people who took part in the procession. Uma Nandan Kaushik, zonal head, Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Noida, said, “Some people raised “Pakistan Zindabad” slogans during the procession. There were also some sensible people in the procession who stopped the group from raising this slogan. Someone captured the incident on mobile phone and shared the video with us. We then informed the police and demanded action against them,” he said. Mufti Mohammad Rashid Qasmi, imam of Jama Masjid in Noida’s Sector 8, said the procession had no connection with the mosque or its organising committee. “We were not part of the procession. We came to know that some people had organised the procession, which also had the permission of the police and the district administration. We do not know what happened in the procession,” he said. The police said the organisers had permission from them to take out the procession. “We took suo motu cognisance of the viral video and registered a case under Section 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence) at the Sector 20 police station. We have sent the video to an expert team for further investigation, although, prima facie, it appears that the video is genuine. We scanned the video and arrested three persons for their alleged involvement in the sloganeering,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/three-persons-arrested-for-raising-pakistan-zindabad-slogans-in-noida-101634753422573.html
20-10-2021||Noida||No offline classes for Gautam Buddha University’s first year students for now||With offline classes set to begin from Monday, officials of the Gautam Buddha University (GBU) have exempted first-year students from attending in-person classes as the number of students who have taken admission to its various undergraduate and post graduate courses for the academic session 2021-22 has exceeded the carrying capacity of the varsity . As per the Uttar Pradesh Gautam Buddha University Act of 2002, all registered students of the university have to mandatorily reside within the campus, said officials. “GBU is a residential university and therefore, all registered students have to be accommodated in the university’s hostels. After the Covid-19 outbreak last year, students were allowed to attend online classes from their homes,” said Dr Vishwas Tripathi, registrar of the university. Currently, the GBU has a capacity for 5,000 students at its 12 boys and six girls’ hostels. However, officials said, the strength of registered students at the university after admissions for the academic session 2021-22 will increase to approximately 6,500. The university will not have space to accommodate around 1,500 registered students. So far, around 1,000 students have taken admission for the 2021-22 academic session. “The university has introduced a number of new courses this year, such as MTech in Artificial Intelligence, MTech in railway signalling and some new certification courses, due to which admissions have increased here,” said Tripathi.From October 25, the university expects to welcome at least 3,500 students for offline classes as admissions for some courses will continue till October 30. “Officials are contemplating solutions to accommodate the extra number of registered students. In the meantime, first year students as well as international students have been exempted from offline classes. We will be welcoming other students from Monday,” said Tripathi.He added that either the university will have to construct a new hostel building or will have to make changes in the GBU Act to allow registered students to find accommodation elsewhere.“We will have to find a solution for all the registered students of the varsity to come for their offline classes. In the meantime, the hostels are ready for around 3,500 students who will take in-person lessons from Monday,” said Tripathi adding that the final decision will be taken in the academic council meeting of the university chaired by the vice-chancellor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/no-offline-classes-for-gautam-buddha-university-s-first-year-students-for-now-101634753364405.html
20-10-2021||Delhi||After row, Delhi Development Authority defends plan for eco-tourism at Sanjay Van||Following criticism from environmentalists and citizen groups, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has clarified that its proposal to develop an eco-tourism project at Sanjay Van is aimed at creating awareness and providing recreational facilities to people living near it.The DDA recently invited expression of interest (EOI) from companies to develop Sanjay Van in south Delhi, the 783-acre green lung of the national capital, as an ecotourism destination, with facilities for activities such as rock climbing, aerial trails (canopy tour or ziplines), forest safari, cycling, picnic and camping spots, among others.“Sanjay Van, an integral part of South Central Ridge, attracts tonnes of visitors for daily leisure activities. DDA’s current proposal of introducing activities related to nature based eco-tourism aims to create environmental awareness and recreation amidst a natural setting in an eco-friendly manner using locally available resources. The activities proposed, like rock climbing, forest leisure cycling, camping, star gazing activities, guided nature tour etc have been included keeping their nature of application and natural context,” read the statement by DDA.DDA official said that the purpose of EOI is to “encourage community participation to sensitise the public towards environmental awareness via knowledge dissemination through nature walks, educational tours etc”.The project will be developed on a public-private partnership, and a private concessionaire will have to develop and operate the proposed facilities, said a DDA official.The land-owning agency said that under the PPP model, the concessionaire will also ensure development, operations and maintenance, said a senior official.“The idea is to allow more and more users from different age groups to visit and appreciate this gem in the heart of the city. After careful site analysis, designated zones for each of the activity will be earmarked in areas already open to public with minimal or no intervention in the existing habitats. The intention is not to create a tourist spot in a natural forest but to give the opportunity to the public to feel connected with such natural heritage available in the domain of the urban fabric of the city of Delhi,” said a DDA official.DDA officials said they are not planning any major constructions in the area, since it is part of the Ridge, which is a reserved forest area where all non-forest activities are curtailed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/after-row-delhi-development-authority-defends-plan-for-eco-tourism-at-sanjay-van-101634753362463.html
20-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC orders govt to open ration shop in outer Delhi’s Baprola||The Delhi high court asked the Delhi government to open a fair price shop (FPS) in the vicinity of a residential complex at Baprola for the convenience of residents.“It is in the interest of the state to ensure that citizens do not have to chart their ways through difficult areas simply to get foodgrains at subsided prices,” justice Najmi Waziri said in an order dated October 12.The court was hearing a contempt plea by a petitioner who had moved court against the Delhi government’s non-compliance with a 2019 order, wherein the court asked the Delhi government to examine the feasibility of setting up the FPS in the vicinity of Rajiv Ratan Awas Yojana, Phase-2, Baprola.The petitioner contended that the FPS that served them was approximately 2.5km away from the residential area, and women had to walk through deserted stretches and forest areas simply to fetch ration.The Delhi government counsel told the court since there are only 320 ration card-holders in Rajiv Ratan Awas Yojana, Phase-2, Baprola, it may not be feasible for an FPS licensee to operate an FPS in the area.Ordinarily, each FPS caters to about 1,000 ration card-holders in an area, the counsel said.The petitioner’s counsel said that relaxation in guidelines for opening a new Public Distribution System (PDS) outlet can be considered in the case of Jhuggi Jhopdi (JJ) clusters and other areas inhabited by poorer sections of the society.The counsel added that over 800 families, mostly from the economically weaker section, are seeking an FPS in Rajiv Ratan Awas Yojana, Phase-2, Baprola.Noting the special facts and circumstances, the court said, “..it is appropriate that Delhi government open an FPS in the aforesaid place or in the immediate vicinity, as indicated hereinabove so that the poorest of the poor are served well by the state”.The matter will now be heard on December 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-orders-govt-to-open-ration-shop-in-outer-delhi-s-baprola-101634753064503.html
20-10-2021||Delhi||SDMC pulled up for asking cops to help clear encroachment in Delhi’s Rajouri Garden||The Delhi high court pulled up the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) for seeking police assistance to clear a religious encroachment (a gurdwara) allegedly being constructed in a Delhi Development Authority (DDA) residential complex at Rajouri Garden. It also fined the corporation ₹25,000 and said the civic body could either pay the fine or plant 200 tree saplings.Justice Najmi Waziri said that before seeking police assistance, the civic body should explain how the encroachment was permitted to come up in the first place.In an order dated September 29, justice Najmi Waziri, said that the “so-called inability of the municipal corporation (SDMC) to remove the encroachments because of lack of police assistance inevitably perpetuates an illegality, which [has come] up under the corporation’s own watch”.During a hearing on January 11, the counsel for DDA said the land-owning agency did not have any role in this situation as the maintenance of the residential complex had been handed over to SDMC.during a hearing on April 12, the counsel for SDMC told the court that the corporation had stopped the construction in January 2021, and scheduled its demolition in February but due to the non-availability of the requisite police force, the exercise was not carried out. He submitted that the demolition was rescheduled for April 16, 2021, following which the court asked the counsel to file a compliance affidavit before August 23, the next date of the hearing.However, on August 23, neither the counsel for DDA nor SDMC appeared in court.On September 29, the court noted that the compliance affidavit was not on record either.“The court would also note that none appeared for the SDMC or DDA on August 23, 2021,” the judge said.The court then fined the civic body to adjourn the case since the compliance affidavit was not on record. The judge also asked the corporation to fix responsibility for the lapse on the officer concerned.“The failure of the municipal corporation in discharging its statutory duties is ex facie causing immense public harassment and cannot be overlooked or condoned,” the court noted in its order.“For today’s adjournment, cost of ₹25,000 or supply of 200 trees, is imposed upon SDMC. Let the same be deposited with or supplied to the Deputy Conservator of Forests (South), GNCTD for plantation of trees along the NH-24 starting from Nizamuddin Bridge. The monies, if chosen to be deposited instead of the trees, shall be used for the purchase of trees from a government-owned nursery,” the order added.The court specified the type of trees that should be planted, adding that each tree must be two years old (minimum), its trunk must be six-foot-tall, it must bear a unique number tag, and its details must be entered in the Tree Census Register, indicating its approximate place of the plantation.The court asked the Delhi Conservator of Forest (DCF) and SDMC to file a compliance affidavit within four weeks with photographs of before and after the plantation.The court gave its order while hearing a plea by one Sourav Bose, who through his counsel Manu Nayar, contended that a religious organisation was constructing a gurdwara, adjacent to his property in the DDA residential housing colony, illegally.The plea said that the alleged construction of the gurdwara started in September last year within residential premises, which is a violation of the building bye-laws and the Master Plan.It also said that the illegal construction of the gurdwara on the ground floor in residential housing premises will attract innumerable visitors leading to residents’ safety and security being seriously jeopardised.“….it will be difficult to identify the visitors [who] will be moving in and out of the writ property, which will be a major security issue for the entire neighbourhood especially the petitioner residences as they are in close proximity to the writ property…,” the plea said.It contended that the peace and tranquillity of the entire area would be affected due to the songs and hymns that would be sung in the gurdwara.The matter will now be heard on December 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sdmc-pulled-up-for-asking-cops-to-help-clear-encroachment-in-delhi-s-rajouri-garden-101634753003708.html
20-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s street vendor survey extended by 2 more months, 71k identified in 1st phase||After several appeals and complaints by the street vendors’ associations and municipal councillors, the survey for identifying street vendors in the national capital has been extended by two more months and it will now end on December 7, 2021. The order issued by the Delhi government’s urban development department said many street vendors, who had gone to their home states during the Covid-19 lockdowns, are only now returning to the city weekly markets that had remained shut for a long time on account of the pandemic and have only recently started operating on a rotational basis. The Delhi government ordered the town vending committees to carry out the survey to identify all street vendors in the Capital in 2015, in line with the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014. The survey, which aims at identifying eligible street vendors and give them a legitimate status, began in January this year and concluded on September 30, 2021, and 71,371 vendors were identified in the exercise. The town vending committee is headed by the zonal deputy commissioner and has street vendors as its members. The National Association of Street Vendors (NASVI), however, argued that there are at least two lakh vendors in the city.The extension order issued by deputy director (local bodies) said hawkers and weekly market associations had submitted representations seeking an extension of the survey time period so as to identify more number of street vendors. “Two months additional time, from October 7 to December 7, 2021, has been granted to cover the areas which are either still not covered or partially covered,” the order issued separately on October 6 said.The urban development department has also raised the issue of publishing the details of the identified street vendors in the survey concluded on September 30. Of the 71,371 identified vendors, the local bodies have published the details of only 48,912 vendors. Richa Sinha, a spokesperson for NASVI, said that the association welcomes the extension of the survey period. “The survey process should be more dynamic in the extension period and it should include service providers like cobblers, cloth ironing persons etc., who were earlier left out. “The first part of survey also failed to capture the people carrying out street vending in deep pockets of residential neighbourhoods. The town vending committees should provide a window of time, after the conclusion of the survey in December, during which time vendors who have been left out can submit their applications,” she added. NASVI said the street vendors Act makes provision of vending space capacity with a proportion fixed at 2.5% of the city population, which puts the vending space capacity at around 5 lakh for Delhi.Many councillors have also alleged irregularities in the survey and the north corporation ordered a probe last week when abnormally high numbers of vendors were identified in Jahangir Puri ward.The north corporation has identified 5,912 vendors in City Sadar-Pahar Ganj zone, 4,018 in Karol Bagh, 2,861 in Civil Lines, 5,334 in Keshav Puram, 5,080 in Rohini, and 4,614 in Narela zone. Similarly, the south corporation has identified 8,140 street vendors in the central zone, 7,789 in south zone, 4,350 in west zone, and 3,672 in Najafgarh. The east corporation has found 10,039 vendors in Shahdara South zone and 9,604 in Shahdara North zone. Mayor Shyam Sunder Aggarwal said the civic body will make all efforts to cover the remaining vendors during the extension period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-street-vendor-survey-extended-by-2-more-months-71k-identified-in-1st-phase-101634753002484.html

20-10-2021||Delhi||CBSE to allow class 10, 12 students to change exam centres if they have moved cities||New Delhi: In order to address concerns of candidates who switched cities during Covid-19 crisis, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Wednesday said it will soon allow students of classes 10 and 12 to change their examination centre by submitting an application to their respective schools.“It has come to the notice of the Board that some students are still not in the city of their school where they had taken admission and are residing somewhere else. In view of the above, at an appropriate time, CBSE will inform students to make a request to their respective schools to change the city of their examination centre. Schools will follow instructions given by CBSE to forward the request to CBSE in an online system,” Controller of Examination Sanyam Bhardwaj said in a notice on Wednesday.CBSE asked students to follow updates on the board’s website. “As soon as the students are informed in this regard, they can make the request to their school within schedule which will be of short duration,” Bhardwaj stated in the circular, adding that no such requests will be accepted beyond the schedule.Last year too, the board had announced similar provisions though it couldn’t be put to use as the theory papers were cancelled due to the surge in cases during the second wave.Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, several families migrated back to their home towns and are yet to return due to lack of livelihood and other opportunities. Sukhbir Singh Yadav, president of the Delhi government principals’ association, said there are several students in many Delhi government schools who are yet to return to the Capital.“In my school, we have a handful of students who are yet to return to the city. School officials paid their examination fee and we are now counselling them to return to Delhi so that the children can at least appear for their board exams. Most of these students are from families who lost their livelihood in Covid and went back to their villages,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cbse-to-allow-class-10-12-students-to-change-exam-centres-if-they-have-moved-cities-101634752702928.html
20-10-2021||Delhi||Central Vista project: 160 entries for New India garden structure design||New Delhi: The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has received 160 entries for the design of the “iconic” structure proposed at the New India garden which will be developed on the Yamuna riverfront as part of the Central Vista project. The CPWD has also initiated the process to finalise an agency for the plantation and landscape work at the garden.According to CPWD officials, the garden is planned to commemorate India’s 75th year of independence and will be ready by August 15 next year.The CPWD, which is executing the Central Vista project, relaunched the design competition in July — the competition was first launched in November last year — in a bid to get more ideas for the iconic structure, which will be 134m in height.Close to 600 firms from across the country had registered for the competition. A senior CPWD official said, “We have received 160 entries on our portal and offline. A time limit to finalise the design can’t be given (right now).”The CPWD has received most entries from Maharashtra (24), Karnataka and Tamil Nadu (21 each), followed by Delhi (16), Uttar Pradesh (15) and Gujarat (13).Located near the Purana Qila, the New India garden will be spread over 25 acres on the western bank of the river and have infotainment facilities, a “sphere of unity”, a walkway, an exhibit titled “Journey of India”, a “tech dome” and an open-air theatre. The “iconic structure” is planned to “realise the grand vision of Aatmanirbhar Bharat”, as per the design brief by CPWD.Meanwhile, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), which is developing the Yamuna riverfront, is working on a plan to develop 90 hectares of area, opposite the New India Garden, on the eastern bank of Yamuna.DDA officials said that this is being done to ensure continuity in landscape work. “The land parcel is located right behind the Commonwealth Games village. As the area falls right opposite the New India Garden, we are planning to rope in the same agency which will be hired by CPWD for plantation to ensure continuity in design. We will soon finalise the agency,” said a senior DDA official.As the two land parcels are located on the banks of the river, environment activist Manoj Misra, convenor, Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, said, “It is illegal to construct on the floodplain. There are two court orders, one by NGT and the other by the Delhi high court in 2005. The Delhi high court order clearly states that no construction is allowed within 300m from the edge of the water.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/central-vista-project-160-entries-for-new-india-garden-structure-design-101634752522570.html
20-10-2021||Delhi||North MCD pushes for relaxed fire norms in Old Delhi schools||The North Delhi Municipal Corporation is pushing for relaxation in fire safety norms for special areas, especially in Old Delhi and Walled City, pointing out that the stringent norms with regard to road width will lead to closure of a large number of schools in these areas as they are located in narrow lanes and alleyways. Delhi Fire Services grants NOCs to only those schools located on roads wider than six metres -- a condition that is difficult to fulfil for many old Delhi establishments that are located in congested areas. The standing committee of the civic body has unanimously cleared a proposal asking the Directorate of Education and Delhi Fire Services to frame separate fire safety norms for special areas by keeping in mind local ground realities. The standing committee has also directed the municipal commissioner to not take action against schools until the new fire safety guidelines are framed for the Walled City.Chhail Bihari Goswami, the leader of the House, said that there are relaxations in terms of road and staircase width for guest houses in “special areas”, but similar rules do not apply to schools. “Special areas” comprise Old Delhi, Paharganj, Shahjahanabad and Walled City extension areas.“The town planning department of unified MCD had earmarked old and congested areas which were designated ‘special areas’ and relaxation in fire safety norms were provided to them. No fire safety regulations for schools in these areas had been framed by the education department at that time. The first set of rules came around 2005 which did not specify any road width, but in 2011 the road width was specified to be enough for fire safety vehicles to pass through,” the resolution cleared by the north civic body’s standing committee’s said.Goswami said that later the minimum road width was mandatorily fixed at six metres. “Now the fire safety NOCs are issued to only those schools which are situated on roads wider than 6m and because many schools in Old Delhi cannot follow this norm, they can never get a fire NOC. This can lead to the closure of all such schools unless different norms are prepared for schools in ‘special areas’,” Goswami said.He added that as a precautionary measure to prevent misuse of the anticipated relaxation in rules, the standing committee has asked the municipal commissioner to consider only those schools that received fire NOCs till three or four years ago.“We will not consider sites that have never got a fire NOC. Around 120-150 schools in the ‘special areas’ are likely to benefit in case of relaxation in norms,” Goswami said.The fire NOC issue is not only restricted to private and MCD-recognised schools but many municipal primary schools as well. Jai Prakash, former mayor and councillor from Sadar Bazar, said they have decided to shift some of the old schools located in narrow lanes to wider ones. “The number of children in schools in the area has also gone down as the commercialisation has increased and the residential proportion of the population has decreased. We have decided to shift and merge the municipal primary schools in Deputy Ganj, Roshanara and Gali Pahiya Wali. Old municipal schools are located in narrow lanes and the issue of fire NOC also hangs over them,” he added.A senior Delhi Fire Services official said that the issue of wide access roads for fire NOCs exists mainly in the Walled City areas and urban villages. “Schools in places such as Chawri Bazar, Ajmeri Gate have been operating before the building and fire safety norms were framed. Many started operations even before Independence. Such schools should follow the rest of the fire safety norms, create emergency exits, keep fire safety equipment etc..” the official said.The official added that the primary clearance requirement for a fire NOC is access to fire tenders. “The purpose of a fire NOC is to save lives. The new fire safety norms were issued based on Supreme Court orders after the Kumbakonam fire case,” the official said.On July 16, 2004, 94 students in the primary section were burnt to death in a school in Kumbakonam in Thanjavur district of Tamil Nadu, after which fire safety norms in schools came under the scanner.RC Jain, the president of Delhi State Public School Management Association, said that it was a good idea to make the separate provisions for areas like the Walled City. “The issue of fire safety was first raised in 2006 while the road width factor was considered much later. There are so many schools which existed in these areas much before these norms were framed. The road width norms have only led to harassment of school managements. We should incorporate innovative solutions to improve fire safety in these areas, such as having a common water tank or using the staircases of adjacent buildings as fire exits,” Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/north-mcd-pushes-for-relaxed-fire-norms-in-old-delhi-schools-101634752464551.html

The state higher education department announced colleges would reopen from October 20 in the state. Several prominent colleges like Fergusson College, S P College and others started offline lectures, while colleges like Modern College remained shut. The Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) issued detailed guidelines regarding opening up of college campuses, students safety and most importantly, that only students with both vaccination doses would be allowed in classrooms for lectures. “Though we have received the SPPU guidelines about college reopening, we have not yet started college for students. It will most probably start after Diwali vacations. By then all other safety related arrangements would also be complete. We are going to start college lectures in a phase-wise manner and have informed students to take both doses of the vaccination,” said the principal of one college, speaking anonymously. “We have not yet started any of the offline classes as there are no clear guidelines given from the SPPU or the state higher education department. The students will be called in a phase-wise manner, initially for practical classes and later on actual classroom lectures will start. But offline lectures would start after Diwali and not immediately,” said Shamakant Deshmukh, vice-principal of Modern College of Commerce, Arts and Science, Shivajinagar. “ None of the classes will be held online. We are following all the Covid protocols given by the state government. iIt will take a month for things to be streamlined.

20-10-2021||Delhi||Three arrested for stabbing 24-year-old woman to death in south Delhi||New Delhi: A day after a 24-year-old woman was stabbed to death in the south Delhi’s Bindapur, Delhi police arrested three men for the crime on Wednesday.Police suspect that the woman, who knew the three men and was at a birthday party with them, turned down repeated proposals for a relationship by one of them, following which he allegedly stabbed her on Tuesday morning.Police said that around 2.15 am on Tuesday, cops on patrol duty were informed by a food delivery agent that a girl was lying heavily injured in a narrow street near Gurdwara Sewa Simran in Uttam Nagar. Immediately after this, the ERV staff reached the spot and immediately informed the police station staff regarding the same.The police rushed the girl, identified as Dolly Babber, who had sustained stab wounds, to Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital where she was declared dead on arrival. Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Shankar Choudhary said that a case was registered under IPC section 302 (murder) at Bindapur police station and six teams were formed to crack the case.During investigation, it was ascertained that at around 11.30pm, Babber had gone to attend a birthday party along with the suspects -- Ankit Gaba (24), who supplied cosmetic goods to medical stores, and Himanshu (20) and Manish Sharma (28), who were both jobless.“All the CCTV cameras installed in the vicinity were analysed and a local enquiry was conducted... Prima facie it has been revealed that the woman was known to all these men and in the evening preceding the incident, they were partying together on the terrace of an under-construction building in front of the gurdwara. During the party, a heated argument took place between Ankit and Dolly over some personal issues, following which Ankit stabbed her,” said the DCP.Police said that Ankit had allegedly been trying to get into a relationship with her though she kept declining his proposals.After the incident, the three suspects fled on foot to Vikas Nagar in Uttam Nagar area and then took an autorickshaw to Anand Vihar. Since they did not find any bus for Chandigarh, they then went to Anand Vihar ISBTin a different autorickshaw. They reportedly took a bus heading to Chandigarh and then to Patiala and later returned to Delhi the same day.Police received information that Himanshu and Manish were hiding in Dwarka Mod area, from where they were apprehended, and based on their information, Ankit was picked up from Sector 23 in Dwarka. Police said they also recovered the knife used to commit the offence allegedly from the suspects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/three-arrested-for-stabbing-24-year-old-woman-to-death-in-south-delhi-101634752343850.html

The motto of this project is ‘No one sleeps hungry in Lucknow’, mayor Sanyukta Bhatia said.“We approached Akshaya Patra with a scheme to feed all the poor and hungry in Lucknow and they agreed to prepare the food for the poor in their kitchen. Everybody knows that Akshaya Patra has the best kitchen facilities and they prepare food in the most hygienic way.“The food supplied will be of the highest quality as it will pass through a strict quality control process. Experts of Akshaya Patra and LMC will do a daily quality inspection according to norms of Food Safety Standards Act 2006 (FSSA),” the mayor said.“Anusuiya’s Kitchen started operating at the King George’s Medical University where we distributed food to more than 5,000 people on Tuesday,” she added.Initially, for a month, no one will be charged for food but in the days to come LMC will charge ₹10 per thali. The LMC will also increase food distribution points. Food will be distributed at all the major hospitals and important places like Avadh crossing, Charbagh, Alambagh, Aminabad and Chowk.Municipal commissioner Ajay Dwivedi said, “The cost of a thali is around ₹25. However, the LMC will charge only ₹10 from people. The remaining ₹15 will be paid by LMC to Akashaya Patra.”He added, “After Covid-19, LMC started its own community kitchens and served food to more than one lakh people daily. After that we were receiving a number of requests to start such food service again that’s why LMC tied up with Akshaya Patra to provide hygienic food services to Lucknowites.

The SAD added this was needed as it was the high command that had imposed Amarinder on Punjab and the Congress for more than five decades including over nine years as CM.“Even you (Randhawa) have a lot of explaining to do for remaining Amarinder’s most-trusted aide during these years. We know Capt refused your request for a meeting four days ago. Please share what has happened in these four days to reveal Amarinder’s anti-national, traitorous character,” senior SAD leader Maheshinder Grewal said. He added, “You are the state’s home minister now. If you seriously believe that as CM Amarinder was a traitor and was indulging in anti-national activities through proximity with Aroosa Alam, a Pakistani, then act against him and book him on charges of conspiring against the country with a Pakistani agent. You should explain why you kept spending long evenings and nights with Amarinder and Aroosa.” Grewal alleged that Randhawa was the biggest confidant and the biggest executioner of Amarinder’s plans. “Now that those plans have been exposed, you want to convince us that you were not a part of his crimes. Even today, Captain Sandeep Sandhu, the main adviser of Amarinder, shared space with you in today’s press conference,” he alleged, adding that perhaps Randhawa forgot to hide his association with people close to Amarinder even today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/allegations-against-amarinder-prove-sincerity-by-breaking-ties-with-cong-high-command-sad-to-randhawa-101634752282489.html
20-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Police pulls down 45,000 objectionable posts from social media, registers 12 FIRs||Social Media Lab (SML) of the Mumbai Police in the past one year initiated action against 45,000 highly provocative, hateful, sensitive and objectionable posts from various social media platforms and got 26,825 of those posts either blocked or deleted. Blocking or deleting the remaining objectionable posts is still under process. The lab has also registered 12 first information reports (FIR) at various police stations in Mumbai against people found spreading rumours during the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) or National Register of Citizens (NRC) agitations, Covid-19 pandemic, and against those who were spreading religious rifts in society, spreading anti-police sentiments and terror threatening messages in the past two years. A police officer said during this period, 41,081 inflammatory posts were found to be communal in nature and many had the potential of triggering communal unrest. “Other 1,820 posts were related to terrorism or extreme acts (videos and posts showing terrorists beheading people, content promoting terrorists activities etc.),” the officer added. The police during the digital scanning of various platforms also detected a large number of posts containing gross misinformation, fake news and rumours related to Covid-19 and pulled down 1,855 such posts from the digital space. The task is carried out by the SML of the special branch-1 (SB-1) which is entrusted with the duty of conducting digital patrolling. “Terrorist, anti-nationals and anti-social elements have extended their area of functioning and reach. For terror activities and spreading their web, they use cyberspace, cyber technologies, advanced computers, networks and social media. Our social media lab acted against such content online and got them blocked or deleted, following due procedure of law,” said a deputy commissioner of police (DCP) rank officer. The lab keeps 24×7 vigil on digital platforms, keep surveillance on the online activities of people who might incite or drive others into communal violence, anti-government activities, anti-social activities, etc. thus creating unrest in the city and its peripherals. The lab’s functioning involves timely identifying potential trouble makers, detecting inflammatory contents/posts and getting them blocked with the help of the service providers, ensuring that it is stopped at a very early stage and do not spread or get viral. Officers at the intelligence wing have also observed a significant dip in a number of objectionable content, fake news, rumours and hate messages being uploaded on social media platforms in the recent past. Last year (up to September 2020) the social media lab had identified nearly 35,700 objectionable posts that had the potential of triggering untoward incidents. This year, till September the number of objectionable and provocative posts declined to 31,292. Officers posted at the social media lab attributes the decline to major service providers adopting the more serious approach in dealing with such content. “Now major service providers such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and YouTube respond to police requests for taking down certain objectionable or inflammatory posts comparatively in lesser time. With the introduction of the new IT Rules by the Central government, service providers have started keeping stringent checks on objectionable content online and service providers are now voluntarily taking action on such content,” said another SML officer. And now as netizens are also much aware that their account can be blocked or deactivated for a lifetime, they refrain from uploading objectionable posts after receiving the first warning from the service providers, the officers at the lab added. “Besides keeping an eye on those who could disturb communal harmony or peace, policemen at the Social Media Lab also protect women from social media bullying, cyberstalking, phishing profiles, cyber fraudsters, fake matrimonial profiles, etc. Online miscreants’ posts defamatory material about women and out staff at the lab search and block such defamatory material, thus preventing online crimes against women,” said an IPS officer.The state cyber police too detected 10,067 objectionable posts and got nearly 5,000 of them blocked or deleted during the past one year. The process of pulling down the rest of the objectionable posts is underway, said an officer. How it’s done: A team of 25 highly trained, technologically sound, multilingual police personnel work in three shifts to keep an eye on various social media platforms 24x7. The SML members search for objectionable content on the internet by putting keywords like terrorism, jihad, attacks, names of radical groups or individuals, etc. The online activity on popular platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, etc. is scanned with the help of advanced computer programs and tools. These programs also detect terror messages in Arabic, said a police officer, requesting anonymity. When some problematic content is identified by the Social Media Lab (SML), it is referred to either the additional commissioner of police or the deputy commissioner of police of Special Branch, who in turn approve the post for sending a request to the concerned service provider under section 91 of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and request them to remove or block the content. “The service providers do not accept all our requests, as they adhere to their local laws. But, in cases related to terrorism or any other emergency, they usually accept our request and promptly remove the content from their platforms immediately. They also follow a verification process before taking down the content,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-pulls-down-45-000-objectionable-posts-from-social-media-registers-12-firs-101634751802456.html
20-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s SGNP to get wildlife forensic laboratory by March 2022||A proposed wildlife forensic laboratory at Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), which will be equipped to carry out DNA analysis of animals, based on swab and scat samples, is expected to become operational by March 2022 after a considerable delay, Maharashtra’s chief wildlife warden has said. The lab will be set up along the lines of a similar facility scheduled to be inaugurated in Nagpur this week, on October 22, by the police department. This development, which has now been integrated into the Maharashtra State Wildlife Action Plan 2031 (sanctioned by the chief minister during a State Board for Wildlife meeting last week), has been pending since 2019 when the state forest department first proposed a dedicated facility for wildlife forensics in Mumbai. Sunil Limaye, Maharashtra’s chief wildlife warden, said that such forensic capabilities have so far been lacking across the state, where wildlife crimes and conflict are both par for the course. “The wildlife forensic laboratory at Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), equipped to carry out DNA analysis of animals, will be operational by March 2022. At the moment, whenever we need to conduct any forensic analysis of swabs or scat samples, we send them to labs in Jabalpur or Hyderabad. The process can take months and is a major impediment toward resolving wildlife crime and conflict cases. With our own facilities, we can create a database of vulnerable animals through scat samples. This can come in handy later. Say there is a poaching case where some animal parts have been recovered, or some tiger or leopard has attacked a human, we can identify the concerned animal in a matter of days and respond appropriately,” Limaye said, emphasizing that such a facility would lead to faster resolution of conflict and perhaps faster conviction in case of wildlife crimes. SGNP officials have already identified a location within the park premises for setting up the laboratory, which will be done at an approximate budget of ₹3.5 crore. “We are in process of acquiring the funds,” Limaye added. The laboratory’s expenses are expected to be met from the park’s annual public ledger. The laboratory will be able to cater to the needs of wildlife monitoring teams not just from Mumbai, but from across western Maharashtra and also from other adjoining states, such as Gujarat and Karnataka, which are home to vulnerable animals such as Asiatic lions and black panthers. In addition to the forensic lab, a second priority project for the wildlife department under the Maharashtra State Wildlife Action Plan includes creating a comprehensive database of all wildlife crimes in Mumbai (and across other territorial forest ranges in the state) over the last 10 years by December. “We have already started work on this over the last month. While poaching and killing of wildlife, particularly terrestrial mammals like tigers, was found to be the most predominant crime in eastern Maharashtra, in Mumbai and the Konkan region it is possession and trafficking of protected reptiles and birds, like sand boas, monitor lizards and even marine animals like turtles. We have enlisted the help of the Wildlife Trust of India and the Kerala forest department in creating this database as they have been working on a similar initiative in Kerala for the past five years, which will allow us to monitor the progress of individual cases of wildlife crime. At the moment the data is scattered across range offices and we do not have a centralized database. We have already established dedicated wildlife crime control cells, one each in Nagpur and Mumbai, for whom this database will prove extremely useful,” said Pandurang Pakhale, assistant conservator of forests, who is leading this exercise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-sgnp-to-get-wildlife-forensic-laboratory-by-march-2022-101634751682453.html

The duo had revealed the names of the main drug suppliers in Mumbai. The ANC kept a watch on them through a network of its informants. Recently, the agency got a tip-off about a major consignment delivered in Mumbai.Police inspector Lata Sutar of the Ghatkopar ANC unit laid a trap and arrested Shaikh from Sion Koliwada area. After search police seized a total 7.2 kilograms of heroin worth ₹21.60 crore from her, added Nalawade. She revealed during interrogation that she had procured the contraband material from two residents of Naugama in Pratapgarh district. She was arrested in 2015 by the Ghatkopar ANC unit with 50 grams of heroin and had served one year in jail. She was again arrested by the Worli unit in 2018 with 25 grams of heroin and spent 10 months in prison, added Nalawade. “Shaikh sold drugs through her network of 10 regular peddlers. She revealed that her supplier from Rajasthan use a new person with a new mobile phone to deliver drugs in the city. The drugs come by train and bus, and they keep the contraband in one compartment and book tickets adjoining compartment to avoid getting caught with the consignment,” Nalawade added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/woman-from-sion-koliwada-arrested-with-heroin-worth-21-60-crore-101634751623694.html

The structures, located in wards 13, 15, 16 and 22, all under Zone 1, were commercial and residential buildings, including a few that were under construction.“A team of enforcement wing officials sealed 16 illegal structures in areas such as Gandhi Nagar, New Colony area, Krishna Colony and Saraswati Enclave. The drive was conducted on Wednesday afternoon without any major resistance or untoward action,” SS Rohilla, public relations officer (PRO), MCG, said.MCG officials said the sealing drive was conducted on the instruction of MCG’s Zone 1 joint commissioner, Sumit Kumar. “Prior to the sealing, notices were issued to all 16 building owners to present official documents to show if they had carried out construction according to norms and after procuring building plan approval. All of them failed to exhibit any such documentation, following which sealing was carried out,” a senior MCG official privy to the matter said.The MCG officials also carried out a drive against illegal advertisements in areas located along the Dwarka Expressway on Wednesday and removed around 100 illegal hoardings.As per the by-laws of the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act,1994, no person or firm can display any kind of advertisement within Gurugram without seeking approval from MCG.MCG officials said that they are in the process of identifying violators and subsequently, will take action against them under the Haryana Municipal Corporation Advertisement by-laws and Haryana Defacement of Property Act.“Applications are available online at the MCG’s official website for seeking permission for advertising.

20-10-2021||Gurugram||GMDA to build 13 ‘missing’ link roads from next month||To improve connectivity to residential areas in newer sectors of the city (sectors 82 to 93), the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) will start the construction of 13 missing road links from the next month, officials said on Wednesday. Jaspal Singh, the chief engineer of the infrastructure-I division, said, “We have started with the inspections and are also coordinating with other agencies for transfer of land to GMDA so that the construction of these roads can be started. One part of the land has already been transferred to us, so we are trying to start work by next month.” Around 3.9 kilometres of roads will be constructed to connect the missing links of master dividing roads of sectors 82/82A, 82/83, 84/85, 88/89, 82/85, 86/90, 90/93 and outer roads of sectors 87 and 81. The matter was discussed during the core planning committee meeting of GMDA last week, when the chief executive officer instructed officials to inspect each of these missing links. “A site inspection will be done for each of the missing links of these roads for which provision has been made in the estimate of construction work to be undertaken for these roads. An e-estimate should be prepared and submitted along with comments from the public,” the chief executive officer said during the meeting. Officials said that these missing link roads need to be constructed for better connectivity with the master roads. Singh said that the GMDA is taking up the matter with Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) on a weekly basis to get encroachments removed from sectors 81 to 88, as most of the missing links are located in these sectors. Residents of the newer sectors said that the construction of these missing roads will reduce their travel time to other parts of the city. Praveen Malik, the vice-president of United Association of New Gurugram, a body of 40 housing societies located in sectors 77 to 90, said, “Roads are a basic infrastructure that the city must have. Construction of these link roads will improve travel time for many residents, especially those going towards IMT Manesar. At present, residents have to first to go Rampura Road and then take the IMT Manesar road, but such issues will be solved once the roads are constructed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gmda-to-build-13-missing-link-roads-from-next-month-101634751503801.html
20-10-2021||Gurugram||Respite over, air quality drops to poor zone as pollution rises||Following a respite from bad air due to heavy rainfall over the weekend, the air quality in the city started deteriorating on Wednesday, recording an air quality index (AQI) reading of 235 (‘poor’) on the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily bulletin.Neighbouring cities of Delhi, Faridabad, Manesar, Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad in the National Capital Region (NCR) also reported ‘poor’ air quality on Wednesday. Residents and experts said that in the past two days, the air quality was better because of rain, but local sources of pollution in the city have not reduced. On Wednesday, the particulate matter having a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM2.5) was listed as the prominent pollutant in the AQI bulletin. Ruchika Sethi, a member of Citizens for Clean Air, a city-based group, said, “It’s important to remember the role played by meteorological conditions in the city’s air quality and the constant sources of air pollution, such as waste burning and dust pollution, within the city. If full efforts are made to curb the local triggers of air pollution, then the city, despite external seasonal factors or rains and high speed of wind, will enjoy a better air quality. But violations are witnessed on a regular basis, be it uncovered trucks with construction material or rampant waste burning.”Experts also expressed similar concerns and said that the authorities need to curb the impact of local pollution sources, apart from external factors like stubble burning. Sachin Panwar, a city-based independent air quality scientist, said, “This was a rare episode of extended October rain, and one which created a micro airshed for Delhi-NCR. Stubble burning has also been low so far this year, but still, the ground pollution levels were high. Time and again, it has been seen that favourable meteorological conditions are the only saviour and there are no significant efforts to control the localised emissions.” Panwar said that over the next three days, visibility is likely to drop in Gurugram due to high pollution, and this may, eventually, turn into smog. “Over the coming days, moisture will hold dust particles and other secondary aerosols, and we are heading slowly towards peak pollution days without any proper action on the ground,” Panwar said. According to the weather bulletin issued on Wednesday evening by Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the air quality over Delhi and National Capital Territory is likely to deteriorate and reach the ‘very poor’ category on Thursday and remain the same on Friday as well. Over the next five days, the air quality is likely to remain largely in the ‘very poor’ category. Meanwhile, officials of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) said that measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) are being implemented in the district according to the air quality. Kuldeep Singh, regional officer of HSPCB for Gurugram (north), said, “Over the next three to four days, our primary focus is to control sources of dust pollution as the air quality is likely to deteriorate. We have issued instructions to all agencies to ensure that dust control measures, mainly sprinkling of water from a height, is followed. Our teams will be patrolling the city to ensure that the action is being taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/respite-over-air-quality-drops-to-poor-zone-as-pollution-rises-101634751502446.html
20-10-2021||Gurugram||MCG kicks off fogging drive as dengue cases rise||Amid surging dengue cases in the district, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) started its citywide fogging drive from Sector 4 on Wednesday. The total dengue count stood at 189 on Wednesday, with five new cases recorded on the day.Officials said that on Wednesday, the civic body procured around a dozen new fogging machines to launch the drive.“Around a dozen new fogging machines were procured today (Wednesday) following which we decided to launch the drive on an immediate basis starting from Sector 4. We are creating a schedule for the drives in consultation with the RWAs [residents’ welfare associations], ward councillors, and on the basis of complaints received on MCG’s social media handle,” Hariom Attri, joint commissioner (headquarters), MCG, who is overlooking the fogging drive, said.So far, the MCG was only conducting fogging activities in areas from which residents posted complaints on its social media handle, as it was short of necessary equipment.During a House meeting on October 11, the MCG decided to procure fogging machines as well as start a citywide fogging drive, after councillors raised the issue of poor fumigation due to broken equipment.On Wednesday, Attri said that the MCG would procure 21 fogging machines in total, of which five would be vehicle-mounted ones and the rest hand-held devices.“Around nine remaining fogging machines will arrive on Thursday, taking the total number of such machines to 36. Of the 36, 11 are vehicle-mounted while the remaining are hand-held machines,” Attri said. Lack of proper fogging has been a major concern for residents, as dengue cases continue to surge, with over 100 cases reported over the past two weeks.As per a release from the district administration, the highest number of dengue cases was reported on October 6, when 83 cases were recorded.This year’s dengue count is the highest since 2015, when Gurugram recorded 451 such cases. As many as 86, 66, 93, 22 and 51 cases were reported from 2016-2020, respectively.A senior MCG official privy to the matter said that around 110 officials, comprising five to six teams, will be deployed for fogging for extensive ward-wise coverage.“Besides fogging, the team will have multiple responsibilities such as checking houses for stagnant water or larvae inside coolers, pots, utensils, tyres, or any other such items and accordingly, issuing notices to such violators,” the official said.So far, the MCG has issued over 12,700 notices in the district.“During this dengue crisis, residents have been alerting their respective local RWAs regarding water stagnation or mosquito breeding spots on a daily basis. RWAs, thus. tend to have greater localised knowledge about such matters. RWAs working in tandem with the MCG for the fogging drives can help reduce dengue cases,” Dhruv Bansal, spokesperson, Gurgaon Citizens Council (GCC), an umbrella body of RWAs in the city, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-kicks-off-fogging-drive-as-dengue-cases-rise-101634751442495.html
20-10-2021||Pune||100% beneficiaries in 18-45 age group vaxed with first Covid dose in Pune||PUNE The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has been able to vaccinate what it claims is close to 100% of the eligible population aged between 18 and 45 years in the city with at least one dose of the Covid vaccine, officials said on Wednesday. However, civic officials observed that a significant population is hesitant to take the second dose and are not fully vaccinated even if they qualify after gap of 84 days for Covishield, and 28 days for Covaxin. The age group above 45 years is the most hesitant to take the second shot, possibly due to side effects after the first dose and the ebbing of the second Covid wave. Although more commercial activities are opening up, a higher percentage of vaccination has helped bring down the number of new infections and also the severity of the infection even if a vaccinated person gets Covid-19. According to Dr Suryakant Deokar, PMC’s immunisation officer, “The PMC has been able to vaccinate even more than the estimated population in the 18 to 45-year category, considering the city also has a floating population coming in from Pimpri-Chinchwad and the rural parts of the district.” “We request citizens to get completely vaccinated with both doses. Even if there are side effects post first dose, they are bound to be very negligible post second dose. However, without both doses there is no immunity. We have allowed mobile vaccination in societies as well. Just file an application and the civic body will arrange for the drive to be conducted on the society premises,” said Deokar. The Pune civic body has been able to administer more 4.94 million vaccines, of which 3,153,205 are first doses and 1,788,745 are second doses. The central government has estimated that Pune city’s population is 4,210,592. As per this estimation, more than the estimated eligible beneficiaries in the 18-45 age group have been vaccinated with the first dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/100-beneficiaries-in-18-45-age-group-vaxed-with-first-covid-dose-in-pune-101634751202677.html

The plinth is the lowest part of a building, working as a base for any structure and is in the form of a rectangular block or slab. The three-day meeting of the Ram Mandir Construction Committee in Ayodhya concluded on Wednesday after the review of the ongoing construction work. Nripendra Misra, chairman of the committee, presided over the meeting. At present, 1.5-metre raft is being erected on the temple’s foundation. “Stones from Mirzapur and Karnataka have been brought to Ayodhya. These will be used for laying the plinth of the temple,” Anil Mishra, member of Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, told media persons after the meeting. “Work is on to lay 1.5-metre raft. Out of 17 layers, around seven have been laid. By November 15, construction work related with the raft will be over. Thereafter, the plinth will be laid,” added Mishra. In the meeting, it was proposed to complete the plinth work by February next so that construction work related with the main structure of Ram temple could start by February or March, 2022. At present, casting of the raft above the temple’s foundation is going on. A maximum temperature of 22-23 degrees centigrade is required at the time of casting. For this, work (casting) is being done during the night. Ice in large quantity is also being used to maintain the temperature. The trust has already set a deadline to enthrone Ram Lalla (infant Lord Ram) in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple in Ayodhya by December 2023 to allow devotees to worship the deity. The Yogi Adityanath government had prepared a Vision Document for the overall development of Ayodhya along with the construction work of Ram temple. The government hired an international consultant, LEA Associates South Asia Private Limited, to prepare this vision document.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mirzapur-karnataka-stones-to-be-used-for-ram-temple-s-plinth-101634751142483.html
20-10-2021||Lucknow||Cracker trade’s flickering flame casts shadow on dealers in Lucknow||LUCKNOW: Sher Ali, a cracker dealer in his late sixties, never thought that he would be switching to another trade at this stage of life. The man, who used to own a famous cracker shop – Sheru Fireworks – in Bansmandi here is now struggling with his new plastic raw material business.The trade, which was once considered most profitable, has now lost its spark, lamented Ali. Ali is not the only one facing this situation. Many others have entered into alternative trade citing dwindling demand for crackers, focus on green crackers, government restrictions in wake of rising air pollution levels and anti-cracker campaigns. “Cracker business is unpredictable and unprofitable, Hence it’s better to make a switch rather than flogging a dead horse,” said Sher Ali who switched to plastic raw material trade around two years back. Ali, who entered the cracker trade in the 1980s, said: “In those days, people used to line up before our shops and bought massive chatais (series of fire crackers) of 10,000, 15,000 and 20,000 crackers. They spent lavishly on crackers and purchase of clothes used to be second on their priority list. The trend continued till 2010, but things began to change gradually and now the trade is left with no spark.” Gulsher Azad, owner of Azad crackers, is another trader who believes that cracker trade is no longer lucrative. “It is becoming difficult for us to invest in this trade that has no future. Last year, UP Government banned use of fireworks in around 13 districts following high pollution levels. In wake of so many guidelines/restrictions and emphasis on sale of only green crackers, it’s difficult for traders to cope with the changing course of the trade,” he said. Similarly, Mahesh Gupta, another cracker seller here, said there is no point sticking to this business. “The trade has witnessed setbacks in the last few years. And the rising pollution levels are another threat to the trade. In such a situation, there is no point investing in a trade that has no future. Many cracker traders have switched to other businesses,” said the owner of Gupta fireworks. According to the Fireworks Dealers Welfare Association (Lucknow), less than 35 fire cracker licence holders are left in the city. “Cracker trade is dwindling in the state,” said Satish Chandra Mishra, president of the association. He said this year too there are no directions from the government over cracker shops. “There is hardly any time left for Diwali and the government is yet to issue guidelines regarding sale and purchase of crackers. In such a situation, traders fear investing in the business,” added Mishra. Amar Pal Singh, additional district magistrate (administration), said guidelines regarding the establishment of shops would be issued shortly.

As the dates are vacant in October, there is no problem giving bookings to dramas and other shows. We are currently collecting the data of booking enquiries received all over the city.”Musical shows and plays have been scheduled at Yashwantrao Chavan Natyagruha and Balgandharva Natyagruha over the weekend. Satyajit Dandekar, who is coordinating the musical shows, said that audiences have responded well to the advance ticket booking.“We have arranged a musical evening on October 23 and prominent singers will be part of the show which is scheduled at Yashwantrao Chavan Natyagruha. Another musical show has been arranged on October 24. There has been an amazing response to ticket booking for these shows. Mostly, there have been group bookings by families,” said Dandekar.Shows of the popular Marathi comedy play ‘Eka Lagnachi Pudhachi Goshta’ have also been scheduled on Sunday. “We have arranged two shows of the play on Sunday. There is good response for ticket booking for the play,” said Sameer Hampi of S H Enterprises that has organised the shows.Multiplexes in the city too are reopening on Friday with the release of the new James Bond film ‘No Time to Die’. Prakash Chaphalkar, a partner in the city-based City Pride multiplex chain, said that initially only prominent properties will reopen. “There is a lot of preparation required for cleaning and sanitisation of screens. So initially, our prominent centres at Kothrud, Satara road, Shivajinagar will be reopened. Gradually, other centres will follow suit,” said Chaphalkar.By contrast, several single-screen theatres in the city are unlikely to reopen immediately. Single-screen operators cited financial constraints and the restriction of 50% capacity for not reopening single-screens immediately.Nitin Datar, president of Cinema Owners and Exhibitors Association of India, said, “Single-screen owners have been dealing with many issues. So, most single-screens are unlikely to reopen from October 22.”Deepak Kudale, former president of Cinema Owners and Exhibitors Association of India (COEAI), said, “It is an optional issue for single-screen operators to open or not to open single-screens. Most single-screens will open after Diwali depending upon the situation. We had a meeting with the CM and deputy CM about the problems of single-screens on Oct 18. They assured us that our problems will be addressed and a solution found.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/multiplexes-theatres-to-reopen-in-pune-on-friday-single-screens-after-diwali-101634750423196.html
20-10-2021||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh CM just makes tall promises on development: Kamal Nath||Madhya Pradesh Congress president Kamal Nath on Wednesday held the BJP responsible for backwardness of Punjapura under the Khandwa Lok Sabha constituency and said people should identify "actor and director" in the saffron party for their own benefit. Punjapura, an area in Dewas district, falls under the Khandwa Lok Sabha seat where a bypoll is scheduled on October 30. Talking about the coronavirus pandemic, Nath sought to know if any compensation has been paid by the BJP government to the families of those who have died due to the infection. Despite the BJP winning from the area for the last 60 years, there has been no development and people are forced to migrate in search of jobs, Nath said, addressing an election rally at Punjapura. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan should seek an apology from people for not developing the area, the Congress leader said. “The BJP has been winning from Punjapura for the last 60 years. Despite that there is no development of the region. Though situated on the banks of the Narmada River, there is a water crisis, there are no industries, no employment... all these have forced the people to migrate from here,” Nath said. The Congress has fielded former MLA Rajnarayan Singh Purni from the Khandwa Lok Saba seat, where Gyaneshwar Patil is the BJP's candidate.Accusing Chouhan of making tall promises of development, but not fulfilling them, Nath said the BJP chief minister should give an account of what his party has done for Punjapura in the last six decades. The former chief minister criticised Chouhan for announcing on a number of occasions to make Bagli, a town in Dewas district, a separate district, but not making good on his promise. “There is an actor (Chouhan) in the state and a director (apparently referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi) in the country and people should identify them for their benefit," Nath said without elaborating. Referring to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) crisis, Nath said “On March 26, 2020, PM [Narendra] Modi had announced a package of ₹20 lakh crore for helping people. In Dewas district alone, nearly 7,000 people have died because of Covid-19 and everybody knows about it. How many people succumbed due to lack of oxygen and Remdesivir drug? Did anyone get a single rupee as compensation?” Nath said though the result of upcoming bypolls in Madhya Pradesh will not affect the stability of the BJP government, it will certainly give a message to the nation that people can't be fooled all the time. Besides the Khandwa Lok Sabha seat, by-elections are due in Raigaon, Jobat and Prithvipur assembly segments in the state. Polling for all these bypolls will be held on October 30 and votes will be counted on November 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/madhya-pradesh-cm-just-makes-tall-promises-on-development-kamal-nath-101634744762584.html

The Patiala municipal corporation (MC) is issuing notices to dairy owners to shift business to the new location, a 21-acre site at Ablowal village, even as Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi had asked the then deputy commissioner, Kumar Amit, to halt the process on October 2. This was after a delegation of dairy owners met Channi, highlighting their concerns.The presence of dairies within city limits has lead to frequent choking of sewers and resultant water-logging in Patiala. The project to shift them was initiated in 2003, but it gathered pace only after former CM Captain Amarinder Singh provided funds in 2017. In the first phase, of 257 dairies, 141 are to be shifted. The MC had set September 30 as the deadline for these units. Patiala mayor Sanjeev Sharma Bittu said notices will be served to these units over the next week and owners have been given a week to shift. “Since Channi’s directive, we have presented our case before the state government and briefed them that all facilities will be provided to owners. If any the dairy owner fails to shift their business within the stipulated time, the criminal action will be initiated,” the mayor added.Dairy owners claimed that the MC has failed to provide proper road network, water supply connections, sewage treatment plant and other requirements before shifting the dairy owners. The site is without a biogas plant, sewage treatment plant and veterinary hospital, as proposed under the ₹17-crore project. The dairy owners also complained that they are being offered a 150 square yard plot, which is small and is not adequate to run their units. Patiala MC commissioner Punamdeep Kaur said they had listed out the facilities and arrangements made for shifting of the dairies before the deputy commissioner, who will now take final call. “We have no choice than to serve notices to dairy owners as the civic body has spent nearly ₹17 crore on the project. We are providing all necessities as promised in Phase I. Allied facilities will be provided in Phase II,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fresh-notices-issued-to-141-patiala-dairy-units-to-shift-despite-cm-s-halt-directive-101634750304853.html
20-10-2021||Pune||Reporting of tuberculosis cases in PMC down in last two years||In the past two years reporting of tuberculosis cases in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has been affected as the number of reported cases have gone down from over 8,000 in 2019 to a little over 5,000 in 2020 and 2021. The coverage of tuberculosis has also been affected from 85% to 55% in the past two years.The Covid-19 pandemic had affected the coverage and reporting of tuberculosis due to a shortage of staff and less detection. The coverage of beneficiaries is done under the central government’s Nikshay Poshan Yojana.Dr Vaishali Jadhav, assistant health officer, PMC, said, “In the past two years the reporting and detection of tuberculosis cases in the city have gone down due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Usually whenever a patient comes to any hospital be it private or government and if the patient has been complaining of coughing for over two weeks then the sputum is sent for testing of tuberculosis. Patients that are then detected positive for tuberculosis and referred to us. However, in the past two years, the number of patients reported due to tuberculosis has come down because the OPD’s (outpatient department) were shut.”In the year 2018, the PMC could report 5,256 tuberculosis patients and the percentage of beneficiaries under the central government scheme was about 89%. In 2019, the number of TB patients went up to 8,061 and the percentage of coverage went up to 66%. In 2020 the number of beneficiaries was 5,663 and the coverage was 75% and in 2021 the number went further down to 5,248 and the coverage went down to 55%.“The pressure to handle Covid-19 in the city was so high that the focus on other diseases was almost neglected. However, now the civic body is restarting its survey of listing out non-communicable diseases and also other diseases which have to be notified as per government rules,” said Jadhav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/reporting-of-tuberculosis-cases-in-pmc-down-in-last-two-years-101634749762368.html
20-10-2021||Other||Capt colluded with BJP even as Cong CM: Harsimrat||Jalandhar Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) Bathinda MP and former Union cabinet minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal alleged on Wednesday that former Punjab chief minister (CM) Capt Amarinder Singh had been in a secret alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), even during his tenure as the state CM, with the announcement of a new political outfit on Tuesday.“The cat is now out of the bag. Capt Amarinder had been in a secret pact with the BJP for the past five years, when he was the Punjab CM. Now, the new political outfit will also possibly have an alliance with the BJP,” Harsimrat said, addressing a press conference at the house of former MLA, Jagbir Singh Brar, the SAD candidate for next year’s assembly polls from Jalandhar Cantt. She added “Capt Amarinder back-stabbed Punjab as he got the three farm laws passed by colluding with the BJP, in a secret understanding. He was a member of the committee which proposed the three black farm laws since 2019.” Harsimrat also addressed a meeting of workers in Jalandhar Cantt and Central constituencies and visited the Valmiki Mandir, on account of Valmiki Jayanti. She claimed that the BJP had also supported Amarinder in the 2017 assembly polls. On the possibility of Capt Amarinder allying with Akali factions like those of Rajya Sabha MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and others, Harsimrat said, “The Capt is betraying the Congress and Punjab. He and the rebel Akalis might come together and act as a B-team of the BJP. People will identify and punish them.” On any possibility of the SAD allying with Capt Amarinder, Harsimrat said, “This is out the question. Though I am not the SAD president, but we will never have an alliance with somebody who has back-stabbed Punjab, aligned with a party that has gone out of the way to finish the state’s agriculture and defamed the Sikh community.” “We have already broken a decade-old alliance with the BJP on the Punjab issue and for farmers’ welfare. It did not remain the same alliance that was stitched together by former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee and former Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal for the betterment and communal harmony of Punjab. Today, the alliance had turned into one where complete dictatorship prevailed,” she said. On the extension of BSF jurisdiction in Punjab, she said Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi had literally signed-away half of Punjab to the Centre, with the writ of the security force now extending up to 50km inside the state from the border. On the lynching of a farm labourer, accused of sacrilege, at the Singhu border, Harsimrat said the SAD strongly condemned any incident of sacrilege. However, in this case a thorough probe was warranted after news facts had emerged in the case.MODI TRYING TO STOP AAP: CHADHAAam Aadmi Party (AAP) Punjab affairs co-in-charge and national spokesperson Raghav Chadha on Tuesday claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was making every effort to prevent the party from forming its government in Punjab. Commenting on former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s announcement to float his own new party, Chadha said that while the BJP, SAD and the Congress were failing to stop the AAP from forming a government in Punjab, Modi had fielded Capt Amarinder through a fourth party to stop it. “In 2017 also, the BJP and the Akali Dal Badal had given all the votes of their workers to the Congress party to stop the AAP,” he claimed in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/capt-colluded-with-bjp-even-as-cong-cm-harsimrat-101634749642384.html
20-10-2021||Lucknow||IAS officer accused of promoting religious conversions fails to get clean chit||KANPUR IAS officer Mohd Iftikharuddin, accused of promoting religious conversions, was denied a clean chit by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) in its 550-page report submitted to the state government late on Tuesday night, said officials privy to the investigations.The UP government had formed the SIT to probe videos purportedly showing IAS officer Mohd Iftikharuddin preaching Islam and allegedly making a pitch for conversions at his official residence in 2014-2016 when he was commissioner of Kanpur division. The officer was questioned for 16 hours recently. Iftikharuddin had provided copies of three books authored by him to the SIT but did not answer pointed questions. He kept pleading innocence, said officials. The investigation began after three videos of the officer went viral on social media on September 6. People in the video, including the officer, were purportedly describing Islam as the best and made objectionable remarks on other religions. Convener of Mutt Mandir coordination committee Bhupesh Awasthi had complained to the chief minister on the IGRS portal, following which the SIT was formed on September 28. It was headed by CB-CID director general Gopal Lal Meena and ADG (Kanpur zone) Bhanu Bhaskar. The government had given the SIT a week to submit the report, but the deadline was extended as the team had to go through the seven-hour-long video footage and a number of books to find out the purported objectionable content and remarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ias-officer-accused-of-promoting-religious-conversions-fails-to-get-clean-chit-101634749462343.html

Kaushal, whose name has recently cropped up in the broad daylight gruesome murder of Youth Akal Dal (YAD) leader, Vikramjit Middukhera, in Mohali is lodged in Sangrur jail. He has claimed that agencies are conspiring to kill him on the asking of rival gangster or eliminate him in a fake encounter. To counter this, he has demanded that whenever he is sought to be taken for interrogation in any case, videography be ‘done’ of his leaving the jail premises till he reaches the police station concerned. The plea also demands that during interrogation, videography be also ‘done’, so that he can ask the court to provide him a copy, if needed, to show that he was tortured during interrogation. Posting the matter for November 2, the high court bench of justice Amol Rattan Singh directed that if replies are not filed at least one week before the hearing, senior officers of each department in each state, would be summoned to the court. The court also made it clear that the affidavits on these allegations should be of a person not lower in rank than an AIG/SSP. “They spit on the floor and asks petitioner to lick, if refused, he is forced to do so. Officers urinate on the petitioner after removing clothes and give him merciless beatings. Sharp objects are inserted in the private parts and also given electric shocks inside the jail as well as during when he is taken on a remand in a case,” the plea alleges without naming the agency. CONVICTED ONCE, FACES 38 CRIMINAL CASES As per the plea, he is an accused in 38 criminal cases, has been acquitted in four and discharged in one. He is a convict in one case in 2006 and remains an undertrial in other cases, the plea adds. His counsel, senior advocate Bipan Ghai, had submitted that the petitioner has been falsely implicated in a large number of cases by the investigating agencies. He is roped in as accused on the basis of false confessions, manipulated, of the co-accused during remand and is not based on any tangible investigation. The petitioner has been arrayed as accused only to cover up the inadequacies in the investigation done by investigation agencies, Ghai had submitted, adding that whenever the police are not able to solve a case, his client was named as an accused. The plea claims that he has been falsely implicated in the recent murders of Middukhera and councillor Sukhmeet Singh in June 2021 in Jalandhar. “The petitioner has full faith in judicial system and ready to face the trial. His family too is being pressurised not to speak against false implication,” the plea says. Taking note of these allegations, the court directed jail officials as well as policemen that rules and judicial orders with regard to arrest and questioning of the accused be followed in letter and spirit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/accused-of-yad-leader-murder-hc-seeks-senior-officers-response-on-gangster-s-fear-of-fake-encounter-101634748801626.html
20-10-2021||Mumbai||Colleges resume physical classes in Maharashtra||The past 19 months left visually impaired Siraj Rane, 20, from Dnyansadhna College, Thane, confined to his home, attending online classes. On Wednesday, as soon as Rane entered the college premises, he called for his friends.“Although I attended online classes regularly, I could only hear the teachers’ lectures. But when I come to college, I can also discuss the topics and lectures with my friends. Meeting my classmates and teachers in person helps me understand better, compared to just hearing their voices from my laptop,” said Rane, a third-year BA student. Colleges and universities across Maharashtra on Wednesday resumed in-person or “offline” classes, which had been stopped for over one-and-a-half years due to the coronavirus pandemic. Like Rane, the handful of students who turned up in colleges across the city were excited to be able to meet their classmates and also attend lectures in person. Colleges across Mumbai saw an around 15% turnout of students each. Although some colleges in rural parts of the state had reopened earlier, the state government had given a go- ahead to all governing authorities to resume physical classes from Wednesday onwards. The Mumbai University and the civic body released SOP ahead of reopening and asked colleges to strictly follow Covid-19 protocols.Those who are fully vaccinated were allowed to attend college and travel by local train. Joel Fernandes, a student of St Xaviers College, travelled by local train from Ghatkopar till his college on Wednesday, after almost two years. “It is now that I feel things are getting back to normalcy. It seemed ages since I followed my routine of taking the train and reaching college. Even walking towards the institute from CST railway station felt surreal,” said an elated Fernandes, a post-graduate student of Mass Communication.“Excitement and nervousness is at its peak today. After 19 months, we are out of our pyjamas and got an opportunity to dress well and attend classes. During online classes, we had to keep the video off so there was no dress code. But we need to dress well to come to college. I specifically went shopping to buy tops in the latest trend,” said Srushti Donde, 20, student of Ruia college.Teachers were happy to get to offline sessions as students were less responsive in online lectures. “We were anxious with all the Covid protocols in place and to ensure that everything is implemented well, but were also excited at the same time. The chatter and laughter is back in the college corridors and we could also have a very enthusiastic and interactive lecture, unlike online classrooms,” said Runa Shajeev, head of department for English, Dnyansadhna College, Thane.Colleges ensured all Covid protocols were in place and a hybrid set-up of teaching was prepared for students. “Thermal scanning and hand washing as well as sanitisation facilities are made available at entry points for all staff, students and visitors. Posters about social distancing norms and other hygiene practices to be followed are displayed at prominent places in the campus. Moreover, classrooms and laboratories are well equipped with online and offline modes of teaching,” said Gajanan Wader, principal, Pillai College of Arts Commerce and Science, Panvel. Hardly a handful of students attended college on WednesdayMost colleges had preferred to call post-graduate or practical batch for the first day and plan to include more students gradually. Krutika Desai, principal, Mithibai College, said, “We had around 10% students from post-graduation who attended college on the first day. We conducted all examinations online. we started with them first and are expecting a better response post Diwali.”“It was not different for our students as some used to visit for the last two weeks to solve doubts. All our teachers are fully vaccinated; students from the first year who had film making courses or practicals had requested if they could visit college for extra help. As some of them were below 18 years of age we allowed them to visit, maintaining protocols. It was almost the same crowd who attended college on Wednesday, so it was pretty much like every day for us,” said Anju Kapoor, principal of Usha Pravin Gandhi college, Vile Parle.With hardly a week before Diwali vacations begin and portions for the second year and third-year students completed, not many students were eager to attend college. This was also one of the reasons that most colleges reopened only for post-graduate and research-related courses on Wednesday. All colleges are expecting a better turnout post Diwali vacations as the new term will begin and more students will be fully vaccinated till then.Most campuses bore a deserted look despite the first day of reopening, “Exams for our undergraduate students are currently on and since the exams were planned in the online mode, we didn’t want to disturb the schedule,” said Rajendra Shinde, principal of St Xavier’s College. He added that their UG students will start attending physical classes only post exams and their Diwali break. “The post graduate batches were called to start attending physical lectures, but very few showed up on day one,” he added.Similarly at KC College in Churchgate, only those students who have practical exams were invited to college while the rest of the students appeared for their exams online. Several residential colleges, including the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) had started bringing their students back on campus in a phased manner and in September this year, the institute announced that their mid-semester exams were being conducted in the hybrid mode — those on campus took offline exams while the rest appeared for exams online. “We now have only two weeks of instructional classes left, therefore our classes will continue online until the end of semester. Post Diwali break, we will be conducting exams in the hybrid mode,” said Prof Subhashis Chaudhuri, director, IIT-Bombay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/colleges-resume-physical-classes-in-maharashtra-101634748749943.html

20-10-2021||Lucknow||Work on 11 new airports progressing in UP: Yogi||KUSHINAGAR Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said work on 11 new airports, including an international aerodrome in Ayodhya and another in Jewar, was progressing in Uttar Pradesh.“Air connectivity in the state is being strengthened, which would provide an impetus for development. The inauguration of the Kushinagar international airport and launch of 12 development schemes here will also benefit five crore people in the east UP region that had remained neglected post independence,” he said. The CM said only two airports were functional in UP from 1947 to 2014 – one in Lucknow and another in Varanasi while the state’s connectivity was confined to around 16 cities. “But now, the Kushinagar airport has become operational as the ninth airport of the state whereas airports in UP have direct air connectivity with 75 major cities,” said Yogi Adityanath during the inauguration of the international airport.“Majority of the Buddhist spots are located in Uttar Pradesh. The PM has realised the vision of the Buddhist circuit with the development of road network and air connectivity. And the international airport has given flight to the dreams of the people settled in the region,” he said. “Gautam Buddh attained ‘mahaparinirvana’ in Kushinagar and this place is revered by Buddhists across the world. People will be indebted to Gautam Buddh for the messages of harmony and peace. Addressing the UN recently, the PM had stated that some countries have given humanity war while India has given Gautam Buddha,” he added.Focusing on the UDAN scheme, Yogi said the PM’s intention behind the project was to ensure that even those wearing ‘hawai chappals’ (slippers) could also travel by air and this had been made possible through improved air connectivity. Yogi reiterated that the state government was developing the health sector to provide better facilities to people. “UP is establishing 30 medical colleges and each district in the state will have a medical college. The Prime Minister will soon inaugurate Gorakhpur AIIMS and other medical colleges,” he said.The UP government was also working for the welfare of the Musahar community in Kushinagar district, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/work-on-11-new-airports-progressing-in-up-yogi-101634748502333.html
20-10-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra health minister hints at further relaxations for train travel||As Covid-19 cases continue to show a decline, state health minister Rajesh Tope hinted that further relaxations for train travel could be provided post-Diwali if cases continue to remain low. Maharashtra added 1,825 fresh infections on Wednesday, the fifth consecutive day of under 2,000 cases.Currently, only people who are fully vaccinated are allowed to use the Mumbai suburban train services. The state government has been gradually easing the restrictions to prevent Covid-19 since mid-August. Recently, the state has decided to open up theatres and drama auditoriums with 50% occupancy from October 22, while on Tuesday, it also extended operational timings for shops and restaurants. Tope said that additional categories of passengers could be allowed to use the Mumbai suburban train services if Covid-19 cases do not rise post-Diwali. “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is monitoring the Covid situation minutely; he has been speaking to the state Covid task force and senior officials. I think, post-Diwali, if there are not many cases or a high positivity rate, the chief minister can think positively on this [the decision to allow entry to all on trains],” Tope told a TV channel.It was speculated that the chief minister, who heads the disaster management department, would extend relaxation on train travel to people who have taken one shot of the vaccine to use suburban trains. However, the move was deferred till cases see a further decline, state officials said. There was also a fear that crowding could increase in trains during Diwali.Mumbai, meanwhile, went above 400 cases after four days on Wednesday with 462 fresh infections. For the past four days, Mumbai was clocking 300 cases daily. Mumbai added four fatalities, taking its death toll to 16,192. Maharashtra added 21 deaths, pushing the death toll to 139,886.The Maharashtra government extended its ‘Mission Kavach Kundal’, a campaign to boost its Covid-19 vaccination drive, up to Diwali. The campaign aims to push vaccination drive in the state, while prioritising the first dose for all citizens at the earliest. The 10-day campaign kicked off on October 8 with a daily target of 1.5 million doses a day. “Mission Kavach Kundal, which was till Dussehra, has now been extended up to Diwali to carry our vaccinations on mission mode by all the districts and civic bodies. Vaccination is our saviour, so I appeal to the people who are yet to get vaccinated, must do so,” the minister said.Tope said that vaccination is the “saviour” in the pandemic, and it has helped keep the third wave of Covid infections under control in other parts of the world. He added that with vaccinations, the state would be able to keep the impact of the possible third wave under check.“Across the world, the third wave has come, but the intensity has been low and not as threatening with fewer serious cases and lower deaths. Vaccinations played a crucial role in that. If the third wave comes here, our focus remains on vaccination so that the number of cases is not more, and if they are, they aren’t critical cases; people don’t need to get hospitalised, and the need for medical oxygen is less,” Tope said.The active cases in the state came down to 25,728 on Wednesday. A chunk of the active cases are from Pune, Mumbai, Thane and Ahmednagar districts. Eight of the 35 districts in Maharashtra currently have active cases in the single digits. These districts include Gadchiroli, Gondia, Bhandara, Wardha, Yavatamal, Washim, Dhule and Nandurbar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-health-minister-hints-at-further-relaxations-for-train-travel-101634748443069.html
20-10-2021||Mumbai||100-fold rise in viral load expelled by Covid patients during the second wave: study||There was a 100-fold increase in the viral load of the respiratory particles expelled by Covid-19 patients during the second wave dominated by the Delta variant. These findings are a part of an ongoing study by the Foundation of Medical Research (FMR) and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The study has been selected for poster presentation at the ongoing 52nd Union World Conference on Lung Health being held virtually. The preliminary findings of the study shared in the poster also highlight a two-fold rise in the proportion of people expelling the virus from their breath during the second wave. Though the study is being conducted on Mumbai respondents, study authors said that it explains the higher transmission and increased number of Covid-19 cases in the second wave. An e-poster presentation is a format of presenting at scientific conferences where researchers present the findings of their research using a poster containing the gist of the study. The study includes a cohort of 75 Covid-19 patients from Mumbai who were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and were under home isolation between July to September 2021. These patients were recruited for the research within 48 hours of testing positive for the infection. More patients are also being recruited as the study is ongoing. In order to understand the viral load expelled through the respiratory particles, the participants were given N95 masks layered with a special gelatin membrane. Their respiratory particles were captured in a 30-minute process that involved talking, reading, coughing and tidal breathing. The field assistants then collected the gelatin membrane from the masks and sent them for Real-Time Reverse Transcription–Polymerase Chain (RT-PCR) testing in a stabilising medium. “More than 90% of the patients were mask-positive, meaning they were expelling ample of virus in their respiratory particles,” said Kalpana Sriraman, senior research officer at FMR and co-author of the study. “This was very high compared to our previous study when only around 42% of patients were found mask positive,” she said. Mask positive refers to samples taken from masks that tested positive in RT-PCR tests. In this case, the gelatin membranes were processed. The previous study, which analysed patients infected in the first wave, was published this April in PLOS One journal. The ongoing study highlights two other important factors: first, the Cycle Threshold (CT) value of patients during the second wave was much lower on masks as well as the swab samples. A lower CT value indicates a higher viral load as the RNA of the virus could be picked up quickly in the RTPCR. Second, those patients who were partially or fully vaccinated showed a marginal reduction in the viral load expelled by them. Patients who were fully vaccinated and had breakthrough infections still expelled the virus. “These findings will be important as we design future vaccines to break the chain of transmission,” said Dr Nerges Mistry, director of FMR and a co-author of the study. An important takeaway message from the study is the way masks are disposed of. “It is clear that the masks carry a high amount of viral load even if the patients are asymptomatic. Thus, careful disposal of masks should be encouraged,” said chest physician and study co-author Dr Vikas Oswal. He said that one must avoid touching the inner side of the mask. “Hold the mask carefully from the outer side or by the strings, roll it in a plastic bag or a newspaper and discard it. One must not let the mask touch any surface from the inner side. If someone has symptoms like cough and cold, it is ideal to discard their masks separately in a sealed plastic bag. The ongoing study has used CT values to arrive at the quantitative aspects of viral load. It is yet to undergo the peer-review process. “The Delta variant which was dominant during the second wave was undoubtedly more infectious as we saw many cases of entire families testing positive,” said Dr Kedar Toraskar, critical care specialist at Wockhardt Hospital and member of the Covid-19 task force of Maharashtra. “However, there are many other techniques to look at the quantitative aspect of the viral load other than the CT values,” he said. Maharashtra has recorded over 6.5 million cases and over 139,800 deaths. In July, this year, most districts had a test positivity rate of around 5%. The test positivity rate is now under 2%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/100fold-rise-in-viral-load-expelled-by-covid-patients-during-the-second-wave-study-101634748202197.html

20-10-2021||Mumbai||Ahead of Mumbai civic polls, Thackeray cousins woo communities they once targeted||On Monday, October 18, two Hindu seers visited Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray’s house at Shivaji Park in central Mumbai’s Dadar area. Guru Ma Kanchan Giriji and Jagatguru Suryacharaji hail from Uttar Pradesh, and both had criticised Raj’s cousin Uddhav Thackeray, the president of the Shiv Sena party and the chief minister of Maharashtra, for “abandoning the cause of Hindutva.”“We want a Hindu rashtra (Hindu nation). Raj Thackeray supports the Hindutva ideology and the best thing about him is he does what he says,” said Guru Ma Kanchan Giriji soon after meeting the 53-year-old nephew of Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray. “Since both BJP and Raj Thackeray share a Hindutva ideology, they should come together,” she added. The two spiritual leaders were in town to convince Hindi belt voters in Mumbai to side with MNS, which has developed a soft alliance with the BJP, one that could convert into a partnership when the elections near. Earlier this year, in January, a year ahead of the 2022 Mumbai civic elections, Shiv Sena launched a massive on-ground campaign to get the Gujarati and Jain communities – traditionally BJP voters – on its side. The theme of the party’s first event: ‘Mumbai ma jalebi ne fafda, Uddhav Thackeray aapda’ (Jalebi and fafda in Mumbai, Uddhav Thackery is ours). The Shiv Sena plans to hold monthly events to attract the elusive Gujarati and Jain voter to consolidate its hold on the city’s municipal corporation, the country’s richest with a 2021-22 budget of ₹39,083 crore. In Shiv Sena’s annual Dussehra rally on October 15, Uddhav’s statements seemed to point towards the burying of the linguistic-divide hatchet, something the party is backing to help it succeed in the BMC election. “I believe Hindutva is now under threat,” Uddhav said. “Those who have used the ladder of Hindutva can now use the strategy of the British of divide and rule. They will create a divide between Marathis and non-Marathis. They will erect a wall within Marathis on basis of caste and community, to continue to enjoy the power in the Centre. Marathi people must unite by forgetting their differences. The division between Marathis and non-Marathis should also be buried.” Sena chief spokesperson and former Union minister Arvind Sawant said the Sena was never anti-Gujarati or anti-south Indians. “We were against the injustice meted out to the sons of the soil. A person born in Maharashtra, whether he is Gujarati or Tamilian, is a son of the soil. Our people were not getting jobs, so Balasaheb had to pick up the issue of Marathi manoos.” In a political twist of fate, therefore, both MNS and Shiv Sena seem to be wooing the same communities they once targeted as part of their “sons of the soil” agenda. Shiv Sena, founded in June 1966, fought elections on the “rights to the Marathi manoos” plank. Four decades later, in March 2006, Raj Thackeray founded MNS following an ugly succession spat with his cousin Uddhav. In the quest for a political agenda, Raj invoked the same anti-north Indian migrant workers’ card – including beating up taxi drivers who hailed from UP and Bihar – that the original Sena had used to consolidate its Marathi support base. Shiv Sena had also launched a bitter campaign in its initial decades against the Gujarati and the Jain communities in Mumbai and its suburbs. No longer. Uddhav’s Shiv Sena wants these communities to shift loyalties from BJP, while Raj’s MNS wants to get closer to the north Indian community to cement its relationship with BJP. HISTORICAL CONTEXT MNS leaders assert the party’s anti-north Indian image was created by the media. Nitin Sardesai, senior MNS leader, said, “Our stand as anti-north Indian was always misunderstood. Raj Saheb, in a 2018 gathering of north Indians, had clearly said that it was the failure of states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to create jobs. If locals won’t get jobs there, migration is bound to happen. When locals here won’t get jobs, friction with migrants is a natural outcome.” Another senior party leader, Bala Nandgaonkar said the party “has never opposed north Indians living in Mumbai for generations.” Meanwhile, a key Shiv Sena leader, said on the condition of anonymity, “The BJP is looking at a combination of Gujarati, north Indian and middle-class Maharashtrian votes to win Mumbai as well adjoining cities in next year’s civic polls. If they are going to dent our voter base, we have to do the same with theirs. Gujaratis are a better option because the community is not hostile to the Sena under Uddhavji and Aadityaji (Aaditya Thackeray, Uddhav’s son and the state’s environment minister).” The roots of Shiv Sena’s uneasy relationship with the Gujarati and Jain communities dates back to the Samyukta Maharashtra (United Maharashtra) movement when Gujarat and Maharashtra were carved out of the then Bombay Presidency in 1960. Both states wanted Mumbai (then Bombay) as their capital, but the Central government ruled in favour of Maharashtra. Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray, a political cartoonist, began targeting the Gujarati community in his artworks. Political historians point to the Sena’s apparent grudge against the lack of private jobs for the Marathi-speaking locals in businesses dominated by the Gujarati, Jain and Marwari communities. Political analyst Hemant Desai said, “Since Samyukta Maharashtra movement the Gujarati-Marathi divide was created as Morarji Desai wanted Mumbai to be a part of Gujarat, which the Sena had vehemently opposed. Later, they (Sena) saw that private jobs came from these communities, and this furthered the divide.” In addition to these communities, the senior Thackeray launched a campaign against South Indians who, according to the Sena, were “usurping jobs in banks, corporations and Central government offices in Mumbai.” Desai added, “Balasaheb started the movement against south Indians largely on the basis of jobs. The banks had a lobby which would not give jobs to Marathis. Competency was also an issue with the Marathis.”Raj’s evolution as MNS leader was no different. His outfit called for forcibly evicting north Indian migrant workers from Mumbai and Maharashtra. In 2008, MNS workers attacked north Indians in Mumbai and other districts including Pune, Nashik and Aurangabad. They also assaulted north Indian candidates who appeared for the all-India Railway Recruitment Board entrance exams. The violent campaign yielded electoral dividends. In the 2009 Maharashtra assembly elections, MNS won 13 seats out 288, five of them in Mumbai. However, the party’s drop in influence coincided with the emergence of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government in 2014 with Narendra Modi as prime minister. That year, the MNS won just a single assembly seat in Maharashtra, and none from Mumbai. The story repeated in the 2019 elections. “MNS only tasted success in 2009 and in Nashik civic body in 2012. Lack of organisational strength and direction to the party led to the decline in their fortune,” Desai said. SHIFT IN STANCEEarlier this year, Raj officially veered towards Hindutva with a new saffron flag for the party with a seal of Chhatrapati Shivaji in the middle. “We wanted to signify our connection not only with Marathi people in particular, but also Hindus in general,” an MNS functionary said.Guru Ma Kanchan Giriji, one of the two seers who met Raj on Monday, said the MNS chief is loved by north Indians and that “they needn’t fear him.” In December 2018, Raj had addressed a gathering of north Indians under the aegis of the Uttar Bhartiya Mahapanchayat (UBM), a non-governmental organisation. In that event, he reached out to the community saying other states must also build infrastructure and economic might to help local people get jobs. “I want north Indians to understand my side of things,” he said then. “What was wrong in asking for Maharashtrian youth to be given priority in jobs over other migrants? With 13.5 crore people in the state, we don’t have enough space to walk on the roads because of a huge inflow of migrants from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Chhattisgarh,” he said. “We understand your situation but change needs to come from within the community. You have to tell your own people that now no space is left in Maharashtra, so please don’t come here.” Soon after the unlikely post-poll alliance of Shiv Sena, Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in 2019 to form the state government, MNS gravitated towards BJP, which, to be sure, could not openly have an alliance with Raj as it would risk alienating its north Indian voters. Hence, it was left to Raj to woo the north Indian voter instead. As part of this outreach campaign, Raj is expected to visit Ayodhya in December this year. Similarly, the Shiv Sena – as part of its Gujarati outreach programme – organised gatherings to drum up support for Uddhav’s handling of the pandemic, and what Sena patriarch Bal Thackeray did for the community during the 1992-93 Mumbai riots. Shiv Sena’s change in stance also coincides with a gradual mellowing of the party’s hardline posture on Hindutva and its approach towards non-Marathi communities, with a more liberal Aaditya playing a key role in the party’s evolution. Insiders say that Sena is wooing the Gujarati community because it knows it cannot win Mumbai civic polls only on the basis of Marathi votes. “The population dynamic of Mumbai has altered. The Marathi population has not grown as much as the people from the other communities. Gujaratis, Jains and Marwaris account for a significant number of voters in Mumbai and so political parties will take that into consideration,” said Mumbai-based political analyst Surendra Jondhale. THE POLITICAL CALCULATIONMNS and Shiv Sena largely share the same vote base – Marathi manoos (Marathi person). However, the Mumbai electoral pie has other factors. As per the 2011 census, the Gujarati-speaking population in Mumbai was 19%, while Jain community (which also largely speaks Gujarati) was 4.5%. In 2011, Mumbai’s population was 12.4 million. Over the last 10 years, these numbers would have increased significantly to impact the outcome of the BMC polls.In the 2017 Mumbai municipal election, Shiv Sena won 84 of the 226 seats and just about managed to retain its senior partner position with BJP, which won had 82 and pocketed seats in the western suburbs largely dominated by non-Marathi population. Political analysts said the BJP performed well in 2017 as it adopted a development agenda. “Since 2014, the BJP had taken up the development agenda. In Maharashtra, under Devendra Fadnavis, the government took up several infrastructure projects. In Mumbai Metro project was pushed. Having their CM also helped BJP in BMC election,” said Jondhale. Sena spokesperson Sawant acknowledged that the Marathi population in Mumbai has remained constant, while the non-Marathi population has increased. This time, though, Shiv Sena is likely to bank on its Covid-19 performance as well. Insiders say that, as a chief minister with no prior administrative experience, Uddhav Thackeray managed to keep the pandemic under control and created large-scale public health infrastructure. BJP, on the other hand, is expected to use the resentment of traders and business owners against the Thackeray government for a prolonged Covid-19 lockdown in Mumbai. Jondhale, a former political science professor at Mumbai University, said, “Uddhav Thackeray had earlier said that politics of religion was not good. He has not disavowed Hindutva, but he is speaking on it because BJP is trying to corner him on that issue. Besides, he is focusing more on governance which will help his party overall, not just in the BMC polls.” He added that calling Raj Thackeray as the new Hindutva icon would be “exaggeration”. He wondered if Raj would risk losing the Marathi youth following in order to gain the trust of north Indians. “He (Raj) has the charisma, but it never translated into votes for him. When Uddhav gives directions to his party, he has the organisational strength to execute his plan, unlike Raj.” He added, “Even BJP doesn’t have it as strong as the Sena does at the ward level. But they make up for it with two faces, Devendra Fadnavis and Narendra Modi.” javascript:selectTab(’tab-panel’, ‘tabExtra’);||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ahead-of-mumbai-civic-polls-thackeray-cousins-woo-communities-they-once-targeted-101634747722548.html
20-10-2021||Lucknow||Doctor clicks rare Mottled Wood Owl in Prayagraj||In a first confirmed sighting, the extremely rare and endangered Mottled Wood Owl (Strix ocellata) has been clicked in Prayagraj. Endemic to the forests of central India, Mottled Wood Owl has been listed as a ‘threatened’ species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List since 2016 and has been clicked by an ardent wildlife photographer and Sangam city’s laparoscopy and cancer surgeon Dr Arpit Bansal near the Harish-Chandra Research Institute (HRI) campus in Jhunsi. Incidentally, the spotting of this rare owl comes close to the festival of Diwali during which many owls are illegally caught and sacrificed for black magic in the country. “It was during the morning hours near HRI campus in Jhunsi recently when I spotted the Mottled Wood Owl. Owls are generally nocturnal, so it was a very thrilling moment for me to capture the Mottled Wood Owl during the daytime, even though the light was poor at that time due to clouds,” shared Dr Bansal, reliving the moment. Perched on a branch, the owl was being bothered by crows and other birds. Suddenly, it landed on the ground for hunting. And, there, I got my dream shot of the rare Mottled Wood Owl in Prayagraj, added the doctor who is director of a 200-bed Jeevan Jyoti Hospital in Prayagraj. “Its spotting is very rare, so we also uploaded its details on ebird.org — an international online database of bird observations providing scientists, researchers and amateur naturalists with real-time data about bird distribution and abundance. It will also inform the bird lovers about the possible habitat of this owl and encourage its conservation,” shared the 35-year-old medico, who has already clicked 887 species of different birds out of the total 1,349 found in India. With the click of Mottled Wood Owl, Dr Bansal has succeeded in photographing five endangered species of Owls within the busy city limits, including Spotted Owlet, Jungle Owlet, Barn Owl and Indian Scops Owl—all of which are under threat owing to depleting forest cover. “With this click, I have succeeded in photographing 31 out of 36 species of owls found in India, in their natural habitat,” he added. Dr Bansal, who has been a wildlife and bird photographer for the past ten years, says that it is high time that we start spreading awareness about owls here in Prayagraj and also in other parts of the country so that people become aware and come forward to protect these beautiful and useful birds, and put a check to any illegal activity related to harming them. DFO Prayagraj Ramesh Chandra said over 250 bird species have been spotted in Prayagraj, over the years, by bird lovers and conservationists. “We are aware of the presence of some species of owls like Jungle Owlet, Spotted Owlet, Collared Scops Owl, Short-eared Owl and Rock Eagle Owl in and around the city. Spotting of endangered Mottled Wood Owl is good news, and all efforts will be made to protect it from any harm,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/doctor-clicks-rare-mottled-wood-owl-in-prayagraj-101634747602365.html
20-10-2021||Mumbai||BMC plans 50 locations for setting up food trucks in Mumbai, slots to be auctioned||Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Wednesday directed civic body officials to formulate a comprehensive policy for allowing setting up of food trucks at 50 locations in the city. According to the plan, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) plans to draft a policy after taking into consideration the views from other stakeholders like the health department of BMC, Mumbai Traffic Police (MTP) and Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB).The slots for setting up food trucks at 50 locations will be auctioned on the same lines as slots for on-street parking lots are done in the city. Once the policy is out, the BMC will float tenders and pick bidders to run the food trucks. Some of the food trucks will be given by the BMC to women self-help groups.A BMC official who attended the meeting said, “A detailed food truck policy will be rolled out. It will be selling cooked food and not vegetables and fruits. The finer details will be worked out. All food trucks will require an NOC from the traffic police and other departments like the fire brigade. We will also identify the location and fix timings for the food trucks as part of the policy.”The official added, “As per the plan, every ward will get at least two locations where food trucks can be kept. However, the number of slots will be depending on the area available in the particular area.”Earlier, the plan was to set up food trucks in khau gallis in all 24 administrative wards of the city. However, the city was hit with a second wave days later with cases starting to increase from February 2021 due to which the plan was put on hold. The idea of food trucks was pushed by state tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray who announced having food trucks across the city to boost tourism. In the 2021-22 budget, BMC reserved ₹200 crore for creating food hubs including beautification of footpaths, beautifying space below flyovers etc.Meanwhile, the BMC will continue the stay on the distribution of food trucks by corporators in the city. Also, it has not taken a call on taking back the food trucks already distributed by Shiv Sena corporators in Byculla. However, on the other hand, BJP has asked Chahal to seize the food trucks running in the city that were already distributed by the BMC. In a letter to Chahal, BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said, “Around 30 trucks are already distributed in Byculla and other areas by the local corporators. These food trucks should be taken back by the BMC and seized till a formal policy is approved. With the lack of a policy, these food trucks distributed by the BMC using taxpayers’ money are running illegally.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-plans-50-locations-for-setting-up-food-trucks-in-mumbai-slots-to-be-auctioned-101634747542364.html

Amarinder on Tuesday said that he planned to announce his political party soon. He also talked about a seat-sharing arrangement with the BJP if the farmers’ issue was resolved, besides looking at an alliance with like-minded parties such as breakaway Akali groups, particularly Dhindsa and Brahmpura factions.

20-10-2021||Mumbai||Param Bir Singh untraceable; not inclined to continue no coercive action statement, state tells HC||The Bombay high court (HC), while hearing the petition of former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh, was informed by the state government that it was not willing to continue its statement of no coercive action including arrest, as Singh was not traceable. The state submitted that as there were developments in other matters it could not continue the statement which was made concerning the case registered against Singh by a police officer under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Singh has sought quashing of the first information report (FIR). While hearing the petition, a division bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice Sarang Kotwal was informed by senior advocate Darius Khambata, for the state that as reports suggested that he (Singh) was not traceable, the state was not willing to give a statement in his matter. However, senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani for Singh submitted that as the state government had not declared his client as absconding, it should continue the statement till further hearing. Jethmalani submitted that Singh had responded twice to the summons issued to him in the atrocity’s cases. Apart from sections of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, various other sections were added in the FIR lodged on a complaint of police inspector Bhimrao Ghadge. Ghadge has alleged that when he refused to comply with Singh’s order of dropping the names of a few persons from an FIR in 2015, Singh had got FIRs against him and had also hurled castiest remarks against him for non-compliance. In another petition filed by Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Rashmi Shukla, senior counsel Mahesh Jethmalani who represented her reiterated that Maharashtra government’s action of filing an FIR against her in the illegal phone tapping case was an attempt to keep a gun on her head. Jethmalani submitted that Shukla had performed her duty according to the mandate given to her and had maintained secrecy as per the law. Jethmalani further argued that there was no reason for the state to invoke the Official Secrets Act against Shukla when the state maintained that the report, she submitted to her superior was a roving probe. The senior advocate argued that the FIR against Shukla was nothing but an attempt to suppress the presence of political influence and corruption in police transfers and postings. He added that the state government was trying to shield chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, who had sanctioned the phone tapping while he was the additional chief secretary. “There is a serious attempt to avoid judicial, CBI or ED scrutiny of these documents,” submitted Jethmalani while seeking quashing of the FIR. The bench will continue hearing of Shukla’s petition on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/param-bir-singh-untraceable-not-inclined-to-continue-no-coercive-action-statement-state-tells-hc-101634747062175.html

But the boat couldn’t stand the river current and capsized mid way. Sundar Lal (65), died while others were left stranded and later airlifted by an army chopper from Bareilly.In a separate incident near Talia ghat, another boat carrying 17 persons, including seven men, seven women and three children, capsized in Ghaghra while they were returning from Jungle Matera.District officials said “Nine among these, including three women, have been rescued while search for eight persons were on.”They added “NDRF teams had been deployed to locate and trace the missing eight persons.”Meanwhile, overflowing Sharda river following heavy discharge of 533000 cusec waters from Banbasa barrage on Tuesday wreaked havoc in dozens of villages and towns in Pallia, Nighasan and Lakhimpur tehsils.The overflowing river submerged the Bhira-Pallia state highway forcing officials to suspend road-traffic. Dozens of villages and agricultural fields were left inundated in knee-deep water.

The state health department has shared a list of such people with all the districts to locate them and ensure they are fully vaccinated. The communication from the office of health secretary Arun Kumar Singh has also directed all districts to ramp up daily vaccination targets and ensure at least 3 lakh persons get the jab every day. Currently, the state is inoculating just over one lakh people daily. “Those on the overdue list as per the CoWin portal should be located and inoculated immediately. District wise overdue list of Covishield and Covaxin is attached,” said the letter from the health secretary’s office. As per the provided list, 8.61 lakh persons are due for the second dose of Covishield and 3.86 lakh have been due for the second dose of Covaxin across the state. Only around 20% of the 2.46 crore eligible population above 18 years in the state have been fully vaccinated, while 60 per cent of the eligible persons have got the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Senior officials in the health department said awareness and migration could be key possible reasons for people not turning up for the second dose. “Many people especially in the rural areas are not very educated so they might not be aware of the exact vaccine cycle. Also, many people migrate for work. They might even have taken the shots there and that could be showing in data of that state. We are taking requisite steps to corroborate and adjust those figures, besides creating awareness about vaccination,” said a senior official of the national health mission department. The official said directions have been given to the districts to approach all on the overdue list through their registered mobile number and take action accordingly..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/covid19-vaccination-j-khand-health-dept-looks-for-over-12-lakh-people-overdue-for-second-dose-101634745982169.html
20-10-2021||Mumbai||SRA can work out four steps to restart stalled slum projects in Mumbai: State||To give a boost to the slum revamp schemes, the state government has given a green signal to the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) to work out four alternate methods to kickstart the stalled slum projects.There are about 225-250 SRA schemes in Mumbai which are currently languishing due to various factors like monetary issues, lack of consent from the slum dwellers as well as compliance issues.The meeting headed by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray asked the SRA to take stringent methods to ensure that the stalled projects get rolling. In most cases, the slum dwellers have vacated their houses and are sufferings as the builders have not given them their promised monthly rents.The first option was that banks and financial institutions which have funded the project can remove the old developer and bring the new developer on board to start the project. The second option was Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) signing a joint venture (JV) with the SRA in order to take care of its sale as a part of its affordable housing scheme. The third option: the builders to be allowed to pledge their sale portion to the banks and financial institutions to raise loans. The last option will be direct inviting tenders by the SRA from reputed builders to take over the stalled project.There are 12.50 lakh slums with 62 lakh residents staying in them. The SRA scheme, which was started in 1996, has been moving at a snail’s pace as it faced with problems like corruption, infighting as well as regulatory problems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sra-can-work-out-four-steps-to-restart-stalled-slum-projects-in-mumbai-state-101634745922205.html

The vaccination drive is being held from 9am to 4pm for one week starting Wednesday.This decision was taken by TMC after the State government asked educational institutes to organise such drives within their premises for the convenience of the students as only fully vaccinated are allowed to attend college.Colleges within Mumbai and neighbouring cities began on Wednesday. Most colleges had students from post-graduation or research based attending physically. However, in Thane city, a few students from the second year and third year who had completed their first term also visited to get inoculated.“We have made separate arrangements for vaccination. A few classrooms have been kept aside for vaccination and as waiting rooms. A schedule has been prepared for students who have not taken the first jab. We have called them batch wise to get vaccinated this week within the college premises itself. For those who are due for the second dose, we have made both doses available,” said Dr Hemant Chitte, principal, Dnyansadhna College, Thane.Nishant Jaiswal, 20, TYBCom student, got his second shot of Covaxin on Wednesday. “I had taken the first jab in a centre near my home in Mulund but this seemed convenient as I could attend college as well. Although our lectures are over, I can come over for solving doubts once I am fully vaccinated. I felt this was an easier process as there was no queue and I could be inoculated as soon as I reached college,” said Jaiswal.Similarly, students at Anand Vishwa Gurukul can also avail this facility for the next three days.“Each day, we are providing around 500 doses for students in both colleges. If colleges show interest, we can start this process in other institutes as well. This is part of our initiative to reach out to all sections of the society. We have provided a separate women-only facility and also have four mobile vaccination units that reach out to different parts of the city and also vaccinate the destitute,” said Naresh Mhaske, Thane mayor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/tmc-sets-up-vaccination-centres-at-two-thane-colleges-for-students-101634745864110.html

Agriculture officials have started assessing the damage to crops in various areas. A report will be sent to the government.” District agriculture officer (DAO) of Purnia, Prakash Chandra Mishra, said, “We are assessing the damage. October rainfall has delayed rabi sowing by at least 15 days.” However, DAO of Saharsa Dinesh Prasad Singh said, “There is no report of any damage to crops in the district due to rains.”Farmers in Purnia and Saharsa, where paddy is cultivated over large areas, are a worried lot. “Our paddy in flowering stage has been damaged,” said Sunil Singh, a farmer in Dhamdaha. Mukhtar Alam of Shrinagar block in Purnia said, “Paddy, which was almost at harvesting stage, has been damaged by rains and winds.”In Darbhanga, Baidyanath Thakur, a farmer of Ratanpur village in Jale block, had cultivated paddy this time with great expectations. However, for the last three days, intermittent rains have shattered all his dreams. His paddy crop in about 4-5 bighas of land has been completely damaged.In Moujampur village under Benipur block, Radheshyam Mahto says sowing of paddy this year was delayed due to incessant rains and floods. Now, standing crop got ruined due to strong wind and rains.DAO in Darbhanga, Radha Raman, said actual crop damage would be known only after an assessment, to be conducted after weather turns conducive.District statistical officer, Shambhu Prasad Yadav, said the total average rainfall recorded in district till Wednesday in October was 219.94 mm, the highest in last five years.

Addressing the national executive meeting of his party Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) in New Delhi on Wednesday, Manjhi, whose party is a constituent of the ruling National Democratic Alliance in Bihar, alleged that Union minister S P Singh Baghel and Jaisiddeshwar Shivacharya Mahaswamiji (both BJP MPs), Congress MP Mohammad Sadique, Trinamool MP Aparupa Poddar and Independent MP Navneet Ravi Rana represent seats reserved for SCs after contesting on the basis of forged certificates. Manjhi claimed 15-20 per cent of quota benefits for Dalits in jobs and even local body polls are usurped by others on the basis of forged caste certificates. “The trend should stop,” he said. According to PTI, though there was no immediate reaction from these parliamentarians to his allegations, most of them in the past have denied the charge. However, Baghel’s aides have said his caste is notified as an SC in Uttar Pradesh from where he has been elected. The Bombay High Court had cancelled Rana’s caste certificate but she got relief from the Supreme Court which had in June stayed the judgment. This is not the first time Manjhi has taken a line that has embarrassed ally BJP. In May this year, he had questioned the use of PM’s photo on Covid vaccination certificates. The tweet, though, was later deleted. The HAM (S) president also demanded a common schooling system for everyone and a separate electoral roll for Dalits. “Common schooling for children from different strata of society will bring equality. Reservations will then not be needed if the review of such an education brings out positive outcomes in 10 years,” he suggested and announced dissolution of all organisational bodies of the party. Talking to media persons later, Manjhi was also critical of peace efforts initiated by the government in Kashmir. “The Union government may be making efforts to usher in peace in Kashmir but results are not visible, “he said while referring to killings of migrants from Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/5-mps-elected-on-forged-caste-certificates-manjhi-101634745742126.html

Superintendent of police (SP), Crime, Ashutosh Mishra said that cops of all police stations, especially, in rural areas had been asked to remain alert during the festive season as liquor smugglers might try to take advantage of this period. “Cops are keeping strict vigil on highways and launching routine checking drives, besides patrolling on alternate routes, which may be used by smugglers to enter the district, have been increased, he said. Police had recently arrested two persons who were involved in smuggling and supply of spurious country liquor to country liquor shops in trans-Ganga area.On Tuesday, a team of Handia police laid a trap near Bhiti crossing and intercepted an SUV after a chase.

20-10-2021||Mumbai||90% cases filed by NCB are fake, alleges Nawab Malik; PIL to follow||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief spokesperson Nawab Malik on Wednesday continued his attack on the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) stating that most of the cases filed by the investigative agency were “fake” and “victims” were considering filing a public interest litigation (PIL). Malik spoke to reporters shortly after the Special Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) court rejected the bail plea of Aryan Khan on grounds that there was prima facie evidence which indicated that the 23-year-old was indulging in “illicit drug activities on a regular basis”. Malik on Wednesday claimed that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is in opposition in Maharashtra, was in connivance with NCB officials to defame the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. Malik added that he was working on collecting evidence which he would disclose next week. “Ninety per cent of the cases filed by the NCB in the last one year are fake. It is going to be established one day before the court of law. I am personally collecting evidence on fake cases. A few advocates will be filing a PIL on behalf of the victims,” he said. “I will also come out with evidence on how they tried to defame the MVA government in the last one year,” Malik, who is the state’s Minority development minister, said. The NCP leader, who has held several press conferences since October 6 — three days after Khan, the son of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, and seven others were arrested following an NCB raid on a holiday cruise ship scheduled to travel to Goa — also said that the case against Khan was fake, as the seizure pictures of contraband circulated by the NCB was from taken at the office of NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede and not on the spot. The NCB was making charges based on WhatsApp chats and not by conducting urine and blood tests. “Earlier, the officials used to collect urine and blood samples of those detained from rave parties and cases used to be filed on the basis of their positive reports. In contrast, the NCB in the last one year has accused everyone as a consumer but did not take their blood and urine samples. Instead the agency is using their WhatsApp chats to make allegations and delay bail,” Malik said. Malik’s son-in-law, Sameer Khan was arrested by the NCB for alleged drug possession in January. Sameer Khan is now out on bail. On Wednesday Malik said that a similar strategy was adopted against Sameer Khan. “NCB said they have financing proof of ₹5 lakh as WhatsApp chats held between his two sons-in-law but when the charge sheet was filed there was no mention of the WhatsApp chat. It means they wanted to create trouble and ensure the bail plea of the accused is rejected,” Malik added. “There is a complaint filed at Versova police in April by a person saying a few people tried to extort money in the name of Sameer Wankhede,” Malik said. The BJP responded to Malik’s allegations stating that the NCP is hampering the anti-drug movement. Keshav Upadhye, party spokesperson said, “Is NCP supporting the anti-drug movement or are they against it? We have been raising this question since day one. Making allegations every now and then against the enforcement agency will not only hamper the movement but will also affect its morale?” Upadhye said. “Aryan Khan’s bail was denied by the court and Malik can also move the court if he is not satisfied with the court’s decision,” Upadhye added. “I am doing my job and whatever will come, will answer to the honorable court,” NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede said.

20-10-2021||Lucknow||Samajwadi Party, SBSP become allies for 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly polls||The Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP), a former BJP ally-turned-rival, have become allies for the 2022 UP assembly polls.Both the Samajwadi Party and the SBSP announced the alliance on Wednesday. Before the announcement, SBSP president Om Prakash Rajbhar, a former minister in the Yogi Adityanath government, and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav met at the Samajwadi Party state headquarters in Lucknow. SBSP chief general secretary Arvind Rajbhar was also present at the meeting that finalised the alliance for the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly polls.Om Prakash Rajbhar, in a tweet in Hindi, said: “The BJP will be wiped out this time. The Samajwadi Party and the Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party have come together. The days of the BJP government, which betrayed all sections along with Dalits, backward, and minorities, are numbered.”Om Prakash Rajbhar and Akhilesh Yadav were in talks, intermittently, for more than a year. Simultaneously, the SBSP chief had also been working on other alliances and frequently met AIMIM chief Assaduddin Owaisi and Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party-Lohia (PSP-L) chief Shivpal Yadav (Akhilesh’s uncle).Om Prakash Rajbhar had founded the SBSP in 2002. His party contested all the Lok Sabha and assembly elections (both in eastern UP and in some constituencies of Bihar) since then. The SBSP has its support base among the Rajbhar and a few other backward class communities in eastern UP and the bordering areas of Bihar.The SBSP had its first electoral success when Rajbhar had allied with the BJP ahead of the 2017 UP assembly polls. The SBSP had won four seats then and the BJP government inducted Om Prakash Rajbhar as the minister for backward classes and disabled welfare. However, the relationship soured soon after Rajbhar’s frequent statements against the Yogi and Modi governments. He had been demanding “better treatment” of Rajbhars and also the inclusion of the community in the list of scheduled castes. In 2019, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath had dismissed Om Prakash Rajbhar from the state cabinet after he accused the government of not doing enough for the backward castes.The Yogi government also dismissed seven members of SBSP, including Rajbhar’s son Arvind Rajbhar, from their posts in various UP government committees.The Samajwadi Party confirmed the alliance through a statement in which the Samajwadi Party state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said: “This is the beginning of the end of the oppressive rule of the BJP...the founder of Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party, Shri Omprakash Rajbhar, has always been fighting for the poor, farmers, labourers, downtrodden and backward classes. SBSP has always talked about social justice, whether it is reservation based on population and economic status, implementation of the report of the social justice committee, technical education in primary schools, domestic electricity bill waiver, 50% reservation for women, free treatment to the poor, employment to the unemployed…etc.”Chaudhary further said: “There are 18-22% Rajbhar voters in Purvanchal with SBSP. The party influences more than 150 seats of eastern UP. There is deep penetration in the assembly seats of Varanasi, Devipatan, Gorakhpur, Azamgarh divisions of the state. SBSP also has a stronghold on sub-castes like Bansi, Aarkh, Arkvanshi, Kharwar, Kashyap, Pal, Prajapati, Bind, Banjara, Bari, Biar, Vishwakarma, Nai and Paswan.”While Om Prakash Rajbhar had been interacting with Owaisi or Shivpal, he also had met UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh in August, triggering speculation that SBSP and BJP would ally again.After the meeting with Swatantra Dev Singh, Om Prakash Rajbhar had said: “In politics, anything can happen. In politics, there are no permanent friends or enemies.”Om Prakash Rajbhar had also formed a Bhagidari Morcha for smaller anti-BJP parties to ally.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav had been saying that his party would not ally with any big political parties and would strike strategic alliances with small, regional anti-BJP parties. He had been also saying that with its allies, SP will win 400 seats in 2022 polls.

20-10-2021||Pune||Parents unhappy about delay in education department’s fee waiver notification||PUNE: The education department on Wednesday issued a notification that the government resolution (GR) dated August 12 about the 15% fee waiver for the academic year 2021-22 should be strictly implemented. While parents have been waiting for the implementation of the fee waiver first announced in the GR issued by the state government on August 12, members of the schools’ association said that it is not mandatory for all schools to give the waiver.D G Jagtap, director of the secondary and higher secondary education department, issued the notification. “All officials are directed to implement the fee waiver for schools and educational institutions in their respective area as per the GR issued by the state government,” he said.As per the GR issued on August 12, parents who have paid the full fee should either get a reimbursement or the excess amount should be adjusted in the next year. Parents can also file complaints with the divisional fee regulatory authority in case schools do not comply.Parents are unhappy about the delay in issuing the notification. Jayshree Deshpande, Pune division president of the All India Parents, Students and Teachers Association, said, “The education department has delayed the notification for schools which is causing a lot of distress to parents. Due to the pandemic, parents have lost their jobs and fee waiver is important for many families. However, the delay reflects that officials are not taking the parents’ grievances seriously. Due to partial or non-payment of fees, many schools are denying online education to students, leading to learning loss for them.”Meanwhile, the schools’ association said that the matter is in court and no action can be taken against schools that are not implementing the fee waiver.Rajendra Singh, working president of Independent English School Association (IESA), Maharashtra, stressed that it is not compulsory for all schools to give the waiver. “We as an association and our members have approached the court in this regard. As of now, no coercive action can be taken against schools that are not giving the 15% fee waiver for this academic year. As the matter is in court, whatever the judgment of the honourable high court will be accepted by us. Meanwhile, these letters will not be applicable to us as the matter is subjudice,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/parents-unhappy-about-delay-in-education-department-s-fee-waiver-notification-101634742742026.html
20-10-2021||Mumbai||BMC to come up with safe school zones to make roads and footpaths in Mumbai children-friendly||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has launched a plan to create a safe school zone in the city, to make roads and footpaths outside schools safe for children. As part of this plan, the BMC aims to create child-friendly and walkable school zones in Mumbai. This includes testing design solutions that make roads walkable, barrier-free, safer, and more vibrant for all road users, especially children.On Wednesday, as part of its pilot project, the BMC launched ‘Safe School Zone’ at Byculla’s Mirza Ghalib Road. This road is home to two schools, namely Christ Church School and St Agnes High School. The BMC in partnership with Mumbai Traffic Police (MTP) and World Resources Institute (WRI) launched this project as schools across the country reopen after a year and a half to make way for safer, vibrant, walkable child-friendly streets in Mumbai.According to WRI, between 2017 and 19, a 500-meter area around Christ Church recorded 23 crashes and three fatalities. This also included two children who suffered serious injuries while on their way back home and one student’s death. Of the 2,610 school campuses in Mumbai, 28% have witnessed more than three fatalities within a 500-meter walking radius between 2017 and 19.Owing to such incidents, the design solutions of (Safe School Zone) will include demarcation of the school zone using signages, road markings, providing designated areas for walking and waiting, multi-utility zones including pick-up and drop-off zones, child-friendly spaces with playful elements and a vibrant pedestrian crossing. The pilot project using low-cost material will aid in undertaking feedback from the neighborhood, before making it permanent on-ground.According to BMC officials, going further based on the response and the success at Byculla more such zones will be created in the city. The criteria for selection will be based on the vulnerability of the road to accidents etc. Manish Valanju, assistant commissioner, E-ward, under which Byculla falls, said, “We will assess the trial, incorporate feedback from all stakeholders, including traffic police, school management and local community and prepare a plan for permanent implementation.”Rais Shaikh, local corporator from the Samajwadi Party (SP), said, “While we work hard to provide quality education to students and improve infrastructure inside schools, it is also important to look at safer access to schools. In Mumbai, even if the school is at a walking distance, many parents/guardians take their vehicle out as it’s not safe for children to walk on these roads. This pilot project will help implement it further around other schools in the city.”Further, this project is similar to the lines of junction improvement undertaken by the BMC along with MTP and WRI. In October 2019, WRI India had conducted a workshop with students at Christ Church School to understand what they would like to see around their school. This included a walk around their school to understand what they like/dislike and visualization exercises where students were asked to add elements of their choice on the street. WRI India also conducted stakeholder consultations and surveys to understand the mode of commute, time spent by children in commute and the challenges they faced.Meanwhile, Rohit Tak, Manager, Sustainable Cities and Transport, WRI India, said, “Almost 57% of the parents had said that the streets around their school precinct are not safe for children owing to several reasons, including lack of quality footpaths and vehicular conflicts.”Tak added, “Children are more prone to risks compared to adults given their smaller size, cognitive development and perception of risk. Our plan looks at a safer, child-friendly street that will make their school-going journey comfortable and enjoyable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-to-come-up-with-safe-school-zones-to-make-roads-and-footpaths-in-mumbai-childrenfriendly-101634742381881.html

20-10-2021||Lucknow||Double engine BJP government scripted turnaround in Uttar Pradesh: PM Modi in Kushinagar||Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi on Wednesday said the double engine Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre and in Uttar Pradesh (UP) has brought a turnaround in the state within four-and-a-half years.In contrast, the previous Samajwadi Party government had blocked development and welfare schemes launched by the central government, he said.PM Modi was addressing a public meeting on Barwa farm ground in Kushinagar district of eastern Uttar Pradesh after inaugurating the international airport there and laying the foundation of a government medical college, besides 12 development schemes.The people of Kushinagar were waiting for an international airport and a medical college for long, he said.Invoking Gautam Buddha and Maharishi Valmiki, Modi said the development projects have been launched on an auspicious day when Buddhists are observing Abhidhamma Day and people are celebrating the birth anniversary of Valmiki who compiled the Ramayana.As he welcomed the people in the local dialect Bhojpuri, the crowd responded with slogans.A network of airports, roads, hospitals, investment in tourism and hospitality sectors and industrialisation would change the scenario in the backward areas of east UP soon, giving employment opportunities to the youths, the prime minister said.With the medical college, people residing in the area will get protection from encephalitis, he said.The BJP government was working to fulfil the aspirations of the people and the confidence of the deprived people will increase when they have basic facilities like house, power supply, cooking gas, toilets and direct drinking water supply to their home, he said.People know that the central and the state governments are aware of their aspirations, he said.Attacking the previous Samajwadi Party government, Modi said it was not concerned with the development and welfare of the people of Uttar Pradesh. The Samajwadi Party did not follow the ideals of socialist ideologue Ram Manohar Lohia but promoted scams and mafias.The previous government also worked for the promotion of a family, he alleged.While the launch of development and welfare schemes was a challenge in Uttar Pradesh under the previous regime, the BJP government kick-started projects with ease, he said. UP leads in Covid vaccination as well as in the fight against TB and malnutrition, he said, adding that women benefitted from the launch of welfare schemes.During the Covid pandemic, a free ration scheme was launched, he said.The rule of law was established in UP under the Yogi Adityanath government and the mafia, which had grabbed the land and property of the poor under the patronage of the previous regime, had been demolished now.Fear has been instilled among mafia, he said, adding that the BJP government is committed to taking UP to new heights of development.Modi said the double engine government had credited ₹80,000 crore into the accounts of the farmers for procurement of agriculture products and ₹27,000 crore under the PM Kisan Nidhi Samman scheme.The sugarcane farmers are getting highest rate of the cane in UP and Yogi government has credited ₹1.50 lakh crore into the account of the cane farmers after procuring sugarcane, he said.With the construction of roads and revival of sugarmills, the farmers can sell their crops with ease, the prime minister said. Stating that promotion of bio-fuel and ethanol will benefit farmers, he said the BJP government is working for the welfare of small farmers.Noting that UP has given the maximum prime ministers to the country, he said the history of the state cannot be limited to seven decades.It has a glorious history and legacy, and is the land of Lord Ram, Krishna, Tirthankars, Tulsidas, Kabir and Ravidas, he said.Holy places are located at short distances across the state and gurudwaras in Agra and Pilibhit are revered by all.The legacy and tradition of UP should be promoted, he said.Greeting the people ahead of the coming festivals of Diwali and Chhath Puja, Modi said, “I will urge the people to be vocal for local. The purchase of items from local people will not only promote local products but also add to the income of local craftsmen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/double-engine-bjp-government-scripted-turnaround-in-uttar-pradesh-pm-modi-in-kushinagar-101634736261477.html

The drivers are being trained in operating the fog-safety device, which is a GPS-controlled device. Ludhiana station director Tarun Kumar said, “We want to ensure the safety of passengers and hence are providing special training to train drivers. These workshops are open for drivers from any district and state. Drivers from Ludhiana, Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ambala division and Firozpur Division participate in these sessions.” “It is really difficult to run the trains when visibility is poor due to dense fog. But the fog-safety device will alert drivers of the next signal well in advance and make navigation easier.” The officer said drivers are being trained to ply the train at a certain speed. “They should not miss any signal and thus the speed of the train should be adjusted accordingly,” stated Kumar. Another railway officer said the device also helps run trains at a decent speed amid fog. “Usually, trains get delayed due to thick fog which creates hassles for passengers. The device has been fed with all railway routes. The drivers just need to fill the route to be followed by the train and the device will give sound alerts before each signal. Thus, drivers don’t need to move the trains at a very low speed; they can run it at a moderate speed using the alerts from the device,” said an official.According to officials, no train accident has been reported in recent years, but these workshops are being organised as a precautionary measure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bracing-for-winter-northern-railways-trains-drivers-in-navigating-through-fog-101634732901351.html

It is also causing inconvenience to the public,” Priyanka Gandhi was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. She also said she did not understand the fuss behind her visiting the family of the man. “They say I cannot go to Agra. They stop me wherever I go. Should I keep sitting in restaurants because it is politically convenient for them? I want to meet them, what is the big deal?,” Priyanka said.Arun, a sanitation worker, was accused of stealing ₹25 lakh from the warehouse of the police station on Saturday night.

20-10-2021||Dehradun||As Uttarakhand rain deaths rise to 50, Oppn hammers BJP govt for ‘inaction’||Dehradun: Uttarakhand’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) faced stinging attacks from the Opposition that blamed the Pushkar Singh Dhami government for not taking enough steps to minimise the loss of lives after the weather department’s forecast of heavy rainfall.At least 50 people, most of them in Nainital district, have died after heavy rain on October 18 and 19 triggered a flash flood and landslides, resulting in dozens of deaths.“The government should have taken the warning more seriously and made more efforts to save the lives of people. But they did little,” Uttarakhand Congress president Ganesh Godiyal said on Wednesday.On Sunday, India Meteorological Department (IMD) Dehradun centre put out an alert for heavy to very heavy rainfall from October 17 to 19. On October 18, it issued a red alert that forecast heavy to very heavy rainfall in Nainital, Pithoragarh, Bageshwar, Champawat and some other districts. Following the warning, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami had directed the authorities concerned to remain on alert mode and appealed to people not to take Char Dham yatra.Also Read: ‘My friends died in their sleep’: Uttarakhand rain fury leaves trail of despairA cloud burst in Ramgarh block on Monday morning, October 18, followed by incessant rain through the day led to heavy damage in Ramgarh as well as Okhladanda blocks in Nainital district, where the popular lake town was also inundated.“Now after people have died, the chief minister is conducting aerial surveys and visiting affected areas. Had the government’s response been more prompt, so many people wouldn’t have lost their lives in the rain-related indents in the state,’ Godiyal alleged.Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) spokesperson Sanjay Bhatt asked why such a large number of people lost their lives since the IMD did warn about the heavy rainfall. “We want to ask the government that when they knew about the situation in advance, why so many people lost their lives? Who is responsible for the deaths of so many people? The state government seems to have learnt no lessons from the 2013 Kedarnath tragedy”, he said.The BJP hit back, accusing the opposition of trying to politicise the response to the rainfall.This is not the time for politics, said Uttarakhand BJP president Madan Kaushik.“Both these parties should in fact come forward and cooperate with the government in helping people in the affected areas. It is sad that they are indulging in politics over this at this juncture. People of the state will not forget this,” Kaushik said. Kaushik said chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami is making all possible efforts to help people and save precious lives.“He is visiting all affected areas and taking stock of the situation. He has already announced compensation to the kin of those who died in the rain-related incidents. Under his leadership, all rescue agencies and police are conducting rescue and relief operations in the affected areas. Nearly 1500 people have been rescued and provided help in the affected areas because of the prompt action of all concerned”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/congress-aap-blames-dhami-govt-for-50-rain-deaths-bjp-says-no-time-for-politics-101634727860968.html
20-10-2021||Bangalore||Muslim marriage is a contract, not sacrament unlike Hindu marriage: Karnataka HC||The Karnataka high court has observed that the Muslim marriage is a “contract with many shades of meaning, not a sacrament unlike a Hindu marriage” adding, that “such a marriage dissolved by divorce per se does not annihilate all the duties and obligations of parties by lock, stock and barrel”.The bench made the remarks in an order dated October 7 while hearing a PIL filed by Ezazur Rehman (52) in Bengaluru. Rehman was seeking quashing of an order passed by the First Additional Principal Judge of Family Court on August 12, 2011, which held that the plaintiff is entitled to monthly maintenance at the rate of ₹3,000 from the date of the suit till the death of the plaintiff or till she gets remarried or till the death of the defendant.Rehman had divorced his wife Saira Banu by uttering Talaq on November 25, 1991, months after the marriage with a 'Mehr' of ₹5,000. After the divorce, Rehman then contracted another marriage and became the father of a child. Banu then filed a civil suit for maintenance on August 24, 2002.The plea was, however, dismissed by Justice Krishna S Dixit who said, "'marriage is a contract' has many shades of meaning; It is not a sacrament unlike a Hindu marriage, is true."Elaborating further, Justice Dixit said, “Such a marriage dissolved by divorce, per se does not annihilate all the duties and obligations of parties by lock, stock and barrel.”The Judge said the marriage amongst Muslims begins with the contract and graduates to the status as it ordinarily does in any other community. "This very status gives rise to certain justiciable obligations. They are ex contractu," the court said.The court said a Muslim ex-wife has a right to maintenance subject to satisfying certain conditions, is indisputable.In law, new obligations too may arise, of them being the circumstantial duty of a person to provide sustenance to his ex-wife who is affected by divorce. Quoting verses from Surah Al Bakra in Qur'an, Justice Dixit said a pious Muslim owes a moral and religious duty to provide subsistence to his destitute ex-wife."Ordinarily, the right of an ex-wife to maintenance does not extend beyond 'Iddat'. I should hasten to add that Islamic jurisprudence has not treated this as a thumb rule ever, although there is some juristic opinion in variance," Justice Dixit observed. "This norm has to be subject to the rider that the amount paid to the ex-wife, be it in the form of 'Mehr' or be it a sum qualified on the basis of 'mehr', or otherwise, is not an inadequate or illusory sum," the judge noted.He also pointed out that 'Mehr' is fixed inadequately and bride lacks equal bargaining power inter alia because of economic and gender-related factors.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/muslim-marriage-is-a-contract-not-sacrament-unlike-hindu-marriage-karnataka-hc-101634722052665.html
20-10-2021||Chandigarh||Childhood memories come rolling back with marbles||While decluttering our attic, my mom showed me a container full of marbles, asking me if they were of any use or should she chuck them away into the dustbin. Spreading them all over the floor elicited a wide smile on my face and I was reminded how during our childhood, my elder sibling and I would vie for garnering them. We played different games related to marbles, including ‘Kalli Jotta’ in which one made a blind guess if the number of marbles in the opponent’s tightly clenched fist was odd or even. The game, ‘Nishana’, was equally popular, more about hitting the aimed marble standing behind a marked line. However, nothing compared the thrill of indulging in ‘Pill Goli’, which children of all ages enjoyed. The player would sit down on the heels keeping the thumb on the ground with an upright outstretched palm. Having closed one eye, the player would bend the middle finger, holding one marble backwards with the aid of the index finger of the other hand to send the marble rolling along the ground. Taking turns, players would repeatedly squat to flick their respective marbles to shoot the opponent’s marbles off the way and rise again only to reach them right into the middle of a desired hole. Making a ‘pill/khutti (hole)’ in the earth was not everyone’s cup of tea. We had a specialist kid, Pintu, who was a master at digging a perfect hole, employing the sharp edge of a screwdriver; whose depth should neither be too deep nor too shallow, mouth not too wide nor too constricted. Our hard-won marbles would go clinking down the redundant transparent plastic jars, serving the dual purpose of keeping a close watch on their count besides making our peers envious of their ever-rising level. Losing our marbles even if we lost a single marble came as no surprise. Untimely rain failed to pour cold water on our spirited fervour thanks to an indoor game devised indigenously. By the flick of our fingers with a sudden, quick, and vigorous twist, we set our respective marbles to spin round and round on the floor to check whose marble turned for a longer time, using a stopwatch. Our full control on the game often caused our little minds to reflect as to why marbles couldn’t be India’s national game with an overt wish to win the coveted World Cup for our country. Over time, my sibling began using a bigger carry bag to accommodate more marbles at one place. Jealous, I failed to restrain myself from secretly lifting a few of his collection. The effectiveness of this rewarding short-cut egged me on, and I continued with the immoral practice until my sceptic brother once caught me unawares. Consequently, he kept half of his treasure-trove under lock and key, and the rest meant for playing remained before his eyes as a rule. One day, he came roaring, waving aloft a scintillating milky-white marble, nicknamed Chittu. He had just won that deemed ‘Kohinoor’ for its contrastingly appealing shade among other dark-coloured glass balls. The permission to play with his highly prized possession for a fixed time was granted only after I secretly completed his homework. Having spotted the same Kohinoor after ages as my hands drew back the scattered marbles, I was consumed with nostalgia, charming me into sending the picture of ‘Chittu’ to my brother’s phone. A quick reply from his side proved that the whirligig of time had detached his close association with his most treasured possession. His reply was, “What is it? In meeting, talk later.” unsharma3116@gmail.com The writer is a freelance contributor based in Una||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/childhood-memories-come-rolling-back-with-marbles-101634726000786.html
20-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi CM announces compensation of ₹50,000 per hectare for crop damage||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said his government will ensure compensation to farmers in the Capital who suffered losses because of crop damage this year. He added that the government fixed the rate of compensation at ₹50,000 per hectare.“Recently, I met groups of farmers who told me that they suffered losses because of crop damage caused by unseasonal rainfall this year. I want to tell farmers in Delhi that they need not be distressed. The Aam Aadmi Party government will continue to help farmers,” Kejriwal said during a video press briefing, adding that the Aam Aadmi Party set up the initiative when it came to power in the national capital in 2015.He said that suffering farmers, like previous years, will continue to get ₹50,000 per hectare as compensation for crop damage: “...This is the highest amount compared to all states, which pay ₹8,000 – ₹10,000. We will also make sure that the money is disbursed within one-and-a-half months or so. This year too, I have issued directions to ensure farmers who have suffered losses because of crop damage will get compensation of ₹50,000 per hectare.”Kejriwal added that district officials have started assessing losses. “... the survey will be completed within two weeks and the money disbursed to eligible farmers within one-and-a-half months after that,” he said.Government data shows that Delhi has around 29,000 acres of crop fields and around 21,000 farmers.Farmers, however, said that despite the initiative, most of them did not receive any compensation for crop loss since 2015.“Farmers in the city last received compensation for crop damage in 2015. However, only those who owned less than two hectares of land were compensated. This year, the government has not stated any such condition yet. We hope more farmers manage to get the compensation. Several farmlands flooded during the monsoon between 2016 and 2020, damaging crops, but farmers did not receive any money. The process is often very messy,” said Rajesh Shokeen, a farmer from Dichaon-Kalan village in the southwestern periphery in Delhi.Dinesh Rana, a farmer from Palla village in the northwestern periphery of Delhi, said, “This year, there has been significant crop damage because of excess and unseasonal rainfall. Farmers are in immense distress. However, we hope that the government streamlines the process of compensating us and we don’t have to run from pillar to post for compensation.”Earlier this year, the government commissioned a separate study to assess the grievances of farmers in the city and record concerns revolving around minimum support price, input costs, yield, crop loss, etc. The findings of the study, however, are yet to be published.Paras Tyagi, co-founder, Centre for Youth Culture, Law and Environment, a Delhi-based public policy group that works primarily on villages, said, “In Delhi, there are almost no subsidies for farmers. So, input cost is very high compared to several other states. Considering input costs, ₹50,000 per hectare is too little a compensation amount. Secondly, there are loopholes in the system because of which a large number of genuine farmers are often excluded from such schemes. That should not happen. Also, no farmer in the city has received any compensation under government schemes since 2015. So there is a lack of trust too. The government has to invest in making the system better.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-rs-50-000-per-hectare-for-crop-damage-to-delhi-farmers-101634719580095.html

20-10-2021||Chandigarh||Centre trying to bifurcate society, alleges former Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar||Former Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar on Tuesday alleged that the BJP-led Centre is trying to "bifurcate society" and create a "deep state" in Punjab.Referring to a news article hinting at a conspiracy in the Singhu border killing to end the farmers' protest, Jakhar took to Twitter and said, "Modi government dealing through shady characters! Thus, the proclaimed nationalists are not just demeaning themselves but also the institution of 'Government of India'."Speaking on the recent killings at Lakhimpur Kheri and murder at Singhu border, Jakhar said, "These are all totally independent separate incidents, but when you look at it from this angle--a cop who is a cat, who is a tout of the agencies, gives rise to the apprehensions of what we call the deep state. There is a definite attempt to bifurcate the society, to create divisions and sub-divisions within the community also."The leader said that through his tweet, he wanted to raise the concern of the presence of a 'dismissed cop' in the picture shown in the news clipping he shared and raised doubts over his involvement in the issue.Alleging conspiracy of the BJP-led government, Jakhar said, "Minister of State's (Home Affairs) statement on the day his son was involved in the killing of the innocent farmers is very indicative, he said 'Khalistan is behind that', what information did he have? The idea was to segregate and identify people."He also appealed to the BJP to withdraw the Central farm laws which he termed 'black laws'. "Negotiation must be started with the farmers," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/centre-trying-to-bifurcate-society-alleges-former-punjab-congress-chief-sunil-jakhar-101634712230257.html

20-10-2021||Chandigarh||Alleging corruption, BJP protests against closed-door meeting of Ludhiana Improvement Trust||Lambasting Raman Balasubramaniam, the chairperson of Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT), for not making the agenda of the trust meeting public and allegedly indulging in corrupt practices during the ‘closed-door’ meeting held on Tuesday, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) staged a protest outside the LIT office. The agitation took place at the same time when the chairperson and LIT trustees were participating in the meeting inside the office at Feroze Gandhi market. The protesters, led by district secretary Lucky Chopra and Ghumar Mandi mandal president Sandeep Wadhwa, alleged that on one hand, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi had been making tall claims of running a transparent government, but on the other, LIT has even restricted the entry of public in the office. Closed-door meetings are being held to benefit the close aides by bending the rules, they alleged. “It has been learnt that during the meeting held on Tuesday, LIT has approved cases for allotment of plots under locally displaced persons (LDP) category by bending the rules. Further proceedings of properties auctioned in the past are approved during the meeting. The chairperson had been involved in corrupt practices in the past and the state government should take action against him,” Chopra said. “Neither mediapersons were not allowed to enter the building nor the agenda was made public, which raises questions over the functioning of the chairperson and the LIT at large,” he added, while demanding the agenda to be made public. Meanwhile, Balasubramaniam said that the agenda of the meeting was sent to the trustees on October 14 and none of them complained about not receiving the same. “BJP leaders are levelling baseless allegations. The LIT cannot release each and every information as we have to keep secrecy in some of the issues as per the norms. The BJP leaders are raising hue and cry as I have tightened the noose around the property mafia in the LIT. No resolution or decision has been approved by moving against the norms. As far as the LDP cases are concerned, in few of the cases the court has recommended allotment of plots to residents while some have been recommended by the government. The final decision regarding the LDP cases has to be taken by the state government only,” he added. As per the information, around 23 resolutions were discussed during the trust meeting held on Tuesday, out of which at least seven were regarding the LDP cases. In LDP cases, the trust has to allot alternative plots to residents after their land is acquired by LIT for some project. Trustees Anil Parti, Vicky Gypsy, and Vijay Gaba along with LIT executive officer Kuljit Kaur were among the participants of the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/alleging-corruption-bjp-protests-against-closed-door-meeting-of-ludhiana-improvement-trust-101634685317169.html

20-10-2021||Chandigarh||Admn sets ball rolling for Chandigarh MC polls, reserves 16 of 35 wards||The process for the Chandigarh municipal corporation elections, scheduled in December, kicked off on Tuesday with the UT administration announcing reservation of wards. Of the 35 wards in the city, 16 have been reserved for three categories – nine for women (general), four for Scheduled Caste (SC) and three for SC (women) candidates. The remaining 19 will be open for the general category candidates. In the last elections held in 2016, the number of wards was 26, with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) winning from 20, the Congress from five, while one seat went to the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). Since then, UT merged 13 villages with MC, increasing the number of wards from 26 to 35. Till December 2020, only nine of the 22 villages in the city were under the civic body’s ambit. Among the wards reserved for SC candidates, including those for SC women, are ward numbers 7, 16, 19, 24, 26, 28 and 31.Ward numbers 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 18, 22 and 23 have been reserved for women (general) category candidates, and the remaining 2, 3, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 20, 21, 25, 27, 29, 30, 32, 33, 34 and 35 are for candidates from the general category. The election will be held on the basis of the 2011 census. The draw of lots was held at the UT State Guest House by the state election department in the presence of nominees of political parties. Equations set to changeAs areas of most wards have been changed due to increase in number of wards and re-carving of boundaries, many candidates will have to opt for areas other than those represented by them previously. In the BJP, among those affected by the reservation are former mayor Rajesh Kalia, who was sitting councillor from Maloya (ward number 28), but now the seat has gone to an SC woman candidate. Devinder Singh Babla, Congress’ leader of opposition in the MC House, will also have to consider his options, as his area (Sectors 27, 28 and 29) got reserved for a woman. Code of conduct likely in November second weekOfficials said the code of conduct is likely to come in force in November’s second week, following which the nomination process will commence. The election process is to be concluded by December 31, the date of expiry of the current term of MC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/admn-sets-ball-rolling-for-chandigarh-mc-polls-reserves-16-of-35-wards-101634684826257.html
20-10-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana lads rewrite history, bag U-19 cricket title after 19 years||It was exactly two years ago when the young Nishant Sindhu led Haryana to the Vijay Merchant U-16 Trophy title win. As the pandemic raged on and no cricket was played last season, Sindhu, like hundreds of young aspiring cricketers in India, was left disappointed.As he led Haryana to another national title win on Monday, this time in the prestigious Under-19 Vinoo Mankad Trophy finals at Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, Sindhu and his teammates only vindicated the belief and hard work being put in by the Haryana Cricket Association.Haryana beat Maharashtra by six wickets in the finals to cap off a campaign where the team didn’t lose a single game – both in the league stage and the knockouts. Incidentally, the last time Haryana had won the Under-19 title was way back in 2002-03. “It was disappointing to lose out on good cricket opportunities last season due to the pandemic. We would talk among ourselves and keep encouraging each other. The players were also hungry to do well knowing the U-19 World Cup is going to take place next year,” said 17-year-old Sindhu, son of a former state-level boxer from Rohtak.A left-hander, he scored 299 runs and took 12 wickets for Haryana in the tournament.Gruelling one-month camp did the trickHCA had organised a tough month-long camp in Faridabad where about 50 players from various parts of Haryana were invited. “Since it was the season’s first tournament, HCA planned the preparations and the players went through high-intensity training during the camp. They even travelled to nearby districts to play practice matches. They had to undergo two fitness tests, 2km run and sprint repeat within stipulated time, twice. By the end of the camp, all were match-fit. Then a pool of six-seven qualified coaches, including first-class cricketers Pankaj Thakur, Vijay Yadav, Sonu Rathee, Gaurav Vashisht and Vishal Sahni, were given charge of the camp. HCA asked a dietician to plan their menus during their stay. HCA wanted the team to clinch the title,” said former Haryana Ranji Trophy cricketer and now senior coach Ashwini Kumar.Haryana beat Uttarakhand, Baroda, Kerala and West Bengal in the league stage in Hyderabad. They won against top-team Vidarbha in the quarter-finals and then beat Rajasthan in the semi-finals at Ahmedabad. HCA went all out to motivate playersA few months ago, HCA also came to the rescue of the players whose parents lost jobs or faced pay cut due to the pandemic, just to make sure the cricketers did not suffer. A message was sent out to smaller districts like Panchkula, Rohtak and Bhiwani to ask the players to start training in batches after the second lockdown ended.“HCA has progressed immensely under former HCA secretary and ex-BCCI treasurer Anirudh Choudhary. He takes personal interest in all teams. The way he planned the camp for our U-19 team speaks a lot. We knew the same bunch which won us the Vijay Merchant Trophy two seasons ago, was with us for the Vinoo Mankad Trophy, so we fine-tuned their skills like that,” added Kumar.The Haryana U-19 team coach and former Ranji Trophy cricketer Pankaj Thakur also heaped praises on the players.“The players were pumped up ahead of the camp. They just wanted to play cricket, get match-fit and compete in the tournament for the title. Then I had to tell them about the importance of doing well in the tournament and also keep them calm at the same time as they were experiencing the bubble for the first time. I spoke to coaches of other state coaches also. We had the longest preparatory camp with set goals,” said the coach, who felt beating Vidarbha in the low-scoring quarter-finals was the best performance of the team. Batting first, Haryana scored 171 runs and thereafter bowled out Vidarbha at 164.The road aheadA Challenger Trophy for U-19 will be organised soon by the BCCI, along with some exposure tours abroad in the coming months, to provide India U-19 players enough opportunities ahead of the World Cup.“They play the Cooch Behar Trophy from November 16. HCA has planned another intensive camp beginning in four-five days as a run-up to the tournament. The Haryana team would like to carry the momentum forward and leave no stone unturned to win the Cooch Behar Trophy,” said Kumar, who has also coached the Haryana senior men’s team in the past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-lads-rewrite-history-bag-u-19-cricket-title-after-19-years-101634684822499.html

The courts must endeavour for a drug-free society and drug trafficking must be dealt with heavy hands... Measure of punishment in such cases cannot depend upon the social status or family background of the accused,” said the order. Mintu was booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act in 2019 after he was nabbed from a check post.A police team on patrolling duty in view of the General Elections in 2019 had caught him following a tip-off near the Kishangarh roundabout.

20-10-2021||Chandigarh||Air India penalised for not refunding ticket upgrade fee to Panchkula resident||The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has directed Air India to refund the economy-to-business upgrade fee to a Panchkula resident.Apart from the upgrade fee of ₹38,508, along with 9% interest, the airline has also been told to pay the complainant ₹5,000 as compensation for causing mental agony and harassment, and ₹5,000 as litigation cost. In his complaint, Pankaj Kumar Mahajan, a resident of Sector 6, Panchkula, had said that he had booked tickets for an Air India flight to travel from Delhi to Colombo, Sri Lanka, on February 16, 2019. After his ticket was confirmed, he was allowed to upgrade the economy class seats to business class on payment of upgrade price. He said as per norms of the airline, the seat’s upgrade status was required to be notified via email within one to three days, but no later than four hours before the flight’s departure. Also, if the seats are not upgraded, the fee will be refunded within five days from the flight departure. So, he applied for the upgrade on February 13, 2019, and paid ₹38,508 for it. But he was not provided an upgrade and the airline also failed to refund the money. Contesting the complaint, Air India said the business class seats in the flight on February 16, 2019, were fully booked. Thus, Mahajan could not be accommodated instantly. He had initially checked into economy class seats and was told if any business class seat falls vacant, he will be informed at the boarding gate and be accommodated, and if not, he will be duly compensated as per rules. The consumer commission held that the airline had failed to prove by way of any documentary evidence that they upgraded the seats one hour before the flight’s departure and also rejected the refund on false and frivolous grounds.“The complainant was therefore constrained to file the consumer complaint, causing undue harassment to him and practicing of the unfair trade practice on the part of airlines,” the commission held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/air-india-penalised-for-not-refunding-ticket-upgrade-fee-to-panchkula-resident-101634684755742.html

20-10-2021||Chandigarh||Centre must reverse decision on BSF’s jurisdiction: Sukhbir to PM||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Tuesday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene and rescind the decision to expand the Border Security Force’s (BSF’s) jurisdiction over vast swathes of Punjab along with the three farm laws. During a roadshow in the district, the Akali Dal chief said that he had written to the Prime Minister on this issue and pointed out the urgent need to review the central directive extending the jurisdiction of the BSF to over 50km along the barbed wire fence with Pakistan. Taking a dig at Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi for “surrendering the rights” of the state to the Centre, Sukhbir asked him to clarify as to why he had agreed to the proposal during his meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah on October 5. “The CM is only busy in getting photographs clicked these days. All attempts were being made to befool the people by laying various foundation stones. These foundation stones will remain stones only as no work will be undertaken on any of the projects in the next two months before imposition of the model code of conduct,” he added. Sukhbir also asked Channi to “get his act together” and ensure timely supply of DAP fertilisers to farmers. “My father Parkash Singh Badal during his term as Punjab CM used to make arrangements for procurement of the fertilisers two months in advance,” he said, adding that the Congress was only interested in fighting for the “top jobs” and had left the farmers at the “mercy of corporates”. The SAD chief asked Channi not to indulge in a “sham” by calling an investment summit after winding up the Punjab Invest department. “No investment was done in Punjab in last nearly five years and none is going to happen in the next two months,” he said, while suggesting the CM to take steps to control the spread of dengue in Punjab. Sukhbir said that the Centre should tell why the law and order situation in Jammu and Kashmir was being allowed to deteriorate. “J&K was turned into a union territory and it was the Centre’s responsibility to maintain law and order as well as ensure the security of members of the minority community,” he added. Earlier, the SAD president addressed members from various sections of society at the residence of party leader Gurdeep Gosha along with former minister Maheshinder Singh Grewal. ‘State needs a leader with ideas’ Sukhbir also spoke on how Ludhiana benefitted by the construction of two bypasses besides expansion of Ferozepur Road during the previous SAD regime. “Give me five years and you will see a different Punjab. Trade and industry needs a leader who has a vision because it is the future of the state. You don’t need money, you need plans,” he said. Sukhbir’s roadshow that started from Samrala Road took three hours to reach Fieldganj. He was also accompanied by local party candidate Pritpal Singh Pali. He paid obeisance at Guru Ravidas mandir and Gurdwara Baba Bachittar Singh. Sukhbir also participated in a ‘Shobha Yatra’ held at Daresi ground to celebrate Pargat Diwas of Bhagwan Valmiki.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/centre-must-reverse-decision-on-bsf-s-jurisdiction-sukhbir-to-pm-101634683855085.html

Director (health and family welfare) Dr Andesh Kang refused to admit that the situation was going out of hand. She said, “The government is making out all efforts manage the outbreak. The good part is that cases have started decreasing in the past few days.” She dismissed reports of a new breed of mosquito as the reason behind the spurt in dengue cases. “Nothing of that sort has been found in our studies so far. A longer spell of rain and humidity are also the reason behind breeding of mosquitoes this year,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/5-districts-record-two-thirds-of-punjab-s-total-dengue-count-101634675815565.html

She said only two months have remained for the start of the election and the people should not expect any employment or development from the incumbent government, which is currently busy in its infighting. “They promised development but failed, they promised better infrastructure but failed. They promised safety of citizens but we are seeing rise in crimes every single day. They (Congress) have failed the people of Punjab on every front,” she claimed.Joshi said the Congress government is riddled with corruption from top to bottom and the only thing they have achieved in the last five years is undoing all the good work the Akali Dal had done. “From the ministers to the ration depot holders, everyone associated with this government has betrayed your mandate,” he told the gathering.The SAD also released its election manifesto at the event. The manifesto promises of not accepting the controversial farm laws introduced by the central government, 1 lakh government jobs for the youth and 10 lakh new private sector jobs, 50 percent reservation for women in colleges and universities, and ensuring cheaper electricity for consumers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-govt-in-punjab-unable-to-deliver-on-pre-poll-promises-akali-mp-harsimrat-badal-101634675517418.html

But the accused cops — both serving and retired — moved an application opposing Bains’ appointment, saying he cannot lead the prosecution having represented the complainants in the Punjab and Haryana high court in the firing cases. In another petition, referring to the high court’s order staying investigations in cases pending against former director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini till February 2022, they asked the court to stay proceedings against all the accused till then. Six accused including, suspended inspector general of police Paramraj Singh Umranangal, former SSP Charanjit Singh Sharma, SP Bikramjit Singh and inspector Amarjit Singh appeared in the court on Tuesday. Additional district and sessions judge Harbans Singh Lekhi adjourned for hearing till October 29. Former Moga senior superintendent of police (SSP) Charanjit Singh Sharma’s counsel HS Saini said they challenged Banis’ appointment as it was the prosecution’s job to assist the court in a neutral manner. Bains was the counsel of Sukhraj Singh, son of Bhagwan Krishan Singh who was killed in the Behbal Kalan firing on October 14, 2015, and Ajit Singh, who was injured in the Kotkapura incident. ‘Claims of suspects not sustainable’Advocate Bains said the opposition of the accused to his appointment as special public prosecutor was not sustainable and they must show provision in the law on this. “Since they don’t have any valid point to make, they are filling these applications to waste time. We will file a reply and argue on the basis of facts on the next date,” he added.So far, designated government district lawyers have been appearing in the trial courts in the firing cases.In the Behbal Kalan case, challans have been presented and are pending trial. The prosecution supplied 1000-page documents to the accused following the directions of the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2015-police-firing-special-public-prosecutor-rs-bains-appears-in-faridkot-trial-court-for-first-time-accused-oppose-appointment-101634675094299.html

The chief of the Bhim Army, a scheduled caste (SC) rights organisation, who gave ₹5,000 in cash to Lakhbir’s sister Raj Kaur and assured her more financial aid, said the victim could not have desecrated the Guru Granth Sahib.Speaking to mediapersons, Azad sought a compensation of ₹1 crore to the victim’s dependents from the government. “We are with the family which has nowhere to go. The Punjab chief minister should provide government job to a member of the family,” he said. When contacted, Raj Kaur said, “I am upset and don’t want to speak on the matter right now.” Also, Lakhbir’s 37-year-old wife Jaspreet Kaur, who along with her three daughters has been living at her parental home in Amritsar district, refused to talk over phone. Jaspreet’s brother Sukhchain Singh, a carpenter, said, “My sister has three daughters but no income source. They struggle to make both ends meet. She has to do labour work in the farms.”“With the death of my brother-in-law, my sister has lost her only hope for the future. In such a situation, the government should award her compensation so that the family faces lesser hardships. We are not raising the demand for compensation fearing reprisal,” he added.The family, which belongs to the Majhabi Sikh community, has also won the support of other SC organisations and BJP leaders who say the victims’ dependants should be compensated.Sukhchain said, “Many persons have approached and contacted us assuring all kind of help. Yesterday, members of two organisations—one of the SC community and the other a Sikh outfit — visited us and saying they would surely help my sister.”On Monday, senior BJP leader and the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) chairman Vijay Sampla wrote a letter to acting Akal Takht jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh, requesting him that the bhog of Lakhbir be performed as per the Sikh rehat maryada (code of conduct). It has not been proved yet that the victim committed sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/singhu-border-episode-bhim-army-chief-meets-tarn-taran-man-s-family-seeks-cbi-probe-into-lynching-101634674734097.html

20-10-2021||Pune||Uprooting of invasive plant species to begin at Taljai tekdi in Pune on Oct 21||PUNE: The yellow flowers commonly found on the roadside and on hill slopes may paint a pretty picture but the reality is far from it. According to botanists and environmentalists, these Cosmos flowers (Cosmos Sulphurous) are a slow killer of native plants and shrubs.So much so that Dr Sachin Punekar, biologist from the Agarkar Research institute, has started an initiative called MABI (Movement against Biological Invasion) to promote the conservation of native flora in the face of this mushrooming challenge. The campaign will kick-off from Taljai tekdi at 7.30am on October 21 with a Cosmos uprooting drive to help preserve the rich biodiversity on the tekdi.Punekar said, “MABI is a movement against any type of biological invasion but currently, the city is seeing an onslaught of pretty yellow-orange coloured flowers across hills and hill slopes. Cosmos is an invasive alien species of plant, an obnoxious weed that has come here from various sources. It has created a challenge for native biodiversity because of its prolific growth and has wiped out indigenous species of plants and disrupted the local food chain upon which a number of insects and animals are directly dependent for their food and shelter.”According to environmentalists and nature lovers, it is unfortunate that the rampant growth of this invasive species of plant was not addressed earlier but they feel that a dedicated movement might help rein in the invasion that has spread to grasslands and scrublands.Punekar said, “With the help of various partners and stakeholders, nature lovers, environmentalists, we want to sensitise everyone about the ill effects of this species. There are a large number of these plants growing rampantly in the wild and on the tekdis creating problems for livestock and herbivores who are losing out on fodder which is dwindling day by day.”Punekar, along with stakeholders such as the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), will uproot the Cosmos plants mechanically and stop them from spreading further, making room for local species to grow in good time.Mangesh Dighe, environment officer, PMC said, “Yellow Cosmos is a native plant of Mexico and is commonly seen along highways but has now spread to the hills and plains of the city. The Cosmos flowers are very attractive and we often see people taking photos of them but they are slowly killing local plant species. Hence we appeal to citizens to come in large numbers to the Taljai tekdi to help uproot these biologically invasive plants and maintain local plants.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/uprooting-of-invasive-plant-species-to-begin-at-taljai-tekdi-in-pune-on-oct-21-101634673593995.html

On the occasion of World Osteoporosis Day on October 20, doctors have advised senior citizens to remain active even while staying indoors and maintain bone health. Osteoporosis is a condition in which bones become weak and brittle.About Osteoporosis, Dr Tushar Deore, consultant-spine specialist at Jupiter hospital, Pune, said that senior citizens haven’t stepped out much due to fear of infection during the pandemic. “With pre-existing conditions like hypertension, diabetes and arthritis, many senior citizens may face mobility issues due to Osteoporosis. Because of lack of movement, overall physiology goes down, more so in the geriatric population. Limited functionality also makes them more dependent on physical activity. Hence, geriatric patients should try to engage in yoga activities through online platforms. There are plenty of online and television programmes that focus on light movement exercises at home to improve physiology,” Dr Deore said.He advised increasing the intake of proteins, minerals, vitamins, green leafy vegetables and fruits that provide calcium along with light movement exercises. For those who eat non-vegetarian food, it is easier to get these through their food, Dr Deore said. The younger population too is facing a lot of calcium deficiency, he added.“There is an increase of almost 75% in backaches and muscle dysfunction among the young population. This is primarily due to bad posture while working from home,” said Dr Deore.Sharing similar views, Dr Nitin Bhagali, Pune-based orthopaedist said that along with Osteoporosis, senior citizens are also suffering from Osteomalacia. “In simple language, Osteomalacia is soft bones. In Osteomalacia, the bones are weakened and can break due to the lack of vitamin D. Senior citizens are reporting more cases of Osteoporosis and Osteomalacia,” Dr Bhagali said. Many are reporting loss of bone mass due to the lack of vitamin D, he added.“Many senior citizens are suffering from backaches while changing position. Everyone should maintain their bone mass, as the loss of bone mass starts in the early 20s. It increases among women who are going through menopause and men show problems post the age of 70. To maintain bone mass, diet and exercise are a must,” said Dr Bhagali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/world-osteoporosis-day-rise-in-cases-among-senior-citizens-101634673234436.html

The decision was taken during the apex gurdware body’s executive committee meeting presided over by its chief Bibi Jagir Kaur. The new serai would be constructed at the location of Hansli near Gheo Mandi Chowk on the way to the Golden Temple.Talking to media after the meeting, Kaur said the “kar sewa” (voluntary service) of the new serai, which will begin from November 1, has been entrusted to Baba Kashmir Singh Bhuriwale.“A parking lot would be constructed on the ground floor of the five-storied serai, besides a store for ration offered by the sangat for Sri Guru Ramdas Ji Langar. Moreover, the old building of Sri Guru Ramdas School near Gurdwara Sri Ramsar Sahib would also be repaired,” said the SGPC chief.The executive committee also condemned remarks by Sikh preacher Ranjit Singh Dhadrianwale on Harmandar Sahib. “No preacher has the right to speak against the historical shrines of the Sikh community. The sentiments of the sangat have been hurt by the remarks of Dhadrianwale linking Sri Harmandar Sahib with the incident at Singhu border. Sri Harmandar Sahib is a common place where people of all faiths visit with devotion,” said Kaur.Condemning the Singhu lynching, the SGPC chief demanded an impartial inquiry into the incident. She condemned the incident at Lakhimpur Kheri and pledged to stand with the families of the victim farmers.The SGPC also approved a 3% increase in the dearness allowance (DA) of the SGPC employees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sgpc-to-build-1-500-room-serai-for-devotees-visiting-golden-temple-101634672994186.html

He said if the Centre remains adamant to implement the decision despite state’s protest, it should compensate the border state with a special economic package. Addressing a press conference, Rana Gurjeet said the decision to increase the jurisdiction of the BSF has created fear psychosis among residents and a sense of insecurity in investors. “How will an investor go to the 25,000 sq km border belt (out of a total of 50,000), which is under the jurisdiction of the BSF?” he questioned. Rana said if the Centre was adamant in implementing the decision, it should make the agriculture sector sustainable in the border belt with liberal incentives. The Centre should come forward with liberalised and incentivised schemes. He suggested that 90% subsidies should be given to the farmers of the border area under the central schemes for drip irrigation system. “There is a dire need to reconsider the jurisdiction issue in concurrence with the state and grant special incentives on a par with north-eastern states,” he said, adding that the first step in this direction should be to constitute a Western Border States Advisory Council having chief ministers/governor of the states as members under the chairmanship of Union home minister on the pattern of North East Council to deliberate the issue of creating of a dedicated corpus fund pooled through a mandatory contribution from all the Union ministries in the Union budget. The minister said he would request chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi to convene a one-day session of the Vidhan Sabha to pass a resolution and to take up the matter with the Union government to reconsider the BSF jurisdiction decision and lead a delegation of all the stakeholders for a meeting with the Prime Minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/extended-bsf-jurisdiction-will-create-fear-psychosis-in-state-rana-gurjeet-101634672575073.html

20-10-2021||Chandigarh||Randhawa alleges deep-rooted conspiracy behind Singhu lynching||Deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa on Tuesday said the state government will get to the bottom of the lynching incident at Singhu border and expose the conspirators. Alleging a deep-rooted conspiracy to defame the farmers’ stir, Randhawa, who is also the home minister, said that in view of the recent disclosures about one of the Nihang leaders having already been in touch with the central government, agriculture minister NS Tomar in particular, the lynching incident had taken an entirely different turn. “The same Nihang leader is now defending the main accused for the killing,” he said in a statement. Lakhbir Singh, who belonged to Cheema Kalan village of Tarn Taran, was lynched at the farmers’ protest site at Singhu last week for alleged sacrilege. “We need to find out as who lured Lakhbir to Singhu border and who paid for his travel as he could not even afford his meals,” Randhawa said. The minister said he had instructed the local administration to find out under what circumstances he was taken away from his home to Singhu border. “The Nihang leader will also need to explain as in what capacity he had met Tomar and whether he was mandated to do so by the farmers’ organisations spearheading the campaign against three black farm laws,” he said without naming him. Randhawa said that given the important place, the Nihang leader was camping at and staging dharna at Singhu border, it was mandatory on his part to keep the farmers’ unions informed and updated about his meetings with the Union minister. “This has raised doubts and suspicion in the minds of people which will need to be cleared and the Punjab government will do everything to reach to the root of the conspiracy and expose and punish the culprits,” he said. Soni demands fair probe JALANDHAR: Punjab deputy chief minister OP Soni has demanded a comprehensive and fair probe into the Singhu lynching episode. Soni was in Jalandhar on Tuesday to take part in the “shobha yatra” of Valmiki. Addressing the media, Soni condemned the lynching and said a thorough probe should be done to unveil the entire conspiracy behind the incident. He also said the Centre must repeal the three farm laws to resolve the issue. Jakhar alleges role of agenciesChandigarh: Former Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar on Tuesday alleged that there could be a role of agencies in the murder of a person at Singhu border. “There is certainly something more than what meets the eye,” he said, adding, “Incidents of recent months point towards a concerted bid to paint the farmers struggle as one of particular community and create divisions between Sikhs and Nihangs”. In a statement, Jakhar demanded a thorough investigation into events leading to the death at Singhu border. Making it clear that presence of Nihangs at Delhi borders was by no means harmful for the protests, he said rather it is a deterrent against BJP attempts to evict protesting farmers from Delhi borders against their wishes. “If you look at the recent events through the prism of agencies, first a Haryana SDM publicly ordering his men to break heads of farmers, then Haryana chief minister asking people to pick up sticks followed by mowing down of farmers at Lakhimpur Kheri and then Singhu incident and now the increase of BSF jurisdiction to 50 KMs, are steps of a well thought out plot against Punjab,” he claimed, adding that the trail points to a well orchestrated strategy to derail the farmer agitations as well as defame Sikhs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/randhawa-alleges-deep-rooted-conspiracy-behind-singhu-lynching-101634672393892.html

Santa Fe police had labelled the incident as a hate crime directed towards the Indian community in the vicinity. However, more than 16 months later, they are yet to press charges. Last week, the FBI said that they were determined to bring to justice the culprits behind the attack on the India Palace restaurant.“This crime has attracted considerable local and national attention,” special agent in-charge Raul Bujanda of Albuquerque FBI division said.“I want to thank the Santa Fe Police Department for all the work they have done on this case. We are determined to find whoever is responsible for what happened at the India Palace and bring them to justice,” he added.“The Santa Fe Police Department is grateful for all of the assistance we’ve received from the FBI throughout the course of this investigation,” deputy chief Paul Joye said.“We are committed to continuing our work with the FBI, to ensure that the person or persons responsible for this vandalism are brought to justice,” he said.Based upon information gathered during the investigation, the Santa Fe Police have not ruled out that persons associated with the restaurant may have been involved in the damage that occurred, the FBI said in a news release.The India Palace attack has been widely condemned across the US, and it had come amid a wave of racial attacks and protests in the country last year, following the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fbi-to-investigate-attack-on-sikh-man-s-restaurant-in-new-mexico-101634672154108.html

After narrowly defeating then minister of state Tim Uppal of the Conservative Party, Sohi was appointed cabinet minister by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Over the next four years, he handled the portfolios of natural resources, and then infrastructure and communities. Sohi, who was born in what is now the Malerkotla district of Punjab, had lost to Uppal in 2019 and thereafter set his sights on the mayoral elections. He defeated his closest rival Mike Nickel on Monday night in mayoral polls that are traditionally not held along party lines. Outgoing mayor Don Iveson congratulated Sohi on his victory, saying, “I’ve had the pleasure of working with mayor-elect Sohi during his time as city councillor, and have always appreciated and been inspired by how hard he has worked for our community. I have no doubt Edmonton will thrive under his leadership.” Another mayor of Indian origin is completing his term leading the city of Calgary, also in Alberta. Naheed Nenshi, the first Muslim to be elected mayor of a major Canadian city when he achieved that feat in 2010, has chosen not to run again. The new mayor in the city also has roots in India as Jyoti Gondek was elected on Monday night. She was born in the UK to Punjabi parents, originally from India, and the family emigrated to Canada when she was aged four.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/excanadian-cabinet-minister-sohi-elected-edmonton-mayor-101634671916103.html

The BJP had started off these meets by holding a meeting of Prajapatis, the Other Backward Caste (OBC) community, recently. In the absence of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who was in Kushinagar to take stock of PM Narendra Modi’s visit for the inauguration of the Kushinagar airport on Wednesday, UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev hit out at the opposition parties accusing them of running a ‘family trust’. Targeting the Congress, which has been focusing on “soft Hindutva” in the run-up to the 2022 UP polls, the BJP chief said, “The Congress refused the existence of Lord Rama, coined words like Hindu terror and got the revered Shankaracharya arrested.” Pitching the BJP as a party with honest leadership, he said, “The Congress and the other opposition parties have looted the country. In contrast, the country today has a Prime Minister who used to sell tea and whose family members never sat on a government vehicle but who promised government scheme for houses for the poor.” UP deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya hailed the contribution of Pasi community country’s freedom struggle. “The Pasi rulers made life hell for the British. This community has been given full respect by the BJP unlike the Congress and other opposition parties which have only flattered to deceive them,” he said. Deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma cautioned against powers who, he claimed, were out to divide the masses. The BJP leaders also recalled how BJP regimes have always taken up tasks for promoting the community. Union minister Bhanu Pratap Verma, national chief of the party’s scheduled caste wing Lal Singh Arya, BJP’s state general secretary Priyanka Rawat, scheduled caste wing chief Ramchandra Kannaujia, UP minister Suresh Pasi among others were also present in the meeting held in Lucknow.To woo Dalits, specially Jatavs, the BJP has already got Baby Rani Maurya, its national vice president, to hold rallies across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/at-its-social-justice-meet-bjp-woos-dalit-pasis-in-up-101634671613766.html

For instance, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has formed SPVs, including the Pune Smart City Development Corporation, PMPML, SRA, Maha Metro and now Riverfront Development. Except the Maha Metro however, none of the other SPVs are doing justice to the purpose for which they were formed. For instance, the PMPML is a loss-making enterprise and has been unable to provide satisfactory service to commuters apart from being dependent on both the PMC and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC). Similarly, the SRA which is a separate authority for the redevelopment of slums has not delivered a single major project in the last five years. If anything, there is further proliferation of slums in the city.Voicing his dissatisfaction, BJP leader and standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne said, “It was a good policy to start SPVs. The intention behind it was good but sadly, it is also true that the SPVs’ performance has not been satisfactory. It all depends on the administrative officer. Actually, there should be a performance audit of the officers. Though we establish SPVs, the rest of the staff is the same, working with the same mentality.”Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and former standing committee chairman Vishal Tambe said, “It is true that it is time to review the SPVs in the city. They are neither answerable to the citizens nor the elected members. Even corruption hasn’t been contained.”Congress leader Arvind Shinde said, “The policy of forming SPVs was adopted to avoid political interference. We gave the SPVs enough time but there has been no decrease in corruption. Rather, I can confidently say that the SPVs are helping hide the corruption of administrative officials. The projects too are not being executed in the given time frame. It is my demand that all SPVs be dissolved and that the previous system be followed to bring all proposals under the umbrella of the general body.”SPVs in PMCSmart city - Pune City Smart Development Corporation LimitedPMPML - Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal LimitedSRA - Slum Rehabilitation AuthorityMetro - Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation LimitedEducation boardSPV for riverfront development||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bar-metro-spvs-in-pune-fail-to-deliver-on-proposed-civic-plans-101634671553902.html

Lakhs of quintals of paddy got soaked in two days of rain,” Hooda said in a statement. Attacking the government, the leader of the opposition said the government neither arranged tarpaulin covers for the crop in the mandis nor were the crops lifted on time. “There was a deliberate delay in starting the procurement by the government and now the lifting and payment were being delayed. Farmers have not even been given compensation for the crops damaged due to bad weather for the last several seasons, ” Hooda said. He also opposed the closure of livestock insurance by the state government and said he had inspired farmers to get livestock insurance during the Congress rule. “Farmers were given the benefit of insurance at only ₹100 but the government has now handed over cattle insurance to private companies and the farmers are now being charged ₹3,000. The government should get the livestock insured as before and give full compensation to the cattle owners in case of any loss,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-suffering-due-to-government-negligence-hooda-101634671314860.html

Recently, they were caught again by villagers when they were trying to steal a cylinder. The villagers started demanding an action against them, as we’ve no hope from the administration and the panchayat decided to do so. We wanted to teach them a lesson.” When pointed out that what they did was against the law, Kumar accepted that they shouldn’t have taken the law into their hands. “I know we’ve done wrong but villagers have no hope from the police. They are drug addicts and the whole village was angry with them,” he added. Superintendent of police Kamaldeep Goyal said he will verify the details and inform accordingly. However, he didn’t respond to calls and messages later.Pratap Nagar SHO sub-inspector Prithvi Singh said, “We’ve not received any complaint .

20-10-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana sees 42% rise in dengue cases so far this year||A steady increase in the number of dengue, a mosquito-borne viral infection, is keeping the health authorities in Haryana on their toes. According to the health department data, more than 2,400 cases of the vector-borne disease were reported till October 18 this year as compared to 1,377 in 2020, 1,207 in 2019 and 1,936 in 2018. The districts of Panchkula (315 cases), Sirsa (264), Gurugram (180), Nuh (175), Faridabad (169) Sonepat (163) and Fatehabad (156) are the worst affected, according to the health department statistics. State health minister Anil Vij, who held a review of the prevalence of vector-borne disease on Monday, said though there have been no deaths so far due to dengue, efforts have to be made to reduce the number of cases. The health minister said 60% of patients have tested positive for dengue. Additional chief secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora said provision of free-of-cost single donor platelets has been made for dengue patients admitted in government hospitals. Previously, a sum of ₹8,500 per unit of single donor platelet was being charged in government hospitals. He said 27 dengue testing labs were functional for free of cost testing of dengue. Private hospitals and labs have also been restricted to charge a maximum of ₹600 for the dengue test. As per reports from Karnal, the vector-borne disease was spreading as fresh cases are being reported from both urban and rural areas of the state every day. This despite the health department officials conducting door-to-door inspections and serving notices to owners of the properties where dengue larvae was found. Kaithal district, officials said, has reported 10 new cases in the past 24 hours. The number of dengue patients has reached to 132 in the district and 91 cases have been reported from Kaithal city alone. The number of patients in Kurukshetra has increased to 82, followed by 53 in Panipat and 49 in Karnal. However, the officials claimed that there was no shortage of platelets and separate wards for the dengue patients have been created in the civil hospitals. “There is no specific reason behind the number of dengue cases reported in the district. The anti-larvae detection teams have been on alert but the situation was under control as a separate ward has been created for the dengue patients and instructions for the availability of platelets as per government instructions have been issued,” Kaithal deputy commissioner Pradeep Dahiya said. He said that notices have been served to 1,218 households where the larvae were detected during the inspections. He said that guidelines have been issued to the officials over the availability of the platelets as private hospitals cannot charge more than ₹8,500 for platelets and it will be provided free of cost in government hospitals. Following a surge in the cases, the demand for platelets has also increased in the past couple of days and even testing was being conducted. The doctors claimed that special wards have been created for the dengue patients in the civil hospitals and platelets were being given free of cost at government hospitals. Even instructions have been issued to the private blood banks to provide the platelets as per the fixed prices. As many as 193 cases of dengue were reported in Sonepat , 75 in Rohtak and 55 in Jhajjar. Dr Sanjay Dahiya, chief medical officer of Jhajjar, said all the patients were stable. “The surge in cases of dengue is late this year as compared to previous years due to delayed monsoon and sporadic heavy showers followed by dry spells,” he added. Dr Anvita Kaushik, Sonepat’s nodal officer for malaria and dengue, said they have reported as many as 193 cases of dengue against last year’s 15. A 16-bedded ward has been set-up at civil hospital for dengue patients,” she added. Rohtak deputy civil surgeon (malaria) Dr Anupma Mittal said they have served nearly 4,800 notices to the owners of the premises where mosquito larvae were detected. “We have also told the people that we would impose a fine of ₹200 to ₹3,000 if larvae are found again on their premises. The health department has established a special micro plan to detect mosquito larvae in the district,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-sees-42-rise-in-dengue-cases-so-far-this-year-101634670715087.html

20-10-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Meet the Nila Gumbad||It’s 24 karat gold—the kalash , or the finial, at the top of the Humayun’s Tomb. The gilded metal glistens in sunshine. Just some steps away is a much smaller tomb. Its dome is dotted with wild grass. But it too is as intense as its celebrity counterpart. The effect is caused by the dome’s enigmatic blue, which is neither shiny, nor pale. The shade appears fragile, and one fears it might wash out during the rains, or under the harsh sunshine.The Nila Gumbad, or the blue dome, stands at the far-east of the Humayun tomb complex. It isn’t visited by as many sightseers as the Mughal emperor’s mausoleum, but it is the oldest edifice in the compound, which is a UNESCO world heritage site.In the beginning there was just this Nila Gumbad. It stood on an island, surrounded on all sides by the river Yamuna. The tomb was built by Humayun 500 years ago in the memory of… this fact is lost to history. The grave inside is also lost to the vagaries of time. Humayun died in 1556, and his grand tomb, commissioned a decade later by son Akbar, eventually shifted the attention away from Nila Gumbad. Centuries passed. The Yamuna drifted away. Railway tracks came up beside the Nila Gumbad, followed by a railway station. Some decades ago, a slum of 400 jhuggis grew about the blue dome. At long last, the tomb was restored to its original self early this year—it was brought within the Humayun Tomb complex in December 2019. The dome originally contained 1,50,000 blue Timurid brick tiles, out of which 20,000 had disappeared. The conservation project—executed by Aga Khan Trust for Culture in partnership with the Archaeological Survey of India—included compensating for these missing tiles. The new tiles were handmade in the style of the original. Many of the original tiles have lost their glaze, but they have been retained because of their antiquity. The young tiles seamlessly trickle into their duller old ancestors, as if trying to resuscitate a vanishing pattern.Meanwhile, the ground around the tomb perseveres with the dome’s haunting ambiance. It is dense with trees; some of the branches are laced with gigantic cobwebs. The arcaded wall towards the west of the tomb is particularly picturesque—it has to be the remnants of a mosque, for the niches are undoubtedly the Mecca-facing mihrabs.Within the tomb, the stone chamber lies steeped in a cooling darkness; the daylight streams in reluctantly through the stone screens. This afternoon it is raining heavily. The blue dome has condescended to shelter a stray dog (called Whitey by the guards). He is sitting inside, waiting for the rain to end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-meet-the-nila-gumbad-101634670414379.html

He should respect women and should not make rude comments against a woman leader from an Opposition party,” he said.Agnihotri said Pratibha belongs to the family that led the Congress government in this state for decades and built Himachal as a modern state.“Former CM Virbhadra Singh is no longer with us but we still have his blessings and affection in the form of Pratibha Singh,” he said.The leader of Opposition asked the CM to list his achievements in the last four years. He said it was Congress which started the subsidised ration scheme when inflation rose in state.However, the scheme is now slowly becoming a bane for people in state as prices of commodities provided under it are soaring high. He said today the prices of cooking gas cylinder have crossed the ₹1,000-mark and petrol prices have gone past ₹103.He said the figures of unemployment are staggering under the BJP regime. He alleged that during the Congress regime, youth of state will get jobs but in BJP regime jobs are being given to non-native people.Taking a jibe at the CM, Agnihotri said these days, he is flying more in the helicopter and doesn’t step on the ground.“This is the reason that he neither has any idea of the condition of the roads nor of the problems faced by the common man,” he alleged.Agnihotri said neither the BJP nor the CM has any right to seek votes. He accused the Jai Ram-led government of pushing the state into a debt trap.He urged people to pay homage to former chief minister Virbhadra and make Pratibha Singh win with huge votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/agnihotri-hits-back-at-jai-ram-over-helpless-candidate-remark-against-pratibha-101634670474287.html

In a tweet with pictures of the inside and outside of the terminal building, Akhilesh said: “The tourism and economic activities will get a boost after the ‘Kushinagar airport’ initiated by the SP government becomes operational. The BJP should take inspiration from the public interest works of the SP government instead of merely making a record of inaugurating the SP government’s projects”. He hashtagged the tweet “SaPa ka kaam janata ke naam (SP’s works dedicated to people”. Later, in a statement, SP state spokesperson and former minister in Akhilesh cabinet Rajendra Chaudhary said: “The previous SP government--for the development and prosperity of the state--took several decisions and paved the way for the state’s prosperity. The then chief minister Akhilesh Yadav in 2016 had sanctioned ₹207 crore for the airport and the Bhumi Pujan (a ceremony for the project’s start) was held on April 3, 2016.” He said that once the airport became operational, it would boost tourism and economic activities in the entire eastern UP region and added: “The BJP government in its entire tenure did not do even one public welfare development work and in the last four and a half years only re-laid foundation stones of the project for which the foundation was laid by the SP government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/kushinagar-airport-akhilesh-attacks-bjp-for-calling-sp-s-work-its-own-101634670233866.html

Athawale, leader of the Republican Party of India, which is an ally of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), said the country should have an “aar paar ki ladaai” with its neighbour to set things right. Athawale, while speaking in Pune on Tuesday said India should not play its scheduled T20 World Cup match against Pakistan on October 24, in order to teach the latter a lesson. ‘The neighbouring country has not learnt lessons. If Pakistan does not stop its activities in the (J&K) valley, then there has to be an ‘aar paar ki ladaai’ (all out war to settle things once and for all). In J&K, attacks are taking place on migrant labourers, local Kashmiri Pandits are being targeted. It is Pakistan’s ploy to not allow development in the valley,’’ Athawale said while responding to a question on latest spate of violence in the valley. In the past fortnight, as many as 11 civilians including five labourers from outside Kashmir have been killed by terrorists in Jammu & Kashmir, prompting migrant workers leave the valley. The latest round of targeted attacks prompted reactions from some quarters with BJP leaders such Subramanian Swamy questioning if there was any urgency to hold the India-Pakistan fixture. When asked if the two countries should play cricket match and whether he will convey his opinion to BCCI office bearers, Athawale said, “I am personally of the opinion that India should not play against Pakistan. I will express this to BCCI secretary Jayesh Shah.” The minister then went on to add that this is also his party’s stand. According to the union minister, attempts are being made by terrorists to spread fear in the valley among the workers who are coming to the Valley from UP and Bihar. ‘’By resorting to such militant attacks, there is an attempt to spread fear among the workers who are coming to the Valley from UP and Bihar. But the Centre will not fall prey to such tactics and a strategy is being formed to end militancy. There is need to conduct another surgical strike against Pakistan, which needs to vacate PoK and stop terror activities,’’ the minister added. Meanwhile the minister also expressed unhappiness over e rising prices of petrol and diesel, and demanded that both the state government and the central government withdraw some taxes on the fuel. Athawale was in the city and interacted with media on Tuesday, when he spoke on various national and state- level issues. Speaking about rising fuel prices, Athawale said, “It is true that the common man is suffering a lot due to increasing fuel prices. I will raise this issue in the next cabinet meeting and also brief the prime minister about how the common man is suffering.” Athwale said both state and central government should take some burden and bring down the taxes on fuel. On talks about an alliance between the BJP and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) in Maharashtra, Athwale said, “If the BJP takes the MNS, it will have a negative impact on the BJP. MNS leader Raj Thackeray took a stand against north Indians. RPI is with the BJP. As a party, we are not in favour of an alliance with the MNS.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/union-minister-ramdas-athawale-says-india-should-not-play-pakistan-in-t20-world-cup-101634669994356.html
20-10-2021||Chandigarh||Waiver on water bills likely to deepen Ludhiana MC’s financial crisis||The Punjab government’s attempt to woo voters ahead of 2022 assembly elections by waiving pending water bills is expected to further deepen the financial crisis of the fund-starved municipal corporation (MC). The civic body is yet to receive around ₹250 crore as outstanding water-sewer charges. While officials are tight-lipped over the announcement, they fear that the authorities might even struggle to pay salaries and take up routine work if the government continues to announce waivers. Penalty and interest waiver for property tax and water-sewer charges had already been announced earlier. The officials added that the outstanding amount might be more than ₹250 crore, as many cases pertaining to water-sewer tariff are under dispute. As per the announcement made by chief minister Charanjit Channi, water tariff for domestic consumers has also been reduced to ₹50 per month from upto ₹300 per month for different categories. This will further reduce the MC’s revenue. An MC official, requesting anonymity, said the government is announcing freebies to woo voters, but the crisis at the ground level is deepening. Senior officials have been pushing the authorities to expedite recovery of dues so that salaries can be paid on time and development projects can be taken up, but the government has waived off the dues in one go. Citing the norms set by World Bank to seek loan for the 24x7 water supply project, the MC had recently hiked the tariff by upto 60% for different categories. But now, the authorities have announced a waiver just for political gain, said the official, while adding that this will also encourage wastage and careless behaviour among residents. Municipal commissioner, Pardeep Sabharwal said that the decision has been taken at state level and the government must have considered all aspects. He added that the government has not yet issued a notification, so there can be no comments on the matter yet. Confusion over waiver on sewer charges As the civic body has been issuing combined bills for water-sewer charges in the city, there is also confusion over whether the sewer charges will also be waived off or not. The MC officials stated that the situation will be clear only after the state government issues notification. The MC officials stated that this is also an injustice towards those paying taxes on time, as no benefit has been extended to them. Earlier too, the government had announced penalty and interest waiver for property tax and water-sewer user charges defaulters, but no incentive was announced for good taxpayers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/waiver-on-water-bills-likely-to-deepen-ludhiana-mc-s-financial-crisis-101634669933523.html

Killing of a lawyer inside of court room in Shahjahanpur is a serious issue,” said Chaudhary. “Adequate security measures must be put in place in all district courts across the state and the government must implement Advocates’ Protection Act,” said Amrendra Nath Tripathi, general secretary, ABA. The Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh has given a work boycott call on Wednesday in protest against the killing of lawyer Bhupendra Singh inside the district court complex in Shahjahanpur. The incident took place on Monday. The council also demanded ₹50 lakh compensation and a government job for the kin of the deceased. ‘DFMD a showpiece at district court’ The Door Frame Metal Detector (DFMD) installed at the entrance of the Lucknow district court (gate number three) is just a showpiece, said lawyers. “Cops deployed at gate number three at district court never check anyone. Now, there will be checking just for a few days after the Shahjahanpur incident and as the issue subsides, security personnel will again become careless,” said Rohit Kant, lawyer, district court. UP Special Security Force? The Uttar Pradesh Special Security Force (UPSSF), a dedicated unit for security at district courts across the state, is yet to be constituted. This proposal, passed after the sensational killing of a double murder accused in a courtroom in Bijnor district before the chief judicial magistrate on December 17, 2019, remains on paper. Past incidents June 12, 2019: Murder of first-ever woman president of UP Bar Council, Darvesh Yadav, took place inside the district court campus, Agra.

20-10-2021||Lucknow||Khadi is the brand of a self-reliant India: Yogi||LUCKNOW Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday said khadi was earlier a brand of the freedom movement, but now it’s the brand of a “self-reliant India” having an important role to play in strengthening the rural economy.“Vocal for Local” should be encouraged to achieve the Prime Minister’s goal of a “self-reliant India”, he said while inaugurating the Khadi Mahotsav and Silk Expo-2021 here. The exhibition, organised by the Uttar Pradesh Khadi and Village Industries Board and the Department of Silk to promote Khadi as part of the Azadi ka Amrut Mahotsav, will continue till October 30. On the occasion, the CM presented cheques, loan sanction certificates and state level awards to the beneficiaries of Pandit Deen Dayal Khadi Marketing Development Assistance Scheme, Mukhyamantri Gramodyog Rozgar Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Rozgar Nirman Karyakram. He also distributed Deen Dayal Upadhyay Silk Productivity Awards. “In 2017, the unemployment rate in the state was 17-18 %. Today, it has come down to just 0.5%, which shows that the schemes launched by the state government are working effectively,” said Adityanath. He said that the Khadi and Village Industries Board, in collaboration with the state government, had provided self-employment to unemployed youth in rural areas under the Mukhyamantri Gramodyog Rozgar Yojana.Addressing the function, the Yogi Adityanath said this was an occasion to celebrate khadi, which was a symbol of swadeshi, samman (honour the local) and swavalamban (self reliance). During the epidemic, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave the mantra of “self-reliant India”. And without achieving the goal of self-reliance, no country and any society could move ahead with their lives with dignity, he said.“If rural women participate in the production of khadi after domestic work, they will get sources of income, become self-reliant and their family will be happy. This will help in realizing the concept of Gram Swaraj,” emphasized the CM.He said , “The use of solar charkha instead of manual charkha is proving to be helpful in increasing the income of workers. A new dimension has been given to the traditional enterprise (khadi) in the state by linking it with technology.”The chief minister said that the central and state governments were making efforts to create more employment. As a result, over 1,86,000 people were employed in various schemes during the last four years while about 50,000 more unemployed people would be provided jobs.Under the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Khadi Marketing Development Assistance Scheme, claims of ₹33.37 crore had been paid to 307 Khadi institutes from financial year 2017-18 to 2021-21 and ₹9.52 crore bonus was paid to 1.61 lakh people working in khadi institutions, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/khadi-is-the-brand-of-a-self-reliant-india-yogi-101634669454787.html

20-10-2021||Lucknow||Non-Yadav OBCs dominate new Samajwadi Party state executive committee||The Samajwadi Party reconstituted its state executive committee on Tuesday. In a shift from its traditional Yadav-Muslim domination, 40 per cent members of the new committee are non-Yadav OBCs (other backward classes) with good representation of Brahmins and Dalits. The state executive had been in suspended animation for the last five years after party president Akhilesh Yadav dissolved the previous executive committee after the 2017 UP assembly elections debacle. The state unit had the state president in the form of Naresh Uttam Patel (a non-Yadav OBC) and Akhilesh named him the party’s state unit president again.The 72-member committee has over 40% OBCs, 10 Brahmins, 11 Muslims, more than six Dalits (including three former Bahujan Samaj Party leaders), five women and within this there is a balanced representation of all the regions of the state. The committee has only seven Yadavs.The non-Yadav OBCs in the committee include members from Nishad, Kashyap, Kurmi, Bind, Pal, Maurya, Kushwaha, Prajapati, Saini, Sahu, and Gurjar communities. “The committee has a representation of all communities”, said Samajwadi Party state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary.The committee indicates the party’s shift for the 2022 electoral battle keeping in sync with all the rival parties’ attempts to please all communities other than their traditional vote banks.“This also indicates that the party’s ticket distribution for the 2022 polls too would follow a similar pattern as that of the executive committee,” said a senior SP MLA. The party is likely to start announcing lists of candidates from next month onwards.A political analyst and former head of the department of political science, Lucknow University said: “Quite a logical strategy. The party knows that its traditional vote bank Yadavs and Muslims would, by and large, stay with it. And such measures are needed to attract other communities. All parties are racing to attract all communities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/nonyadav-obcs-dominate-new-samajwadi-party-state-executive-committee-101634669154985.html

Until August, a total of 8,800 deaths were reported due to Covid-19.Dr Vaishali Jadhav, assistant health officer PMC said, “The survey of non-communicable diseases is a national programme which was not undertaken, but now we are implementing the scheme across the city and are reporting non-communicable diseases because these diseases like diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, cancer or Aids are silent killers and have a higher death rates than even Covid-19. However, because of the pandemic we have become health conscious and so now the civic body is conducting a detailed survey again, to report every non-communicable disease so that we can prepare for the same. The city has an estimated population of 4 million and so as per our reports now we know that 10% of the city is comorbid, which is common for a metro city, the numbers in reality could be higher as these are just reported numbers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/1-in-10-pune-residents-report-comorbidity-pmc-data-101634669093678.html

The rats chewed through computer wires, bringing the Railways’ online booking system to a halt.Many important trains pass through the station of East Central Railway, which is used by a large number of commuters. After railway staff found the wires cut in the morning, alternate arrangements had to be made for passengers who had to board trains without tickets.“In view of the problem, a makeshift arrangement was made at the next railway station at Anugrah Narayan stop, where trains stopped for 10 extra minutes to enable passengers to purchase tickets,” said Phesar station master Manish Kumar.Passengers with disabilities and heavy luggage faced difficulties due to the disruption. “I had difficulty in climbing the steep stairs and crossing the foot over bridge to go to the counter at Anugrah Narayan station to buy a ticket.” said Ram Balak Kushwaha, who is physically challenged.The problem was solved, and ticket counter was functional, said Mohammad Iqbal, public relations officer of the Deendayal Upadhyay rail division.Rats were in the news in Bihar a few months ago, when the state’s water resources minister blamed them for floods. “Corn is kept by the local people next to the dam. Due to this, rats easily damage it by making holes in the dam,” Jha said while inspecting breached embankments in Bhagalpur in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/rat-attack-hits-ticket-services-at-rly-station-101634668673739.html

The notices were sent by the economic offences wing (EOW) on October 18 (Monday), a day after the EOW announced the arrest of Yateesh Wahaal, Satish Kumar Narula, and Rahul Singh Yadav in the case. Police said Wahaal and Narula are directors of Nayati Health Care and Research NCR Pvt Ltd, which Radia allegedly floated. Yadav is the proprietor of the dummy firm named Ahluwalia Construction that was used to siphon off the bank loan. The arrests were made following investigation into a case of criminal breach of trust, cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy that was registered on November 4, 2020. The three accused have been booked for cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy. Police learnt Radia allegedly floated the firm during the questioning of the three. “We learnt about her (Radia’s) links with the company after the arrest. Apart from Radia, the link of her sister Karuna Menon with the company also emerged during the investigation. We issued summons to Radia and Menon on October 18, asking them to join the investigation within three days of receiving the notices. More beneficiaries of the siphoned off money are being identified. They will also be asked to join the probe,” said additional commissioner of police (EOW) RK Singh. Singh said they received a complaint from one Sharma against Narayani Investment Pvt Ltd, holding company of Nayati Health Care and Research NCR Pvt Ltd, and its promoters and directors namely Niira Radia, her sister Karuna Menon, Yateen Wahaal, Satish Kumar Narula and others. In his complaint, Sharma told police he was the company’s vice-chairperson and executive director. Singh said that the company was earlier known as OSL Healthcare Private Limited (OSLHPL) and was incorporated to build and run a hospital in Gurugram. “Also, a MOU (memorandum of understanding) was signed between VIMHANS and OSLHPL for operating and managing VIMHANS’ IPD, OPD, Emergency and Diagnostic Services and VIMHANS was to provide its state-of-the-art medical super speciality services for psychiatry and allied services to OSLHPL,” said Singh. He added Sharma was also promised of ₹30 lakh monthly as his fees for his services. “...during the completion of Gurugram Hospital, OSL Healthcare Pvt Ltd faced a certain financial problem and majority shareholders/Directors sold their shares (51%) to M/s Narayani Investment Pvt Ltd, the holding company of M/s Nayati Healthcare & Research NCR Pvt Ltd at the consideration of ₹99 Crores. Once the alleged persons/company entered into the shoes of the majority shareholder, they took all the major decisions. It is alleged that the company took a loan of ₹312 crore from YES Bank for the development of Gurugram Hospital, but the money was not used for the said purpose and misappropriated by the alleged company/persons.” Police said the arrested persons did not pay Sharma his fee and on the basis of his complaint, the EOW filed a case in November 2020. Singh cited the investigation and added they found that after the loan, the arrested people transferred ₹208 to a bank account in the name of Yadav’s Ahluwalia construction. “During the verification, we found that the account was opened by Rahul Singh Yadav with a view to divert or siphon off the loan amount as it was a dummy account. The investigation revealed that the said transfer of ₹208 crore was authorised by arrested persons Yateesh Wahal and SK Narula as directors and authorised signatories of the loan account of the alleged company,” said Singh. He added the dummy bank account was opened to deceive the bank. HT has reached out to Radia for her response.

If I have earned anything in life, it is honesty and that is my biggest asset,” said Thakur, while addressing election meetings at Basan and Balichowki in Saraj assembly constituency. The Kargil war veteran said people of Mandi will give an apt reply to the Congress for playing such “cheap politics”. Speaking on the occasion, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur asked what Virbhadra did for his constituency despite being a six-term chief minister. “If we go to Rohru, many areas still remain inaccessible and one has to walk for kilometres,” the CM said. “The work which could not be done by Virbhadra Singh for Rohru despite being the CM, the BJP did in four years,” he added. The CM said during the Kargil War, 527 soldiers were martyred. “However, Congress says it was not a war but just a minor infiltration. It is a great insult to the soldiers who laid down their lives for the sake of the nation,” said the CM. He said Congress says the soldiers should not enter politics.

Fadnavis said that the cooperative sugar mills have been receiving I-T notices for paying increased FRP for over a decade and that Shah has assured to resolve the problem at the request of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders.Fadnavis and other BJP leaders met Shah to discuss the issues related to the cooperative sector in New Delhi on Tuesday.“We requested him [Shah] for a permanent solution as for the past 15-20 years, cooperative sugar mills have been facing issues after receiving I-T notices for paying more than the declared FRP… Every year they get I-T notices, resulting at the beginning of the seizure process, which has to be stayed. We requested Amit Shah saheb to resolve the issue once and for all by coming up with a permanent solution. The Union cooperation minister promised us a positive decision, which will come as a big relief for the sugar mills,” Fadnavis told reporters in New Delhi after the meeting.The Centre announces FRP, the minimum price that sugar mills have to pay to cane growers every year before the start of the sugarcane crushing season.The leader of opposition also defended the action by the central investigation agencies against various sugar mills in the state in the backdrop of I-T raids conducted against multiple sugar mills linked to deputy CM Ajit Pawar. The Nationalist Congress Party leadership has alleged that they have been targeted to bring the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in trouble.Fadnavis said the central agencies will take action where misappropriation of funds, corruption or black money is involved. In many cases, action was taken on court’s directives, he said. “If there’s a case wherein action by agencies is found to be taken against someone innocent, one can say Centre is doing it to put pressure on them. But when I-T department comes up with details on how ₹184 crore was generated to buy properties, then the picture is clear. The agencies are doing their work properly. The Centre has no such policy [to put pressure on anyone] and it doesn’t discriminate [among people].”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/devendra-fadnavis-amit-shah-assured-sugar-mills-won-t-face-action-for-paying-above-frp-101634668254752.html
20-10-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra Congress spokesman Sachin Sawant asks party to relieve him of post||Maharashtra Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant has requested state president Nana Patole to relieve him from his official position and hand him a new responsibility. Though Sawant said that he wants a new role as he has been working as the party spokesperson for a decade now, party insiders have said that the request was made after he was overlooked for the appointment as Congress’ chief spokesperson.Sawant has also removed ‘spokesperson’ from his bio on his Twitter handle.On Tuesday, Patole had allotted responsibilities to the newly-appointed body of the Maharashtra unit. He appointed Atul Londhe as the chief spokesperson. It is believed that Sawant has been hurt by the decision.Sawant was not available for a comment. Patole, too, did not respond to calls and text message.“Sachin Sawant was expecting that he would be appointed as the chief spokesperson of the state unit and got upset after being ignored for the position and because the post went to someone who is junior to him in the party,” said a Congress leader, on the condition of anonymity.Sawant is considered as one of the most active voices of Congress against the opposition parties for the past 10 years. He is also credited for exposing the various aspects of the Chikki scam and the alleged irregularities in the Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan in the previous Devendra Fadnavis-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Maharashtra and for taking the opposition leaders head on. Recently, he had disclosed the report of a committee of medical experts that had allegedly found that all the ventilators provided under the PM Cares Fund were non-functional. The committee was appointed by the Government Medical College, Aurangabad, after ventilators that they had received were found to be in non-working condition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-congress-spokesman-sachin-sawant-asks-party-to-relieve-him-of-post-101634668253467.html
20-10-2021||World||Bomb hits security vehicle in northwest Pakistan, killing 4||A roadside bomb struck a vehicle carrying security forces in a former stronghold of local militants in northwest Pakistan on Wednesday, killing four, police said.The attack happened in Bajur, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan. The area served as a base for the Pakistani Taliban until a few years ago, when the army said it cleared the region of insurgents. But the violence has continued there.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the latest attack.Senior police officer Abdul Samad Khan said two police officers and two soldiers were killed in the attack. He said troops launched a search operation in the region to find those who orchestrated the attack.Khan refused to speculate on who could be behind the attack.But suspicion fell of Pakistan’s own Taliban who have been emboldened by the return to power of the Taliban in Afghanistan, where thousands of Pakistani militants are still believed to be hiding.Pakistan and Afghanistan share a 2,400-kilometer (1,500-mile) internationally recognized border known as the Durand Line, which was drawn in the 19th century when the British dominated South Asia. Kabul has never recognized the boundary.Before the Taliban came to power in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Afghanistan often accused each other of turning a blind eye to militants operating along the porous frontier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bomb-hits-security-vehicle-in-northwest-pakistan-killing-4-101634746295951.html

The Biden administration said that it has procured enough Covid-19 vaccine doses to support the vaccination of 28 million children if the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorises Pfizer shots and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the same.“The vaccine will have packaging available in smaller configurations that will make it easier for physicians’ offices and other smaller, community-based providers to offer the vaccine to kids and their families,” the White House said in a statement.Vaccination for children will be available at more than 25,000 pediatric offices and other primary care centres across the United States, as per the plan. Apart from including more numbers of pediatric and primary care providers, the administration is working to provide vaccine supply in smaller package sizes to make it easier for physicians’ offices and community-based providers to offer the vaccine to kids and their families.About two-thirds of the eligible population has been fully vaccinated in the United States as the administration continues to expand its coverage. While the World Health Organization (WHO) has criticised the move to vaccinate children as several countries around the world are yet to vaccinate frontline workers and vulnerable populations, the US and other Western countries are moving swiftly to administer Covid shots to the younger population."The start of a vaccination program for children ages 5-11 will depend on the independent FDA and CDC process and timeline, but our planning efforts mean that we will be ready to begin getting shots in arms in the days following a final CDC recommendation,” the White House said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-details-plan-to-vaccinate-kids-age-5-11-as-pfizer-shots-clearance-nears-101634743291844.html
20-10-2021||World||US prepares to vaccinate 5-11 year olds against Covid-19||The United States on Wednesday rolled out a plan to administer Covid-19 vaccines to 28 million children in the 5-11 age group once it’s authorised and recommended by the health agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The FDA meets on October 26 and the CDC on November 2-3 and approve the vaccine, Pfizer-BioNtech’s Comirnaty. Dosage will possibly be adjusted for children.Their go-ahead will make the United States the only country in the world to vaccinate children in the 5-11 age group against Covid-19. Many countries are vaccinating children 12 and older for SARS-CoV-2 or plan to, including India which may start inoculating at-risk children soon.“The start of a vaccination programme for children aged 5-11 will depend on the independent FDA and CDC process and timeline, but our planning efforts mean that we will be ready to begin getting shots in arms in the days following a final CDC recommendation,” the White House said in a fact-sheet.The Biden administration is ready to start rolling out vaccines for children in this age group after necessary authorisations are in as the White House listed out locations where the vaccine will be administered at - doctors’ offices, hospitals, pharmacies, community health centres, and school- and community-based sites. “If authorised by the FDA and recommended by the CDC, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for 5-11 year olds will be a dose and formula specifically for this age group,” the fact-sheet said. “The vaccine will have packaging available in smaller configurations that will make it easier for physicians’ offices and other smaller, community-based providers to offer the vaccine to kids and their families.”Pending authorisation, the administration plans to distribute the vaccine in 10-dose vials in cartons of 10 vials each (100 doses total). It will be delivered in a newly updated product shipper, and the vaccine can be stored for up to 10 weeks at standard refrigeration temperatures and 6 months at ultra-cold temperatures, the White House said.The plans include supplying the vaccine with all the ancillary supplies that providers need to inoculate kids, including smaller needles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prepares-to-vaccinate-5-11-year-olds-against-covid19-101634743701985.html
20-10-2021||World||Parkland school shooter pleads guilty to 2018 massacre that left 17 dead||Nikolas Cruz pleaded guilty to murder on Wednesday in the 2018 high school massacre in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 dead.Cruz, 23, entered his pleas in a courtroom hearing attended by a dozen relatives of victims after answering a long list of questions from Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer aimed at confirming his mental competency. He was charged with 17 counts of murder and 17 counts of attempted first-degree murder for those wounded in the Feb. 14, 2018, attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, located just outside Fort Lauderdale.A penalty trial will determine if Cruz will receive a sentence of death or life in prison without parole. Scherer plans to begin screening jurors next month in hopes testimony can begin in January.As several parents shook their heads, Cruz apologized, saying, “I'm very sorry for what I did. ... I can't live with myself sometimes." He also added that he wished it was up to the survivors to determine whether he lived or died.Several parents and other relatives of victims broke down in tears while listening to the court proceedings via a Zoom call.Cruz's attorneys announced his intention to plead guilty during a hearing last week.Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter Jaime died in the shooting, said he visited her grave this week to ask her for the strength to get through Wednesday's hearing.“She was the toughest, wisest person I ever knew," he said. “My daughter always fought for what was right. My daughter despised bullies and would put herself in the middle of someone being bullied to make it stop.”The guilty pleas will set the stage for a penalty trial in which 12 jurors will determine whether Cruz should be sentenced to death or life in prison without parole. Given the case's notoriety, Scherer plans to screen thousands of prospective jurors. Hearings are scheduled throughout November and December, with a goal to start testimony in January.Following the pleas, Broward State Attorney Mike Satz recounted the details of the murders. Cruz killed the 14 students and three staff members on Valentine’s Day 2018 during a seven-minute rampage through a three-story building at Stoneman Douglas, investigators said. They said he shot victims in the hallways and in classrooms with an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle. Cruz had been expelled from Stoneman Douglas a year earlier after a history of threatening, frightening, unusual and sometimes violent behavior that dated back to preschool.The shootings caused some Stoneman Douglas students to launch the March for Our Lives movement, which pushes for stronger gun restrictions nationally.Since days after the shooting, Cruz's attorneys had offered to have him plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence, saying that would spare the community the emotional turmoil of reliving the attack at trial. But Satz rejected the offer, saying Cruz deserved a death sentence, and appointed himself lead prosecutor. Satz, 79, stepped down as state attorney in January after 44 years, but remains Cruz’s chief prosecutor.His successor, Harold Pryor, is opposed to the death penalty but has said he will follow the law. Like Satz, he never accepted the defense offer — as an elected official, that would have been difficult, even in liberal Broward County, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 2 to 1.By having Cruz plead guilty, his attorneys will be able to argue during the penalty hearing that he took responsibility for his actions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/parkland-school-shooter-pleads-guilty-to-2018-massacre-that-left-17-dead-101634741709030.html
20-10-2021||World||Pakistan PM Imran Khan accused of selling gifts received from other countries' heads||Pakistan's Opposition parties on Wednesday accused Prime Minister Imran Khan of selling gifts he received from other countries' heads, including an expensive watch worth USD 1 million.Gifts are routinely exchanged between heads of states or officers holding constitutional positions during a state visit. According to the gift depository (Toshakhana) rules, these gifts remain the property of the state unless sold at an open auction. Rules allow officials to retain gifts with a market value of less than ₹10,000 without paying anything, The Express Tribune newspaper reported."Imran Khan has sold the gifts he received from other countries," PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz tweeted in Urdu."Caliph Hazrat Omar (companion of Prophet Muhammad) was accountable for his shirt and robe and you (Imran Khan), on the other hand, looted foreign gifts from Toshakhana and you are talking of setting up a state of Madina? How can a person (Khan) be this insensitive, deaf, dumb and blind?" asked the daughter of deposed prime minister Nawaz Sharif.Opposition alliance -- Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) -- president Maulana Fazlur Rehman said there are reports that prime minister Khan has sold a precious watch he received from a prince. "This is shameful," he said.Social media is rife with reports that Khan was gifted a watch worth USD 1 million by a prince of a Gulf country. The watch was allegedly sold in Dubai by Khan's close aide and USD 1 million was given to the prime minister. The prince reportedly knows the selling of the watch he gifted to Khan.Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Punjab president Rana Sanaullah told a press conference on Wednesday that Pakistan was defamed because of the alleged selling of the gifts received by the premier from the heads of the states of other countries.Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Political Communication, Dr Shahbaz Gill, had earlier said the government was "maintaining secrecy" over details of gifts received by Prime Minister Khan from other heads of states as releasing their lists and "comparing them with those of other countries is considered inappropriate, especially by Islamic countries with whom Pakistan enjoys brotherly relations"."Usually PM Imran Khan deposits such gifts to the Toshakhana, however, if he desires to retain them with him, he has to pay an amount for it," he had said.Last month, the Pakistan government refused to make public details of gifts given to the prime minister by foreign heads of states, asserting that the disclosure can damage the country’s national interest and its relations with other states, after the Pakistan Information Commission sought details from the Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government in response to an application from a citizen on the issue.The PTI government challenged the matter in Islamabad High Court, arguing that details of the gifts received by the prime minister have been designated as “classified”, the Express Tribune newspaper reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-pm-imran-khan-accused-of-selling-gifts-received-from-other-countries-heads-101634736971055.html
20-10-2021||World||Putin orders week-long paid holiday to curb rising Covid-19 cases in Russia||Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday backed the Cabinet’s proposal to declare a non-working week and keep Russian workers away from their offices as coronavirus deaths surged to another daily record.The government task force on Wednesday reported 1,028 coronavirus deaths over the past 24 hours, the highest number since the start of the pandemic. That brought Russia's total death toll to 226,353 which is by far the highest in Europe.Putin said Wednesday he supports the Cabinet’s proposal to introduce a nonworking period starting Oct. 30 and extending through the following week, when four of seven days already are state holidays. He added in some regions where the situation is the most threatening, the non-working period could start as early as Saturday.In some regions, mounting infections forced authorities to suspend medical assistance to the population as health care facilities were forced to focus on treating coronavirus patients.Russia's daily coronavirus mortality numbers have been surging for weeks and topped 1,000 for the first time over the weekend amid sluggish vaccination rates, lax public attitudes toward taking precautions and the government’s reluctance to toughen restrictions.About 45 million Russians, or 32% of the country’s nearly 146 million people, are fully vaccinated.Even though Russia in August 2020 became the first country of the world to authorize a coronavirus vaccine and vaccines are plentiful, Russians have shown hesitancy about getting the shots, a skepticism blamed on conflicting signals sent by authorities.While extolling Sputnik V and three other domestic vaccines, state-controlled media were often critical of Western-made shots, a controversial message that many saw as feeding public doubts about vaccines in general.Until now, the Kremlin has ruled out a new nationwide lockdown like the one early on in the pandemic that dealt a heavy blow to the economy and sapped Putin’s popularity, empowering regional authorities across the country's 11 time zones to decide on local restrictions, depending on their situation.Many of Russia’s 85 regions already have restricted attendance at large public events and limited access to theaters, restaurants and other venues. Some have made vaccinations compulsory for certain public servants and people over 60.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov admitted that the situation is “very sad,” noting that the level of vaccination in those regions was particularly low.In Moscow, however, life has continued as usual, with restaurants and movie theaters brimming with people, crowds swarming nightclubs and karaoke bars and commuters widely ignoring mask mandates on public transportation even as ICUs have filled in recent weeks.On Tuesday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said unvaccinated people over 60 will be required to stay home. He also told businesses to keep at least a third of their employees working remotely for three months starting Oct. 25.The government task force has registered a total of more than 8 million infections and its official COVID-19 toll ranks Russia as having the fifth-most pandemic deaths in the world behind the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico.However, state statistics agency Rosstat, which also counts deaths in which the virus wasn’t considered the main cause, has reported a much higher pandemic death toll — about 418,000 people with COVID-19 as of August. Based on that number, Russia would be the fourth hardest-hit nation, ahead of Mexico.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-orders-week-long-paid-holiday-to-curb-rising-covid-19-cases-in-russia-101634732980622.html
20-10-2021||World||Queen Elizabeth II, last seen with walking stick, 'advised to rest' on medical grounds||Queen Elizabeth II has taken ill and "has reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days", Buckingham Palace informed on Wednesday. The announcement was made as the 95-year-old monarch cancelled a planned trip to Northern Ireland on medical grounds.Britain's domestic Press Association news agency, however, clarified that the decision was not related to the coronavirus and that she was resting at Windsor Castle in London, where she moved last year.She was also expected to attend events at the upcoming UN climate change summit in Glasgow next month, it added.The Queen was "in good spirits and is disappointed that she will no longer be able to visit Northern Ireland, where she had been due to undertake a series of engagements" the next two days to mark the 100th anniversary of the creation of Northern Ireland, the palace said, as quoted by news agency AFP."The Queen sends her warmest good wishes to the people of Northern Ireland, and looks forward to visiting in the future," the palace statement added.Queen Elizabeth II is Britain's longest-serving monarch, succeeded her father, King George VI, in 1952. She will celebrate her Platinum Jubilee to mark 70 years on the throne next year. Her husband, Prince Philip, died aged 99 in April this year.The Queen appeared well on Tuesday evening, when she hosted a reception at Windsor for international business leaders, including the billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates, and senior British ministers, for a government investment summit.However, the latest palace statement will inevitably raise fears for her health. She was also seen for the first time at a major public event using a walking stick, AFP reported. Royal officials have denied its link to any health condition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-elizabeth-ii-last-seen-with-walking-stick-advised-to-rest-on-medical-grounds-101634730867016.html
20-10-2021||World||Europe aims to ease travel restrictions for fully vaccinated||European Union countries are trying to reach agreement on ways to ease pandemic travel restrictions within and into the bloc as leaders work to boost Covid-19 vaccination levels.One option under discussion ahead of a two-day EU summit in Brussels is a plan to effectively scrap the traffic-light system of green and red areas in the bloc that has been used to govern travel rules and instead allow anyone who has been vaccinated to travel freely, according to a European Commission informal proposal seen by Bloomberg.The plan would rely on the use of the widely adopted EU digital Covid passports, which have allowed travelers to cross borders without tests or quarantines since the summer if they can show they’ve been fully inoculated or recovered from the virus. Travelers without a Covid pass could be required to undergo tests after arriving in their destination.“Given the very sizable impact on the exercise of free movement, persons traveling within the EU should in principle no longer be required to quarantine save for very exceptional situations (e.g. new variants of concern),” the European Commission proposal says.Other jurisdictions have begun to open up rapidly in recent weeks after a slower start, with the U.K. simplifying its own traffic light system to a green and red list, with the latter now featuring only seven countries as of last week. The U.S., meanwhile, will admit vaccinated foreigners starting from Nov. 8, spurring demand on transatlantic routes that rank as the most lucrative for airlines and travel firms.At the same time, there are some worrying Covid trends that could slow the push to relax the rules. Tuesday saw the most single-day confirmed deaths in Europe since April, with the 7-day average also on the rise. A second option proposed by the commission would retain the traffic-light system, but refine the data used to produce the ratings. Member nations would be encouraged to implement simpler and more standardized rules for handling travelers from red or grey zones.The commission proposal would also maintain the use of the so-called emergency brake mechanism to be used to case of new variants of concern or outbreaks, but would aim to establish a common framework for when new restrictions should be triggered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-wants-to-make-travel-easier-for-the-fully-vaccinated-101634729109758.html

Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov addressed an international conference attended by the Taliban and said that his country noted the new administration in power in Afghanistan and their efforts to stabilise the political situation in the war-torn country.“A new administration is in power now,” news agency AFP quoted Lavrov as saying, during the meeting. “We note their efforts to stabilise the military and political situation and set up work of the state apparatus,” he further said.However, Lavrov also noted that several other extremist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State (IS) have been trying to exploit the security vacuum in the war-torn country and raise their profile.Also read | India, Taliban to meet today at Moscow Format in RussiaRussia further expressed regret that the US officials did not participate at the meeting in Moscow. The US earlier said it would not join this round of talks in Moscow, but expressed willingness to do so in the future, news agency Reuters reported.Expressing concerns over the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, Russia also urged the international community to provide assistance to the country. “We are convinced that it is time to mobilise the resources of the international community to provide Kabul with effective financial humanitarian support, including to prevent a humanitarian crisis and reduce migration flows,” Reuters quoted Lavrov as saying.Meanwhile, the Taliban delegation was led by Afghanistan's deputy prime minister Abdul Salam Hanafi, who had also led the talks with other Western powers in the past. Last week, the Taliban had held discussions with the US and the European Union (EU), following which the EU pledged an assistance of one billion euros to prevent a 'humanitarian crisis' in Afghanistan. Following the Taliban’s takeover in August, several people were evacuated by the US and its allies while several others fled the country. The UN had previously warned of internal displacement of Afghan nationals after the militants took over the reigns.The talks came amidst the concerns expressed by Russian president Vladimir Putin about the gathering of IS fighters in Afghanistan and the possible disturbance of peace in Central Asian nations bordering Russia.Russia is one of the few countries that had not evacuated its diplomatic mission in Kabul despite the rapid and violent takeover of the country by the Taliban. However, the country is yet to officially recognise the Taliban regime and top officials have also hinted that no such discussions are currently in progress.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-recognises-taliban-s-efforts-towards-stability-in-afghanistan-calls-for-humanitarian-aid-101634729288316.html
20-10-2021||World||‘Technical glitch’ hits India’s strong response to China-led BRI at UN meet||India expressed strong opposition to the China-led Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) at a United Nations transport conference in Beijing last week despite a “technical problem”, which temporarily silenced the participating Indian diplomat’s microphone when delivering the speech.Priyanka Sohoni from the political section of the Indian embassy in Beijing was explaining New Delhi’s opposition to the BRI, the China-led intercontinental connectivity project, when her microphone went silent at the second UN Global Sustainable Transport Conference.The October 14-16 conference was organised by China in Beijing under the aegis of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA).Minutes before Sohoni spoke, a Pakistani diplomat had heaped praise on the BRI, and its flagship project, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), calling it a “game changer” for the region in his speech.After talking on how “…expansion and strengthening of physical connectivity is an integral part of India’s economic and diplomatic initiatives,” Sohoni questioned the principles behind BRI.“There have been some references to the BRI at this conference. Here, I wish to say that as far as China’s BRI is concerned, we are uniquely affected by it. It’s inclusion of the so-called CPEC as a flagship project impinges on India’s sovereignty,” Sohoni said. “No country can support an initiative that ignores its core concerns of sovereignty and territorial integrity,” she said without naming either China or Pakistan.“This aside, there are also larger issues regarding how connectivity initiatives should be pursued. We are of the firm belief that connectivity initiatives must be based on universally recognised international norms. They must follow principles of openness, transparency and financial responsibility,” Sohoni said.It was at this juncture that her microphone stopped working, making it impossible for Chinese and international delegates to hear her.The connection was restored after DESA under-secretary general Liu Zhenmin - former Chinese vice foreign minister -- said it was a “technical problem” and asked Sohoni to “be patient”.Sohoni finished her speech after the connection was restored.“India for its part abides by these principles and stands ready to make collective efforts for sustainable developments through a human-centric approach,” she said at the end. “They must follow principles of openness, transparency and financial responsibility and be pursued in a manner that respects sovereignty, equality and territorial integrity of nations.”The short interruption seemingly allowed the Chinese transport minister, Li Xiaopeng, present at the session, to respond to the Indian diplomat’s criticism of the BRI. “I would like to extend my apologies for the technical glitch just now when the Indian delegate spoke,” Li said in Mandarin.“I don’t want to be offensive. Just now you have mentioned a lot of topics. As for the topics you mentioned, I would like to make some complements,” Li said in what seemed to be a direct response to Sohoni’s statement.“The BRI is open and inclusive. We tried to improve the connectivity and seek the development of all countries. In the past eight years, all the international communities have welcomed this initiative. Up to now about 141 countries and 32 organisations have signed more than 200 agreements with China,” Li said.“A lot of important and practical projects have been implemented, which include a lot of important transport projects. I would like to invite all parties to contribute to the development of this (BRI) project,” Li said.A diplomat who has worked at the UN said that Li being allowed to seemingly respond to the Indian diplomat’s critical speech was a likely breach of UN protocol.President Xi Jinping had also mentioned the BRI in his speech to the conference on October 14. “China’s door of opening-up will only open wider, and will never be closed. China will continue to advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, strengthen infrastructure connectivity with other countries, and develop a green Silk Road and a digital Silk Road at a faster pace,” Xi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/technical-glitch-hits-india-s-strong-response-to-china-led-bri-at-un-meet-101634729541741.html
20-10-2021||World||Europe reports 7% rise in new Covid-19 cases; daily deaths in Russia soar||The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday said that Europe recorded a 7% rise in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases last week. It said that Europe was the only region in the world that reported a rise in cases, according to a report by news agency Associated Press.The WHO’s weekly assessment of Covid-19 which was released on Tuesday showed that there were 2.7 million new Covid-19 cases and more than 46,000 deaths last week globally. Europe recorded 1.3 million new cases and more than half the countries in this region reported a spike in the number of cases.The UK, Russia and Turkey were among the nations that accounted for the most number of Covid-19 cases. This is the third week in a row that the region has seen a rise in cases.Russia over the past week broke new daily records for new cases. Russia on Wednesday reported 1,028 Covid-19 deaths over the course of 24 hours, setting a new record. It also reported 34,073 new Covid-19 cases, up from 33,740 cases recorded on Tuesday. The rise in the number of cases led to the Russian government announcing a slew of restrictions in order to curb the spread of the disease.The UK reported 223 deaths from Covid-19 on Tuesday - the highest single-day toll since March, according to news agency AFP. The report also said that the UK was averaging more than 40,000 new cases per day and there was also a rise in hospitalisations. Experts have asked the UK government to reinstate some of the Covid-19 restrictions in a bid to ease pressure on the hospitals.Turkey reported more than 25,000 new Covid-19 cases daily over the past week and health officials have warned that the cases could rise further, according to a report by Turkish news agency Hürriyet Daily News. The nation reported 33,680 new cases over a period of 24 hours on October 12, reporting a rise for the first time since April 30 this year.Turkey and Russia also reported vaccine hesitancy among their citizens which could also exacerbate the pandemic-related situation in these nations.(with inputs from Reuters, Bloomberg)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-reports-7-rise-in-new-covid-19-cases-daily-deaths-in-russia-soar-101634725703718.html

Rebellious Tigrayan forces accused the Ethiopian government of launching the strikes. Though a government official initially denied any strikes, state-run media later reported the air force conducted an attack.The news follows intensified fighting in two other Ethiopian regions, where the central government's military is trying to recover territory taken by the TPLF, which recaptured Mekelle and most of the rest of Tigray several months ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/airstrike-hits-capital-of-ethiopia-s-tigray-second-time-this-week-101634717930039.html

The channel reported at least 13 people were killed and three wounded.Two explosive devices went off as the bus was on the Hafez al-Assad bridge, it said, adding a third device was defused by an army engineering unit in what officials said was a “terrorist” blast.There have been several attacks this year on army vehicles in eastern Syria by suspected Islamic State militants who still operate in the sprawling desert areaThe United Nations says at least 350,000 people have been killed during a civil war that started a decade ago.Blasts in Damascus have been rare since forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad took control of rebel enclaves around the city. Helped by Russia’s military presence and Iran’s Shi’ite militias, Assad now controls most of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/13-syrian-military-personnel-in-roadside-bomb-attack-in-damascus-report-101634711065037.html
20-10-2021||World||All MPs must get anti-Covid jabs before entering House of Commons: Canadian govt||When the new House of Commons convenes for the first time in November, it will be mandatory for all attending MPs to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 or they will be denied entry.The first session of the 44th parliament is scheduled to begin on November 22. The Board of Internal Economy, which administers functions of the house, and is chaired by its speaker, issued guidelines on Tuesday which stated that it has “determined’ that starting that day “individuals must be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 to be allowed within the House of Commons precinct”.The board’s current chair is outgoing speaker Anthony Rota. In the statement, he added that this “requirement will apply” to all those who wish to enter the precinct, including members and their staff, political research office employees, administration employees, members of the parliamentary press gallery, parliamentary business visitors, contractors and consultants.Exceptions will only be made for those who provide proof of a “medical contraindication” and they will have to furnish a negative Covid-19 test result before being allowed to enter.While the house functioned during the peaks of the pandemic since spring of last year, it has often been with reduced numbers due to the need for social distancing as well as a hybrid arrangement that included in-person attendance along with those joining in virtually.Mask and social distancing mandates will continue to be implemented. “These decisions were made to meet ongoing recommendations from public health authorities to help limit the spread of Covid-19 within the work environment,” the statement noted.This announcement comes as vaccine mandates are due to be enforced at the national level from the end of this month covering public sector employees.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau raised the matter during a telephonic conversation with the leader of the Bloc Québécois, Yves-François Blanchet, ahead of the new session of parliament. A release from the prime minister’s office said Trudeau “emphasised the need for all members of parliament in the House of Commons to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-mps-must-be-fully-vaccinated-before-entering-house-of-commons-canadian-govt-101634708599102.html
20-10-2021||World||China’s transition to clean energy faster than expected: Study||The costs of solar and coal power in China could become comparable countrywide by 2023, a new US-China study has found, indicating that the country, the largest carbon emitter globally, could be at a tipping point towards transitioning to clean energy faster than expected.In two years, China will have the capacity to install solar power across the country at the same price as coal, and currently has that ability to do so in three-quarters of the country, the joint study found. “About 78.6% (79.7 PWh or petawatt-hour) of China’s technical potential will realise price parity to coal-fired power in 2021, with price parity achieved nationwide by 2023.”Solar energy could provide 43.2% of China’s electricity demands in 2060 at less than two-and-a-half US cents per kilowatt-hour, it found; for comparison, coal power tariffs in China ranged 3.6 to 6.5 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2019, researchers from Harvard, Tsinghua University in Beijing, Nankai University in Tianjin, and Renmin University of China in Beijing said in the study.The research forecast that “...nationwide parity is estimated to be achieved by 2023. Solar power in the North China, Northeast, East China, and Tibet grids is projected to achieve full price parity with coal in 2021, followed by the Central China, Northwest, and South China grids in 2023”.The research was published as the cover article of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), a peer-reviewed science journal on Tuesday.“Today, subsidy-free solar power has become cheaper than coal power in most parts of China, and this cost-competitive advantage will soon expand to the whole country due to technology advances and cost declines,” Xi Lu from the School of Environment, Tsinghua University and co-corresponding author of the paper, said in a statement published by Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.The researchers, according to the Harvard statement, first found that the physical potential of solar PV, which includes how many solar panels can be installed and how much solar energy they can generate, in China reached 99.2 petawatt-hours in 2020.It was “…more than twice the country’s total consumption of energy in all forms, including not only electricity but also fuels consumed directly by vehicles, factories, building heating and more. The findings show solar PV is an enormous resource for China’s decarbonisation”.“They then demonstrated its cost-competitiveness, with 78.6% of the potential in 2020 equal to or lower than current prices of local coal-fired power, a share set to grow further. This cost advantage means China can invest in storage capacity, such as batteries, and still cost-effectively supply 7.2 petawatt-hours or 43.2% of country-wide electricity demand by 2060,” the statement said.“Our results demonstrate that the economic competitiveness of solar power combined with investments in storage systems could provide extra benefits for grid dispatch, which will be especially important for operation of future electric systems in China,” Xi, the Tsinghua university professor, said.China has the world’s largest solar power capacity, with 253 GW of installed capacity at the end-2020 compared with about 151 GW in the European Union, according to International Energy Agency data.China is expected to add up to 65 GigaWatts (GW) of solar power capacity in 2021, taking total solar installations beyond 300 GW by the end of the year, the China Photovoltaic Industry Association (CPIA) said at a conference in July this year.“Most now realise that climate change requires transitioning away from fossil energy use,” said Chris P Nielson, executive director of the Harvard-China Project and a co-author of the paper.“Not as many realise that decarbonising the power system is the linchpin, especially as more sectors become electrified, and that accommodation by the grid of renewable variability is the toughest part of the puzzle. It’s a huge breakthrough, and not just for China, if storage can make solar power grid-compatible at a competitive cost,” Nielson said.The report comes ahead of the global climate summit in Scotland beginning on October 31 as Beijing’s plans to change from coal-based energy will be a major factor in the world’s ability to limit climate change.Last week, President Xi Jinping pledged to accelerate the development of solar power in China. “[We will] step up our efforts in the development of renewable energy, and accelerate the planning of large-scale photovoltaic and wind power projects in [our] deserts and nearby areas,” he said, adding that the phase one of these projects with a combined installed capacity of 100 million kilowatts will begin construction soon.Xi has also pledged to peak carbon emission by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-transition-to-clean-energy-faster-than-expected-study-101634705778464.html

Here's how much financial help it requires||Imran Khan, whose claim to political power was based on the promise of a new Pakistan, seems to be falling behind on one of his vows to make the country's economy stronger, as a recent media report claimed that Pakistan is now facing its biggest economic crisis in history. According to The News International, one of the largest English language newspapers in Pakistan, the country is in the throes of a deep financial crisis – with the Imran Khan-led regime ideally requiring gross external financing of $51.6 billion within a two-year period (2021-2023) in order to fulfill its needs.Also Read | End in sight for Imran Khan's 'Naya Pakistan' amid rising inflation in PakistanAs per the report, Pakistan's gross external financing requirement stands at $23.6 billion in 2021-22 and $28 billion in 2022-23. The development comes despite the very conservative estimates assessed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Pakistani authorities are now reportedly trying to make a last-ditch effort to strike a staff-level agreement with the IMF to bridge the gap of external financing requirements.In a recent report, the World Bank noted that Pakistan has joined the list of top ten nations with the largest foreign debts. Citing the International Debt Statistics 2022, The News International reported earlier that there lies a “wide divergence” in the rate at which external debt is accumulated in individual DSSI-eligible countries – including the group's largest borrowers which include Pakistan. The World Bank report also pointed out that Pakistan's foreign debt increased by 8 per cent; in June this year, another report revealed that the Imran government had borrowed $442 million from the World Bank.However, with the suspension of program loans from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB) now, Pakistan is further at risk of a monumental economic crisis – with the headache of the gross external financing requirement upon it – to deal with which it needs to anyhow strike a deal with the IMF under the existing $6 billion extended fund facility (EFF) during the ongoing parleys in Washington.Also Read | No more assistance to Pakistan, hold Imran Khan accountable now: Ex-US advisorMeanwhile, the WB and ADB will continue lending project loans but keeping in view the capacity to implement projects, the disbursement becomes dismally low. The credit rating agencies may further downgrade the country's ratings, so generating funds through the issuance of international bonds will become expensive, reported The News International.The IMF had been asking for the removal of distortions into the taxation system and also pointed out that different GST exemptions and rates should be aligned with the standard rate of 17 per cent, according to officials cited by the ANI news agency The standard GST rate of 17 per cent should be imposed on Petroleum Oil Lubricants (POL) products. The GST rate on fertilizer, tractors and other items should be brought at the standard rate of 17 per cent, as per the report. However, Pakistani authorities are opposing such proposals arguing that it would further marginalise the neglected agricultural sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-facing-deep-economic-crisis-here-s-how-much-financial-help-it-requires-101634695426803.html

20-10-2021||World||North Korea confirms submarine launch of new ballistic missile||North Korea test-fired a new, smaller ballistic missile from a submarine, state media confirmed on Wednesday, a move that analysts said could be aimed at more quickly fielding an operational missile submarine.The statement from state media came a day after South Korea's military reported that it believed North Korea had fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) off its east coast, the latest in a string of North Korean missile tests.The White House urged North Korea to refrain from further "provocations", with spokeswoman Jen Psaki saying on Tuesday the United States remained open to engaging diplomatically with North Korea over its weapons programs.Pyongyang so far has rejected those overtures, accusing the United States and South Korea of talking diplomacy while ratcheting up tensions with their own military activities.The "new-type" SLBM was launched from the same submarine involved in a 2016 test of an older SLBM, North Korea's state news agency KCNA said.North Korea has a large fleet of aging submarines, but has yet to deploy operational ballistic missile submarines beyond the experimental Gorae-class boat used in the tests.Photos released by KCNA appeared to show a thinner, smaller missile than North Korea's earlier SLBM designs, and may be a previously unseen model first showcased at a defence exhibition in Pyongyang last week.A smaller SLBM could mean more missiles stored on a single submarine, although with a shorter range, potentially putting nuclear-armed North Korea closer to fielding an operational ballistic missile submarine (SSB)."Though a smaller North Korea SLBM design could enable more missiles per boat, it could also enable smaller less challenging SSB designs, including easier integration/conversion on pre-existing submarines," Joseph Dempsey, a defence researcher at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said on Twitter.Still, the development was expected to have only a limited impact on Pyongyang's arsenal until it made more progress on a larger submarine that has been seen under construction."It just means they're trying to diversify their submarine launch options," said Dave Schmerler, a senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in California."It's an interesting development but with only one submarine in the water that can launch notionally one or two of these it doesn't change much."The new type SLBM featured advanced control guidance technologies including "flank mobility and gliding skip mobility," KCNA said."(The SLBM) will greatly contribute to putting the defence technology of the country on a high level and to enhancing the underwater operational capability of our navy," KCNA added.Schmerler said it was unclear exactly what KCNA meant by "flank mobility", but "glide skip" was a way to change a missile's trajectory to make it harder to track and intercept.North Korea has conducted a number of tests in recent years with short-range ballistic missiles that analysts say are designed to evade missile defence systems in South Korea.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was not reported to have attended Tuesday's test.The missile was launched from the sea in the vicinity of Sinpo, where North Korea keeps submarines as well as equipment for test firing SLBMs, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-confirms-submarine-launch-of-new-ballistic-missile-101634686185119.html
20-10-2021||World||India, Taliban to meet today at Moscow Format in Russia||An Indian delegation and Taliban officials will come face-to-face at the “Moscow Format” meeting hosted by Russia on Wednesday, with discussions expected to focus on the security situation and formation of an inclusive government in Afghanistan. The dialogue between the Taliban and 10 regional countries will be held a day after the US pulled out of a meeting of the “extended troika” hosted by Moscow on Tuesday. Only special representatives from Russia, China and Pakistan – the other members of the extended troika – participated in the meeting. The special representatives of Russia, China and Pakistan exchanged views on “common security threats [and] expressed their joint interest in providing Afghanistan with urgent humanitarian and economic assistance”, the Russian foreign ministry said. The US state department said on Monday the American special representative would not participate in the extended troika talks due to logistical reasons. On Tuesday, Zalmay Khalilzad, the US special representative for Afghanistan who has taken some of the blame for the Taliban’s return to power, stepped down from the position. The Indian delegation to the third Moscow Format meeting will be led by JP Singh, the joint secretary who heads the Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran desk in the external affairs ministry. The possibility of informal contacts between the Indian team and the Taliban on the margins of the meeting in Moscow has not been ruled out. The Moscow Format meeting, which will be attended by representatives from 10 countries of the region and the Taliban delegation, will be addressed by Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov. The meeting will “discuss prospects for development of the military-political situation in Afghanistan and the formation of an inclusive government”, the Russian foreign ministry said on Tuesday. “Participants will also touch upon the issues of consolidating efforts of the international community to prevent a humanitarian crisis in [Afghanistan]. Following the meeting, it is planned to adopt a joint statement,” the ministry added. The Moscow Format was established in 2017 as a six-party mechanism involving Russia, Afghanistan, India, Iran, China and Pakistan. It was later expanded with the inclusion of more countries and meetings were held in Moscow in 2017 and 2018. Zamir Kabulov, Russia’s special presidential envoy for Afghanistan, said on October 15 that Moscow intended to have a frank discussion with the Taliban during the Moscow Format meeting, but no “breakthrough decisions” were expected. The Russian side intends to “hold a sincere conversation behind closed doors with the representatives of the new Afghan leadership” and “convey our objections to the Afghan delegation”, Kabulov was quoted as saying by state-run TASS news agency. “We do not expect any breakthrough decisions, this is a long evolutionary process, we are proceeding from this understanding,” he said. Kabulov further said the discussions will focus on human rights issues and the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. He added that fighting drug trafficking and terror threats related to Afghanistan remain a priority for Russia and other countries. The Indian government has cautioned the world community against rushing to recognise the Taliban setup in Kabul, pointing out the change of power in Kabul was not inclusive and was done without negotiations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-delegates-taliban-leaders-to-be-face-to-face-at-moscow-format-meet-in-russia-101634667714758.html

Arun Kumar, 31, died in police custody after his health suddenly deteriorated during interrogation late on Tuesday, said Agra police. He was arrested on charges of stealing ₹25 lakh from maal khana (storage room where confiscated items are kept) of Jagdishpura police station in Agra on Sunday. “Kumar was picked up from Tajganj area on Tuesday and during interrogation, he admitted to his involvement in the theft and said that the stolen cash was kept in his house. A police team recovered ₹15 lakh cash from his house. However, during the recovery, he suddenly fell ill and was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was declared ‘brought dead’ by doctors,” Muniraj G, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Agra, said. The kin of the deceased, however, alleged that Kumar was tortured by police. They demanded a compensation of ₹1 crore, a government job and action against the concerned policemen.“A case has been registeredunder section 302 (murder) of IPC onthe basis of a complaint by the kin of the deceased who has sought action against the concerned policemen. The district magistrate was contacted and the body was sent for post mortem. Further action will be taken on the basis of the post-mortem report and the investigation,” the SSP said. Following the theft on Sunday, six policemen, including the station house officer, were suspended for negligence.The death was condemned by Opposition politicians in the state that goes to the polls in early 2022 with the Congress and the Bahujan Samaj Party attacking the state government. Priyanka Gandhi left Lucknow by road for Agra at about 3 pm, but was stopped by Lucknow Police at the Lucknow-Agra Expressway on the grounds that the Agra district magistrate (DM) had requested to refrain political leaders from visiting the area. “Do I need somebody’s permission whenever I move out of Lucknow? Is there a problem... why am I not being allowed to go to Agra, is there a law and order issue?” she asked policemen who stopped her motorcade. “Someone has died, how can it be a law and order issue? Ask the DM by calling him. It is too much that I cannot go out anywhere and should remain confined in a guest house in Lucknow,” she added. Police said she was neither taken into custody nor arrested. “Because of the massive crowds, the movement of traffic was being hampered and she was first asked to either go to the party office or her residence but when she did not agree, she was sent to the police lines,” Lucknow police commissioner D K Thakur was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. The Congress UP in-charge was later allowed to proceed along with three others, party spokesperson Anshu Awasthi confirmed. She reached Agra at 10.30 pm and met Kumar’s family at around 11.30 pm. “A high-level investigation should be held and action taken against the policemen, and the victim’s family should get compensation,” Priyanka Gandhi tweeted. Lucknow Police later allowed four people, including state Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu and senior leader Acharya Pramod Krishnam, to accompany Priyanka to the spot. The sanitation worker’s death was also condemned by BSP chief Mayawati. “The death of a sanitation worker in police custody in Agra is very sad and shameful. The UP government should give strict punishment to the culprits and should also provide help to the victim’s family in every way. This is the BSP’s demand,” she tweeted. Celebrations to mark Valmiki Jayanti, the birth anniversary of Valmiki who wrote the Hindu epic Ramayana, were called off in the district on Wednesday.“There is much anger and grief among Valmikis in the city over the death of community member Arun Kumar, allegedly in police custody. We have called off all celebrations and will not stop till his family gets justice,” Vinod Allahabadi, senior vice president of Local Self Body Workers’ Union, said.“We demand a compensation of ₹1 crore for family members of the deceased, a government job to one of his dependents and prison for guilty policemen against whom a case for murder should be registered. In case the administration fails to meet the demands, the Valmiki community will not hesitate to go on a strike across Agra Nagar Nigam,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-man-s-death-in-police-custody-sparks-row-priyanka-gandhi-visits-kin-in-agra-101634754502738.html
20-10-2021||India||Dichotomy between Maoist surrender and rehab numbers||Only 3% of Maoists that surrendered in Chhattisgarh in the past three years have passed muster of the state Screening and Rehabilitation Committee (SRC), which decides if those surrendering to the state are eligible for benefits under the surrender and rehabilitation schemes of the government. Data accessed by HT from the beginning of 2018 shows that while Chhattisgarh, the state hit worst by the state-Maoist conflict over the last two decades, claims a record total of 1,462 Maoist surrenders, only 113 of these were actually sent to the SRC for screening, and only 47 were found fit enough to receive the benefits under the surrender and rehabilitation scheme.The process of rehabilitation by the government is meant to begin the day a Maoist surrenders, either to the state police, or administration or the central paramilitary forces that are posted in Chhattisgarh. Most Maoists that surrender immediately receive a protsahan rashi (encouragement reward), now set at ₹10,000. An interrogation is meant to follow where their rank is verified with police intelligence records, and recoveries recorded if they are surrendering with weapons or arms and ammunition, which increases the amount due to the person, given that there is a reward attached with each kind of weapon. Finally, the names and records must be sent to the SRC. This screens their antecedents, and if they pass muster, the surrendered Maoists become eligible for government benefits. The objectives of these guidelines for surrender, the Union ministry of home affairs says, is to “wean away misguided youth and hardcore naxalites who have strayed into the fold of the naxal movement and now find themselves trapped into that net and to ensure that the naxalites who surrender do not find it attractive to join the naxal movement again.” However, the MHA also adds that “tactical surrenders by those elements who try to make use of the benefits extended by the Government to further their vested interests should not be encouraged”.The benefits that a surrendered Maoist is eligible for in Chhattisgarh are significant: ₹5 lakh for a high ranking Maoist (category 1), and ₹2.5 lakh for middle and lower cadre Maoists (category 2A and 2B respectively); a monthly stipend of ₹6,000 for a maximum period of 36 months; additional incentives for recovered weapons; and study and house-building grants.While category 1 is defined as “State Committee members, Regional Committee members, Central Committee members and Politburo members”, category 2-A refers to area commanders, sub-zonal commanders and zonal commanders. Any other hardcore cadres, Dalam members and identified LWE (left wing extremism) cadre involved in heinous crimes will come under category 2-B.But to receive these benefits, the Maoists must be cleared by the SRC.The composition of the SRC is an additional director general of police (ADGP) or inspector general of police (IG)-level police officer from the state police, a representative from the state home department, and a representative of Central Armed Police Forces. The definition set by the MHA, for screening says, “The naxalite who surrenders may be a hardcore, underground naxalite cadre and a member of a Dalam and surrenders in accordance with the comprehensive surrender and rehabilitation policy being implemented by the concerned State Government. Rehabilitation of surrendered naxalite should be confined to dalam members and above, other ranks and overground supporters/sympathisers being considered only in exception cases. The authority designated by the concerned State Government for the purpose should ensure that the surrenderee is a genuine naxalite and the naxalite should make a clear confession of all the criminal acts committed by him/her including names of planners and other participants, names of financers, harbourers, couriers, details of the naxal organizations, arms / ammunition and the property looted/distributed/disposed of by the naxalite and organization to which the naxalite belongs, which may be verified.” The numbersThe records of the Chhattisgarh Police show that 1,462 surrenders have taken place in the past 33 months, from January 1, 2018, to September 25. Of these, as many as 1,223 were in the three districts of Dantewada, Sukma and Narayanpur. Of the 1,462 recorded surrenders, the district police administrations only sent 113 cases for scrutiny to the SRC, of which 47 were approved, and 66 were rejected. In 2018, 18 were approved by the committee of which only one was a “category 1” cadre. In both 2019 and 2020, the number approved was 14 (all category 2A and 2B) and this year, till September 25, only one surrender has been approved by the committee. The last meeting of the committee was on June 26 and another meeting of committee is scheduled in November, officials said. The SRC generally meets twice a year. The debate around surrendersHuman rights activists, who work in Bastar, said that the numbers are evidence that most surrenders that occur in the region are fake, and that this required an explanation from the police. Bela Bhatia, a human rights activist and lawyer, said, “Does this mean cases shown as surrenders are actually fake surrenders? The police in Chhattisgarh should be asked to explain. Our ground work has shown that ordinary villagers get picked up and are given the option to surrender or face imprisonment. Rather than facing long years behind bars, individuals settle for the former.” Senior police officials in Chhattisgarh defended the low number of cases being sent to SRC and being approved but claimed that the poor surrender numbers of top cadres is cause for concern.“Only those Maoists who have rewards on their heads and have police records are considered for compensation under governments’ surrender and rehabilitation policy, and that too if the surrender is approved by the state-level committee. Many lower cadres surrender before the police and go back to their villages and live a normal life. We don’t compensate them because they are not active. The aim of these small cadres when they surrender is to remove themselves from polices’ list and live a life without police fear,” said OP Pal, deputy director general (DIG) of State intelligence Bureau (SIB), and Surrender and Rehabilitation officer of Chhattisgarh, the head of the SRC. The DIG further said that lot of these surrendered Maoists are low-level cadres or a part of the “Jan Militia”, who have no bounty on their heads. “However, there are other benefits for them in different departments including – Below Poverty Level (BPL) cards, education and hostel facilities for their children, various health services, houses under state or central schemes, training for self-reliance and employment, if they are eligible for government jobs including induction in the police force,” Pal said. Activists, however, point out that these are routine benefits available to all. An IPS officer working in Bastar said that even in the case of cadres with bounties, there are bureaucratic challenges, such as what lists their names appear on. “Even with cadres who have rewards, many do not have their profiles in the state headquarters’ records, so their names are not approved,” he said, adding that the state intelligence bureau list should be regularly updated.The official added that with the primary LWE districts in Chhattisgarh-Dantewada, Bijapur, Sukma and Narayanpur, being geographically contiguous with Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, a region from where much of the top Maoist leadership hails, most choose to surrender in their home states. “It is a fact that very few senior cadres are surrendering in Chhattisgarh. This is because there is no pressure on them here as there have hardly been any arrests, or encounters where they have been reached, which means there is less incentive or fear to surrender. They largely operate in south Bastar which still has vast swathes where they are completely in control. Most importantly, most of the senior cadres are from AP and Telangana and more likely to surrender in their home states,” said the officer.Another police official based in Raipur said that the surrender of low-level cadre, despite them not making the basic SRC grade, should be seen as a positive sign. “Yes, this (low approval rate under SRC) is an issue of concern and the reasons should be discussed by the police and government. But, I believe that the surrender of lower cadre is also a positive sign because it reflects that people are leaving the movement and shifting from Maoist ideology or they have lost faith in Maoism,” said the officer. The people caught in betweenYet, for those Maoists who surrendered under the impression that they would be the recipient of the long list of benefits, but failed to make the grade, these debates bring little solace. Mahru Ram Punem is now part of the police, with the Narayanpur’s District Reserve Guard, carrying a gun again, a protagonist in a battle he was trying to escape. The DRG is a wing of the state police raised in May 2015, which operates in Bastar, and is comprised primarily of locals and surrendered Maoists, with the operational argument for them being that they provide innate knowledge of both the Maoists and the difficult terrain. “I had ₹8 lakh reward on my head when I surrendered in 2014. I was a platoon commander in Indravati Area Committee. I got ₹10,000 on the day and since then, I have received nothing. I have written many times to senior police officers but all of it has been in vain. In 2018, the police inducted me in the district DRG, but I have not received what I was promised,” said Punem, now posted in Narayanpur. Intelligence officers operating in Bastar said that there is clearly a question mark on the effectiveness of the state’s surrender policy if so many of the surrenders were “jan militia” with little to no stated police records. “It’s almost ironical that the state police claims that most of its surrenders are jan militia, who will not find mention in the surrender policy. This is only beefing up numbers to hide that very few active Maoists are actually surrendering. Area Committee Members (ACMs) or Divisional Committee Members (DCMs) seldom do it. The surrender of militia is like pruning the tree, which will constantly regenerate,” said one.But for 32-year-old Madka Varte, the process of surrendering to the Dantewada Police has brought another deep fear, typical to others like him. Varte is a resident of Mahrakarka village, falling under the Malangir Area Committee in the Maoist lexicon. He surrendered to the Dantewada Police in 2020, and was given at the time, ₹10,000 and nine goats. “Seven of the goats are now dead, and I have nothing left. Worse, because I surrendered, the Maoists think I am a police informer. I live in fear,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dichotomy-between-maoist-surrender-and-rehab-numbers-101634754443964.html
20-10-2021||India||At CBI-CVC meet, PM calls for zero tolerance to corruption||iPrime Minister Narendra Modi called on the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Central Vigilance Commission to have a “zero tolerance” policy towards corruption and ensure that there were no safe havens for those committing crimes against the country.Addressing a joint conference of the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) virtually, Modi said that over the past seven years, the work of his government has given people faith that corruption can be stopped.“People of the country have faith today that they will get benefits of government schemes without any give and take or without any middlemen.”Comparing this with the record of the previous government he said they lacked the will to control corruption.“The way the earlier government functioned, it lacked the political and administrative will to fight corruption. Today, there is a political will and administrative reforms are also being carried out to achieve the goal.”The second term of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government was marked by several high profile corruption scandals and a popular protest against corruption and it is widely believed that its loss in the 2014 elections was partly on account of this. PM reminded the officers about their responsibility. “You have to remember that your partnership is with this ‘mitti’ (soil), with Maa Bharti (Mother India).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/atcbicvcmeet-pm-calls-for-zero-tolerance-to-corruption-101634754349769.html
20-10-2021||India||Opposition plans to challenge Centre’s BSF order during Winter session||New Delhi: India’s opposition parties protesting the enhanced jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF) in three states have drawn up a plan to challenge the Union government’s order in Parliament . They have included the subject “border management” for review in the parliamentary home affairs panel on Wednesday to pave the way for the scrutiny of the new BSF rule. On October 11, the Union government notified the jurisdiction of the BSF has been extended to another 35 kms from the border from the current 15 kms in three states—Punjab, Assam and West Bengal. It also notified that in Gujarat, which shares international border with Pakistan, the jurisdiction has been brought down to 50 kms from 80 kms. It stayed the same (50 km) in Rajasthan. BSF has explained that the changes bring uniformity to its jurisdiction across border states, and government officials have pointed out that the enhanced jurisdiction is also a function of technology, such as drones, being used to drop weapons, explosives, drugs and cash from across the border, but opposition parties have protested the move which they see as the Union stepping on the turf of states. The executive amendments were made under section 139 (1) of the 1968-era BSF Act, but opposition parties such as the Trinamool Congress and Congress have latched on another provision under the same section, 139(3), to seek an amendment of the order in the winter session of Parliament that is likely to start in mid- November. 139(3) states “Every order made under this section shall be laid, as soon as may be after it is made, before each house of Parliament while it is in session for a total period of thirty days.” The same section also gives power to lawmakers to approve or modify the order. 193(3) of the BSF Act adds that the executive order will be effective after “both houses agree in making any modification in the order or both Houses agree that the order should not be made.” The order is automatically approved after 30 days if there is no further modification. For the Opposition to negate the new BSF order, it has to pass a motion in the house against the new amendments, which looks unlikely given the numbers. Parliament is no stranger to Opposition’s challenge against executive orders on central laws. In 2012, then Opposition parties such as the BJP and the Left, wanted amendments on the changes in FEMA rules that allowed foreign investment in retail stores. FDI in multi-brand retail turned into a major political clash and the UPA even lost its crucial ally Trinamool Congress over the proposed entry of foreign capital into the sector. In 2018, when the Narendra Modi government notified the automatic route for up to 49% foreign investment in defence firms, the Congress and other opposition forces sought to challenge it. In both cases, the Opposition couldn’t succeed and the notifications were approved. At the first meeting of the revamped panel on home affairs on Wednesday, some Opposition leaders suggested that border management should be included in the context of the new amendments in the BSF rules. Chairman Anand Sharma (of the Congress) suggested that it can be added in the pending subject on coastal security. “The first meeting on border security which would cover the BSF issue, is likely to be held in November. It has been also decided that all concerned states as well as the union home secretary will be asked to depose before the panel,” a member said.The TMC, which is vehemently opposed to the power of the BSF to arrest anyone or conduct search operations within 50 km from the border without informing the local police, alleged that the new order has a political undertone. “Out of 23 districts in WB, 10 will be affected by this new order. It will also apply to 21 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats and practically the entire North Bengal (BJP’s bastion in Bengal) will come under the purview of the new order,” said a senior TMC leader who asked not to be named. The TMC and the BJP fought an intense and bitter election that the former won with a clear majority. Relations between the two sides have worsened further since then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-plans-to-challenge-centre-s-bsf-order-during-winter-session-101634754381964.html
20-10-2021||India||5 dead, many stranded amid rains, landslides in Bengal and Sikkim||At least five people, including two children, have died in various rain-related incidents in the tiny Himalayan state of Sikkim and the tea growing region of north Bengal which have been witnessing torrential downpour (no floods) and major landslides since Monday night. Normal life was thrown out of gear and hundreds of tourists, who thronged the popular hill destinations during the Durga Puja season, were stranded after National Highway-10, the main road linking Gangtok with the rest of the country, was snapped due to landslides in the area. The arterial roads connecting various spots in Darjeeling and Kalimpong hills were damaged at several points while NH-10 was believed to be damaged in at least 16 areas. Power supply and mobile network services were also affected. Two children, aged 8 and 10 years, were washed away in the swelling waters of Torsa River in Alipurduar on Wednesday. One died in West Bengal’s Kalimpong district on Tuesday, two died in Sikkim on Monday. .A home guard, identified as Suman Thapa, went missing after a landslide in Darjeeling.Several teams of National Disaster Response Force and civil defence have been deployed in these areas for rescue work.In a letter to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, BJP MP from Darjeeling district, Raju Bista, sought additional teams of forces to tackle the situation.“Several areas such as Rimbick-Lodhoma, Tangta-Jaldhaka, Tukdah-Teesta Valley, various parts of Mirik subdivision, Lopchu-Peshok, Algara-Lava and Goke-Bijanbari have been virtually cut off from the rest of the country due to landslides. Over 50 houses have been damaged and a few hundred families could be rendered homeless,” he said. In the foothills in Siliguri, four houses were swept by Balasan River near Matigara. Darjeeling district magistrate S Poonambalam said: “Roads, which were closed due to landslides, are being gradually cleared and opened for traffic. Tourists were being rescued and provided relief.” The Rangpo Bridge, which connects Sikkim and West Bengal, was found to be in a precarious condition after the supporting pillars were damaged as the powerful Teesta river swept embankments at many points. East Sikkim district magistrate Ragul K, who took stock of the situation at the border town at Rangpo, said: “We have decided to allow the movements of light vehicles only.” The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said that the intensity of rain would decline in the next 48 hours. “Very heavy rain was recorded in the districts of north ,including Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Jalpaiguri. We had issued a red alert for Wednesday. The intensity of rain is likely to decrease over the next two days even though there would be light to moderate rain,” Sanjib Banerjee, deputy director general of IMD’s regional office in Kolkata, said. According to an IMD official, Darjeeling received around 233mm rain while Kalimpong received around 199mm rain in the last 24 hours. “Jalpaiguri and Siliguri at the foothills in north Bengal received around 151mm and 195mm rain, respectively, during the same period,” said a IMD official in Kolkata. While south Bengal too witnessed heavy rainfall in the past few days, the intensity has now reduced. While IMD stations located in coastal areas such as Canning, Haldia and Digha recorded more than 100mm of rain on Monday, in the last 24 hours, the amount of rain in these stations dropped to less than 25mm. Kolkata received just around 6.3mm rain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-dead-many-stranded-amid-rains-landslides-in-bengal-and-sikkim-101634754155263.html
20-10-2021||India||8 trekkers among 14 missing after heavy snowfall in Uttarkashi||Dehradun: Fourteen people, including eight trekkers from West Bengal and Delhi, were reported missing in two separate incidents amid heavy snowfall in Uttarakhand’s Uttarkashi district, officials said on Wednesday. In the first incident, on October 14, a team of 17 people left for a trek to Chitkul via Harsil in Uttarkashi district. They were supposed to reach Chitkul on October 19, but 11 of them went missing on October 18. “The team had gone for trekking near Lamkhaga Pass which is a 90km long trekking route passing through the remotest valleys of Kinnaur in Himachal Pradesh and Gangotri in Uttarkashi. However, on Monday, due to snowfall in the area, 11 went missing. Six of them, all porters, managed to go to the ITBP camp in Chitkul village in Kinnaur and inform them about the incident on Tuesday,” said Jai Panwar, consultant to Uttarkashi district on disaster management. “Of the 11 missing from the trekking route, eight are trekkers while three are porters. Seven of the eight trekkers hailed from West Bengal while one is from Delhi. The three porters were local,” he added.In the second incident, three porters went missing on October 17 when they were accompanying ITBP personnel to their posts near the Indo-China border in Uttarkashi. “The ITBP officers, who informed the SDRF to seek help in finding them, said that the local porters had left for the border with ITBP men on October 15. However, on October 17, they got separated from the ITBP men due to heavy snowfall and went missing. The ITBP informed the district administration on the same on Tuesday evening after which on Wednesday, a chopper of the air force left with the SDRF personnel to search the missing people,” said Panwar, adding that a team of ITBP personnel had also left from their base in Neelapani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/8-trekkers-among-14-missing-after-heavy-snowfall-in-uttarkashi-101634754149323.html
20-10-2021||India||Overflowing Naini Lake floods Nainital’s Mall Road||Dehradun: With parts of Nainital district receiving the highest-ever rainfall in the last 124 years, water from Naini Lake overflowed its bank and flooded the iconic Mall Road and Naina Devi temple complex on Tuesday. Several visuals on social media showed people wading through ankle-deep floods as water from the mango-shaped lake, which is situated at a height of 1,938 metres, overflowed and entered residential and business areas. Even fish from the lake spilled over to the streets, prompting a few local residents to put them inside a bucket and release them later into the lake.Some people were also spotted kayaking down the flooded Mall Road. “You could swim and move in a boat on the flooded road here. I also saw fish in large numbers moving in the waters on the road. I have never seen such a sight here before,” Pawan Singh Bisht, who runs a shop near the lakeshore, said. Noted environmentalist Ajay Singh Rawat, who lives in Nainital, said it is for the first time that the lake has overflown to such an extent. “In 1995, the water had overflown to some extent. But this time, it has happened in a big way. I don’t think such a case has happened here before,” he said. Generally, Rawat said, local authorities tend to release the waters into Baliyanala when the water level rises in the lake. “But this time, the rains were so severe that it left the entire area inundated,” he said. In 1880, 151 people were killed after a major landslide hit Nainital’s Sher Ka Danda area. Following this, a 79 km drain network was built by the British along the slopes and Nainital was divided into safe and prohibited zones for construction. “But constructions have come up in the same zones as well. And some constructions are over three storeys. Many drains have narrowed down due to encroachment and dumping of solid waste inside them. This has affected the free flow of rainwater into the lake,” Rawat said. Maruti Sah, president of Talital market association in Nainital, alleged that the authorities opened the gate of the lake late despite a rain alert in the district. “They opened the lake gate manually at 1.30 pm on Tuesday but it was already late. They should have opened the gate well in advance,” he said, adding that several people and traders around the lakeshore were affected.Varun Adhikrai, a resident of Nainital who works as a consultant geologist with the railway ministry in North East, said the overflowing of the lake may impact the stability of its slopes and sidewalls. “One overlooked factor which can contribute to slope instability around the lake is the sudden fluctuation in the water level. A full lake itself creates pressure on the slope walls on its sides. And when the water level suddenly drops by even a few metres, it can lead to slope instability on the sides of the lake and even cause a landslide,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/overflowing-naini-lake-floods-nainital-s-mall-road-101634754148082.html
20-10-2021||India||State govt to get initial results of 7th sero survey on Monday, detailed report||The preliminary results of the seventh round of the serological survey conducted in Delhi last month to estimate the population-level exposure to the Sars-CoV-2 virus (which causes Covid-19) are likely to be submitted to the state government on Monday, according to officials aware of the matter.“This round of the survey was conducted in great detail, so it will take some time to analyse the data. However, a preliminary report will be submitted on Monday. A more detailed report is likely to be submitted in early November, around Diwali,” said an official from Delhi’s health department who asked not to be named. Diwali this year will be celebrated on November 7.The complete report will also contain information about vaccine eagerness or hesitancy, which was among the “extensive list of questions” for which data was collected digitally during the survey, said the official.The government roped in three non-governmental organisations to help collect data during the current survey.Sero surveys are blood tests that check for antibodies to a virus. They are a good measure of the exposure of a population to the pathogen. They are also a proxy for the level of broad immunity that exists in the population, although the best immunity is that achieved through vaccination.A portion of the samples collected will also be analysed for neutralising antibodies that specifically target the Sars-CoV-2 virus. This will help researchers correlate the level of IgG antibodies detected in semi-quantitative tests (which just show whether levels of an element are high or low) to the level of neutralising antibodies and thereby estimate the protection that a person has from the coronavirus disease.This will be the Delhi government’s first complete survey after the brutal fourth wave of infections, which saw the city add over 28,000 infections at its peak.The last round of the survey in Delhi in April was interrupted due to the emergence of the fourth wave. Just 13,000 samples were collected, instead of the 28,000 targeted.These samples, however, returned a reading of nearly 56%, which means 56 of every 100 residents of the Union territory were exposed to the virus. The previous five surveys returned readings of 56.13%, 25.5%, 25.1%, 29.1%, and 22.6% respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-govt-to-get-initial-results-of-7th-sero-survey-on-monday-detailed-report-101634754052581.html
20-10-2021||India||New weapons deployed in east to counter China||BUM LA (ARUNACHAL PRADESH): The Indian Army has positioned new weapon systems in the eastern sector to strengthen its posture against the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA), which has ramped up military drills across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Arunachal Pradesh amid the lingering border row in Ladakh, officers familiar with the development said on Wednesday.The new weapons deployed in the sector include the M777 ultra-light howitzers that can be swiftly deployed and redeployed in challenging mountainous terrain using the CH-47F Chinook helicopters, said one of the officers cited above.The army has also inducted the upgraded L-70 anti-aircraft gun, a legacy weapon manufactured by Swedish arms firm Bofors AB, into the eastern sector to tackle aerial threats. This is the first time the upgraded L-70 gun has been positioned in high altitude, said a second officer.Both M777 and L-70 guns are held by regiments holding ground near LAC.“There are many places where heavier artillery guns cannot be deployed because of the terrain. But the M777s can be sling-loaded to Chinooks and swiftly inserted there,” said Brigadier Sanjeev Kumar, the commander of an artillery brigade in Arunachal Pradesh.The 155 mm/39-caliber M777 howitzers have a range of up to 30km. “But it is capable of striking targets at ranges of more than 40km in some areas where the geography allows the shells to fly in rarified air,” Kumar said at a forward location at a height of 13,500 feet in the Bum La sector.Their tactical mobility has enhanced the army’s capabilities significantly, he added.The arsenal in Kumar’s brigade includes the 155 mm FH 77 BO2 guns, better known as Bofors.“If the enemy were to launch an offensive in this sector, the M777s and the Bofors will play a key role in crushing it,” said an officer whose unit is located barely two km from LAC.The M777s are also deployed in Ladakh where India and China have been locked in a border row for over 17 months.India ordered 145 howitzers from the US for $750 million in November 2016.The M777s are a key component of the army’s field artillery rationalisation plan (FARP), cleared in 1999. The ₹50,000-crore FARP lays down the road map for inducting new 155mm weaponry, including tracked self-propelled guns, truck-mounted gun systems, towed artillery pieces and wheeled self-propelled guns. The plan seeks to equip 169 artillery regiments with a mix of nearly 3,000 guns over the next decade, as previously reported by Hindustan Times.M777 manufacturer BAE Systems has delivered 25 ready-built howitzers and the remaining 120 guns are being built locally in collaboration with Mahindra Defence under the Modi government’s Make in India initiative.An M777 howizer weighs only 4,218kg, which is half the weight of conventional artillery guns deployed in the northern and eastern sectors.The upgraded L-70 guns that have just arrived in the eastern sector are capable of shooting down modern combat aircraft, armed helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles and smaller drones.The guns, upgraded indigenously by Bharat Electronics Limited, have a range of 3.5 km.“The induction of upgraded L-70s here is an important capability upgrade. The biggest threat we face here is the aerial threat,” said a senior officer, asking not to be named.The upgraded L-70s have superior target acquisition and tracking capability with high resolution electro-optical sensors consisting of a thermal imaging camera and a laser ramge finder, said Captain Sariya Abbasi, a troop commander with an air defence regiment equpped with the guns.“The gun is also equipped with a new radar for enhancing fire accuracy. It can be integrated with tactical and fire control radars for more flexibility in deployment,” she said, during a demonstration of the gun’s capability at a forward location near LAC.Abbasi said the legacy gun was now a sophisticated air defence weapon.On Tuesday, Eastern Army commander Lieutenant General Manoj Pande said new equipment deployed in the Ladakh sector was being simultaneously inducted in the east, with focus on enhancing mobility, drone and counter-drone systems, precision-guided ammunition and surveillance systems.He also said the army had strengthened its deployment in areas where it was previously thin, and adequate forces were deployed to deal with any contingency.Soldiers on the ground are prepared for any eventuality and train hard daily to succeed in assigned missions.“Our defences and preparations are such that any misadventure by the adversary will be thwarted, no matter where he comes from,” said Major Rufus Johnson, a company commander of 18 Kumaon deployed at a height of 15,500 feet near LAC.Rufus is in charge of a location that forms the first line of defence against the Chinese near Bum La. There are scores of such locations along LAC in Arunachal Pradesh (the army calls them ‘integrated defended locations’) that have the responsiblity of thwarting adventurous moves by the enemy.At Johnson’s location, one of the many forward locations that HT visited on Wednesday, drills have been structured to instil aggression in soldiers.They follow something called Plan 190, as do other forward-deployed soldiers umder Tawang-based HQs 190 Brigade. It involves aggressive training, vigorous exercise, and meditation.“To deal with a wicked enemy and to carry out our unique operational role, it’s critical to instill aggression in soldiers. It prepares them to fight in a treacherous environment,” Rufus added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-weapons-deployed-in-east-to-counter-china-101634753301873.html
20-10-2021||India||PM pushes for enhancing storage facilities for crude||rime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday called for enhancing storage facilities for crude oil during a virtual meeting with chief executives of global oil companies.Those who attended the meeting included Amin Nasser, president and CEO of the world’s biggest oil producer Saudi Arabian Oil Co, Russia’s OAO Rosneft chairman and CEO Igor Sechin and London-based BP Plc CEO Bernard Looney.“Talking about the oil sector, he said that the focus has shifted from ‘revenue’ to ‘production’ maximization. He also spoke about the need to enhance storage facilities for crude oil,” the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.This comes against the backdrop of plans by Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd (ISPRL) to sell 2.17 million barrels of crude oil each to Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) by December, totalling 4.34 million barrels.This is the sixth such meeting that Modi has held with CEOs of energy majors. Attendees also included petroleum and natural gas minister Hardeep Singh Puri, Schlumberger Ltd CEO Olivier Le Peuch, Honeywell president and CEO Bryan Glover, Reliance Industries Ltd chairman Mukesh Ambani and Vedanta chairman Anil Agarwal.Modi’s call comes as India reels under high transportation fuel prices.India’s strategic petroleum reserves have started supplying crude oil to state-owned refiners. Last year, India bought crude oil at $19 a barrel to fill up its 5.3 million tonnes (mt) of strategic reserves, saving $685.11 million in the process. However, India has an existing crude storage capacity of 5.3 mt built at a cost of $600 million sufficient to meet around nine-and-a-half days of India’s crude oil requirements. The government has also approved the construction of an additional 6.5 mt of strategic crude oil reserves to support 12 days of crude oil requirements.In comparison, countries that are part of the International Energy Agency (IEA) hold 1.55 billion barrels of public emergency oil stocks. In addition, 650 million barrels are held by industry under government obligations and can be released as needed.“Prime Minister recounted that since 2016, the suggestions provided in these meetings have been immensely useful in understanding the challenges faced by the oil and gas sector. He said that India is a land of openness, optimism and opportunities and is brimming with new ideas, perspectives and innovation. He invited the CEOs and experts to partner with India in exploration and development of the oil and gas sector in India,” the PMO said.Speaking at the Fifth India Energy Forum by CERAWeek, Puri said, “India believes that access to energy must be affordable and reliable.”India has been making repeated appeals to the Opec- plus grouping that also includes Russia to hike production, as global energy markets across fuel sources including crude oil, gas and coal have been on a boil due to inadequate investments in view of the energy transition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmpushes-for-enhancing-storage-facilities-for-crude-101634753058043.html
20-10-2021||India||Flood-hit families recount horror as rain abates in Uttarakhand||Dehradun/Haldwani/Rudrapur: 54-year-old Kiran Negi was asleep in her home in Almora early on Tuesday morning, with her husband and two grandchildren aged 12 and 16 right next to her, when a loud noise outside woke her up with a start.In a few minutes, her home was crushed under boulders and rubble. Negi somehow managed to muster enough strength to extricate herself, but her family remained trapped for hours. The body of her husband, Anand Negi, 60 was removed by rescue workers around 12 pm on Tuesday . Her two young grandchildren were all pulled out -- alive, but injured. “We were sleeping in the house early in the morning when we heard a big blast-like sound. Soon after, heavy muck and boulders came crashing down on our house burying us under it. I couldn’t understand what had happened. I’m not sure how, but I somehow stood up and came out of the house. My husband and grandchildren couldn’t, and got buried in it. It was not rain, but death pouring from the clouds on Tuesday,” a sobbing Negi said over the phone. At least 52 people have died so far after record rains lashed Uttarakhand over the last three days. Of the deaths, 28 have been in Nainital district, which saw the Naini lake overflowing, prompting frantic rescue operations from the Army, NDRF and SDRF. Nine of these deaths occurred after a cloud burst in the Ramgarh block of the district early on Tuesday morning. Apart from Nainital, Champawat district reported 8 deaths, followed by Almora with 6.  In shock after coming out of the house, Negi began screaming for help, and neighbours rushed to do their best. “But they could not rescue them from the debris. After some time, the personnel from SDRF and NDRF (state and national disaster relief forces) came to rescue the three. They could only retrieve the body of my husband. My two grandchildren were rescued, but they were seriously injured,” she said. The two were rushed to a nearby hospital, and are now in a stable condition. Like Negi, 65-year-old Munni Devi from Chopra village near Nainital couldn’t stop her tears after losing her 32-year-old son, Manoj Kumar, who was swept away by an overflowing stream of water near his home in the village on Tuesday night. Kumar, worked as a storekeeper in a hotel in Nainital, was returning home on his motorbike when he lost control while crossing a stream of water. His body was recovered by rescue workers a few kilometres away from the spot on Wednesday morning. “The rains took my young son. I lost a piece of my heart. I had never imagined I would see this day at this age,” said an emotional Devi. Even as the village mourned, Devi prayed and said, “I just pray to Lord Kedarnath that such rains should never happen again which take someone’s dear ones away from them,” Munni Devi said. SDRF commandant Navneet Singh Bhullar who has been on the ground in Rudrapur to monitor and assist in relief and rescue said, “We have already rescued many people in the last three days. Several rescue operations are still on in the affected areas with additional deployment of personnel in sensitive areas.” Close to 1500 people have been rescued since Tuesday in different parts of the state, officials said.Six NDRF teams have been deployed in Udham Singh Nagar, two teams each are stationed in Uttarkashi, Chamoli and one each in Dehradun, Champawat, Pithoragarh and Haridwar. “Two teams and a sub-team have been deployed in Nainital while one sub-team is placed at Almora,” an NDRF spokesperson said.In Rudrapur town of Udham Singh Nagar district, which witnessed heavy flooding on Tuesday, 48-year-old Nandlal Gangwar remembers frantic moments of horror. “The floodwater stormed suddenly into our house and didn’t give us a chance to carry our clothes, ration or valuables. My family ran towards the terrace leaving everything behind. Our fridge, TV, washing machine, clothes, ration and all other valuables are completely destroyed,” said Gangwar. Gangwar spent the day on Tuesday, with the rest of his family on the terrace of his home, waiting for the water of the river Kalyani, in spate at the time, to subside. “We only got down in the morning on Wednesday when the floodwater level reduced,” she said.Earlier on Wednesday morning, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami visited affected areas of the state promising all possible help. “There has been massive damage. It will take time to return to normalcy - roads were washed away, there were landslides, rivers changed their routes, villages were affected, bridges collapsed,” Dhami said. “We want to assure the people that our government is with them in this hour of need. We are providing every possible help including food and medicines to the needy and will continue to do so,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/floodhit-families-recount-horror-as-rain-abates-in-uttarakhand-101634753072554.html
20-10-2021||India||Taliban dy PM meets Indian diplomats; both sides discuss concerns||NEW DELHI: A Taliban team led by deputy prime minister Abdul Salam Hanafi held talks with a delegation of Indian diplomats on the margins of a regional conference on Afghanistan hosted by Russia on Wednesday and reportedly discussed the need to address the concerns of both sides. There was no official word from the Indian side on the talks held on the sidelines of the “Moscow Format” meeting, which brought together diplomats from 10 countries, including India, Pakistan and China, and the Taliban delegation. The talks represented the first contact between the Indian side and a top member of the Taliban’s interim cabinet, which was formed last month after the group marched into Kabul on August 15 following the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani government. On August 31, India’s envoy to Qatar had met senior Taliban leader Sher Mohammed Abbas Stanekzai. A statement issued by Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the delegation led by Hanafi met the Indian team led by joint secretary JP Singh, head of the Pakistan- Afghanistan-Iran desk in the external affairs ministry on the sidelines of the Moscow Format meeting. “Both sides considered it necessary to address each other’s concerns and improve diplomatic and economic relations,” Mujahid said. The Indian side expressed its readiness to provide humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people, he added. People familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity that the Taliban spokesman’s remarks were not a full and accurate reflection of the discussions. India has said repeatedly in recent weeks that it stands ready to help the Afghan people against the backdrop of a looming humanitarian crisis. Earlier, diplomats from the 10 countries and the Taliban team discussed crucial issues such as providing humanitarian aid to Afghanistan and countering terror emanating from Afghan soil.A joint statement issued after the Moscow Format meeting noted the Taliban’s reaffirmation of previous commitments to “prevent use of the Afghan territory against its neighbours, other states in the region and the rest of the world”. Expressing concern at the activities of proscribed terrorist organisations in Afghanistan, the parties “reaffirmed their willingness to continue to promote security in Afghanistan”. The 10 countries called on the Taliban leadership to take “further steps to improve governance and to form a truly inclusive government that adequately reflects the interests of all major ethno-political forces”. They also called on the Taliban to “practice moderate and sound internal and external policies, adopt friendly policies towards neighbours of Afghanistan...and respect the rights of ethnic groups, women and children”.While expressing concern at the deteriorating economic and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, the parties proposed to convene an international donor conference under the auspices of the UN as soon as possible. In his opening remarks, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov called on the Taliban to prevent anyone from using Afghan territory against the interests of third countries, primarily the immediate neighbours and the Central Asian states. The Indian side was represented by joint secretary JP Singh and joint secretary (Eurasia) Adarsh Swaika. Discussions at the Moscow Format meeting dragged on for more than six hours, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. Lavrov, who held a separate meeting with the Taliban delegation before the Moscow Format meeting, said he had discussed with the Taliban leaders the need to prevent the use of Afghan soil against other countries. Pointing to the lack of stability in Afghanistan, Lavrov said: “Numerous terrorist groups, primarily the Islamic State and al-Qaeda, are trying to take advantage of this in turn, and are once again rearing their heads and launching brazen [and] deadly attacks in various parts of the country.” Speaking in Russian, he added, “Unfortunately, the problem of drug production in Afghanistan remains acute. Today there is a real threat of an overflow of terrorist and drug activity, including those masquerading as migration flows, onto the territory of neighbouring countries. In this context, for obvious reasons, we are especially concerned about the Central Asian region.” Countering these threats to the security of Afghanistan and the surrounding region requires a “timely, adequate response both within the country and from external partners”, Lavrov said. “We call on the Taliban movement to strictly follow the line of preventing anyone from using the territory of Afghanistan against the interests of third countries, primarily against Afghanistan’s immediate neighbours - the countries of Central Asia, our friends and allies.” The people cited above said the diplomats of several countries, including India, raised the counter-terrorism commitments made by the Taliban during the Moscow Format meeting. Lavrov also said sustainable peace could be achieved in Afghanistan through the formation of an “inclusive government, which should fully reflect the interests of all ethnic and political forces”. Hanafi, in his speech, contended the Taliban takeover of August 15 had resulted in a “historic transformation” that took place “without bloodshed and destruction”. According to the text of his speech released by the Taliban, he said the security situation in Afghanistan is “satisfactory” and the Afghan people “have a responsible government committed to the national interest and safeguarding political freedom”. The Afghan people, Hanafi said, expect the world community to “have a formal interaction” with the Taliban government as the “isolation of Afghanistan is of no benefit”. He also called on the US to lift a freeze on the foreign assets of Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/taliban-dy-pm-meets-indian-diplomats-both-sides-discuss-concerns-101634752704287.html

We love India. We view India as a huge friend and we’re looking forward to expanding our relationship in all fields and all dimensions,” Bennet was quoted as saying in an official statement issued by his media adviser.The meeting between Jaishankar and Bennet took place earlier in the day and saw the two leaders discuss varied topics revolving around “strengthening the strategic alliance, expanding bilateral ties and deepening the warm friendship” between India and Israel.Along with Jaishankar, Bennet also thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for their “personal commitment” to the alliance between Israel and India.Meanwhile, Jaishankar extended an invitation to Bennet on behalf of PM Modi to make his first official visit to India.On Monday, Jaishankar met his Israeli counterpart Yair Lapid wherein both parties agreed to renew negotiations on a free trade area agreement (FTA) from November, and also to mutually recognise Covid-19 vaccination certificates.

In its detailed order, the court laid out the reasons why it has denied bail to the accused. The cases of Rhea Chakraborty and Showik Chakraborty were mentioned in the order.The order referred to additional solicitor general Anil Singh's argument that Showik Chakraborty was also not in possession of drugs when the Narcotics Control Bureau arrested him. But the Bombay high court said that Showik appeared to be an important link in the chain of drug dealers. "He was in touch with different dealers. He had monetary transactions with them. Disclosure by each of them has led to the discovery of the involvement of others. Hence it is not desirable to release the applicant on bail at this stage," the order said citing the high court's past verdict regarding Showik.Only Aryan Khan has the details of...: 5 things court said while denying bail to SRK's son"...As held in the case of Shwoik Chakraborty, since accused are part of the conspiracy, each of them is liable for the entire quantity of drugs seized. Case of each accused can not be segregated from each other and can not be considered in isolation," the court said commenting on the present case of Aryan Khan. No drugs were found on Aryan Khan, but the court in its verdict stated that his case is not separate from the others who were arrested with drugs in their possession.The order then mentioned Rhea Chakraborty's case and said, "In the authority od Rhea Chakraborty (supra), it has been made clear that all offences under NDPS Act are non-bailable...Jurisdiction to grant bail is circumscribed by the provisions of Section 37 of the NDPS Act which can be granted in the case when there are reasonable grounds to believe that accused is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail."Bollywood actor Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik Chakraborty were arrested last year in connection with the drug angle of Sushant Singh Rajput's death. They were accused of procuring drugs for Sushant. They got bail after spending months in jail. Their arrest last year brought Bollywood on NCB's radar as the agency questioned many Bollywood personalities in the last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-court-mentions-rhea-showik-chakraborty-in-order-denying-aryan-khan-s-bail-101634751217520.html
20-10-2021||India||SKM reiterates demand for fair probe into Lakhbir Singh murder, alleges conspiracy to defame farmers’ protest||The Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of farmers union, on Wednesday restated its demand for a “comprehensive investigation” regarding the murder of Lakhbir Singh by a group of Nihang Sikhs near the protest site at Delhi’s Singhu border. The body also said that the “true story” behind the murder should be revealed and called it an “attempt to tarnish the image of the farmers’ movement.”"We reiterate our demand for a comprehensive investigation into the conspiracy related to the brutal murder at the Singhu border on October 15. While the attempt to tarnish the image of the farmers' movement has not succeeded, the true story behind the whole episode has to come out to reveal to the world what the BJP is up to," the SKM said in a statement.The SKM’s demands came after the body of Lakhbir Singh, a Dalit farm labourer, was found tied to a barricade at the Singh border, where the farmers have been protesting against the three farm laws. He was killed by a group of Nihang Sikhs who had alleged that the victim had desecrated a Sikh holy book. After the incident, the SKM had distanced itself from the Nihangs and said that neither the accused in the case nor the victim were related to the union.Meanwhile, the victim’s family has denied the claim that he had disrespected a holy book and has also requested a high-level probe into the murder. Also, four people have been so far arrested in connection with the killings and are currently in police custody."As more news emerges about a group of Nihang Sikhs having met the Union agriculture minister in the presence of other people with dubious antecedents, and even about the offer of money for leaving the morcha sites, the SKM reiterates its demand for a comprehensive investigation into the conspiracy related to the brutal murder at the Singhu border," the SKM further said in its statement.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/skm-reiterates-demand-for-fair-probe-into-lakhbir-singh-murder-alleges-conspiracy-to-defame-farmers-protest-101634750851613.html

20-10-2021||India||India, UK to discuss advanced propulsion systems for warships on Friday||NEW DELHI: India and the UK will discuss the British side’s offer to supply advanced electrical propulsion systems for warships at a meeting on Friday that will coincide with a visit by foreign secretary Liz Truss and chief of defence staff Gen Nicholas Carter.The UK also plans to have a more enduring presence in the western Indian Ocean by deploying two offshore patrol vessels in the region from 2022, and a littoral defence group based around amphibious vessels from 2023, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.The first meeting of a working group to discuss cooperation on integrated full electric propulsion systems will be held in Mumbai on Friday as part of engagements during a visit by the UK carrier strike group led by the HMS Queen Elizabeth, Britain’s largest warship.The UK is seen as a leader in these propulsion systems, which are used in the Type 23 frigate and Type 45 destroyer that are part of the carrier strike group. The Indian side has shown interest in the systems, and the people cited above said the two sides were in the very early stage of talks on the issue.Experts and operators from both sides will participate in Friday’s meeting to frame terms of reference for further discussions. The British side developed integrated full electric propulsion systems and removed risks associated with them while developing the Type 45 vessels, the people said.Almost 10% of the UK carrier strike group’s global deployment has been devoted to interactions and exercises with the Indian Navy and the two sides will conduct Exercise Konkan Shakti, the first wargames involving all three services of both countries during October 25-27. These drills are part of the shared interest of the two countries to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific.The naval interactions are expected to continue even after the UK carrier strike group ends its deployment in November in view of the UK’s plans to deploy the offshore patrol vessels in the western Indian Ocean in 2022, later and a littoral defence group. These deployments are expected to be done from Oman, the people said.The littoral defence group is a new formation based around amphibious warships and Royal Marines that are aimed at allowing the UK to carry out maritime security tasks, including counter-terrorism, evacuation missions, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. The people cited above did not rule out the possibility of joint patrols between the British warships and vessels of regional countries such as India.Truss, who will begin a three-day visit to India on Friday, will hold talks with external affairs minister S Jaishankar in New Delhi before travelling to Mumbai for talks with business leaders on Saturday. The UK side is keen to launch negotiations with India on a free trade agreement as part of the Roadmap 2030 launched by the two sides in May.The UK chief of defence staff, Gen Carter, will hold talks with his Indian counterpart, General Bipin Rawat. The Royal Navy chief, Admiral Tony Radakin, who is set to take over as chief of defence staff in November, will also be in India and will hold talks with his Indian counterpart. Defence and security is one of the five elements of the India-UK comprehensive strategic partnership, the others being trade and investment, climate change, health, and the “living bridge” for the flow of ideas and people between the two sides. The UK’s integrated review of security, defence and foreign policy, unveiled in March, included a tilt towards the Indo-Pacific to unlock new opportunities across the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-uk-to-discuss-advanced-propulsion-systems-for-warships-on-friday-101634750842406.html
20-10-2021||India||Diplomats from 12 countries participate in the event to open Kushinagar airport||NEW DELHI: Senior diplomats and officials from 12 countries with sizeable Buddhist populations, including Sri Lanka and Japan, joined the inauguration of Kushinagar international airport on Wednesday as part of India’s drive to popularise the Buddhist tourism circuit.Besides Sri Lanka’s sports minister Namal Rajapaksa, ambassadors of Bhutan, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam and senior diplomats from Mongolia, Nepal, Japan, South Korea, Sri Lanka, and Singapore participated in the ceremony led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to open the airport.The move comes against the backdrop of China’s efforts to project soft power through public diplomacy focused on Buddhism. The officially atheist Chinese Communist Party hosts the so-called World Buddhist Forum every three years. In recent years, China has sought to project that it will have the final say in choosing the next Dalai Lama while contending that India should have no role in the process.The inaugural international flight at the airport arrived from Sri Lanka with a delegation led by cabinet minister Namal Rajapaksa, the son of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa. The delegation included 100 Buddhist monks, four state ministers and senior officials.“We believe the opening of Kushinagar [airport] will increase the number of travellers from Sri Lanka and also travellers from all over the world,” Rajapaksa said, adding it was an honour that his delegation was on the first flight to land at the airport. The Sri Lankan monks belong to different sects and prominent temples in more than 20 districts across the country. The only documented relics of Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka, the Piprahwa relics that are kept at Waskaduwa Viharaya in Kalutara, were brought by the delegation. The Kapilvastu relics of India, which have travelled abroad for display only six times in the past, were sent to Sri Lanka in 1978 and 2012.Buddhism is seen as an important bridge connecting the people of India and Sri Lanka. The advent of Buddhism in Sri Lanka in the 3rd century BC is linked with the arrival of Prince Mahendra and Princess Sanghamitra, the children of Emperor Ashoka.During a virtual India-Sri Lanka Summit in September 2020, Modi announced an outlay of $15 million to promote Buddhist ties between the two countries. Kushinagar has an important place on the global Buddhist map because of its rich heritage. Lord Buddha attained “Mahaparirvana” in the city and other important sites such as Sravasti, Kapilvastu and Lumbini are located nearby. These factors attract pilgrims from countries such as Cambodia, Japan, Myanmar and Thailand to Kushinagar. A large number of foreign devotees visited the Mahaparinirvana Temple in the pre-Covid-19 period.The new airport is expected to pave the way for more flights to Kushinagar from Buddhist countries. Vietnamese ambassador Pham Sanh Chau and Thai envoy Pattarat Hongtong said the new airport will reduce the distance for travellers from their countries bound for Buddhist sites and also boost tourism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/diplomats-from-12-countries-participate-in-the-event-to-open-kushinagar-airport-101634749342259.html

A lie detector test and a psychoanalysis test was also conducted on the duo.The judge was fatally knocked down by an autorickshaw when he was on a morning jog in Dhanbad. The Supreme Court and the Jharkhand high court had taken suo motu cognisance of the hit-and-run incident in which the judge was killed after CCTV footage showed a three-wheeler swerving on an empty road to hit down as he was jogging.The Supreme Court later also expressed distress over rising incidents of physical and verbal attacks on judges throughout the country.CCTV footage showed that he was jogging on one side of a wide road at the Randhir Verma Chowk when the autorickshaw veered towards him, hit him from behind and fled the scene.The CBI has recreated the scene, while experts of the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) have also collected evidence from the spot.The case was handed over by the Jharkhand government to CBI, which dispatched a 20-member team led by investigator VK Shukla under the overall supervision of joint director Sharad Aggarwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-files-charge-sheet-in-dhanbad-judge-murder-case-still-probing-conspiracy-101634744662190.html

20-10-2021||India||Why keep out private doctors out of ₹50 lakh Covid insurance scheme, asks SC||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the Centre to explain why doctors and health workers battling the Covid-19 pandemic in private clinics and dispensaries were excluded from the ambit of the central insurance scheme promising ₹50 lakh to families of health workers who died battling the deadly pathogen.“Prima facie the objective of the scheme is to provide social security to health professionals in view of the risks they faced due to Covid-19, be it in public or private institutions,” the bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna said on a petition by family members of seven doctors who died in Mumbai during the first and second wave of the coronavirus pandemic.On March 9, the Bombay high court held that private hospital staffers were not entitled to insurance coverage under “Insurance scheme for hospital workers fighting Covid-19” unless their services were “requisitioned” by the central or state government.The scheme, which was launched on March 30, 2020, under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package (PMGKP), assured ₹50 lakh to the family of health workers employed in public healthcare institutions who died due to Covid. It was extended only to those private hospital staffers and contract workers whose services were “requisitioned” for Covid duties by the state or central government hospitals or autonomous institutions such as AIIMSA Union health ministry statement on Wednesday said the scheme, which was due to end on 20 October, will continue for another six months. The statement said 1,351 claims have been paid under the scheme during the past 19 months. It did not indicate the number of claims which were filed, or rejected. The funds for the scheme were allocated from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), and released through the New India Assurance Company.As the bench issued notice to the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Maharashtra government on Wednesday, the judges noted that the petition raised issues of considerable public importance since it has bearing on the security of health professionals who served the nation during Covid-19.Though the petition before the high court was filed by the widow of one medical practitioner, the court allowed the family of seven doctors (including the petitioner before the high court) to appear before the top court in view of the “nationwide consequences” flowing from the order.The court requested the solicitor general Tushar Mehta to assist in the matter when it comes up for hearing next after three weeks. “We request the solicitor general to assist the Court with regard to the interpretation of the scheme and to ensure the object underlying the insurance scheme is duly fulfilled,’ the order said.Pradeep Arora, one of the petitioners who appeared in person before the top court, faulted the high court order as it failed to consider an order issued by the Commissioner of Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation on March 31, 2020, directing all clinics and private medical establishments to remain open to serve Covid-19 patients even when the nationwide lockdown was in place.This order was passed pursuant to an earlier order of the state government on March 14 under the Epidemic Act 1897 requiring all medical institutions to remain at the disposal of the municipal commissioner for steps to prevent and contain Covid-19.He said doctors were forced to keep their clinics open due to fear of criminal action, and, in the process, lost their lives treating patients.The initial petition in the Bombay high court was filed by Kiran Bhaskar Surgade, who lost her husband, a doctor who operated his private clinic in Thane, to Covid-19 on June 10 last year.She first approached the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation to file a claim under the PMGKP insurance scheme. But her request was rejected by the insurance company on September 7, 2020, on the ground that her husband’s dispensary was not recognised as a Covid-19 dispensary. Surgade appealed against the insurance company’s decision in the high court.While her petition was pending before the high court, the Maharashtra government asked the Union health and family welfare secretary if the central scheme could be extended to all private practitioners. The Centre, however, reiterated that unless the services of any private practitioner was “requisitioned” by any public hospital or autonomous institution run by the government, they will not be entitled to claim insurance benefit.The high court dismissed the widow’s petition, relying on this letter.“The letter (by Union Government) categorically states that for a private healthcare provider to be covered under the scheme, he or she must be “drafted” by the State/Centre for Covid-19-related responsibilities,” the high court said.“Considering that Surgade’s services were not requisitioned as mandated under the scheme, we are unable to extend the applicability of the scheme to persons who fall outside the ambit thereof. Resultantly, no relief can be granted to the petitioner,” the court added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-keep-out-private-doctors-out-of-rs-50-lakh-covid-insurance-scheme-asks-sc-101634742621945.html

One of them is Laskar-e-Taiba commander Gulzar Ahmad Reshi, IGP Kashmir confirmed.Police said based on specific inputs of the presence of the terrorists, a joint leam of the Police and the Army launched a cordon and search operation, which was fired upon by the terrorists ensuing the gunfight.Earlier on Wednesday, two terrorists were killed in a gunfight in Shopian and one of them was LeT commander who allegedly shot dead a carpenter on Saturday. A terrorist, identified as Adil Ahmad Wani, who was gunned down in Shopian in the earlier encounter on Wednesday, was active in the Valley since 2020.In the last two weeks, 15 terrorists have been neutralised, inspector-general (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar said.Civilians, especially non-local people who have come to J&K for work, have been the target of the recent terrorist attacks in the Valley. On Saturday, last week, a golgappa seller from Bihar Arvind Kumar was shot dead in Eidgah while a labourer from Uttar Pradesh Sagir Ahmed Ansari was killed in Pulwama. Wani, the terrorist who was killed earlier today, was involved in Ansari's death, police said. On Sunday, terrorists fired indiscriminately at the Wanpoh area of Kashmir's Kulgam area killing two labourers from Bihar Raja Reshi Dev, Joginder Reshi Dev. Another labourer from Bihar Chunchun Reshi Dev was reportedly injured.The targeted killing of the civilians began in the first week of October and since then hundreds of people have been interrogated or detained.

20-10-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: On October 21, 1977 — Parliamentary set up for Pakistan; accord at leaders’ meet||Rawalpindi A constitutional conference today reached agreement on general lines for a federal parliamentary Government for Pakistan, a spokesman said. The accord, reached after four days’ consultation among leaders of Pakistan’s political parties, called for a Prime Minister responsible to the National Assembly, a strong Central Government and autonomous provinces with adequate economic resources.The agreement, signed today by Pakistani leaders convened by President Z. A. Bhutto, also provided for an Assembly of 200 members and a Senate of 60 members, the former to be elected by popular vote and the latter by provincial Assemblies.Islam is to be the State religion guaranteed by the new constitution. The new constitution provides that the President be chosen by an electoral college made up of Senate and National Assembly members. Immediately after the agreement was signed, President Bhutto told Radio Pakistan that the constitution could now be prepared within the stipulated time, reports UNI. Mr Bhutto had earlier fixed March 23, next year, as the deadline for the promulgation of the new constitution.Observers believed that with the President becoming a titular head under the new set-up, Mr Bhutto would step down to become the Prime Minister in whom will reside effective power. Baluchistan Governor Mir Ghaus Bakhsh Bizenfo and North West Frontier Province Governor Arbab Sikandar Khan Khalil, both leaders of the National Awami Party, expressed satisfaction over the accord.Mr Bhutto congratulated all the leaders who participated in the talks and said each one of them had contributed to the agreement reached. Mr Bizenjo said in the upper house, to be known as the Senate, all the provinces would have equal representation. The provision for equal representation of all provinces, which is borrowed from the American constitution, will give Sind, Baluchistan and NWFP the same say in the Senate as Punjab, which accounts for more than 60 per cent of Pakistan’s population.Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Abdul Hafiz Peerzada said that at today’s meeting, a consensus was reached on “equitable distribution of power” between the Centre and the provinces. Mr Peerzada told newsmen in Rawalpindi that there was complete unanimity of views at the constitutional talks. He described the agreement reached as “an ideal arrangement under the circumstances which ensures the country’s unity and integrity.”Announcing the details of the formula, Mr Peerzeda said that all actions of the Government would be taken in the name of the President but the chief executive would be the Prime Minister. “The President will Act on the advice of the Prime Minister in all matters and his advice will be binding in all respects,” he added. The country shall be known as the ‘Islamic Republic of Pakistan.’ An amendment to the permanent constitution, when it had been framed and passed, will require an absolute majority of not less than two-third members of the lower house. The amendment Bill must be passed by the Senate by a simple majority. The judiciary and the Election Commission are to be independent of the executive. Fundamental rights shall be guaranteed, and safeguards will be provided against preventive detentions. The Prime Minister shall be from the lower house. It shall be the right of the Prime Minister to seek dissolution of the National Assembly even during the pendency of a motion of no-confidence against him. If the Prime Minister thinks that members of the House are not acting in accordance with the mandate of the people, he will ask for a dissolution which will be granted. Special provisions have been made to ensure stability in the country. These will apply mutatis mutandis to the legislatures of the four provinces. A vote of no-confidence shall not be moved during a budget session.A vote of no-confidence shall not be moved against the Prime Minister unless by the same resolution, the name of another member of the Assembly is proposed for Prime Ministership. The proposed constitution must now go before the constitutional commission of the National Assembly before being submitted to a final vote, probably before the end of next April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthis-day-on-october-21-1977-parliamentary-set-up-for-pakistan-accord-at-leaders-meet-101634737942052.html
20-10-2021||India||Asaram’s son Narayan Sai suffers setback in SC, judges cancel HC order on furlough||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday set aside the Gujarat high court order accepting the appeal for furlough from self-styled preacher Asaram’s son Narayan Sai, ruling in favour of the Gujarat government decision to reject the request on the ground that Sai’s release could lead to disruption of public peace and tranquillity.In its ruling, the bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna cited Narayan Sai’s track record during and after the trial that led to his conviction. “The conduct after the trial, in jail, has not been shown to be above reproach,” the bench said, concluding that the Gujarat Police was fully justified to decline his furlough request.Sai was convicted in April 2019 in a rape case on a complaint by two women who alleged to have been raped between 2002 and 2005 at a Surat ashram run by him and his father Asaram. He was convicted for rape, assault, unnatural offences and criminal conspiracy and is serving a life term.After the Gujarat Police turned down his request for release on furlough on May 8, he approached the high court, which directed the authorities on June 24 to release him on a two-week furlough. The Gujarat government quickly petitioned the Supreme Court against the high court order and was granted a stay.“The opinion of the Sanctioning Authority under the Bombay Furlough and Parole Rules 1959 does not suffer from perversity nor does it consider material extraneous to the Rules governing the grant of furlough,” the bench said, pointing that the order rejecting furlough “adduced a number of circumstances which cumulatively indicate that the release of the respondent (Sai) on furlough may lead to a violation of public peace.”Furlough is one of the two types of leave granted to convicts; parole is the other one. A prisoner is entitled to release on furlough on serving time in jail subject to the condition of demonstrated good behaviour before the prison authorities.The Supreme Court bench referred to the threat that Sai and his followers posed to the complainant in the rape case and other persons who deposed at the trial. “An attempt has been made to threaten and suborn the investigating team and the witnesses. The respondent and his father have a mass following of persons who owe loyalty to them and there is a reasonable apprehension of disruption of public peace and tranquillity,” the court said, noting that Narayan Sai also attempted to bribe public officials during the trial.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who argued the appeal for the state government, had pointed out that Narayan Sai was already granted a two-week furlough under the 1959 Rules in December 2020 since the request was made to attend to his mother’s health who had suffered a cardiac arrest. But since Sai sought furlough again within six months, the Director-General of Police turned down the request on grounds of public peace and tranquillity, and unsatisfactory conduct in jail.The state government pointed out that even the jail superintendent did not favour his release since Sai kept a mobile phone inside the jail illegally and attempted to make contacts with the outside world. He was also accused of assaulting and murdering witnesses by his followers, besides threatening police officials and inspectors of the Income Tax Department. This, Tushar Mehta said, was ground under the 1959 Rules to deny furlough. Moreover, the police weighed the crime of which he was convicted to be a heinous offence.Mehta cited the provision in the rule that made it clear that prisoners did not have a legal right to furlough. He also cited a 2006 judgment of the Supreme Court that underlined that furlough is not an absolute right and the idea was to periodically allow the convict to have a family association and avoid the ill-effects of continuous stay in jail.The bench held, “The grant of furlough must be balanced against the public interest and can be refused to certain categories of prisoners. Although furlough can be claimed without a reason, the prisoner does not have an absolute legal right to claim furlough.” These principles, the Court said, must be applied in the context of each individual case.Narayan Sai sought to rebut the charges against him, claiming that all allegations against him pertained to the period prior to 2016, after which there were no complaints. He even argued that after being granted parole in December 2020, he did not violate any conditions of furlough and nor was there any disruption of law and order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/asarams-son-narayan-sai-suffers-setback-in-sc-judges-cancel-hc-order-on-furlough-101634737401511.html

20-10-2021||India||Fabindia, other brands which offended boycott brigade||Fabindia withdrew an advertisement after facing backlash over “Jashn-e-Riwaaz”, a collection of clothes for the upcoming festive season. Bharatiya Janata Party leader Tejasvi Surya argued the collection was an “attempt of abrahamisation of Hindu festivals” and that the models in the advertisement were “depicted without traditional Hindu clothes”. Several social media users also called for boycotting Fabindia. In the last few years, several other brands including Zomato, Unilever, Manyavar and Tanishq have faced similar backlash:-- Manyavar’s ad featuring actor Alia Bhatt drew a similar backlash in September this year for hurting religious sentiments. The ad showed Bhatt, who was playing a bride, critiquing the idea of “kanyadaan” and questioning why daughters are considered “paraya dhan”. While the ad appealed to many, it also drew backlash from people who were offended and argued that Manyavar misinterpreted the Hindu tradition.-- Jewellery brand Tanishq last year faced backlash for its “Ekatvam” campaign that depicted an interfaith baby shower. It removed the advertisement for the campaign. The brand also issued an apology for hurting “public sentiments”.-- In 2019, Hindustan Unilever Limited faced a similar backlash for its Red Label advertisement which was themed on Ganesh Chaturthi. In the ad, the brand showed a man visiting a Ganesh idol sculptor ahead of the festival only to defer his purchase on realising that the sculptor is Muslim. However, the buyer eventually makes the purchase after having tea with the sculptor.Also Read: Fabindia withdraws Diwali ad after row over Urdu phraseHindu Janajagruti Samiti asked the company to remove the ad and tweeted: “We appeal Red Label Chai and HUL News to remove ads insulting religious sentiments of Hindus and apologise to Hindu Community.” --Surf Excel’s Holi ad “Rang Laaye Sang” based on Hindu-Muslim harmony drew flak for “hurting the sentiments” of Hindus and “portraying the festival in a bad light”. -- Food delivery app Zomato found itself mired in controversy when netizens questioned its decision to advertise on Republic TV. Actress Swara Bhaskar tweeted, “Hey @zomatoin @zomato@deepigoyal I’m your regular customer.. do u plan to #DefundTheHate & pull your ads from hate espousing channels like @Republic_Bharat ? I’m not okay with my money even indirectly funding this kind of communal bigoted hate!

That being said, we are looking into this.” Zomato’s reply to Bhaskar triggered calls for the app’s boycott.-- Food delivery app Swiggy faced backlash when it responded to a satirical tweet related to farmer protests. “Had an argument with my Bhakt friend over a farmers protest. He said that we are not dependent on farmers for food. We can always order food from Swiggy. He won,” the tweet from an anonymous handle said.Swiggy’s official account responded by saying: “sorry, we can’t refund education.” The comment triggered trolling and backlash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fabindia-other-brands-which-offended-boycott-brigade-101634733141278.html
20-10-2021||India||Developed nations to fund solar projects through international alliance: RK Singh||RK Singh, minister of power and new and renewable energy demanded that developed countries fund solar power projects in poor countries through the International Solar Alliance. During the ministerial plenary of ISA’s fourth general assembly on Wednesday, Singh said the developed world cannot say, sorry it’s not my business when it comes to funding clean energy projects.“It is your business. You developed using fossil fuels and occupied most of carbon space. This emergency of climate change in some ways you have created,” he said in his opening remarks. He added that for the developing world some carbon space should be free. “We have 800 million people around the world without access to energy and ISA can play a major role in ensuring that access. It is incumbent upon the entire developed world to enable the ISA to do this,” Singh said.He warned that if there is no funding from developed countries, ultimately development in emerging and poor economies will be fossil fuel based. He said that the time had come to fulfil the unmet pledges made in previous climate conferences to make 100 billion dollars available for the transition . “Not for India, but for other countries which need clean energy,” Singh said, asking for directing funding to ISA to set up solar parks, renewable energy parks in countries with low energy access to help them develop clean energy generation options.John Kerry, US Special Presidential Envoy on Climate said that the global target to reach net zero emissions by 2050 needed dramatic action in the present decade. “To keep 1.5 degrees Celsius within reach, we need to take dramatic action during this critical decade in order to reduce emissions by half worldwide. If we don’t do enough between 2020 and 2030, we can’t achieve net zero by 2050 and we certainly can’t keep in limit the rise of the earth’s temperature by 1.5 degrees.” But, he also made it clear that US alone shouldn’t be expected to invest in solar energy.Also Read | Extreme weather events in Kerala linked to climate crisis: ExpertsKerry said the US has targeted a 50-52% reduction in U.S. economy wide greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 and a roadmap published by the US department of energy recently shows how solar energy could economically generate 40% of the country’s electricity supply by 2035. “But its not enough for the United States to invest in solar energy. Nearly 90% of greenhouse gas emissions come from outside the United States and that’s why the International Solar Alliance is so critical,” he said. Kerry said solar is the cheapest source of new electricity in more than a dozen countries, spanning India, China, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Egypt, Chile and more but it still counts for just over 2% of global electricity.Frans Timmermans, European Commission Executive Vice President for the European Green Deal said EU will support investment in renewable energy as there was a huge appetite for sustainable investment support for small-scale renewables, roof top and community level projects and offshore wind projects. “I am hugely impressed by India’s commitment of having 450 GW of renewables by 2030. To make it happen, there is need for massive investment. Many European nations and EU want to be part of that development. We will need technology transfers and sharing of technology. There is a 1 million Euro support programme that will allow the deepening of cooperation between EU and ISA including by connecting and mobilising academic, financial and business communities,” he said, adding that after Netherlands and France that joined ISA in the beginning, six other EU members have joined the alliance and EU will urge the other 19 members to be part of ISA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/developed-nations-to-fund-solar-projects-through-international-alliance-rk-singh-101634732661328.html
20-10-2021||India||YS Sharmila begins 4,000km marathon march; Telangana’s KCR is her prime target||HYDERABAD: YSR Telangana party president YS Sharmila on Wednesday kick-started her marathon padayatra (march) aimed at ending, what she called, the “autocratic rule” of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) president K Chandrasekhar Rao and bringing back “Rajanna Rajyam,” the welfare state envisioned by her father YS Rajasekhar Reddy who died in 2009.Sharmila’s mother YS Vijayalakshmi flagged off the padayatra after a massive public rally at Ranga Reddy district’s Chevella town from where her husband YS Rajasekhar Reddy started his 1,500km “Praja Prasthanam” padayatra across united Andhra Pradesh in 2003 and brought the Congress party to power in 2004 assembly elections.Addressing the rally, YS Sharmila, sister of YSR Congress party president and Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, said she was going on a marathon padayatra to end the “arrogant and dictatorial rule” of KCR, as the chief minister of Telangana is known.“Today, I am taking the first step towards heralding a welfare state in Telangana and dethroning the dynastic rule of the TRS. I shall touch every village and meet every villager during my journey,” she said.Vowing to expose the alleged corruption of the TRS government, YS Sharmila described KCR as the worst chief minister of any state in the country and accused him of pushing the revenue surplus state into a debt-ridden state with indiscriminate borrowings.“Hundreds of educated unemployed youth have died by suicide due to lack of employment opportunities and many others turned into daily wage workers. Though official records say there are 1.90 lakh vacancies in the state, the TRS government has not issued a single job notification so far,” she said.Sharmila also accused the TRS government of neglecting the weaker sections. “After TRS came to power in 2014, KCR announced that he would make a Dalit as the first chief minister of Telangana. He also promised three acres of land to each Dalit family. But he did not fulfil even a single promise. On the contrary, atrocities on Dalits have gone up during the TRS regime. He also has not done anything for OBCs (other backward classes),” she said.She also criticised the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), blaming them for not taking the TRS government to task for corruption. “The Telangana Congress president A Revanth Reddy has no guts to fight against the government, as he was involved in the cash-for-vote scandal. The BJP is hand-in-glove with the TRS and has not been able to prove the cases against KCR,” she said.Vijayalakshmi said only Sharmila could make the Bangaru Telangana (golden Telangana) a reality. “My daughter has the courage and commitment to fulfil the aspirations of the people and dreams of late YSR,” she said, appealing to people to bless her daughter.Sharmila hopes to break all the records as part of her walkathon. YSRTP official spokesman Tudi Devender Reddy said as per the route map, she would undertake padayatra for nearly 4,000 kilometres across the length and breadth of Telangana state in a span of 14 months covering 90 assembly constituencies. “On average, she will walk for 12-15 km a day,” Reddy said.The previous record in the padayatras is held by her brother Jagan Mohan Reddy. He walked a distance of 3,648 km over a span of 341 days starting from November 6, 2017. The “Praja Sankalpa Yatra” ended on January 9, 2019, months before people voted in Andhra Pradesh’s April 2019 assembly elections. His party won 151 of the assembly’s 175 seats, and YS Jagan Mohan Reddy succeeded in replacing TDP’s N Chandrababu Naidu.According to Sharmila’s schedule for the foot march, she will walk a distance of 10 km from Chevella and halt at Nakkalapalli village. “Every day, she will begin the padayatra at 8.30am and take a break at 12.30pm. She will resume the walk at 3pm and conclude at 6pm,” the party spokesman said.She will hold a “Mata Muchata” (chit-chat) programme at the location selected for the night halt where she intends to interact with villagers to hear their problems.The schedule and route for her padayatra has been mapped out by a team of the Indian Political Action Committee (IPAC), the political consultancy group founded by political strategist Prashant Kishor.“She is expected to touch at least three blocks in each assembly constituency. In all, she will address nine big public meetings,” the party spokesman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ys-sharmila-begins-4-000km-marathon-march-telangana-s-kcr-is-her-prime-target-101634731401320.html

Aryan Khan has already spent 13 days in Arthur Road prison starting from October 8. On October 1, the special NDPS court heard both the NCB and Aryan Khan's lawyers and reserved the verdict for October 20. The first week of November will be a vacation for the court because of Diwali. Hence, the lawyers are attempting for an early hearing of the case by the high court. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh who is the counsel for the Narcotics Control Bureau said they have been informed of the mentioning of the plea in the high court by Khan's lawyers. Senior advocates Satish Maneshinde and Amit Desai were present before the single bench of justice Nitin Sambre to mention the plea. But, the court did not allow mentioning on Wednesday. Khan's advocates are likely to mention it on Thursday morning at 10.30am.Aryan Khan's drug-related chat with debut actress: Why didn't court grant bail?

20-10-2021||India||20 cases of betting registered during IPL: Central Crime Branch, Bengaluru||The Central Crime Branch (CCB) in Bengaluru on Wednesday said it has so far registered 20 cases of betting during the Indian Premier League (IPL), one of the biggest sporting events globally.“In the recently concluded IPL, CCB booked (a) total of 20 cricket betting cases and seized ₹78 lakhs, arrested 27 accused,” Sandeep Patil, Joint Commissioner of Police (CCB), said in a statement on Tuesday.The statement came even as online gaming companies have approached the Karnataka high court seeking a stay on the legislation banning all gambling apps in the state.Patil told HT the cases were registered over the last two to three weeks or during the IPL season. “All this (cases) happened before the ban,” Patil said. He added gambling in itself is an offence under the Karnataka Police Act.The Karnataka Police (Amendment) Bill was passed last month and banned “any act or risking money, or otherwise on the unknown result of an event including on a game of skill.”The online gaming industry, which gained significant traction during the Covid-19 pandemic-induced lockdown, was slated to grow from 360 million gamers to 510 million by 2022, according to a 2021 report by All India Gaming Federation and EY. The report estimated that online real money game players were expected to grow from 80 million in 2020 to 150 million by 2023.Also Read: After a dip in tally, Karnataka logs 349 fresh Covid cases, 14 deathsEstimates indicate that Karnataka, known for its prowess in technology, accounts for around 15% of the country’s market.According to the Internet and Mobile Association of India, 92 gaming companies registered in Bengaluru employed over 4,000 people and, in the last three years alone, attracted ₹3000 crores in investments.Patil said the amendment to the law empowers police to crack down on such service providers.To be sure, most online gaming and gambling apps have disabled their services in Karnataka after the notification of the law on October 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/20-cases-of-betting-registered-during-ipl-central-crime-branch-bengaluru-101634727981021.html

The woman went missing on October 8 after leaving her home in the Bolangir district. Her family lodged a police complaint accusing Gobind Sahu, the president of the school managing committee, of having a role in her disappearance. Sahu was detained but he managed to escape on Sunday. He was arrested on Tuesday.Police said Sahu has confessed to murdering the teacher on October 8 in his car before burning the body and burying it in the pit. “We would produce Sahu before a court today (Wednesday),” said Bolangir police superintendent Nitin Kushalkar. Four others who allegedly helped Sahu have been detained.Police did not comment on the reason behind the murder.Investigators said Sahu, who started out as a civil contractor before setting up schools, told his interrogators that he took the teacher for shopping on October 8 before allegedly killing her. “The murder seems premeditated as Sahu had the pit dug up...on October 6... for installing a cellphone tower. After killing her, Sahu likely poured petrol on the body for charring the body quickly... before burying the body in the pit. The impact of the heat was so much that the (woman’s) skull has disintegrated. Some salt was also put on the body for quick decomposition,” said a police officer, requesting anonymity.Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has called a 12-hour bandh in Bhawanipatna town demanding the sacking of minister Dibya Shankar Mishra. It alleged Sahu ran the school and a sex racket under Mishra’s patronage.Also Read: Odisha to deploy drones to keep an eye on jail inmates and their activitiesThe teacher’s family has also alleged she threatened to expose the racket.BJP leader Pradipta Naik has written to chief minister Naveen Patnaik demanding a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe as Mishra is in charge of the home department. “As the minister is at the centre of controversy over giving protection to Sahu, it will hamper the investigation if he continues his office,” he wrote.Mishra was immediately unavailable for commentsAparajita Sarangi, the BJP Member of Parliament from Bhubaneswar, said the teacher would not get justice if the probe remained with the Odisha Police. “CBI should be handed over charge for fair and impartial probe. For last 20 yrs, CM (chief minister) has been saying law will follow its course. The question is will law be permitted to follow its course,” she tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/main-accused-confesses-to-killing-woman-found-buried-on-odisha-school-campus-101634727200857.html

The Narcotics Control Bureau earlier argued that Aryan Khan should not be granted bail as he was part of a drug nexus which the agency is probing. It said that Aryan was not new to drugs, though no drug was found on him. The drugs found on Aryan Khan's friend Arbaaz Merchant were for Aryan and Arbaaz's personal consumption, the agency said.Aryan Khan's counsel, on the other hand, said his WhatsApp chats might have been misinterpreted and many of those chats might be from the time when Aryan Khan was abroad, where many things are legal.In the latest development, the agency on Wednesday submitted Aryan Khan's WhatsApp chats with a new actor of the industry. Those chats were drug-related, the agency claimed. The details of these chats or the name of the actor have not been revealed. What's next for Aryan Khan and other accused in the case?Aryan Khan and the other accused in the cruise rave party were sent to judicial custody on October 7.

20-10-2021||India||UP cops ‘dragging feet’ in Lakhimpur Kheri violence case: Supreme Court||The Supreme Court on Wednesday pulled up the Uttar Pradesh police for ‘dragging its feet’ in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case. The top court's remarks came after statements of only four witnesses were recorded in the case under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.Eight people, including four farmers and a journalist, were killed during a farmers' protest on October 3 after an SUV belonging to a Union minister's convoy ran over them."We think you (UP police) are dragging your feet. Please dispel that impression," a bench of Chief Justice of India NV Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli observed, questioning senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for the Uttar Pradesh government, why the statements of 40 other witnesses were not recorded yet.Salve informed the apex court that he had submitted a report on the incident in a sealed cover. "A concern was stated that the State was going soft on the accused, now everybody is arrested and they are in jail. As of today, 10 accused are arrested. There are two crimes which were driving into farmers and the other one in which a person was lynched," he said.The statements of other witnesses were being recorded, but the courts had shut (due to Dussehra break), Salve added.The Supreme Court has asked the Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the case to get more witnesses to record their statements. The hearing has been adjourned to October 26.The bench asserted that the SIT must identify the vulnerable witnesses, provide them protection and record their statements under Section 164 CrPC, as it will have more evidentiary value.'Until interrogated, you won't find out'Questioning the Uttar Pradesh government on why police custody of other accused was not sought, the Bench said, "Until and unless they are interrogated by police, you won't find out."Salve told the Supreme Court that the phones of the accused had been seized and the videos had been sent for forensic examination. "If the forensic reports come, there may not be a need for further questioning," he added.This is not the first time the apex court expressed dissatisfaction over the steps taken by the Uttar Pradesh government in the "brutal murder" of eight persons in Lakhimpur Kheri. On October 8, the top court had said it is "not satisfied" with the action taken in the violence and also questioned the Uttar Pradesh government regarding the delay in arresting accused Ashish Mishra.The law must take its course against all accused, the court had observed and asked the Uttar Pradesh government whether in other murder cases the police issue summons instead of arresting the accused. Not arresting the accused is sending a "wrong message", the Bench had observed.Local farmers have blamed Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Kumar Mishra 'Teni' and his son Ashish Mishra for the violence that left eight dead.Ten people, including Ashish Mishra, have been arrested so far in connection with the case. Ashish Mishra had allegedly mowed down farmers with his car.Videos are also being circulated on social media where a Mahindra Thar, belonging to the convoy, was seen knocking down protesters from behind. However, the Minister and his son denied the charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-cops-dragging-feet-in-lakhimpur-kheri-violence-case-supreme-court-101634720664947.html

The AAP has a good structure and presence in 20-25 constituencies,” Narvekar said. The AAP is positioning itself as an alternative to the Congress and the BJP in Goa. Narvekar added that when he met AAP’s national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, he was surprised to learn about his government’s “accomplishments”. “This party has a good name at the national and international level,” he said.Narvekar’s past has led to rumblings within AAP, which started out on an anti-corruption plank. He was accused of misusing his position as the Goa Cricket Association chairman in 2002 to print and sell fake tickets for an India-Australia one day international match. Thousands of spectators, some with genuine tickets, were refused entry into an already full stadium. He was booked and arrested for cheating and corruption.

He was re-elected until 2012 when he lost to Glenn Ticlo of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

The idea of setting up a makeshift cage for drunkards was first floated by the community in Motipura village of Ahmedabad district, reported news agency PTI citing village sarpanch Babu Nayak. People caught drunk were incarcerated for a night in the makeshift cage and a fine of ₹1,200 was imposed on them.The report suggests that the method was soon replicated in 24 villages that had a sizeable number from the Nat community with high liquor consumption in a dry state with a strong prohibition law. The community has claimed that the move has been effective as more members are getting dissuaded from consuming liquor and a lesser number of people are getting caught every year, according to PTI."In 2017, we first decided to impose a fine of ₹1,200 on drunkards, but the community members later realised that was not enough, so the rule of caging such people for a night was framed," PTI Nayak as saying.The members of the community caught drunk are provided with only a bottle of water for the night and a container to relieve themselves. Villagers have claimed that the experiment has also led to a reduction in the instances of domestic violence. A team responsible for keeping an eye on such people also acts on tip-offs from villagers."The fine imposed by the community is collected and spent on religious and social works. We also offer money as financial support to widows and the poor for marriage of their daughters," PTI quoted Rajesh Nayak, another member of the Nat community, as saying.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/caging-drunkards-imposing-fine-nat-community-s-experiment-in-gujarat-to-fight-the-menace-101634722524586.html
20-10-2021||India||NDPS court rejects Aryan Khan’s bail application in drugs’ case||A special Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act court on Wednesday refused bail to Aryan Khan, son of Bollywood star Shahrukh Khan. Special NDPS judge VV Patil also rejected bail applications filed by Aryan’s friend Arbaaz Merchant and model Munmun Dhamecha. The trio was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in connection with the cruise drug bust of October 2. A team of NCB officials headed by the agency’s Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede acted on a specific tip off and searched some passengers slated to take Cordellia cruise to Goa from the International Cruise Terminal at Green Gate in Mumbai. Their rooms booked on the cruise ship were also searched. The agency claimed to have seized multiple drugs such as 13 grams of Cocaine, 5 grams of Mephedrone, 21 grams of Charas, and 22 pills of MDMA (ecstasy) and ₹1.33 lakh in cash from the cruise. 14 persons were intercepted and after hours of interrogation, 23-year-old Aryan, Arbaaz, 26, and Dhamecha, 39, were placed under arrest in the afternoon of October 3. The trio moved the special NDPS court after a Metropolitan Magistrate on October 10 rejected their bail applications, holding them not maintainable before him. NCB opposed Aryan’s bail plea, contending he was in touch with a person abroad who appeared to be part of an international drug trafficking network. The agency also claimed there was sufficient material in the form of pictures, WhatsApp chats to show that the 23-year-old was part of an illicit drug chain. Also Read: Sanjay Gupta reacts to Aryan Khan’s case, calls it a ‘suspicious arrest’The agency also maintained that Aryan’s case could not be separated from others, from whom independent seizure of contraband in commercial quantity was made, as “all the accused were part of an illicit drug chain.” It was alleged that Aryan Khan was a regular consumer of the contraband since the last few years and 6 grams Charas, allegedly found on Arbaaz, was meant for the duo’s consumption. On Aryan Khan’s behalf, it was argued that by no stretch of imagination the boy can be said to be involved in illicit drug trafficking or international drug racket and that he cannot be linked to any of the seizures made by the NCB. His counsel added that even if it was accepted that Aryan was a consumer, the charge attracts maximum punishment of a year and therefore he deserves to be released on bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ndps-court-rejects-aryan-khan-s-bail-application-in-drugs-case-101634722640374.html
20-10-2021||India||Aryan Khan's bail application rejected, will remain in Arthur Road jail||Aryan Khan, son of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, will continue to remain in jail after the special Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) court on Wednesday dismissed his bail plea application in the Mumbai cruise ship drugs’ case. The 23-year-old has been lodged in Arthur Road jail since October 7 after being initially held by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on October 2.Besides Aryan, the court rejected the bail applications of other accused persons Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha.Aryan, Merchant and Dhamecha were among eight accused who have so far been held by the NCB in the drugs case that was busted after the central agency raided Cordelia – a Goa-bound cruise ship, earlier this month.The case has created enormous buzz and also saw NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede alleging that he is being followed by and spied on by two Mumbai Police personnel. His security was tightened last week after he met Maharashtra director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Pandey, seeking the same.Mumbai Police chief Hemant Nagrael took cognisance of the complaint later, and ordered an additional commissioner of police to inquire into the allegations and submit a report.Prior today, the last time the court met was on October 14 in order to hear arguments in the matter. At the time, the NCB opposed Aryan's bail application, with the agency's lawyer Anil Singh saying that the 23-year-old is a regular consumer of drugs as per his WhatsApp chats. Singh also referred to Bollywood actress Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik in the late Sushant Singh Rajput's death case, saying that not being found in possession of drugs doesn't rule out the requirement to stay behind bars. The NCB counsel said no drug was found from Showik's possession but the matter was probed regardless.Last week, Aryan along with others were shifted to the general cell of the Arthur Road jail, following the completion of their isolation period, news agency PTI had reported citing jail officials. He also received a money order of ₹4,500 from his family and spoke with his parents Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan over a video call, news agency ANI had reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/special-ndps-court-rejects-aryan-khan-2-others-bail-application-in-drugs-case-101634721762769.html
20-10-2021||India||'Inaccurate': Govt slams magazine article claiming digital divide in India||Reacting to a recent story on India's tech-based governance in a renowned magazine and the digital divide that is highlighted, the government on Wednesday claimed that the article is “inaccurate and biased", "betrays a severe lack of journalistic diligence" and “contradicts even the past reports” in that publication.Taking cognisance of an article published in The Economist on October 16, titled, ‘India’s high-tech governance risks leaving behind its poorest citizens’, which highlighted that while India's administrative infrastructure such as Aadhaar has propelled conveniences as digital payments, internet shopping and online schooling, millions are still left out of the tech-based government benefits because of India’s size and poverty and challenges in areas of electricity supply and mobile and internet connectivity.An excerpt from The Economist story read, “Given India’s immense scale and complexity, and with its deep pool of highly skilled workers, its governments have increasingly turned to high-tech solutions for all sorts of problems. Generally these have eased burdens on both rulers and the governed, despite some expected glitches. Administrative infrastructure such as Aadhaar has propelled such conveniences as digital payments, internet shopping and online schooling. Yet precisely because of India’s size and poverty, tens of millions still are left out—because they are poor, illiterate, disabled, lack electricity, do not possess a smartphone or cannot connect to a mobile or Wi-Fi network.”Calling the claim factually wrong, the government said that the total number of Aadhaar card holders above the age of 18 has reached 129.48 crore as of June 21, 2021. “As per UIDAI data in the last one year, the UIDAI has issued around 36 crore new Aadhaar cards to the adult population. In this period the highest number of Aadhaar cards was issued in January 2021 when 53.4 lakh (5.34 million) new Aadhaar card holders were added to the list of Indian population having a digital identity,” the government said in a rejoinder issued in response to The Economist article.The government also quoted excerpts from another article published in The Economist on September 5, 2020, titled, ‘Time for proof’, to claim that the recent story contradicts past reports in the publication."Creating a digital ID system is hard and expensive. Yet India, a gigantic and largely poor country, has managed it. Its "Aadhaar" biometric system has created digital identities for 1.3bn people….it has streamlined government services and massively reduced fraud. If rural Indians can prove who they are online, it is scandalous that many Brits and Americans cannot," the rejoinder quoted an excerpt from the September 2020 article in The Economist.In the recent article, the author narrated the story of one Reena Devi, a mother of two from Bihar, who reportedly didn't receive widow pension benefit after she misplaced her Aadhaar card.“With no phone, no registered postal address and no record of her birth date, Ms Devi was unable to retrieve her unique number," an excerpt from the article read, underscoring the concern that while Devi was lucky to get help, “In a few tragic cases those who have lost access to subsidised food because they cannot link their old ration cards to new Aadhaar cards, or because fingerprint readers in remote towns do not work properly, have starved to death.”The government, in the rejoinder, called out the “wrong observations” to say that in such cases, the resident can easily retrieve their Aadhaar card by visiting the nearest Aadhaar enrolment centre. “The resident may be provided with an Aadhaar number after furnishing his/her demographic details and authenticating the biometrics. In case, if demographic details like address, date of birth, phone number etc. are also not available, then, the resident can visit the nearest Aadhaar Seva Kendra or concerned UIDAI, Regional Office,” the government said in its response.It also slammed the article for commenting that India's vaccination programme against Covid-19, launched in January, faced hurdles of digital and literacy divide and largely left out poor and illiterate people initially because slots for the vaccine shots could only be booked on the Co-WIN portal - in English - until June when the Centre allowed walk-ins at and spot bookings at inoculation centres.Calling it incorrect, the government said apart from English and Hindi, 10 regional languages options are available on the Co-WIN platform, including Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Marathi, Malayalam, Odia, Punjabi, Tamil, and Telugu.The government further said that “online registration and prior booking of appointment is not mandatory to avail vaccination services.” It also highlighted that apart from online registration and appointments, Co-WIN offers several modes for registration and vaccination of beneficiaries, including assisted registration through Common Service Centers, assisted registration through 1075 helpline, on-site or walk-in registration and vaccination for people belonging to facilitated cohorts such as people who don’t have access to the internet or smartphones.“The vaccinators who operate the vaccination session do the on-site registrations. The beneficiary is not required to use the Co-WIN digital interface in such cases,” the government said in the rejoinder.Highlighting India's pace of vaccination against Covid-19, the government said that the country has administered the highest number of Covid-19 vaccine doses in the world. “As of October 19 morning, India has administered more than 99 crore doses of Covid vaccine and is likely to touch the 100 crore or one billion doses shortly,” the rejoinder read.“As per the data available on Our World in Data, the US follows India with over 40 crore (400 million) Covid vaccination, and Brazil has administered 25.6 crore (256 million) Covid vaccine doses,” it further read.The government said in the average pace of daily Covid-19 vaccination, India again leads the table with over 4-6 million daily doses (rolling 7-days average). “Countries like the US, France, the UK, Brazil and Russia are all under 1-2 million daily doses (rolling 7-days average),” the rejoinder claimed.The Economist article attributed to surveys by Lokniti-CSDS, a polling group, to show that four-fifths of Indian families use public food supply schemes, of which 28% say they have been denied rations at some point owing to problems with Aadhaar. “The biometric ID has helped curb theft and corruption, but less so than non-tech reforms to the food system,” an excerpt from the story read.The article misses some important facts about food security and the role of technology in ensuring the rightful targeting of beneficiaries in India under the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), the rejoinder claimed in response.“As part of the technology-driven TPDS reforms, significant progress has been made at the national level during the past 6-7 years. These reforms inter-alia include digitisation of all ration cards data (100% achieved in all states/Union territories), Aadhaar seeding (>90% at the national level), installation of electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) devices at the FPSs for transparent distribution (~93% at the national level), portability of ration cards under One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) plan (enabled in 34 states/Union territories), etc,” the government wrote in the rejoinder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/inaccurate-govt-slams-magazine-article-claiming-digital-divide-in-india-101634713173218.html

It will actually divide the votes of Congress's rivals in the state, Harish Rawat said, "Our votes will depend on the performance of the Channi government. The way Channi has started, it has created a good impression before Punjab and the entire nation."Talking on Amarinder Singh, Rawat said, "Who can stop him if he can't stay with his old commitment to secularism? He was considered a symbol of 'Sarvdharm Sambhav' and was connected to Congress' traditions for long. If he wants to go, he should.""Who can forgive BJP that has kept farmers at the borders for 10 months? Can Punjab forgive them for the manner in which farmers' agitation has been dealt with? His statement is really shocking. It seems he has killed the 'secular Amarinder' within him," Rawat said.Capt Amarinder hand in glove with BJP, backstabbed Congress: Randhawa, PargatFollowing an acrimonious episode with the Congress after his resignation from the post of the chief minister, Amarinder Singh on Tuesday announced that he will soon float his own political party. He also said if the farmers' issue is revolved, then he is hopeful of a seat arrangement with the BJP."The battle for Punjab's future is on. Will soon announce the launch of my own political party to serve the interests of Punjab and its people, including our farmers who've been fighting for their survival for over a year," Singh said Tuesday.Amarinder Singh had earlier announced he would quit the Congress. His meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah which the Captain said was to discuss the farmers' protest also raised speculation whether the Captain was planning to join the BJP. At that time Amarinder Singh clarified that he would not join the BJP.The farmers' issue for which the Captain has been raising his voice stands in the way of Captain supporting the BJP or Captain's proposed new party coming to a seat-sharing agreement with the BJP.Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhjinder S Randhawa said, "Captain Amarinder Singh has destroyed himself by announcing a seat arrangement with BJP, whom he has always abused. BJP should hold an enquiry on Amarinder Singh over his whereabouts after the resignation in 1984 and his relation with Pakistan.""There must be some pressure on him. Many cases have been filed against him and his children. We have no fear of Amarinder's decision," the deputy CM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-he-wants-to-eat-crow-harish-rawat-reacts-to-amarinder-singh-s-new-party-announcement-101634719440765.html

We’re the first party to give 40% seats to women in LS (Lok Sabha) elections! Amid such dire times, @INCIndia (Congress) is understandably trying to emulate and one can only hope that this is genuine and not tokenism.

20-10-2021||India||Assam: 2 arrested in Cachar for defacing hoardings written in Assamese||Two members of All Bengali Youth and Students Organisation (ABYSO) of Assam have been arrested in Cachar district for defacing hoardings advertising the Central government’s Jal Jeevan Mission, written in the Assamese language .Those arrested have been identified as Samar Das (38) and Raju Deb (37), both are residents of Silchar town. However, secretary of ABYSO, Rathindra Das said the duo was not involved in the act of smearing the hoardings. “They just extended support to the protest. Police on Tuesday initially called them to get some details but later arrested them. We are moving for bail today,” Das said.He added that his organisation “does not support acts of disrespect to any language” and it “strongly condemned” such behaviour.Members of the youth wing of newly formed political party, Barak Democratic Front, have been citing the amended Assam official language act to demand that all official communication including Central government hoardings are written in Bengali language instead of Assamese in the Barak valley.The Front’s founder Pradip Dutta Roy was also summoned by Cachar police chief on Tuesday afternoon and interrogated for two hours in connection with the smearing incident. Roy later released a statement saying the front didn’t plan to smear the hoardings and it was done without his consent. He, however, lodged an FIR against the director of Jal Jeevan Mission and deputy commissioner of Cachar district for alleged violation of the language act of the state.Roy, also a former lawyer of the Gauhati high court,alleged that the police were harassing innocent people and abusing the law. “These two persons are innocent, they just participated in a protest and were not involved in the act of defacing the hoardings. Also, the charge under IPC 425--an act with intention of destruction or damage to any public property-- is bailable and the police could have released them from the police station itself,” he said.The Assam Official Language Act, 1960, which mandated Assamese as the official language of the state, was amended in 1961 after mass protests by Bengali speaking people, especially in the Barak Valley, led to the death of 11 people at Silchar station on May 19, 1961. The amendment provided for the use of Bengali as the administrative language in Bengali-majority Barak Valley comprising Cachar, Karimganj and Hailakandi districts.The members of BDF argue that the protest against the hoardings was to reinforce the Assam Official Language (Amendment) Act of 1961, which was overlooked by local administration time and again.“Silchar station is the place where 11 people laid their lives while defending their mother tongue. Installation of Assamese posters at the railway station was an intentional move to hurt sentiments of the Bengalis,” said Kalparnav Gupta from BDF youth wing. Also Read | Assam: Students of primary section attend school after nearly 2 yearsThe senior members of Barak Democratic Forum clarified that their protest was not against Assamese or any other language, and they were only protesting against the “forceful imposition” of a particular language among the Bengali speaking people.However, social media platforms were flooded with posts condemning BDF. Silchar MP Rajdeep Roy called the defacing incident a “conspiracy”. “Ironical that the language issue has cropped up only days after Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sharma spent DurgaPuja with the ‘Bengalis’ of Barak Valley. Is this plain coincidence or is there a malicious intent behind it ? Smells fishy!,” Roy wrote on twitter.Silchar MLA Dipayan Chakraborty alleged that BDF members were “anti-nationals”. “First or all, I want to know who these people are? When the entire Barak valley came on streets to protest against the violence on Hindus in Bangladesh, these people kept mum. Now, they are trying to divert the protest by provoking an unnecessary debate. I strongly condemn this,” Chakraborty said.President of Assam Jatiya Parishad, Lurin Jyoti Gogoi sought action against the guilty and said that people from diverse backgrounds lived peacefully in Assam.President of Assam Pradesh Congress committee, Bhupen Kumar Borah said 27 linguistic communities including Bengalis lived together in Assam and the Assamese language was used widely as a common language.Several regional organisations including the All Assam Students Union (AASU), Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad (AJYCP), Bir Lachit Sena criticised the defacing and called for the arrest of the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-2-arrested-in-cachar-for-defacing-hoardings-written-in-assamese-101634717179886.html

20-10-2021||India||‘First flight’s landing akin to paying obeisance to revered land’, PM in Kushinagar||Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated Kushinagar International Airport in Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday, which will improve connectivity to Buddhist pilgrimage sites in India. Referring to the maiden flight from Sri Lanka that arrived at the airport on Wednesday with over 100 Buddhist monks and dignitaries on board, Modi said the flight’s landing was akin to paying obeisance to the revered land. Kushinagar is a sacred Buddhist site, where Lord Buddha is believed to have delivered his last sermon and attained salvation or Mahaparinirvana.“It (airport) is a result of hopes and aspirations of decades... Kapilavastu and Sarnath are nearby as is Bodh Gaya where he [Lord Buddha] gained enlightenment… these are places of reverence for people from Laos, Korea, Sri Lanka, Japan, Indonesia among others,” Modi said He added that as a parliamentary representative from the region, he also feels a sense of accomplishment on the completion of the project. Modi represents Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh.Also Read: Namal Rajapaksa says ‘great honour’ to be on first flight to land at Kushinagar Modi underlined the fillip that the airport will give to economic activity and tourism in the region. He added that farmers, entrepreneurs and a host of other people will benefit from the connectivity offered by the new airport. “It will create an ecosystem of economy, tourism and create avenues of employment.” “Whether it is aastha or ananda (faith or pleasure), modern infrastructure is a prerequisite,” he said, stressing the need to develop roads, airways and waterways along with hotels, and the internet for boosting tourism.He said the Union government is working to augment air connectivity and that of the 900 plus new routes that have been approved in the last seven years, services have already begun on 350.He referred to the accessibility of air services. Modi added amid improved services, many people are now flying. “ In UP (Uttar Pradesh), nine new airports have become operational. There will be newer airports In Ayodhya, Azamgarh, Moradabad, Shrawasti, Aligarh … soon.”Till 2017, the state had only four operational airports--one each at Lucknow, Varanasi, Gorakhpur and Agra. After 2017, five airports have become operational--Prayagraj, Kanpur, Hindon, Bareilly, and Kushinagar International airport. With this, the state now has nine airports operational. Meanwhile, Samajwadi Party president and former chief minister, Akhilesh Yadav accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of taking credit for projects launched by them. “When they (BJP) didn’t even lay a brick for the foundation…and yet they come to inaugurate a project launched during the Samajwadi Party time with their scissors, ribbons, garland and sweets... BJP leaders must remember that merely becoming a pilot doesn’t mean you own the plane. They should also remember that the groundwork of the highway project on which you are taking off, has been prepared by someone else,” Yadav tweeted soon after the prime minister unveiled the project. The Samajwadi Party said on Tuesday that the project was sanctioned in 2016 when Yadav was the state’s chief minister. At the event, PM Modi also referred to the Air India sale as a big step that will give new energy to the aviation sector. Modi’s comments come weeks after Tata group emerged as the winning bidder for Air India paving the way for the disinvestment of the loss-making carrier.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said the new airport is a flight of development for the people of eastern Uttar Pradesh. He added that from 1947 to 2014, the state had only two functional airports, Lucknow and Varanasi. “Connectivity was with only for 15 or 16 places. Now we have nine functional airports and will be connected to 75 places. Construction of an International Airport is on at war-footing in Ayodhya and the second one in Gautam Buddha Nagar.”The Jewar airport in Gautam Buddha Nagar (Greater Noida) will be NCR’s second airport. Union aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said direct flights four times a week between Delhi and Kushinagar will begin from November 26. He added the airport will then be connected with Mumbai and Kolkata too. “The airport will connect eight main Buddhist religious centres. What was not possible for years is being realised today,” Scindia added. Commenting on how the project was accelerated, Scindia said that , across India, from 34, the number of airports has increased to 181 in the past seven years. Congress spokesperson Zeeshan Haidar slammed both the BJP and the SP. “I agree with the Samajwadi Party about the BJP wrongly claiming credit for projects. However, the SP too must remember in whose period the clearance for the big-ticket projects that SP chief Akhilesh Yadav so often refers to had come about... As for the BJP, I will say that inviting Modi for inaugurations won’t help the chief minister because people now know that all such big-ticket activity happens only around elections,” Haidar said.

A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna allowed the appeal of the Gujarat government challenging the June 24 order of the high court granting furlough to Sai.The top court said that furlough is not an absolute right and it depends on various factors. It said the jail superintendent has given a negative opinion for a grant of furlough to Sai as a mobile phone was found from his cell.On August 12, the top court had stayed the Gujarat high court order giving two-week furlough to Sai.The top court had issued a notice to Sai on the Gujarat government's plea challenging the high court's single-judge order of June 24 and stayed it till further orders.It had said that the proviso to Rule 3(2) of the Bombay Furlough and Parole Rules 1959, provides that a prisoner sentenced to life imprisonment may be released on furlough “every year” after he completes seven years actual imprisonment.The single-judge bench of the high court ordered the release of Sai on furlough for two weeks on June 24, 2021, but the division bench had stayed it till August 13, and thereafter the state has moved the top court challenging the June 24 order.The state government has contended that under the rules and even in a judgement of this court, it has been held that furlough is not an absolute right and it depends on various factors.It had said Sai and his father were arrested for offences under rape charges and they wield considerable influence with money and muscle power.On April 26, 2019, Sai was convicted under the Indian Penal Code sections 376 (rape), 377 (unnatural offences), 323 (assault), 506-2 (criminal intimidation), and 120-B (conspiracy) by a Surat court and sentenced to life imprisonment.In 2013, Asaram was arrested for allegedly raping a girl in Rajasthan after two Surat-based sisters had accused Asaram and his son of sexual exploitation.The elder sister had accused Asaram of sexually assaulting her between 1997 and 2006 when she lived at his Ahmedabad ashram.The younger sister had accused the godman's son of sexual assault when she lived at Asaram's ashram in the Jahangirpura area of Surat between 2002 and 2005.The incidents of multiple sexual assaults and unnatural sex with the victim had taken place between 2002 and 2005, but the case against Sai had been filed only in 2013.Sai was arrested from the Delhi-Haryana border in December 2013.When Sai was in jail, the Surat police had claimed to have unearthed elaborate plans to bribe police officers, doctors, and even judicial officers to weaken the case against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-sets-aside-2-week-furlough-granted-to-asaram-s-son-narayan-sai-101634710512721.html

20-10-2021||India||PM Modi addresses CVC-CBI joint meet, hails digital tools in checking corruption||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday virtually addressed a joint conference of the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in Gujarat, in which he hailed a New India which is increasingly using digital tools to push back against age-old corrupt practices. Declaring that India of the 21st-century “innovates, initiates, and implements”, Prime Minister Modi said that people here are seeking a transparent system, efficient processes, and smooth governance. This, he said, will be made possible through the implementation of new-age digital tools.“In the last 6-7 years, the government has succeeded in instilling the confidence that it is possible to contain corruption,” the Prime Minister said at the CVC conference. “Today there is the political will to attack corruption and continuous improvement is also being carried out at the administrative level.”“New India is no longer ready to accept that corruption is part of the system,” said Prime Minister Modi. He added that his government trusts citizens instead of doubting their intentions; barriers were removed and long redundancies in the system were ended with the use of technology. “This approach of trust and technology has strengthened efficient governance and ease of doing business,” said Prime Minister Modi.Speaking of the ways in which digital technology has aided in streamlining the bureaucratic processes by eliminating corruption, the Prime Minister pointed out that long queues to avail of government services have now been significantly reduced. Citizens can now directly claim the benefits from government portals instead of resorting to corrupt middlemen who took a cut of the revenue.“Thousands of compliance certificates and NOCs were needed till now, which led to corruption; all this has been eliminated,” the Prime Minister said. “The processes have been made faceless. Due to the increased digital footprints, it has become easier for investigating agencies to conduct probes.”Prime Minister Modi also reminded citizens that although it is the government that has made laws, its implementation is the responsibility of every citizen. He also called upon the officers of CBI and CVC to rededicate themselves to abolish corruption from all walks of national life. Pointing out that “corruption takes away the rights of people and hinders the pursuit of justice for all”, Modi urged the officials to work towards the nation’s progress and increase the collective power of the nation.Recalling his Independence Day call for simplification of laws and procedures, the Prime Minister called upon CVC and CBI, and other anti-corruption institutions to remove such processes that come in the way of new India. “You need to strengthen New India’s policy of zero tolerance for corruption. You need to implement laws in a way that poor come close to the system and the corrupt moves out of it”, the Prime Minister concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-addresses-cvc-cbi-joint-meet-hails-digital-tools-in-checking-corruption-101634704003930.html

20-10-2021||India||Bangladesh attacks trigger protests with civil society members criticising govt||Attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh since the Durga puja festival have triggered protests with prominent civil society members criticising the Sheikh Hasina government for failing to protect the religious minority. Hundreds of Dhaka University students on Monday held a protest at Shahbag Square in the heart of the Bangladesh capital and demanded protection for Hindu citizens. Most of these students were Muslims, said media reports. They were joined by monks of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, whose temples were vandalised in the attacks.The Shahbag Square emerged as a symbol of resistance against fundamentalist forces in Bangladesh in 2013 when thousands took part in an agitation, demanding capital punishment for 1971 war criminal Abdul Quader Mollah and a ban on electoral activities by his organisation, the Jamaat-e-Islami.Mashrafe Bin Mortaza, a former Bangladesh cricket captain and member of the parliament of the ruling Awami League, expressed his anguish over the violence on Twitter. “I witnessed two defeats yesterday. One was that of the Bangladesh cricket team, which pained me, while the other was the defeat of the entire nation that crushed my heart. This is not the red and green (the national bicolour) we wanted. All the dreams and our hard-earned struggle died in seconds. May Allah offer us wisdom,” Mortaza tweeted on Monday.The communal violence coincided with Scotland’s victory over Bangladesh by six runs in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup. Mortaza wrote in Bengali, the official language of Bangladesh.Hours later, noted Indian lyricist and poet Javed Akhtar tweeted: “What is happening in Bangladesh is a matter of great shame. Those who are trying to crush a vulnerable minority are bullies, cowards and sick communalists. How can Sheikh Hasina who is known for secular values let this happen under her watch?”Bangladeshi filmmaker Mostofa Sarwar Farooki wrote on Tuesday: “I do not believe there can be anything that police cannot achieve. Nobody can commit a crime and disappear in thin air. Bangladesh is waiting to know who committed these crimes and waiting to watch them face trial.”Over a dozen organisations in West Bengal have held protests against the violence since Monday. Over three dozen, actors, writers, poets and painters have taken part in the demonstrations.Also Read | Bangladesh violence: VHP to hold nationwide protests todayThe West Bengal Imams Association said those involved in the violence were insulting Islam and the Quran. “Those who carried out random attacks across Bangladesh, saying the Quran was insulted at one of the Durga pujas, not only showed disrespect for Islam and the Quran but insulted both. Nobody has to study rocket science to understand that the alleged act of insult to the Quran was a well-planned conspiracy to create communal tension,” said Muhammad Yahiya, the chairman of the association representing Muslim clerics.National award-winning director Srijit Mukherji, who is married to Bangladeshi actress Rashid Mithila, condemned the violence. “Strongly, strongly condemn. A barbaric act,” Mukherji tweeted.Ahead of the by-polls to four assembly seats in Bengal on October 30, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which won two of these seats in the March-April elections, held protests in Kolkata and all 23 districts on Monday and Tuesday. The BJP demanded the implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Bengal. It has claimed that the attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh are part of a “systematic ethnic cleaning” that started decades ago.The CAA offers citizenship to non-Muslims who entered India from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh before 2015 to escape religious persecution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/communal-violence-in-bangladesh-triggers-protests-101634703738420.html
20-10-2021||India||Centre asks schools to take responsibility of self prescribed books||The Union government has asked schools to take responsibility for the textbooks they prescribe to students -- other than those approved by the national or state councils (NCERT or SCERTs) -- and told them to put up a list of books on their website or notice boards, declaring that their content has been “thoroughly checked”.The directions are part of the education ministry’s guidelines on “school safety and security” published earlier this month. The schools must follow a “whole school safety approach” covering all aspects of the school community and can impact holistic development, the guidelines said, listing including pedagogy, syllabi, textbooks, and assessments as part of the factors that affect the students’ growth.To this end, the guidelines said that schools, both private and public, should take extra caution while prescribing books other than those that are recommended by the NCERT, SCERTs, or the concerned education boards. “It is the responsibility of principals/school heads and teachers to carefully analyse syllabi and textbooks selected by the school (in case school is not following textbooks prescribed by NCERT/SCERTs). It should not promote any kind of discrimination based on caste, class, religion, gender, ethnicity, or language,” the guidelines added.“It should promote sensitivity towards environmental protection, gender parity, inclusion, and ethical behaviour, etc. Promote healthy habits of eating, cleanliness, and sanitation, reading, working together, helping each other, and collaboration in place of competition, etc.,” they said.The schools have been asked to put up a list of prescribed books on its website and notice board, along with a declaration “to the effect that the school owns the responsibility of having thoroughly checked and having gone through the content of the books”.There have been instances in the past where objectionable content was found in school textbooks, and NCERT or CBSE denied prescribing that book. For instance, in 2012, a Class 6 textbook being taught in some CBSE-affiliated schools in Delhi that said “meat-eaters cheat, lie and commit sex crimes” created an uproar. CBSE later came out with a statement saying that it did not prescribe the textbook.In 2018, CBSE included a clause in its by-laws warning schools of serious consequences, including loss of affiliation, in case they select books with objectionable content.A senior NCERT official, who asked not to be named, said: “It’s important that schools should make a list of such books public and own the responsibility. It is not possible for NCERT or SCERTs to go through the content of the books they do not prescribe,”The guidelines were sent to all states and Union territories on October 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-asks-schools-to-take-responsibility-of-self-prescribed-books-101634703011415.html

20-10-2021||India||WATCH: In Punjab's Ferozepur, a biomass plant generates electricity with paddy stubble||Amid increasing concerns over air pollution stemming from the stubble burning practice in northwest India, a biomass power plant in Punjab's Ferozepur has managed to generate electricity using paddy stubble. According to officials at the plant, the biomass power facility uses 600 tons of paddy stubble per day, which equates to around 2 -2.5 lakh tons of stubble per year. The initiative is being deemed favourable for farmers as well, since they get to sell their paddy to such biomass facilities, thus generating income.Satish Bedi, the general manager (commercial) at the Sukhbir Agro Energy Limited, told the ANI news agency, “The power plant's capacity is 18 MW per hr, it is stubble based and uses 600 tons of stubble in a day and around 2-2.25 lakh tons of stubble in a year.”Bedi added that this initiative is favourable for farmers as they are paid for selling stubble.“This is favourable for farmers,” the official was quoted as saying by the agency. “We take all the stubble from farmland and the land becomes empty for farming again. Farmers are also paid for selling the stubble. It is cherry on top for them.”It was reported by the Hindustan Times earlier this month that the Centre has been pushing the Punjab government to focus on ex-situ management of the crop stubble, in view of the fact that the paddy harvest season is on. Tying the stubble in bundles and supplying it as fuel in biomass-based power generation plants, industrial boilers, and coal-based-super critical power generating units is the most common form of ex-situ management, with experts claiming that the overall management cost is lowered this way.The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has also asked the state’s three thermal power plants to use paddy stubble as fuel to the extent of 10 per cent of total annual coal use. Two of these plants are with the state government.Satish Bedi, the official at the Sukhbir Agro Energy Limited, said that if more power plants are set up in the state, more electricity would be generated and the stubble burning problem could be eliminated.“If 24-26 plants like this are set up in Punjab, we would generate a lot of electricity for the state,” he said. “This will resolve the environmental problem and also eliminate the stubble burning problem. Moreover, this plant provides direct employment to 1500 people, which will help in employment generation as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/watch-in-punjab-s-ferozepur-a-biomass-plant-generates-electricity-with-stubble-101634699844646.html

20-10-2021||India||Monsoon is over. But why is it raining so much in October? Here's the answer||From north to south, many states in India are witnessing heavy rainfall in the month of October, even after the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the southwest monsoon has completely withdrawn from most of north India.In Delhi, October has emerged as the wettest month since 1960. In Uttarakhand, nearly 50 people have died due to landslides triggered by heavy rainfall, which also blocked key highways. In Kerala, the authorities had to open gates of a number of dams due to water levels breaching danger marks.So what is the reason behind this sudden downpour? According to IMD, an unusual western disturbance - a rain system that originates in the Mediterranean region - swept across the northern plans and slammed into the Himalayan ranges, triggering extremely heavy rain spells often regarded as cloudbursts."A western disturbance interacted with the easterlies to cause conditions for extremely heavy rain over Uttarakhand. There was a low-pressure area over Bihar which was bringing in a lot of moisture and the western disturbance helped cloud development and rain," said DS Pai, Scientist and head of climate research and services.And then there was the impact of climate change. “Climate change has increased moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere all around the world. So of course, climate change has a role to play but also local synoptic features need to be considered,” Pai added when asked about reports of cloudburst in Ramgarh block, about 35km from Nainital town.He also said that in the post-monsoon period, such intense rainfall events occur in Maharashtra also.The IMD has forecast more rainfall for Odisha and West Bengal, which have already been pounded by low pressure area-induced heavy showers over the past three days, throwing life out of gear in places.According to the Met department, the states will have to brace for downpour over the next two days, despite the low-pressure system having moved to Bihar.Water levels in Subarnarekha, Budhabalang and Jalaka rivers in northern Odisha are on the rise, according to the weather department. The MeT office has issued a yellow warning for Sundargarh, Keonjhar, Mayurbhanj and Balasore. In West Bengal, it has warned of extremely heavy rainfall over Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Alipurduar till Wednesday and downpour till Thursday over all sub-Himalayan districts.
20-10-2021||India||Andhra Pradesh bandh today, call given by TDP after attacks on its offices||The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) has called for a bandh (shutdown) in Andhra Pradesh today over attacks on its offices, for which it blamed the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy regime. TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu called the attacks "state sponsored terrorism".He demanded a through inquiry on the attacks at TDP state headquarters at Mangalagiri in Guntur and its offices in several other districts, and imposition of President's Rule in the state by invoking Article 356 of the Constitution.Naidu alleged that Director General of Police Gautam Sawang had colluded with the chief minister and perpetrated attacks on the TDP cadres in a pre-planned manner.The TDP chief wrote a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah stating how the law and order collapsed totally in the state under the present regime. In response, Naidu said that Shah assured to look into the matter and asked for making a formal police complaint about the attacks.Naidu also spoke to Governor Biswa Bhushan Harichandan on phone and complained to him about the attacks by the YSRCP cadres on the TDP offices and leaders.The attacks took place after TDP spokesman Kommareddy Pattabhi held a press conference and criticised the state government for not taking any action against rampant ganja cultivation in the tribal areas of Visakhapatnam.Pattabhi found fault with the police for serving notices on a former TDP minister Nakka Ananda Babu, who alleged that certain YSRC leaders were involved in the smuggling of narcotics. In the process of criticising the Jagan government, the TDP spokesman used some foul words against the chief minister.Pattabhi’s foul-mouthing of Jagan evoked strong protests from YSRCP leaders and cadres, who went on a rampage and attacked the TDP offices in several parts of the state. They also burnt the effigies of TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu and raised slogans against Pattabhi and Naidu."My house has been totally ransacked today. They have done it because I questioned the state government about the dealings of drugs in Andhra Pradesh. Wherever you go in the country, drugs are being supplied from Andhra Pradesh. So, I and the party senior leaders questioned him," Pattabhi told news agency ANI after the attacks.YSRCP legislator from Guntur T J R Sudhakar Babu said the TDP leaders had crossed all limits of decency in using foul language against the chief minister. “We don’t mind if the TDP leaders criticize people’s issues and policy issues of the government. But we won’t tolerate if they use abusive language against our leader,” he said.Meanwhile, DGP Gautam Sawang appealed to the people to maintain restraint. He also said that action will be taken against the perpetrators of violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-pradesh-bandh-today-call-given-by-tdp-after-attacks-on-its-offices-101634694333210.html
20-10-2021||India||Telangana: YS Sharmila to begin record-breaking 4000-km foot march today||YS Sharmila, the younger sister of Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, is set to undertake a padayatra (foot march) on Wednesday to “understand people's problems and find solutions” in context with her allegation that 7,000 farmers had committed suicide in the past seven years in Telangana during the rule of chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR). Sharmila, the founder of the YSR Telangana Party, had made her allegations in an official press statement released last month and laid out details about the foot march that she said will begin from October 20. In the padayatra to be launched today, Sharmila, according to reports, aims to cover 4,000km in 400 days.Also Read | YSRTP chief Sharmila announces padayatra from October 20The foot march in Telangana is expected to cover 90 constituencies across the state, barring the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) area, according to details laid out in the YSR Telangana Party press release. “The purpose of the padayatra is not only to hear and know the problems of people but also to find solutions to those problems,” party founder Sharmila was quoted as saying in the press release.Elaborating on the allegations raised over farmers' deaths, YS Sharmila said that attacks on Dalits in Telangana have increased by 800 per cent during KCR's rule, while liquor sales grew by 300 per cent and so did attacks on women. She said that a padayatra – a strategy undertaken by former chief minister late YS Rajasekhara Reddy – is an ideal way to hear out the people and find solutions to the problems regarding any issue.“Following in his (former chief minister late YS Rajasekhara Reddy) footsteps, we are also going to undertake padayatra for almost a year from October 20,” she said in the press release. “It is 'Praja Prasthana Yatra'”.Meanwhile, YS Sharmila also hit out at the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), alleging that they have sold themselves out to the KCR-led Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS). She added that her party, the YSR Telangana Party, would also enlighten the people about this issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-ys-sharmila-to-begin-record-breaking-4000-km-foot-march-today-101634691995487.html
20-10-2021||India||Lakhimpur Kheri: Supreme Court to hear today PIL seeking fair probe||The Supreme Court will on Wednesday hear a public interest litigation (PIL) regarding the violent incident in Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri earlier this month, which led to the deaths of eight people - including four farmers and a journalist. The court took up the case suo motu and in the last hearing, pulled up the Uttar Pradesh police for unsatisfactory progress in the probe, in which the son of a Union minister is among those chief accused in the incident.Also Read | Lakhimpur Kheri: The violence, the aftermath and the politicsAshish Mishra, the son of Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Mishra, was arrested by the cops six days after he was accused in the incident in Lakhimpur Kheri's Tikunia village, following a series of interrogation summons, drawing sharp criticism from the opposition who alleged that police action was delayed in view of the political status of the accused. The Supreme Court had also expressed its dissatisfaction over the investigation conducted by the state government in the case and asked the UP government to direct its state police chief to ensure that the evidence in the case is protected till the time another agency takes over.The Lakhimpur Kheri incident is currently being probed by a special investigation team (SIT) set up by the Yogi Adityanath government, which on Tuesday released pictures of six people standing near an SUV that was set ablaze during the October 3 incident. The team has assured that details of those giving information will not be revealed besides informers will be given due rewards.Also Read | What happened in Lakhimpur Kheri: Sequence of events according to both sides“The SIT team probing the October 3 violence has got some photos and videos,” an SIT official was quoted as saying by the PTI news agency. “We are releasing photographs and appeal to people to identify them. Six photographs have been released for identification.”So far, 10 people, including Ashish Mishra, have been arrested in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri violence. Farmers allege that Mishra was present in one of the vehicles which ran over the group of people during the incident. The Union minister's son, however, denies the charge and instead claims that he was present in Banbirpur village at the time to attend a wrestling event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-kheri-supreme-court-to-hear-today-pil-seeking-fair-probe-101634688903547.html
20-10-2021||India||Aryan Khan drugs case: Mumbai court expected to pass order on bail plea today||The special Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) court will on Wednesday hear the bail plea of Aryan Khan. The 23-year-old is in Arthur Road jail; he was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) during a raid on a cruise ship on October 2.Khan was initially sent to the custody of NCB for questioning, but a Mumbai court later denied NCB's plea for further extension of custody and sent Khan to 14-day judicial remand on October 7. His multiple bail petitions have so far been rejected.Besides Khan, the bail application of other accused Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha will also be heard on Wednesday.The court had posted the matter for October 20 after hearing arguments on October 13 and 14. Additional Session Judge VV Patil had said that he would pronounce his order on October 20.Khan, the son of actor Shah Rukh Khan, was among eight people arrested after an NCB raid on Cordelia, a holiday cruise ship anchored in Mumbai that was set to leave for Goa later that evening.Following the raid in which 13 grams of cocaine, 5 grams of mephedrone, 21 grams of charas, and 22 pills of MDMA (ecstasy) and a sum of ₹1.33 lakh in cash was recovered, 20 people were arrested under various sections of the NDPS Act.In the last hearing, the NCB told the court that there was evidence to show that Khan was a regular consumer of drugs for the past few years. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Anil Singh said the accused (others along with Khan) were going to the cruise and "planned to have a blast".While the agency said nothing was recovered from Khan personally, his WhatsApp chats reveal links with drug peddlers, some of them part of an international drug trafficking network. The NCB was in touch with the external affairs ministry to identify people in the network, the ASG said.Khan's lawyer Amit Desai said the agency can't rely on WhatsApp chats to arrest his client. He argued that these chats needed to be seen in context of the language of the youth, which may seem to be a "torture" for the older generation. Desai also rejected all the allegations of Khan's link with drug peddlers or illicit drug trafficking.Khan's arrest has led to political slugfest in Maharashtra, with the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance slamming the central agency and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) hitting back alleging the NCB probe into the larger drug nexus is being hindered which will be bad for the country.Meanwhile, Khan has been given his qaidi number which is N956. He is being kept in the general cell. He was recently allowed to speak to his parents Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan via video call from inside Mumbai's Arthur Road Jail for 10 minutes and also received a money order of ₹4,500 from them.Khan was counselled along with the seven others at the NCB office on Sunday where he told the officers that from now on, he would work for the society and devote himself to the country and the poor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aryan-khan-drugs-case-mumbai-court-expected-to-pass-order-on-bail-plea-today-101634689142024.html

According to widely held belief, this is the day when Lord Buddha came back to earth from heaven.He is believed to have gone to the heaven to teach Abhidhamma Pitaka (a basket of ultimate things) to his mother. The teaching took three months after which Buddha came back to Earth. His followers too mark the three-month time by staying at one place and praying.Celebrations in KushinagarAccording to a Culture Ministry release, the highlight of the event is the exposition of Holy Buddha Relic being brought from Waskaduwa Sri Subuddhi Rajvihara Temple in Sri Lanka by the Mahanayaka of the temple.These relics are accepted as real relics (bone fragments, ashes, pieces of Jewels) of the Buddha.These relics were found in Piprahwa, Sidharthnagar district of Uttar Pradesh, about 160 km from Kushinagar, in 1898.

20-10-2021||India||After pressure from Opposition, Goa govt backtracks on contentious Trees Bill||The Goa government on Tuesday backtracked and referred the contentious Goa Preservation of Trees Amendment Bill to a Select Committee after pressure from the Opposition, which alleged that the government was downgrading the authorities to ‘advisory’ bodies via the amendment. The Bill, which was introduced in the Goa Legislative Assembly on Monday with the intention of revamping the Goa Tree Authorities, however, also included clauses that the opposition claimed would vastly reduce the powers of the statutory bodies and reduce them to only an advisory function with reduced power. “Via this amendment, the tree authorities will be reduced to an advisory function. They will be rendered toothless and only be reduced to giving advice to the government departments regarding the preservation of trees,” independent legislator Rohan Khaunte said. “The proposed Authority shall act as a principal advisory [body] to the government for protection, preservation and conservation of trees covered under the Act,” the government said.However, perusal of the sections of the Bill revealed that the powers of the authority were set to be curtailed from having the authority ensure preservation of all trees within its jurisdiction to now only having the power “to advise the Government and all concerned for preservation of all trees within its jurisdiction”. The mandate to carry out a tree census was also set to be removed and instead be replaced with a mandate to “maintain a record of tree cover… and take measures, whenever and wherever required, to further increase the tree cover.”After hearing arguments from the opposition benches, the Goa Chief Minister, perhaps because it is the final session of the Goa Legislative Assembly agreed to relent and directed that the Bill be referred to a select committee, where it is likely to lapse. Another Bill, introduced by the Goa government on Monday, The Goa (Verification of Tenants) Bill, 2021 that, among other provisions, proposed to introduce a prison term up to six months for landlords who fail to verify the antecedents of their prospective tenants was also referred to a Select Committee. The two day session that concluded on Tuesday is the last session scheduled of the assembly before the state goes to polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-pressure-from-opposition-goa-govt-backtracks-on-contentious-trees-bill-101634675814386.html
20-10-2021||India||Blaming state’s lockdown policy, Kerala hotel owner dies by suicide||A hotel owner in central Kerala allegedly died by suicide on Tuesday, after writing a detailed post on social media in which he squarely blamed the government’s lockdown norms. His body was found on the railway tracks and he reportedly posted the message hours before his suicide, police said.In a social media post, he said his hotel business was doing relatively well but the pandemic- induced lockdown broke him totally. In the note he said he took many loans from banks and private financiers and in the present scenario it was quite impossible to repay these liabilities. He blamed the government for his death.“You can have hundreds of people in the mall and many in liquor outlets. Buses and marriage halls run with maximum capacity. If more than ten people sit in the hotel the owner will be hauled up. The government’s lockdown policy is quite unscientific and arbitrary,” he said in the note. In the touching note he also said his youngest son was afflicted with autism “and he has every right to live like any other child of his age”. In the note he also asked philanthropists and others to extend a helping hand to his wife and two children.At the end of his note he also made a strange request. “Police officers who recover my phone kindly entrust it to my daughter because she has online classes.” He was perhaps referring to a recent incident in which a police officer was suspended for keeping the phone of a suicide victim whose body was found on the railway tracks. During investigation it was found that the police officer was using the smart phone after changing its SIM card.(Suicide is not a solution.

As per the initial estimate, each drone set up will cost around ₹4 lakh,” he said.The prison directorate would also procure 20 body cameras for Jharpada Special Jail in Bhubaneswar and Choudwar Circle Jail in Cuttack district. The jail personnel coming in direct contact with inmates will be equipped with the body cams.“Cameras will be used by the staff to record any wrongdoing by inmates in areas not covered by CCTV cameras, during searches when inmates return from courts and hospitals and while shifting notorious criminals to hospitals,” said Upadhyay.The two jails will have prisoner calling system under which biometric details of all prisoners including two telephone numbers will be collected. The inmates will be asked to provide two telephone numbers of their family or acquaintances with whom they would like to speak. After verification, the numbers will be fed into the calling system.A prisoner will be allowed to talk for a maximum of five minutes and pay ₹5 per call. The facility will have auto-disconnection system. The new calling system which will be gradually expanded to other jails will help curb misuse of existing phone systems where inmates have often been found allegedly making illegal contacts.In May this year, the chief warden of Jharpara special jail in Bhubaneswar was suspended after mobile phones, SIM cards, mobile chargers, mobile batteries, a pen drive and cannabis were recovered from the prison. A video of dancing and ganja smoking in the same jail had earlier gone viral on social media bringing embarrassment to the prisons department. In April this year, police in Koraput district had seized cash, a mobile phone, dumb-bells, iron rods and a pen drive from some under-trial prisoners following a raid at Jeypore sub-jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-to-deploy-drones-to-keep-an-eye-on-jail-inmates-and-their-activities-101634672573854.html
20-10-2021||India||Corporate bigwig knew those who accompanied killers, indicates probe into Kolkata killings||Investigation into the murders of Subir Chaki, managing director of Kilburn Engineering Ltd, and his driver Rabin Mondal in Kolkata on Sunday evening has shown that both of them knew the people who took the killer to the scene of the crime, police officers involved in the probe said on Tuesday. The probe suggested that the murders were committed by more than one person and they might have been hired for the job. The officers suspect that Chaki was killed first. Some employees of Kilburn Engineering Ltd were questioned by the police on Tuesday at the Mumbai-headquartered company’s office in central Kolkata. The bodies, which bore multiple stab injuries, were found inside Chaki’s ancestral house at Kankulia Road in the Gariahat police station area of south Kolkata on Monday morning. Chaki’s body was found on the first floor while the driver’s body was lying on the second floor. Chaki, 61, who lived at New Town on the eastern outskirts of the city with his wife, mother and mother-in-law and also owned property at a posh south Kolkata condominium, was trying to sell the old three-storey building for the last six years, residents of Kankulia Road told the police. In the past, Chaki sent Mondal, 64, with the keys when prospective buyers came to see the property. The police suspect that Chaki could have been close to sealing a deal and hence came to the house on Sunday. This has raised the possibility of a cash transaction. Officers from the homicide section of the detective department of the Kolkata Police, who are carrying out the investigation, took a sniffer dog to the scene of the crime on Tuesday. “The dog picked up a smell and led the officers to the Ballygunge railway station located less than a kilometre away. The dog went to a platform after climbing the over-bridge. It is possible that someone who came to the house either on Sunday or earlier walked down to the station to board a train,” an officer said on condition of anonymity. Trains passing through the Ballygunge junction station carry passengers to remote parts of South 24 Parganas district as well as the Sealdah station in central Kolkata from where trains leave for most parts of the country. “The investigators on Tuesday recreated the crime scene using a three-dimension imaging device. Statements of local residents were recorded since they claimed to have heard several voices, including that of a woman, coming from the house on Sunday. Security camera footages are also being examined,” the officer added. “We are not ruling out professional rivalry as the motive although preliminary information points towards the sale of the property which should cost around ₹2 crore because of the prime location,” said a second police officer. The Kolkata Police did not officially share any information with the media. Chaki’s car was found on the road outside the building. A number of food packets and some legal documents were found inside the vehicle. Members of Chaki’s family told the police that he called them on Sunday evening and talked about some repair work required at the house. His phone was switched off around 7 pm. Mondal’s phone was switched off as well. Since both devices were stolen, police are examining call lists collected from the service providers. Nobody lived in the upper floors of the house. There was nothing valuable there that might have led to a robbery, officers said. The ground floor was rented out to a private company. Its office was closed on Sunday. When the employees reported for duty on Monday morning, they found the door connecting the ground and first floors shut from inside, which was unusual. Chaki, who studied at Kolkata’s St Xavier’s School, IIT Kharagur and IIM, Kolkata, worked for well-known companies all his life. His son and daughter live in London and Bengaluru respectively. Chaki earlier worked as president (manufacturing) for Eveready Industries India Limited and as director for McNally Sayaji Engineering Limited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/corporate-bigwig-knew-those-who-accompanied-killers-indicates-probe-into-kolkata-killings-101634671493982.html

We have intensified the measures in type and number wherever we thought necessary,” one of the officials said on condition of anonymity.Multiple checkpoints and roadblocks have been erected across Srinagar. “The security is very stringent and the searches have been intensified. Police and CRPF (Central Reserve Police Force) parties have been patrolling in larger numbers… vehicles are also being searched,” Bilal Ahmad, a Srinagar resident, said.Besides, the number of bulletproof mobile bunker vehicles deployed at sensitive places has also been increased and the high-tech CCTV surveillance enhanced. Women paramilitary forces have been deployed in Srinagar’s Lal Chowk to assist with the searches.“There has been an uneasy silence ever since the attacks took place. Fewer people prefer to move out fearing the deterioration of the situation,” another resident said, preferring not to be named.Hundreds of people have been detained and questioned as part of the probe into the civilian killings so far.The counter insurgency operations by forces have also been intensified. Last week, police claimed to have killed 13 terrorists in the region.Union home minister Amit Shah, who chaired a meeting with state police and chiefs of Central Armed Police Forces on Monday to discuss various security issues, is likely to visit Kashmir in the last week of October to review the situation and also inaugurate developmental projects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/security-beefed-up-searches-intensified-across-kashmir-101634669424020.html

While Sahu has been apprehended, the opposition in the state alleged that the key suspect is a close aide of minister of state for home Dibya Shankar Mishra who is trying to protect him. They demanded his sacking and a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the matter.Police discovered the body at the school premises in the village during the probe into sex racket charges, the officials cited above said on condition of anonymity. The deceased’s family have identified the body by the items found at the spot, the officials said.“As the body is partially-burnt, it would be sent for DNA testing,” Bolangir deputy superintendent of police Bata Krushna Mishra said.Officials said that the teacher left her home to meet Sahu on October 8. After finding her phone switched off, her family on October 9 called Sahu who reportedly asked them not to worry about her whereabouts, the officials added. The woman’s father alleged that Sahu was running a sex racket in the school and his daughter was killed as she had threatened to “expose his deeds”.Sahu was apprehended from his house in Bolangir district. Three constables were suspended on charge of dereliction of duty.BJP leader Namitarani Sahu alleged that “the teacher was raped by Sahu” during Mishra’s reported frequent school visits. Reacting to the demand for his resignation, Mishra told PTI that “anyone found guilty will be punished”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-woman-s-burnt-body-found-could-be-of-missing-teacher-police-101634669068641.html

Haven’t we seen what was taught in RSS Shakha? How to behave in the Vidhana Soudha....watching blue film while the assembly session is on. Isn’t such a thing taught to them (BJP) at RSS Shakha? Do I have to go there (to RSS shakha) to learn this?” Kumaraswamy asked.Speaking to reporters here on the sidelines of the bypoll campaign, he said, “I don’t want their Shakha. Whatever I have learnt from the Shakha here, the Shakha of the poor is enough. I have nothing to learn from theirs (RSS Shakha).” Kumaraswamy was referring to an incident in 2012, when the then three ministers were caught on camera allegedly watching porn clipping on mobile phones in the state assembly during its proceedings, causing an embarrassment to the then BJP government.The three ministers had resigned following the incident.Recently, referring to a book, Kumaraswamy had said that the RSS, as part of its ‘’hidden agenda’’, has created a team of bureaucrats in this country, who are now placed at various institutions.He had also said the BJP governments at both the Centre and in Karnataka were functioning on the directions of the RSS, and PM Narendra Modi was its “puppet”.Following this, Kateel had invited him to come to RSS Shakha and learn about the Sangh’s activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/have-nothing-to-learn-from-rss-shakha-says-kumaraswamy-101634669095087.html
20-10-2021||India||Won’t tolerate moral policing, says Karnataka home minister||Karnataka’s home minister Araga Jnanendra on Tuesday said that instances of moral policing and other communal violence in the state will not be tolerated even as the number of such crimes appear to be on the rise in the southern state.“Such incidents will not be tolerated,” Jnanendra said, adding that such matters will be investigated without any consideration for the perpetrators’ religious identity.“When the police take stricter action, a message will go to such people,” he added.The statements come after at least dozen instances of moral policing and communal hatred surfaced in the border district of Belagavi, about 500 kms from Bengaluru.In one incident, a boy was assaulted by a group of Muslim men for talking to a girl from their community in a bus stop. The accused were seen assaulting the boy and pulling the veil off the girl and demanding to know her name and address.In another incident, which happened on October 8, a group of villagers teared down board of a chicken shop for keeping it open despite a Hindu festival being celebrated in the nearby temple.A third incident, that happened on October 14, was of an auto driver who took an inter-faith couple to a remote location, called his associates and assaulted the boy for being with a Muslim girl. In this incident, the assaulters even robbed the couple of their valuables.The police in the district have said that they will register a complaint if the victims come and register a complaint.A person aware of the developments said that the police have tried to strike a compromise between the assaulters and the victims, leading to delays in filing of cases that was further emboldening other groups to resort to such crimes.The incidents of moral policing comes barely a month after the brutal killing of 24-year-old Arbaaz Aftab in Belagavi district on September 28. Arbaaz was found on the railway track as his head and leg were severed and laid on the track between Khanapur and Desur line. According to the police, the parents of the girl who was supposedly in a relationship with Arbaaz had given a contract to a local Hindu fringe group, Sri Rama Sene Hindustan, to murder the boy.The police have arrested 10 people in the case based on the complaint by the mother of Arbaaz, who first suspected the role of the girl’s parents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wont-tolerate-moral-policing-says-karnataka-home-minister-101634669035368.html
20-10-2021||India||Girl detained for poising 4 of family to death over ‘discrimination’ in Chitradurga||A minor girl has been detained in Chitradurga’s Gollarahatti area, about 200 kms from Bengaluru, for allegedly poisoning and killing four family members as she felt rejected by her parents and others, police said on Tuesday. She was detained on Sunday.This was the girl’s second attempt to poison her family, which turned out be a success. In her first attempt, the mother had suspected another lady for the murder bid, a senior police official from the district said. The girl is now in an observation home and will soon be sent to the Juvenile Justice Board, police further said.The incident took place on July 12 when four persons from the family died after consuming poison mixed in their dinner while one person had survived. “First we had registered a case of 174 or suspicious death (on July 13),” Radhika G, the superintendent of police (SP) of Chitradurga district said on Tuesday. The SP said that all five members ate the Ragi Mudhe or ragi ball, a staple diet in rural parts of southern Karnataka and two hours later, they fell sick, started vomiting and cried in pain, while the girl stood silently and watched their suffering. The girl’s family members who died are her father, mother, grandmother, and sister, while her brother, who also fell sick due to poisoning, survived. During the course of the investigation, very few persons suspected the girl, who is just under 18, of having something to do with the crime. “Since she was a minor girl, we did not interrogate thoroughly. But once we got the FSL report, we got direction on how to take the case forward,” the SP said. Initially, the police had suspected an angle of jealousy among the neighbours and other villagers as the family was doing fairly well financially. Police said that since the needle of suspicion was always on others, she could get away with anything and felt “emboldened”. The girl went back to her grandmother’s house where she enjoyed staying. The police then sent women constables almost everyday to meet the girl and gain her confidence. A woman constable who spoke the Lambani language earned the girl’s trust and after 4 to 5 days, she revealed her role in the incident. The SP said that the girl had blamed at least three other persons of having forced her to commit the crime but after investigation it was found that the girl was trying to mislead the probe. Once she said that a lady named Gauri Bai had threatened to poison the family and in two other instances she blamed two boys for having pressurised her in committing the crime. But in all three cases, the stories did not match, pointing the needle of suspicion back on the girl. She later revealed that she was just a few months old when her parents sent her to live with her grandmother, where she was very happy. But about 3-4 years ago, her parents brought the girl back and things started changing. Her family, including the father’s mother, used to scold her for not doing well in school, going to work or for her obsession with watching TV. The SP said that TV serials had a deep impact on her. She also nursed a feeling of neglect as her parents showered love on her brother and younger sister while she was beaten and chided for every small mistake. She had picked up a bottle of discarded pesticide when she went to work in the fields as she could read the words “poison” written on the bottle. She then plotted to poison her family even though she was not fully aware that she was committing murder, the police said. . The SP said that the girl is now in an observation home and will soon be sent to the Juvenile Justice Board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/girl-detained-for-poising-4-of-family-to-death-over-discrimination-in-chitradurga-101634668914762.html
20-10-2021||India||Bengaluru records 125% rise in October rainfall, infra crumbles||The city received 233 mm of rainfall till October 18 as against the normal of 104 mm, registering an increase of 125%, as per Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) data. .Continuous rains over the last couple of weeks have once again exposed the chinks in Bengaluru’s poor quality of infrastructure and planning or the lack of it.On Monday, Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai himself acknowledged the lack of town planning and unscientific methods used for creating new residential layouts or providing basic amenities in existing ones.The rains have left a trail of destruction, misery and suffering of people living in low lying regions of the city and other places where drains and lakes have overflowed into the homes and basements in several localities.The increase in the eight zones of Bengaluru ranges between 62% to 222% recorded in the west side of the city, data from the Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) said.At least 21 persons have died so far in Karnataka since the beginning of October, according to KSDMA data.Thousands of homes have been damaged and hundreds of animals and livestock have died during the same period as rains continue in the state.At least 14 districts have received large excess rains or higher than 60% departure, 6 districts have received excess rains, according to data. Five districts have received near normal rains while six more have recorded a deficit.Chikkaballapura, about 60.kms from Bengaluru, has recorded the highest departure at 150% as the district received 235 mm of rains since October 1 as against the normal of 94mm.The rains have damaged crops in over 471,000 hectares of agriculture and horticulture crops, according to data.During the same period, all major divisions of Karnataka received over 46% more rains than usual with 89% of all taluks recording higher than normal rain this year.“This is what happens when a town is built without town planning,” Bommai said after visiting HSR Layout, an upscale locality in the southern part of Bengaluru, thereby acknowledging one of the biggest challenges in India’s IT capital and how the civic authorities continue to dodge blame.Bommai said that earlier there were many lakes that took in the water but now the layouts or residential localities are interfering with the natural flow of water, causing an impact that has led to water logging, flooding and damages to property.The quality of infrastructure in Bengaluru is among the poorest in the country and at least 18 people died in the city, which prides itself of being the technology capital of India, due to civic apathy last year, according to data by the National Crime Records Bureau.At least 400 out of the fortune 500 companies globally have a presence in Karnataka but the quality of infrastructure, toxic and encroached lakes, pot-hole laden roads, traffic snarls, unplanned expansion and other problems have contributed to the rapidly deteriorating quality of life in the city.The corruption in civic agencies have also led to approval of several buildings without proper plans or engineering, making them prone to collapsing. There have been at least six buildings that have collapsed in the city over the last couple of weeks.According to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), there were 185 dilapidated buildings in the city according to its survey carried out in 2019. However, only 10 among these were demolished and people continue to reside in several other buildings even today. A recent rapid survey revealed that the total number of dilapidated buildings is in excess of 400.Gaurav Gupta, the chief commissioner of the BBMP had earlier told Hindustan Times the rains had caused some shifting of soil and weakened foundations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-records-125-rise-in-october-rainfall-infra-crumbles-101634668853976.html

Yet, the police remained mute spectators when the YSRCP mobs were vandalising our party office with sticks, rods and stones. Similar attacks were carried out on all the TDP offices across the state in collusion with the police,” he said on Tuesday.The TDP chief also called up Union home minister Amit Shah and complained to him about the alleged attacks by the YSRCP mobs on the TDP state headquarters at Mangalagiri in Guntur district and party offices in several other districts. He told him that several TDP workers were injured in the attack, and scores of vehicles were damaged by the frenzied mobs.Naidu requested Shah to see that adequate security and protection be provided to the TDP offices and party leaders by the Central police force. “The Union minister assured to look into the matter and asked for a formal police complaint about the attacks,” an official statement from the TDP office said.The TDP chief also spoke to Governor Biswa Bhushan Harichandan on phone and complained to him about the attacks by the YSRCP cadres on the TDP offices and leaders.It all began with a press conference by TDP official spokesman Kommareddy Pattabhi in the morning, where he criticised the state government for not taking any action against rampant ganja cultivation in the tribal areas of Visakhapatnam.Pattabhi found fault with the police for serving notices on a former TDP minister Nakka Ananda Babu, who alleged that certain YSRC leaders were involved in the smuggling of narcotics. In the process of criticising the Jagan government, the TDP spokesman used some foul words against the chief minister.Pattabhi’s foul-mouthing of Jagan evoked strong protests from YSRCP leaders and cadres, who went on a rampage and attacked the TDP offices in several parts of the state. They also burnt the effigies of TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu and raised slogans against Pattabhi and Naidu.At Mangalagiri, the YSRC cadres attacked the TDP headquarters and ransacked the office and damaged vehicles. They also attacked Pattabhi’s house and damaged the furniture.YSRCP legislator from Guntur T J R Sudhakar Babu said the TDP leaders had crossed all limits of decency in using foul language against the chief minister. “We don’t mind if the TDP leaders criticize people’s issues and policy issues of the government. But we won’t tolerate if they use abusive language against our leader,” he said.Meanwhile, DGP Gautam Sawang made a statement not to get agitated by the provocative language being used by the political parties. “We shall take appropriate action against those who instigate people with their comments. At the same time, we will not hesitate to take stern action against those who take the law into their hands,” he said.Appealing to the people to maintain restraint, the DGP said action would be taken against the perpetrators of violence. “Additional police forces have been deployed all over the state to prevent any retaliatory attacks,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naidu-accuses-ysr-congress-of-vandalising-tdp-offices-demands-prez-rule-in-andhra-101634668619986.html
20-10-2021||India||‘Destructive activities are carried out in name of development’: Madhav Gadgil||Mindless construction in the Western Ghats and the Himalayas is worsening climate disasters, ecologist Madhav Gadgil said in an interview on Tuesday. The Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel, which was constituted by the central government and chaired by Gadgil, had recommended in 2011 that 75% of the 129,037 sq. km of the Western Ghats – spanning Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa and Kerala – be declared an environmentally sensitive area because of its dense, rich forests and large number of endemic flora and fauna. The panel’s recommendations were not implemented. Gadgil said the climate crisis and unsustainable land use will trigger bigger disasters on India’s west coast. Excerpts from interview:The scale of devastation we are seeing due to extremely heavy rainfall in October is unprecedented in Kerala and Uttarakhand. Why is this happening?It is not unprecedented. In the Western Ghats, such disasters have been happening frequently in the past few years. In the Himalayas, we have seen instances of such flooding over the past 50 years. The Chipko agitation in Uttarakhand in 1972 was partly triggered by flooding in the Alaknanda because of cutting of trees and hill slopes. These activities have only increased over the years. The Himalayas are even more fragile compared to the Western Ghats because they were created out of sediments from the sea during the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates. The Himalayan soil is susceptible to landslides and erosion. The Western Ghats, on the other hand, were created out of volcanic rocks. In both these regions, we are seeing extremely destructive activities in the name of so-called development. Road projects cutting through hillsides are common to both regions. In 2019, I traveled to Puthumala in Kerala after the landslides and saw several small landslide sites leading up to the big one. These were all along a road construction project. Rock quarries are proliferating along these construction sites to provide construction material. This is leading to a gradual crumbling and weakening of the hills.The findings of the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel were quite revealing. You foresaw these disasters in Kerala and Konkan, and even pointed out the most vulnerable districts correctly. Why do you think your recommendations were not implemented?I know what kind of vested interests are prevailing. They are nurtured. They are the construction lobby who work so that the rich can make more and more money. People in the Konkan have now started talking a great deal about improper construction of bridges, high embankments and highways in vulnerable areas. In Chiplun, which was badly affected by floods this monsoon, the construction lobby has encroached on the estuary. They found free land, encroached on it and made a lot of money. These vested interests are dominating everywhere in the Western Ghats, and are functioning illegally.Is it only these construction projects or has climate change also exacerbated disasters in the Western Ghats?Climate change is having a perceptible impact on the entire west coast. Sea level is increasing, and the pattern of cyclone formation has changed. Cyclonic activity had reduced over Bay of Bengal and increased over Arabian Sea, including a spike in severe cyclones. All along the west coast, the coastal regulation zone has been crumpled under the feet. Mangroves are being destroyed and several ports are being built to support the demand for construction. These will be devastated by cyclones in the future. In another five to 10 years, cyclones will impact the entire region. Gujarat and Maharashtra have already seen the impact with Cyclone Tauktae and Cyclone Nisarga but Karnataka, Goa and Kerala will also be devastated.The environment ministry is planning to amend the Forest Conservation Act of 1980 to bring significant changes to forest governance in India, including facilitating private plantations for harvesting. How will this impact biodiversity?Such amendments are in flagrant violation of the Forest Rights Act of 2006. Local communities at least nurture and protect forests because they get non-timber forest produce from it. The forest rights law is not being implemented. Instead, private plantations are being considered, which will replace natural vegetation, leading to devastation of biodiversity. Wildlife will also be forced out, which will have a huge cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhav-gadgil-interview-destructive-activities-are-carried-out-in-name-of-development-101634668617841.html

His body was found on the railway tracks, the police said.In social media post, the man wrote that his hotel business was doing relatively good, but Covid-19 pandemic-induced lockdown pushed him on the verge of being broke. In the note, he said that he took multiple loans from banks and private financiers and was finding it “impossible to repay these liabilities”.“You can have hundreds of people in the mall and many in liquor outlets. Buses and marriage halls run with maximum capacity. If more than ten people sit in the hotel, the owner will be hauled up. The government’s lockdown policy is quite unscientific and arbitrary,” he said in the note.He also wrote that his youngest son has autism “and he has every right to live like any other children of his age.” He asked philanthropists and others to extend a helping hand to his wife and two children.(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)

20-10-2021||India||Kerala received 135% extra rainfall in Oct: IMD||As Kerala braces for another spell of downpour from October 20, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) data shows that the southern state has received 135 per cent excess rain during the period from October 1 to 19.During the heavy spell on October 16 when the IMD issued a Red alert indicating extremely heavy rainfall, numerous incidents of landslips and other rain-related accidents were reported from south-central districts of Kerala, resulting in at least 24 deaths.The season’s rainfall data on IMD website shows that the normal rainfall for the period of October 1 to 19 was 192.7 mm whereas the actual rainfall was 453.5mm.There is a “large excess departure” of 135 per cent, the website says.“During October-December, through the north-east Monsoon, the state receives an average rainfall of 491.6 mm, which is 16.8 percent of the annual rainfall. This year, the state has received 453.5 mm rain during Oct 1-19, instead of the usual 192.7 mm. This means that the state has already received over 90 per cent of this season’s rainfall,” a senior IMD official told PTI.Except for Thrissur and Alappuzha , all other districts have received over 100 per cent of the usual rainfall. While Kozhikode saw the highest increase (223 per cent excess), Alappuzha saw the least increase (66 per cent) in rainfall.The official said the heavy downpour which the state witnessed recently marks withdrawal of the southwest monsoon which normally ends by September 30.Kerala has received excess rain due to the low pressure zones that developed near Lakshadweep coast in the South-Eastern region of the Arabian Sea and in the South-Eastern parts of the Bay of Bengal.After a relative respite of two days, the IMD today issued an orange alert for 11 districts of Kerala indicating heavy rainfall on Wednesday.The IMD sounded the alert for Thiruvananthapuram, Pathanamthitta, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Idukki, Thrissur, Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Wayanad and Kannur districts on October 20.The weatherman has put 12 districts on orange alert on Thursday also.It has been issued for all districts other than Kannur and Kasaragod on October 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-received-135-extra-rainfall-in-oct-imd-101634668556973.html
20-10-2021||India||Gates of three dams opened as Kerala battles heavy rainfall||Shutters of Cheruthoni dam, part of the Idukki reservoir in Kerala, were opened on Tuesday to create more storage capacity in anticipation of the heavy rainfall predicted in its catchment area over the next two days.Shutters of Idamalayar dam in Ernakulam and Pampa in Pathanamthitta were also opened in the morning as water in these reservoirs had almost reached the danger levels.Three sirens were sounded prior to the opening of each of the shutters of Cheruthoni dam, which was last opened three years ago, Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) said in its Facebook page.The first shutter was raised at 11.00 AM, the next one at 12.00 PM and the third one at 12.30 PM, it said.The shutters were raised, by 35 centimetres, in the presence of state Minister for Electricity K Krishnankutty and Kerala Water Resources Minister Roshy Augustine who thereafter, visited the Idukki arch dam and the Cheruthoni town to assess the situation.Speaking to the reporters after the shutters were opened, Augustine said, “The situation is calm presently. Water released from the dams is flowing normally. Inflow to the dam is reduced presently. Due to the rule curve, things were carried out accurately and timely. The decision (to open the dam’s shutters) was taken to ensure people do not face any problems.”Krishnankutty, who also spoke to the reporters, said opening of the shutters was carried out on the basis of scientific data and the rule curve.“Politicians did not decide it. Experts did,” he added.Earlier in the day, shutters of Idamalayar and Pampa reservoirs were opened in the wake of an increase in their water level and more rains predicted in the coming days in Kerala.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued orange alerts for 11 districts, barring Kollam, Alappuzha and Kasaragod, on Wednesday and 12 districts, except Kannur and Kasaragod, on Thursday.Orange alert means an area is expected to receive heavy to very heavy rainfall which could range between 64.5 mm to 204.4 mm.According to IMD data, the southern state has already received 135 per cent excess rain during the period from October 1 to 19.The state government on Monday had opened the shutters of Kakki and Sholayar dams to release surplus water.The Ernakulam district administration on Tuesday morning confirmed the opening of shutters 2 and 3 of Idamalayar dam by 50 centimetres each.Opening of shutters 3 and 4 of the Pampa dam by 45 centimetres each was confirmed by the Pathanamthitta district administration on Tuesday.Despite opening of the shutters of the three dams, the water level in the concerned rivers -- especially Periyar and Pampa -- will not rise to the levels as seen in 2018, government officials said and added that people need not panic fearing a repeat of what happened back then.Later in the day, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan issued a statement asking people living in hill regions, low lying areas and along the banks of the rivers, whose dams have been opened, to exercise caution and move to relief camps set up across the state.State Health Minister Veena George visited the Aranmula-Pampa Satrakkadavu to assess the water level in Pampa river and thereafter, told reporters that as the water is receding into the low lying areas in Pathanamthitta district and in view of the IMD warning of heavy rains, people from Upper Kuttanad region -- where people were seen on news channels wading through waist-deep water -- were being shifted to relief camps.State Revenue Minister K Rajan, while speaking to media this morning, said if people refuse to move out of risk prone areas, the government would be forced to “arrest” and shift them to the camps.“Our aim is to save lives,” he said.The CM, in his statement issued later in the day, also said that as the monsoon recedes, extreme levels of rainfall over a short period was expected and due to the same, there would be an increase in the risk of landslides and overflowing of rivers.He said the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) has issued a stern directive to the people in hill areas and river banks to remain vigilant till the current situation normalises.Meanwhile, the district administrations in Pathanamthitta and Ernakulam have put on hold all quarrying activities till October 24.In Ernakulam’s Aluva-Kalady area, fishermen and their boats were brought in via trucks in preparation for rescue and evacuation of people who might get stranded if the water level of Periyar, which flows through the district, rises like it had in 2018 when heavy rainfall and opening of the dams had flooded homes there.The Ernakulam district administration also said that water from the Idukki reservoir will reach the Aluva-Kalady basin at midnight and people should remain alert.In Alappuzha, where several places have been flooded, the state has set up 100 relief camps which are presently housing around 7,126 people from about 2,000 families.The state government had on Monday announced that Idukki dam, built across the Periyar river, Idamalayar in Ernakulam and Pampa dam, in Pathanamthitta, were going to be opened on Tuesday.Even though rains subsided in several parts of Kerala on Monday, after receiving heavy downpour last week, the decision to open shutters of these dams was taken as water levels there had reached close to the danger marks and more rains were expected from Wednesday.In view of the prevailing situation and expected worsening of weather conditions, the government has cancelled pilgrimage to the Lord Ayyappa shrine in Sabarimala for the Thula masam poojas.According to the State Disaster Management Authority, the number of rain-related deaths in Kerala from October 12 to October 18 stood at 38.During the same period, at least 90 houses have been destroyed in the rains while 702 have been partially damaged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gates-of-three-dams-opened-as-kerala-battles-heavy-rainfall-101634668553775.html
20-10-2021||India||Accused in Kerala pregnant jumbo death surrenders||One of the accused in the death of a pregnant elephant in Kerala’s Malappuram last year — which caused nationwide outrage — surrendered before a local court in Palakkad on October 16, a senior police officer confirmed on Tuesday. Thirty-eight-year-old M Riyasuddin was subsequently remanded in judicial custody for a week, the officer added. “He discreetly approached the court which remanded him in judicial custody. We will move the court for police custody,” the senior officer who did not wish to be named said. Riyasuddin is the second accused in the case. His father, Abdul Kareem, 64, is the prime accused in the case and is still at large, police said. A case was registered against the duo in June last year after they fed a 15-year-old pregnant elephant a pineapple stuffed with crackers. The elephant died after the crackers blew in her mouth. She stood in Velliyar river for days but succumbed to injuries. A post-mortem examination later revealed that the elephant died due to asphyxia as a result of water entering its lungs.Both the police and forest departments had filed separate complaints in connection with the case. The father and son run a small agricultural farm along Palakkad-Malappuram border. Three farm workers were also arrested in this regard. On Tuesday, the forest department moved an application in Mannarkkad court to get the custody of the accused. “After getting the custody of the accused, the department will inquire whether he was involved in other similar cases,” Mannarkkad divisional forest officer M K Surjith said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/accused-in-kerala-pregnant-jumbo-death-surrenders-101634668494046.html
20-10-2021||India||Don’t review evaluation policy for Class 12, CBSE urges Supreme Court||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has urged the Supreme Court not to review its evaluation policy for Class XII Board exams, as it opposed a clutch of petitions filed by students who are aggrieved by their scores on account of the poor past performance of their schools.Submitting its affidavit on Monday, CBSE said the option of taking the improvement exams was available to the students and couldn’t claim violation of their rights when the marking was done as per the evaluation policy, which was also approved by the top court in June.The Board’s affidavit has been filed in response to petitions filed by over two dozen students from Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Jammu and Kashmir and Rajasthan.The petitions, filed through advocate Ravi Prakash, have demanded that a school’s poor past performance should not be counted while awarding final scores under the evaluation policy notified on June 17 and approved by the apex court on June 22. “Accepting the request of the petitioners would not only mean deviating from the evaluation policy which has been accepted well across the country but, would also result in revising the results of all the students which is already settled and based on which almost all universities have almost completed their admission process,” the CBSE affidavit read. The Board stated that between August 25 and September 15, it conducted Class XII examinations for students who were not satisfied with the assessment done based on the policy. “As the petitioners fall under such category of students, they had the option available with them to appear in the improvement examinations. Therefore, they are not entitled to claim reliefs, as prayed for, in the writ petition,” the affidavit added. As per the policy, the marks scored in the later examination were to be considered final.The CBSE’s affidavit, filed by advocate Rupesh Kumar, will be taken up by a bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar on Wednesday.Class XII exams were cancelled this year due to Covid-19 and the evaluation policy was formulated that assessed students based on their performance in classes X, XI and XII on a ratio of 30:30:40, respectively. The total marks awarded had to be in consonance with the past performance of the school in Class XII Board examinations. Further, the policy also talked about moderating the final marks based on the historical performance of the school by taking the best overall performance in the previous three years’ Board examination.The petitioners produced a chart to the court, comparing their scores calculated on basis of the 30:30:40 method and the final scores awarded by CBSE. One of the petitioners who scored 91.27% ended up getting 66% when the results were moderated based on the school’s past performance, showing a variance of over 25%. Similarly, another petitioner who scored 85.4% ended up getting 54% showing a variance of over 31% after the school’s performance was factored in. On August 8, the CBSE notified a dispute redressal mechanism, as per the court’s directions, under which the petitioner students complained against the CBSE policy to their respective schools. The grievance was forwarded to the Board that dismissed the representation as it found the marks to be in conformity with the evaluation policy. The petitions filed through advocate Ravi Prakash urged the CBSE to pass a reasoned order and consider amending the policy in view of the future of the petitioners.Even the schools where the petitioners studied supported their cause and told the CBSE that the previous batch of students was poor in academics and this should not come in the way of the present batch, which had performed better.The CBSE said, “The evaluation policy provides for taking into consideration the historical performance of the school, subject-wise mean, overall school average and moderation criteria for which a special software was developed by the Board…the answering respondent (CBSE) was bound to take into consideration not only the actual performance of the students but also the past performance of their school.” The Board also stated that the chart presented by the petitioners was based on a wrong reading of the evaluation policy as it considered the actual performance of students and not the past performance of the school.Further, the Board submitted that the issue with regard to the ‘historical/past performance of the school’ to be taken as one of the components for the purpose of declaring the result was already considered and approved by the Supreme Court by its June 22 order while considering a petition seeking cancellation of Class XII Board examinations.The Board further clarified that since the marks awarded to the petitioners was in accordance with the policy, there was no occasion to reconsider their representations by passing a detailed, reasoned order.The court had issued notice on the petitions on October 8 following which it closed for Dussehra vacation and fixed the matter on the reopening day (Wednesday) and directed the CBSE to submit its response by then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-review-evaluation-policy-for-class-12-cbse-urges-supreme-court-101634668433615.html
20-10-2021||India||Extreme weather events in Kerala linked to climate crisis: Experts||The havoc wrought by heavy rain in Kerala last week in which 39 people were killed has a clear imprint of climate change, say weather scientists. In the last three years, the state has seen at least four flash floods of which the 2018 floods were the worst. Scientists link the fast-changing weather pattern to the rise in surface temperature of the Arabian Sea in the last two decades, leading to higher cyclonic circulations. According to the India Meteorology Department, there was a 52% increase in cyclonic movement over the Arabian Sea between 2001 and 2019, and an 8% decrease in the Bay of Bengal during the same period. IMD statistics showed that nine cyclonic or major depressions had formed in 2020, of which four were over the Arabian Sea. Roxy Mathew, a planet scientist with the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, said the temperature over the Arabian Sea has increased by 1.2 to 1.4 degrees Celsius in the last two decades.“Usually, the temperature in the Arabian Sea is 1.5 degrees lower than the Bay of Bengal and this is one of the reasons for less cyclonic circulations and low pressure in the Arabian Sea. But of late, the situation is changing. What is disturbing is that warming is seen not only in the top layers of the sea but also in the deeper layers of the ocean,” Mathew said. He added, “We all know that more than 90% of the heat on earth is absorbed by oceans. Usually, temperatures in the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal are above 28 degrees Celsius and in the Arabian Sea, it is between 26 and 28 degrees Celsius. But the Arabian Sea is warming up fast. It has been quite visible in the last decade or so.” Dr Dr V S Vijayan, a member of the Madhav Gadgil committee on Western Ghats and founding director of Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology, said the state was yet to learn its lessons from the 2018 tragedy in which close to 400 people died. “It is sad that in Kerala, discussions start only after a tragedy, but everyone forgets about it soon. Cloud bursts, flash floods and landslips are here to stay. The state will have to pay a heavy price if it goes ahead ignoring the climate change signals,” said Dr M G Manoj of the Advanced Centre for Atmospheric Radar Research with the Cochin University of Science and Technology. Vijayan said Kerala can take the lead in implementing the UN General Assembly resolution of 2017 on sustainable development. “Our overdependence on natural resources will be reduced and we can think of a better tomorrow. Whether you take Uttarakhand, Kerala or the Northeast, calamities are leaving untold miseries. But for this, we need a committed political leadership,” he said. The UNGA resolution is a set of suggestions to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all by 2030. Noted ecological scientist Madhav Gadgil, who headed an expert group to study the degradation of the Western Ghats, said people will have to take more proactive roles to protect their place of living, surroundings, and environment. “I agree that lopsided developmental activities have aggravated the intensity of natural disasters. But I still have hope from Kerala — it is the first to take up decentralised planning. Let people take up their bread-and-butter issues along with sustenance,” Gadgil said, adding that states like Maharashtra and Goa also experience similar tragedies year after year but Kerala gets wider publicity and reach. Mathew said a big shift in the rain pattern in Kerala is visible. “Though monsoon rainfall may decrease, the number of heavy rainfalls will increase, leading to more flash floods and landslides,” Mathew said, adding that Kerala should have been very careful in land use because the state, endowed with many hills and rivers, has a slanting geographical landscape. Apart from global warming, scientists have also found that the dumping of plastic waste in the sea has also led to a rise in surface temperature. According to a study conducted by the Central Marine Fisheries Institute of India in 2018, major oceans will have more plastic than fish by 2050. By then, over 850 metric tonnes of plastic will be found in the sea whereas fish will be 821 metric tonnes.Another study conducted in 2017 by a world body, Alfred Wegener Institute, says the seas near Mumbai, Kerala and Andaman and Nicobar Islands are among the most polluted in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/extreme-weather-events-in-kerala-linked-to-climate-crisis-experts-101634668375094.html

20-10-2021||India||‘Problematic’ tiger caught alive in 21-day op||A male tiger who attacked and killed at least two people in Tamil Nadu was tranquillised and captured alive on Friday, bringing to a close a challenging 21-day search for the animal.Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) officials said that the tiger was tranquillised a little after 1pm. This is the first time that a tiger has been captured alive in the Nilgiris district, where at least three tigers were shot dead between 2014 and 2016. In 2002, a tiger was captured alive in the Annamalai Tiger Reserve in the state and let back into the forest.The 13-year-old tiger came to be identified as “MDT 23” , or Mudumalai Division Tiger number 23. He roamed in the buffer zone of the reserve, close to its boundary. Over the past three weeks, MDT 23 had remained elusive despite several close shaves with the search party -- 12 tranquillising darts were used before Friday to try and capture him, but he avoided them all.The searchThe tiger was first recorded by a camera trap in the Bandipur Tiger Reserve (BTR) in 2010. “Since then, it established a territory here. But due to his age, and from his wounds, we can say he has been in territorial fights and has moved. Because of the presence of other animals in the MTR reserve, this tiger is not being allowed into their territory which is why it has been moving near the forest boundary,” said field director D Venkatesh.From the beginning of July this year, villagers of the Gudalur area complained that MDT 23 was preying on livestock. Then, on September 24, the tiger killed a 56-year-old tribal man, V Chandran, a worker in the Devarshola area. The forest department confirmed Chandran as his first human victim. A search was launched for the tiger with five cages set up in vital locations in and around Gudalur, with field staff using camera trap images and patrols. A special police team was also deployed in the area, with a team of experts from Kerala’s Wayanad joining in.For the next week though, the tiger evaded all the traps set up for it, before surfacing on October 1 with another kill in Masinagudi about 30km away from the first. This brought locals to protest on the roads, demanding that the tiger be put down. Local residents alleged that the tiger killed more people than just the two, but officials have not confirmed this.On the same day as his second kill, chief wildlife warden Shekhar Kumar Niraj issued an order to “hunt the problematic tiger” under section 11(1) (a) of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, as the animal had “become very dangerous to human life in the area”. The section that assigns these powers however adds that “no wild animal shall be ordered to be killed unless the Chief Wildlife Warden is satisfied that such animal cannot be captured, tranquillised or translocated”.After the order, efforts were strengthened on the ground, with more than a 100 personnel including highly trained staff of the Forest Department -- with vets, sniffer dogs, two kumki elephants (trained in capture and rescue), and tech such as night vision cameras and drones.Meanwhile, a Chennai-based animal rights group, People for Cattle filed a PIL before the Madras high court seeking directions that the tiger be captured alive, and not killed. Appearing for the principal chief conservator, government lawyer P Muthukumar, informed the court on October 5 that there was no plan to kill the animal or maim it. “Efforts are on in the Mudumalai area to capture the animal alive and study its psychology and behaviour to assess what future course of treatment may be adopted,” he told the court. The bench of chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice PD Audikesavalu directed the principal chief conservator of forests to ensure that the least number of people intruded into the forest and posted the matter for after the festive break.Tiger conservation has been a focus in India for close to fifty years with the National Tiger Conservation Authority coming into being in 1972. A year later, “Project Tiger” was launched in April 1973, with the objective “to ensure maintenance of a viable population of Tigers in India for scientific, economic, aesthetic, cultural and ecological values, and to preserve for all times, areas of biological importance as a national heritage for the benefit, education and enjoyment of the people”. The latest Status of Tigers in India report 2018, a four year tiger census, showed an increase in numbers from 2,226 in 2014 to 2,967 in 2018.The final hoursOver the past three weeks, there were several touch-and-go situations on the hunt, with MDT 23 making a fleeting appearance, only to disappear in the forest.It was after officials suspended operations for the day on Thursday that they received a message, at around 8pm, that the tiger was spotted near the Theppakadu elephant camp, which is part of the Mudumalai National Park. A search team was rushed to the spot.MTR’s field director Venkatesh said that, soon, the tiger began moving towards Masinagudi. “In the meantime a small accident was reported in Masinagudi where a private vehicle skid from the road and the tiger mildly charged at the travellers, and our team stationed there brought the situation under control,” said Venkatesh. “We continued following the tiger because there is a temple near the forest boundary where more than 3,000 people had gathered because of the festival.”It was 4am when the tiger went back to the dense forest. “We had no weapons with us. We were very cautious so that the tiger doesn’t enter any human habitation.”On Friday morning, officials informed locals not to allow cattle-grazing in the area where the tiger was spotted.Forest veterinarian Dr Rajesh Kumar said that their team spotted the tiger at 8.30am inside a bush in the Masinagudi area. They were planning to capture him using nets, and once that failed, they cordoned off the area using the two kumki elephants.“The tiger roared and charged at us twice. The first time the kumki, Udhayan, took a step back but the second time, he stood his ground and that’s when I could dart him. The real hero of the operation is Udhayan,” he said.Kumar darted a tranquilliser from the kumki elephant’s back at the tiger at 1.05pm on Friday. “...we used a second dart on him on the ground again at 2.15 pm and secured the tiger at 2.30 pm,” said Kumar.The forest officers had the option of shifting the captured tiger either to the Vandalur zoo in Chennai or the Mysuru Zoo in Karnataka. Since the animal is old and weak, they decided to shift the animal to Mysuru, Karnataka which is closer to MTR.K Kalidasan, president of Coimbatore-based environmental organisation Osai, who has been working in the MTR landscape for two decades, said that the tiger was not a man-eater but had to be eliminated. “This tiger didn’t attack human beings as its prey but it did so while it was preying on livestock. All the four people (who are suspected to have been killed) are herdsmen,” Kalidasan said. However, after it killed a man on October first, the tiger is said to have mauled his arm. “It led to fear and panic among people. So the tiger had to be captured because we need the support of the local people who live in the fringes of the forest for wildlife management. And it’s not an easy task to capture an animal like the tiger alive while its nature is to hide in a closed forest. It was a huge and patient effort by the field staff.”Local herdsmen collect cowdung and sell it as a means to sustain their livelihood. Though cattle grazing is prohibited in tiger reserves, it continues unabated in buffer zones, says Kumaraguru Arumugam, conservation scientist and member of the Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve Foundation. “Due to this interference of cattle grazing, the herbivores of the region, such as deer, blackbuck, bison, have moved, affecting the balance of the prey and predator. So the tiger doesn’t have sufficient prey and it is also moving outside its territory,” says Arumugam. “This is why man-animal conflict is increasing inside tiger reserves in Tamil Nadu as well as in India.”Chief wildlife warden Niraj described the operation as intense. “And there was a constant fear that the tiger shouldn’t come out and kill anyone else,” said Niraj. “We are satisfied that we tried everything from data analysis to DNA analysis and we completed our mission which was to save the life of the tiger without injuring him. This is the first time in a decade that we have been able to capture a tiger alive.” Niraj said that the tiger has been stabilised after being tranquilised and his vitals, temperature, blood pressure are all normal. The vehicle is travelling with four doctors and officials at a low speed to Mysuru since the tiger’s condition is weak. “I’ve received an NOC from the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) for the tiger to be rehabilitated there. He has crossed his prime age of hunting. After he recovers, we have to find him a home based on what doctors say.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/problematic-tiger-caught-alive-in-21-day-op-101634323264598.html

20-10-2021||Today's||The inside story of India’s coal and power crises||Unprecedented. Unpredictable. A “perfect storm” of high demand, high global prices, and extended monsoons. All of these are common descriptors of how India came to have just four days of coal supplies left at power plants. These are all convenient but incomplete explanations. More than plain bad luck coming together in a perfect storm or any single issue, there was a wide gap in planning, coordination, and risk-taking. This problem also didn’t happen overnight or even in a month or two – it was many months in the making. Until we recognise these issues, this could happen again, and more so as India embarks on a high renewable energy future where uncertainty grows and planning becomes even more complex.What happened? Globally high prices? It turns out India’s power plants don’t import that much coal, at least not most of them which are suffering (a few coastal plants dominate imports). Huge demand for power? It’s false to blame “unprecedented power demand”, 15-20% higher than the previous year, since last year was an outlier. This year’s coal power output during August was 10% lower than in April.Simple arithmetic will show that power plants consumed more coal than they received, but given that generation wasn’t exceptionally high, does this mean the problem was supply?Not really. The real issue was lack of stockpiles. Supply varies both randomly and over the year, and power plants are meant to maintain a local stockpile. Coal India Limited (CIL) fuel supply contracts vary by each quarter of the calendar year, with the rainy season (third quarter) only getting 22% of the Annual Contracted Quantity (ACQ). Before and after this, each quarter gets 25%, but the January-March quarter is meant to be given 28%, partly in anticipation of the upcoming summer demand. Power plants failed to draw this share, for a variety of reasons. During Covid (FY21), coal was the swing producer, and lower power demand was borne almost entirely by lower coal power generation. This led to “record stockpiles” per newspaper reports, to the extent that by April, there were stories expressing concern whether this would put a dent in plans for coal block auctions and even the need for private sector coal mining. What these reports failed to mention was that while total stockpiles may have been very high, most of this was with the miner, Coal India Ltd (CIL). Stockpiles at power plants fell over FY21 by half, to about 30 MT.Even though this fall meant power plants allowed their stockpiles fall below their recommended levels, no one worried as things stayed stable for some months. The real problem wasn’t publicised till the end of September, when we stood at an average of four days supply, and alarm bells ensued. We panicked when coal stocks at power plants fell from seven days to four days from the end of August to the end of September. But no one did enough when in the prior month stocks fell by double, from 13 days to seven days.Plants weren’t buying enough coal because of many complex reasons. They were (and remain) cash-strapped. The chain is weak as consumers delay payments to discoms (electricity distribution companies) who delay payments to power plants. With high uncertainty over demand, it became temporarily “wise” to use up onsite stockpiles over FY21. The narrative was one of surplus, not just of coal but of power plant capacity, and an individual plant always believed, that as a nation, someone else would always fill in. States were anyway wary of stocking up coal at expensive plants that rarely made it into the merit order dispatch, more so in conditions of uncertainty. But many individuals thinking on the same lines leads to aggregate problems. If Google Maps offers us an alternative side road as it’s empty but everyone sees that, it won’t remain empty for long.Power plants changed gears and started asking for more coal precisely at a time when CIL was struggling to increase output. The extended monsoon was severe and many mines were flooded. Stockpiles are meant to handle such swings, but we didn’t have enough.A small saving grace has been Indian railways, the main means of long-distance transport. Because passenger traffic is down, coal delivery currently takes half the time it normally did in the past. That still doesn’t make increasing delivery easy. Coal is a lumpy commodity, and not very liquid (no pun intended). A single large power plant might require two full trainloads (rakes) of coal every day. We can’t just increase deliveries by 10% – we have to add a full rake. In a future piece, I will discuss what this means going forward, and what we need to do to make sure this doesn’t happen again. But one urgent issue I will flag right now is that we don’t have a proper system to get consumers to reduce their demand, which can be done much faster than supply can increase. Voluntary reductions might go a long way towards helping reduce or even avoid a crisis. These include steps such as aggressive control, lowering thermostats and colder/shorter bathing, leave alone actions by bulk consumers. Let’s not underestimate the potential of this– we saw huge reductions during the “nine minutes lights out” event last April.If we don’t voluntarily do something about it, the alternative is a return to involuntary load control, or load-shedding. That’s already started in pockets. With coordination, we can lower demand at the peak, which will help even more. Will voluntary actions be enough? No one knows, and it doesn’t substitute for more coal delivery, but we should certainly try.

20-10-2021||Editorials||On Kabul, a united, proactive approach||India’s move to convene a meeting of senior security officials of regional countries on the situation in Afghanistan reflects a proactive approach to shaping the response to developments in the war-torn country following the takeover by the Taliban. Invitations have been extended to China, Russia, Iran, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Pakistan for the meeting to be held in November. Security officials of these countries met for talks hosted by Iran in 2018 and 2019 with the objective of fashioning a regional approach to Afghanistan. However, the situation has changed since the Taliban takeover and the focus of most countries has shifted to ensuring there is no spillover of terrorism from Afghan soil. India has signalled it is in no rush to give any sort of legitimacy to the Taliban set-up.
