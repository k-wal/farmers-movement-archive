He met family members of the sanitation worker killed allegedly in police custody and targeted the BJP regime in the state for being anti-dalit.Azad arrived in Agra on Friday evening and reached the house of Arun Valmiki, consoled family members, and later interacted with mediapersons. “We demand a CBI probe in this custodial death case because the police is lying and has allegedly killed an innocent Dalit to save themselves in theft case at police station. The police has heaped atrocities on Valmiki and his family members and a dozen women were kept in custody among the 40 people rounded up by the police,” Chandra Shekhar alleged. “Although Agra is the capital of dalits but they (dalits) are weak here but the Azad Samaj Party will stand for them and will question the SSP and DM of Agra about when the real culprits will be arrested. Those who have stolen crores of money are moving scot free and an innocent dalit is tortured to death in matter of 25 lakh stolen from a police station,” Azad said. “The government in Uttar Pradesh gets moved by the death of a cow but is unmoved by the death of a dalit which is shameful. Even the compensation granted of 10 lakh is nothing when compared to similar matters of police atrocities. The Agra incident is a blot on the face of humanity and there is no future for three children, including a 30-day-old daughter, whom the deceased has left behind,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/azad-in-agra-demands-cbi-probe-in-custodial-death-case-101634927323059.html

22-10-2021||Lucknow||West UP’s paddy crop damaged, farmers seek compensation||MEERUT Last week’s heavy rain has caused widespread damage to paddy crop in different districts of western UP. With an estimated 15 to 20 per cent crop damaged, farmers are demanding to an immediate survey to assess the damage. Chief scientist of Basmati Export Promotion Council Dr Ritesh Sharma said that 1509 variety of Basmati were popular among farmers in Meerut, Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Hapur, Saharanpur, Moradabad and Bareilly region. An estimated 4 lakh hectare area is under Basmati cultivation in western UP. Sharma said that 10 to 15 per cent crop of Basmati 1509 had been damaged due to heavy rain last week. “ It was harvesting season for early variety of Basmati when the downpour hit the crop for three days,” said Singh. In addition to loss due to rain, the crop standing in the fields was now being attacked by insects, causing 5 to 7 per cent damage to the quality of grain, he said. An exporter of Basmati rice Ajay Bhalotia also expressed concern over widespread damage to the crop. “ Gujarat, Delhi and a few other states had declared compensation to paddy farmers after due survey but nothing has happened in UP so far and farmers are demanding immediate survey of the loss”, said Bhalotia who convened a meeting with a group of farmers in Jatpura village of Matt tehsil in Mathura on Friday. Bhalotia said that it was really painful to see the damage to crop and farmers needed assistance from the state government, otherwise it would be difficult for them to bear such a heavy loss. Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) president for NCR Mangeram Tyagi said, “ We have directed our tehsil and block level officials to meet farmers and raise their issue with the district magistrates and sub divisional magistrates to push the demand for immediate survey of damage so that compensation may be declared immediately.” BKU’s youth wing state president Digamber Singh, who belongs to Bijnor district, claimed that farmers grew paddy in a large area in the district. “Incessant rain caused heavy damage to paddy crops and unfortunately media also did not raise the plight of paddy farmers,” said Singh who also demanded immediate survey of the damage and compensation to farmers. Criticizing the PM Fasal Beema Yojana and other schemes for benefits of farmers, Singh claimed that the system had made these schemes so complex that farmers seldom received their benefits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/west-up-s-paddy-crop-damaged-farmers-seek-compensation-101634926906408.html

Traffic was constrained in view of the Covid-9 pandemic from April to May, with 50 First-Information Reports (FIRs) registered in the year, the lowest since 1976, when traffic volume was a fraction of today. The number of crash related calls to the PCR was 8,240 is also half of 15,794 calls in 2019. Senior superintendent of police (SSP, Traffic) Manisha Choudhary said, Vehicular restrictions due to Covid pandemic contributed to lower fatalities in 2020. However, continued efforts in areas of enforcement, road safety awareness and road engineering interventions have also helped us in bringing down fatalities by half in the last decade.”National Road Safety Council member Kamaljeet Soi said, “Apart from Covid, we see the traffic police turning to hi-tech speed cameras and e-challaning. Enforcement has increased and a fall in fatality figures was to be expected,” he said.Speeding continues to remain the main cause of fatal accidents in the city. In 2019, 95% of all fatal accidents were caused by speeding; this dipped marginally to 92% in 2020. Road safety activist Harpreet Singh said, “Due to good infrastructure and wide roads speeding has become a problem in the city. Behavioural changes are needed and the traffic police must think of re-introducing speeding nakas like before to change people’s behaviour.” SSP Choudhary added “We will analyse the accident prone areas and take corrective actions in terms of deployment and engineering intervention. We are already deploying night nakas based on accident-prone location analysis and are in the process of purchasing night-vision radar guns to capture speeding violations at night and new Handycams as well. Smart City project will help us in preventing accidents.”TWO-WHEELERS MOST DANGEROUSTwo-wheelers remained the most dangerous mode of transport with 43% of fatalities involving these, from 44% in 2019. Of 22 two-wheeler fatalities, eight were without helmet. Over 22% of all fatalities were pedestrians, 19% were cyclists and 7% were rehri-pullers. In 2019, this was 34% pedestrians, 10% were cyclists and 1% were rickshaw pullers.Cars caused the most accidents. In 60% of all fatalities the vehicle of the accused was a light motor vehicle (32 of 53 fatalities). 17% fatalities were caused by trucks, 8% fatalities by lorries and 4% by buses in 2020.CHANDIGARH VEHICLES MAJOR CULPRITS THIS YEAR In 2019, 41% of the fatal accidents were caused by vehicles from Punjab and Haryana, but in 2020 the number went down to 32%. Vehicles from Chandigarh caused 18 of the 50 fatal accidents which is 36%. Nights remained the most dangerous with 14 of 50 fatal accidents between 9pm and midnight and 12 accidents between 6pm and 9pm.

According to the police, the container was heading towards Mumbai when the driver lost control near Navale bridge. “In order to overtake, the tanker containing thinner first brushed a small seven-seater vehicle which had 12 people travelling in it. Then it also hit a two-wheeler before being rammed into container,” said Devidas Gheware, senior inspector, Sinhgad road police station. Thinner is a solvent used to thin oil-based paints or as a cleaning agent. According to Gheware, three people were confirmed dead and 12 people are injured and have been rushed to the hospital at the time of going to press. The deceased were removed by fire brigade personnel. Assistant commissioner of police Vijay Choudhari said, prima facie it appears that the truck had switched off engine on the slope when the driver lost control. Earlier on Thursday, two women and five others were injured after a container truck caused a multi-vehicle pile up near Narhe selfie point. The truck heading towards Warje hit a pick up van causing it to swerve and hit three motorcycles. The entire stretch between Narhe going till Navale bridge has seen several accidents in the past.

He said that wet, dry and domestic harmful waste should be kept separately in the houses. Do composting at home from wet waste and use compost made from it for the plants. Due to this, the waste in Gurugram will reduce, and it will also add to the green cover in the city. Dry and domestic harmful waste should be given to the recyclers. Overall, these measures will help reduce the waste load carried to the Bandhwari landfill,” said SS Rohilla, public relations officer (PRO) of MCG.Ahuja also said that the Swachh Survekshan 2022 was announced by the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry, and Gurugram is participating in it. He appealed to the citizens for cooperation and said that they should segregate waste, adopt home composting, stop using polythene and single use plastic, and take care of cleanliness of their houses and their surrounding areas.“This way, we will help Gurugram get better in cleanliness ranking and make the city better by making it clean and beautiful,” Ahuja added.He also said that directions have been issued to 26 empanelled agencies of MCG to ensure that waste management is done at bulk waste generators, and to send monthly reports of the action taken to the MCG.

22-10-2021||Gurugram||Faridabad, Manesar pollution hotspots in NCR even during monsoon, says CSE study||Faridabad and Manesar in the National Capital Region (NCR) were identified as pollution hotspots this monsoon as when most of NCR breathed clean air, these two regions reported high pollution levels during the season, found a recent analysis of air quality trends conducted by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), which released the data on Friday evening. The study found Faridabad’s Sector 11 had the worst air this monsoon in the NCR with 64 ug/m3 (micrograms per cubic meter) of pollutants. The analysis is a continuation of the air quality tracker initiative of the Urban Data Analytics Lab of the CSE that was started last winter. The objective of this new analysis is to understand the starting line of the onset of pollution during the pre-winter levels in this region. The analysis assessed the annual and seasonal trends in PM2.5 concentration from January 1, 2018 to October 15, 2021. As part of the study, 14 new locations in NCR were identified last winter as emerging hotspots, half of which registered lower PM 2.5 concentration this monsoon compared to city and regional averages. Three more locations, including Manesar and Faridabad’s Sector 11, emerged as potential pollution hotspots this monsoon. The analysis shows these locations show significantly higher seasonal average compared to the rest of the region. Avikal Somvanshi, programme manager for sustainable cities with CSE, said, “During monsoon, there are no external factors, such as temperature drop and stubble burning that come into play during winter, that will affect the air quality. Still Faridabad, Manesar and other cities of Haryana had high pollution levels. Usually, the rain washes down all pollutants, but higher levels indicate that local sources of pollution are not being controlled.” “If during monsoon, high levels of pollution are being reported when most of Delhi-NCR had good air quality, it will be very difficult to meet targets during winter, when external factors affect the air quality,” he added. According to the 2009 National Ambient Air Quality Standards, the permissible PM2.5 level over a year-long period is 40µg/m³--eight times more than the revised threshold set by the World Health Organisation. The seasonal average of air pollutants in Faridabad (42), Gurugram (44), Manesar (51) and Dharuhera (43) during monsoon this year (from July 1 till October 15) was higher than the annual average. S Narayanan, member secretary of Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), said, “I am yet to go through the data. I will not be able to comment before studying it. All measures are being taken to ensure that pollution levels are under control during the winter season.” Meanwhile, the air quality in Gurugram was in the moderate category. The Central Pollution Control Board’s air quality bulletin showed Gurugram had an air quality index (AQI) of 164 on Friday. With an AQI of 183, Faridabad district also recorded moderate air quality, though slightly poorer than Gurugram. Over the next two days, the city is likely to receive one or two spells of rain, which might improve the air quality. According to the weather bulletin issued on Friday by the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the air quality in the national capital territory will remain ‘moderate’ on Saturday and is likely to improve on Sunday, owing to rainfall and strong winds. The contribution of biomass burning in PM2.5 concentration is also likely to be less than 5% and reduce significantly over the weekend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/faridabad-manesar-pollution-hotspots-in-ncr-even-during-monsoon-says-cse-study-101634926302728.html
22-10-2021||Gurugram||11 years on, buyers protest against non-delivery of plots in Gurugram project||Plot buyers of ‘Krrish World’ in Gurugram’s Brahma City project protested against the developer near the department of town and country planning (DTCP) office in Sector 14 on Friday for failing to deliver their plots even 11 years after launching the project.The buyers also submitted a memorandum to the DTCP, demanding delivery of their pending plots despite 90% of the total payment being done, alleged members of Krrish & Brahma Buyers Association.The association said the project, which was launched in 2010 by Krrish Realtech Private Limited (KRPL), offered plots to buyers in Brahma City spread over sectors 60, 61, 62, 63 and 65, promising that the plots would be delivered between 2013 and 2014. The average size of plots ranged from 300 square yard to 400 square yard, according to the buyers.The protesters, who had gathered near the DTCP office on Friday, alleged that the developer did not offer them possession of their plots and has now come up with a new scheme, according to which, the project will be developed in collaboration with a third party to offer floor spaces to the buyers instead of plots which they had purchased earlier.Naresh Garg, a buyer, said that the developer has approached the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), declaring itself insolvent so that the project could be handed over to a third party for making floor spaces without any consent from the plot owners. “Instead of giving us the plots, the developer is now offering us floor spaces. We want our original plots only,” said Garg, adding that they have not given any consent to accept the floor spaces.According to the buyers, several plots have also been sold to multiple buyers and it becomes a problem when they go for the physical possession. “When I went to take possession of my plot, five other persons were already sitting there who refused to let us take possession as they, too, claimed ownership of the plot,” said Girish Guliani, another buyer.Plot buyers, who protested on Friday, alleged that they have paid nearly ₹1 crore each to the developer, and many of them even took loans and are paying EMIs for the same. “Most of the buyers are end-users and they have invested their hard-earned money in the project. The authorities and developers must not allow this change in the character of the project as it will cause a major loss to the buyers,” said DD Singh, president of the association.The project developer, however, denied the allegations and said that they have been committed to delivering the plots to the buyers. “We are working out a scheme for the delivery of the plots to the buyers, and they will get their spaces soon. We are committed to delivering these units to the buyers. The delay has been caused due to various reasons and we are working on it,” said Amulya Misra, director of KRPL.A spokesperson of Brahma City Private Limited (BCPL) said, “We examined our records, and it is submitted at the outset that the said individuals/entities are not customers or allottees of BCPL and have no privity of contract with it. Further, it may be noted at the outset that BCPL is not responsible for any act or omission committed by KRPL. BCPL is a separate and distinct legal entity. The complainant appears to be the allottee of KRPL and therefore BCPL is not responsible for any act or omission committed by KRPL.”Sanjeev Mann, senior town planner, Gurugram, said that the DTCP officials were in Chandigarh on Friday to attend a meeting, but a memorandum has been submitted to the office. “We will examine issues raised by the buyers, and the needful will be done according to the rules,” Mann said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/11-years-on-buyers-protest-against-non-delivery-of-plots-in-gurugram-project-101634926122794.html
22-10-2021||Gurugram||Seven years after proposal, art and cultural complex project revived in Gurugram||Nearly seven years after it was first proposed, the arts and cultural complex project of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has now been revived, with the tenders for the project likely to be floated by the next month, and the actual work to be commenced from December, officials familiar with the development said on Friday.According to MCG officials, the design of the arts and cultural complex in Gurugram Sector 53 has been inspired by India Habitat Centre (IHC) in Delhi, Dilli Haat in Indian National Airways (INA) Market, and Ravindra Natya Grah auditorium in Indore.Spread across seven acres, the complex will have an auditorium, open-air theatres, restaurants, art galleries, rest houses, pantry area and parking spaces, and a dedicated space for setting up an open market, food court and craft market along the lines of Dilli Haat.According to the MCG officials, a consultant of the civic body made a presentation on the design and concept of the project before senior MCG officials at its Sector 34 office on Thursday evening, and its detailed project report was approved. “Following the presentation, MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja and I, together, examined various aspects of the project’s detailed notice inviting tender (DNIT), detailed project report (DPR), estimates and technical sanctions among other such issues. All of these have been approved and will be taken up on priority,” said TL Sharma, chief engineer of MCG.Sharma also said that the project is estimated to cost around ₹210 crore.Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had announced the establishment of the arts and cultural complex in 2015. The state government had given administrative approval for the project in September 2019 for ₹194.95 crore.“There were some technical issues with the previous concept. The entire project has been designed and planned afresh with new estimates. The consultant has also made changes in the DPR accordingly, and the commissioner has also given his approval to it,” Sharma added.There is a dearth of arts and cultural spaces in the city. The last public cultural centre in Gurugram was the 200-seating capacity Bal Bhawan auditorium in Sector 4 where the MCG showcased its weekly culture performances. The auditorium was shut in February 2018 as it was in a dilapidated condition, and is now under renovation.According to a senior MCG official privy to the matter, the MCG’s consultant will submit the design plans and concept in writing by the next week, following which, they will initiate the tendering process. “The project is in its final stages. The MCG will issue tenders to hire contractors within the next 15 days. According to the concept, art galleries, auditoriums, open-air theatres, rest houses for artists, restaurants, pantries and parking spaces will be set up. Spaces have also been earmarked to set up food plazas, cultural and crafts shops like the ones in Dilli Haat. The cultural complex will be one-of-its-kind in the city,” said Vivek Gill, superintendent engineer of MCG, who is overseeing the project.Gill said that the entire design of the project was inspired from IHC and Ravindra Natya Grah auditorium in Indore.In regards to private cultural spaces, the Epicentre in Sector 44 was the city’s cultural and social hub from 2008 till January 2017, hosting exhibitions, song festivals, plays, dance performances and stand-up comedy shows among other such events. In October 2018, it restarted as an “apparel house”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/seven-years-after-proposal-art-and-cultural-complex-project-revived-in-gurugram-101634926062827.html

22-10-2021||Noida||Man arrested for killing interior designer in Greater Noida||A 30-year-old man was arrested on Thursday night for allegedly killing a 28-year-old woman, an interior designer by profession, in Greater Noida on Wednesday. Police said the suspect Arjun Singh, alias Chaman Chauhan, a resident of Alipur in New Delhi, wanted to marry the woman identified as Pinky Chauhan. Arjun’s sister was married to Pinky’s cousin last year. He killed Pinky because her family fixed her marriage with someone else, said police. According to police, Pinky’s family members found her with her throat slit and multiple wounds on her body at their home in Paramount Golf Foreste Villas Sector Zeta – 1. Arjun allegedly fled with her cellphone, ₹4 lakh cash and gold jewellery. Ankur Agarwal, additional deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said Arjun fled the spot after committing the murder. “We scanned the CCTV footage and identified him and the scooter used in the crime. We launched a search and also informed Delhi police. A team of Delhi police’s crime branch arrested Arjun from Delhi on Thursday night and handed him over to Noida police,” he said.On Friday, the Surajpur police took Arjun to find the murder weapon and the valuables, which he had hid in a bush near Tilapta roundabout. “The police found a bag in which a sharp knife, a stolen I-phone and some gold and silver jewellery, ₹ 39,526 in cash, 190 Nepali rupees and $11 dollar were found,” said Agarwal. Agarwal said that Arjun suddenly snatched a sub-inspector Hariram Singh’s pistol and tried to escape after opening fire. “Police returned the fire; Arjun was shot on the right leg and overpowered. He was sent for medical treatment to the district hospital,” he said. Agarwal added Arjun wanted to marry Pinky but her family had recently fixed her marriage with somewhere else. “Primary investigation shows the suspect had murdered the woman over this issue,” he said. Pappu Namberdar, Pinky’s maternal uncle, said her father deals in the transport business in Noida. Originally from Noida’s Chhalera village, the Chauhans shifted to their new home in Greater Noida last year.

22-10-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Govt hospitals record high bed occupancy with rise in dengue cases||The surge in dengue cases, coupled with a high number of viral fever cases, has led to almost full occupancy in the two district hospitals in Ghaziabad. Experts said the occupancy is also very high in private hospitals. Officials of the district health department said they have directed the hospitals to increase the number of beds as per requirement.According to the official figures of the district health department, 33 fresh cases of dengue were reported on Friday taking the tally of cases to 747, of which 356 cases have been reported in October (till Friday) alone. The first dengue case was reported from the district on September 1. “The bigger private hospitals in the city have almost 80-90% occupancy, while beds are available in other facilities. The reason for the higher occupancy is the increasing number of cases of both viral fever and dengue, where the platelet count shows a marked decline. The situation is likely to prevail for another fortnight. We are expecting the cases to decline as has been the trend in the past years,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, former president of the Indian Medical Association, Ghaziabad. Officials of the two district hospitals in Ghaziabad said almost all their beds reserved for patients suffering from dengue and viral fever are occupied. “We have 60 beds reserved for dengue cases, malaria and viral fever and all of these are full nowadays. Apart from these beds, we have 40 beds reserved for paediatric ICU, high dependency unit and neonatal intensive care. If need be, we can allot these 40 beds for dengue and other patients,” said Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent of Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital. “We have about 150 cases of viral fever. We keep receiving patients suffering from viral fever at our outpatient department on a daily basis. The number (150) has not decreased,” he added. Officials of the MMG District Hospital said almost 90% of their beds are occupied by mostly dengue and viral fever patients. “We have 166 beds in our hospital; around 90% of them are occupied with some beds occupied by patients who have undergone different surgeries. The beds are mostly occupied by patients who are suffering from dengue and viral fever. On an average, we receive around 200 patients daily with symptoms of fever,” said Dr Anurag Bhargava, chief medical superintendent of the MMG District Hospital. Officials of the district health department said they are keeping a close watch on the rise in the number of dengue and viral fever cases. “As regards the bed occupancy, in some hospitals it is high while in others, beds are easily available. In fact, we have also asked the hospitals to increase the number of beds as and when required. The cases of viral fever cannot be ascertained on a daily basis but we have a count of dengue cases as it has to be reported by every hospital in the district,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, district surveillance officer. The tally of dengue cases is highest after 2014 when the district received 928 cases. Official records indicate that the district recorded the first 100 cases in 15 days on September 15 after the first case was reported on September 1. The next set of 100 cases was reported in nine days on September 24. The district breached the 300-mark of dengue cases on September 30. On October 6, the tally of dengue cases breached the 400 mark while the next 100 cases were reported in the next five days on October 11. The tally increased to 600 in a span of five days on October 16. The total number of dengue cases crossed the 700-mark on October 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-govt-hospitals-record-high-bed-occupancy-with-rise-in-dengue-cases-101634925524229.html
22-10-2021||Noida||Noida’s air quality improves as wind catches pace||The air quality of Noida on Friday improved to ‘moderate’ levels due to strong westerly winds. Weather analysts said that the air quality may further improve as the city is likely to witness rain on Saturday. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) reading, on a scale of 0 to 500, for Noida on Friday was 192 (‘moderate’) against 209 (‘poor’) a day earlier. Similarly, the AQI of Greater Noida was 172 against 220 a day earlier. The air quality of Gaziabad, however, remained ‘poor’ even though showing marginal improvement within the category, with the city recording an AQI of 236 against 262 a day earlier, showed the CPCB data.An AQI reading between 101 and 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and above 400 is considered ‘severe’.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Noida and adjoining areas may see rainfall on Saturday. “Maximum temperature will hover around 30°C and minimum around 17°C on Saturday. There is a possibility of light rainfall in the region on Saturday,” said an IMD official.Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet, said that Noida saw strong winds up to 20-25 km per hour that helped with dispersion of the pollutants and better ventilation. “A western disturbance is also approaching that may lead to change in the wind directions towards evening hours on Friday, which may drop the wind speed during night time on Friday and lead to slight spike in pollution levels. However, the winds will catch up during the daytime. There is also a possibility of light rainfall on Saturday which may further improve the air quality,” Palawat said.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the air quality is likely to remain ‘moderate’. “In presence of dry weather and westerly wind, local dust emission will lead to high PM10. Additional dust transport from Rajasthan’s desert areas due to high wind speed and dry conditions is contributing to PM10 enhancement. Impact of fire emission is almost negligible due to faster dispersion and unfavourable wind direction. The overall AQI is forecasted to remain in moderate category for the next two days,” said a statement by Safar on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noidas-air-quality-improves-as-wind-catches-pace-101634925350287.html
22-10-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Five of porn racket arrested||The Ghaziabad police on Friday arrested a couple and their three women employees for allegedly running an online porn racket in which they trapped customers by recording their objectionable videos and extorted lakhs of rupees by threatening them to make the videos viral on social media. Several accounts of the suspect couple have transactions amounting to about ₹3.6 crore, the police said, adding the suspects were operating from a rented flat in a high-rise in Raj Nagar Extension. Police identified the couple as Yogesh Gautam, 28, his wife Sapna Gautam, 24. The couple’s three women employees, who joined lately, were identified as Nikita Singh, 19, Priya, 20, and Nidhi Khanna, 28, all residents of Ghaziabad. According to the police, for past two years, the couple was registered on a website where they would connect on live porn video shows with different customers. “Through this website, the customers used to pay up ₹234 per minute and the couple used to get half of the money. Later, the couple came in contact with a man from Australia who told them that they can start their own venture by connecting to customers directly and bypassing the website. So, they started connecting to customers directly by providing them the mobile numbers,” said Nipun Agarwal, superintendent of police (city 1). The police said that when the customer base grew, the couple hired three women and together they propagated the modus operandi of the website. “While dealing directly with the customers, the gang would record their objectionable videos and then blackmail them. We have come across the couple’s eight bank accounts so far and four of these have transactions of about ₹3.6 crore. Recently, we got a tip-off from the Rajkot police in Gujarat that the suspects extorted ₹80 lakh from a man through a similar modus operandi and the money belonged to his employer. The employer later lodged an FIR and the reason behind siphoning off ₹80 lakh was revealed to the police,” Agarwal said. Based on the tip provided by the Rajkot police, the Ghaziabad police roped in cyber cell teams and nabbed the suspects, the officials said. “The couple had hired a high-end flat in Raj Nagar Extension and was living a luxurious life. It is estimated that they cheated hundreds of people and we are trying to trace them with the help of bank transactions of the suspects. We also recovered several mobile phones containing objectionable videos, web cameras, laptops, and bank documents, among other things, from their possession,” the police officer said. According to the police, an FIR was registered against the suspects at Nandgram police station under IPC sections for extortion, obscenity, criminal breach of trust, cheating and also under provisions of the Information Technology Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-five-of-porn-racket-arrested-101634924984525.html

Some officials from the town planning department were involved in this case,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer, Noida authority.“These are same officials who have been facing FIR in the violation of building map for twin tower case,” said Maheshwari.The Noida authority may send the probe report to the government for further action on Tuesday (October 26), said the officials, adding that the authority has already freed up the 7,000 sqm green belt and taken possession of the land.On October 3, the special investigation team (SIT), constituted to investigate irregularities in the approval of building map plans for 40-storey twin towers in the Emerald Court project, directed the Noida authority to free up 7,000 sqm green area that was merged into the housing project illegally. Officials of Supertech have refused to comment on the issue.In its report, the SIT had said that 26 Noida authority officials were involved in the irregularities in the Supertech’s twin tower map approval. Of the 26 officials, two are dead and 20 have retired. The SIT has also recommended filing an FIR against four directors of Supertech Limited, two private architects and the 24 Noida authority officials.Following the SIT’s recommendations, the Noida authority’s planning department filed FIR against the suspected authority officials with the vigilance department in Lucknow. The SIT was formed by the state government on September 2, two days after the Supreme Court ordered the demolition of Apex and Ceyane towers in the Emerald Court project over grave violation of building norms. The court said the violation was a result of “nefarious complicity” between the Noida authority and the real estate developer. The process to demolish the twin towers is underway, said authority officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/emerald-court-probe-of-officials-involved-in-allowing-green-belt-encroachment-complete-101634924683152.html

She will make the announcement about the remaining pratigyas (promises) while flagging off the yatras scheduled to end on November 1,” said Congress Legislature Party leader Aradhana Mishra ‘Mona’ who, along with senior party leaders PL Punia, Naseemuddin Siddiqui and Rajesh Mishra, shared with the media the details of the yatras that would cover major cities, towns and villages of Uttar Pradesh.Punia said the first yatra to be led by Pramod Tiwari, Rajesh Mishra and Nadeem Javed would begin in Varanasi and pass through Chandauli, Sonbhadra, Mirzapur, Prayagraj, Pratapgarh and Amethi districts to end in Rae Bareli. He said another yatra would begin in Barabanki and end in Jhansi via Lucknow, Unnao, Fatehpur, Chitrakoot, Banda, Hamirpur and Jalaun. Punia would lead this second yatra with Pradeep Jain ‘Aditya’ and Naseemuddin Siddiqui. Former Union minister Salman Khurshid, along with senior party leader Acharya Pramod Krishnam, would lead the third yatra that would begin in Saharanpur.Asked whether the party has cancelled the fourth yatra proposed earlier, Mishra said, “We have a public meeting in Gorakhpur on October 31 and the yatra was also to be in the district at the same time. This would have upset the programme. So, a decision about the fourth yatra will be taken after Diwali.”Indeed, the months preceding the 2022 assembly polls appear to be replete with yatras —the Congress’s Pratigya Yatras, the BJP’s Jan Ashirvad Yatras, the Samajwadi Party’s Vijay Yatras and Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party’s Samajik Parivartan Yatra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/congress-general-secretary-priyanka-gandhi-vadra-to-launch-three-yatras-in-uttar-pradesh-on-saturday-101634924142718.html

22-10-2021||Mumbai||NEET-UG: Students worry about further delay in results||The wait for results of the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-UG) exams just got longer after the Bombay high court on Thursday directed the National Testing Agency (NTA), the nodal exam conducting agency, to conduct the examination afresh for two candidates who approached the judiciary. The decision comes after two medical aspirants from Solapur complained that their exam invigilators mixed up their question and answer sheets on the day of the examination, leaving them without the original answer booklet for results. This automatically means that the already delayed results for the all India medical entrance exam will be further delayed. Nearly 16 lakh students appeared for the exam held on September 12 this year.“There have been too many hiccups with NEET-UG exams this year, starting with delay due to rising Covid-19 cases, then complaints of malpractices during the exam. Now this order by the Bombay HC automatically means further delay,” said Anuja Parikh, mother of a UG medical aspirant. Complaints of malpractices on the day of the exam cropped up in several states this year, including Rajasthan and Maharashtra. Several petitions were filed demanding for re-examination but the final verdict came from the Supreme Court last month clarifying that no re-exam would be held for NEET UG 2021.Late on Thursday night, the National Testing Agency (NTA) further extended dates for the second phase of online correction of data in the original application form. Students can now complete this process by October 26, 11:50pm. The NTA, however, has not yet given clarity on the second round of exam as per Bombay HC order, out details about results date.“This delay (in results) means delay in starting the admissions process. Once again admissions to undergraduate medical and dental courses will not begin until November and that means regular lectures will only start in December. It’s unfair to the students to bear the brunt of mistakes made by the authorities,” said another parent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/neetug-students-worry-about-further-delay-in-results-101634922402962.html
22-10-2021||Mumbai||Pandemic reduced life expectancy at birth in India by two years: study||In 2020, the life expectancy at birth in India reduced by two years due to Covid-19, a new study published by researchers from the International Institute of Population Sciences (IIPS) and Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) has found. The reduction, according to the authors, was due to the excess deaths caused by Covid-19 in the 35-79 age group. The study published on Thursday in BMC Public Health, a peer-reviewed journal, also highlighted that the age-wise mortality disruptions caused by the pandemic impacted more men than women. “The inequality in the deaths by age groups was higher in men,” said Suryakant Yadav from IIPS, who co-authored the paper along with Pawan Kumar Yadav from IIPS and Neha Yadav from JNU. “It could be because men were exposed more to the external factors compared to women,” he said. Life expectancy at birth reflects the overall mortality level of a population, according to the World Health Organization. It summarises the mortality pattern that prevails across all age groups - children and adolescents, adults and the elderly. For the study, the authors retrieved data between January 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020 from Covid-19-India Application Programming Interface (API) portal available in the public domain. They also retrieved data of 21 causes of deaths compiled under the Global Burden of Disease. “We collated these data sets and altogether had 22 causes of deaths with the addition of Covid-19. We used a life table methodology to analyse the impact of Covid-19 and found a drop of two years in the life expectancy at birth,” said Yadav. A life table presents a set of tabulations that describe the probability of dying, the death rate and the number of survivors for each age or age group. The study said that Covid-19 disease demonstrates its potential to cancel the gains of six to eight years in life expectancy at birth and five years in inequality in age at death. “The Covid-19 pandemic has negative repercussions on life expectancy and inequality in age at death and has slowed the mortality transition in India,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pandemic-reduced-life-expectancy-at-birth-in-india-by-two-years-study-101634921922423.html

22-10-2021||Lucknow||Yogi Adityanath says discontent, mistrust prevailed before 2014||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday said discontent and mistrust prevailed in the country before 2014 as scams came to light every day.But the BJP, which came to power at the Centre in 2014 after ten years of the Congress-led UPA rule and formed the government in Uttar Pradesh in 2017, was working on the “sabka saath sabka vikas” mantra given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ensure benefits of various schemes reached all without discrimination, he said.The chief minister was speaking at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) backward class samajik pratinidhi sammelan here on Friday.Adityanath also said during the previous Samajwadi Party government, terrorist activities refreshed the memories of the medieval period when temples and mutts were attacked.The sentiments of Hindus were trampled, police stations and tehsil offices were sold while the SP workers indulged in loot, he alleged.He also said if the BJP had been power in 1990, no one would have dared to open fire on Ram bhakts at Ayodhya.Those who ordered firing on the devotees could not be forgiven, he said.“Will you forgive those who opened fire on Lord Ram devotees? Lord Ram will not,” the chief minister said. Yogi Adityanath was referring to the police firing on karsevaks gathered in Ayodhya on the saffron outfits’ call in 1990 when SP leader Mulayam Singh Yadav was the UP chief minister.Now, with the BJP in power at the Centre and the state, a grand Ram temple is being constructed in Ayodhya, he said, adding it is an opportunity for 135 crore Indians to hold their heads high before the world.He also said a self-respecting society cannot tolerate the chains of slavery. Accusing the then UPA government of doing politics at the cost of the country, he alleged terrorist outfits had a free run and Maoist groups were active across the country.When the country was passing through this period of discontent, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave the slogan of “sabka saath- sabka vikas”, which has turned into a reality today as a result of which there is no discrimination in government schemes as members from all communities have benefitted, he said.While the SP and BSP governments did not work for the uplift of the weaker sections in the society, the BJP government has launched a slew of development projects across the state, he said.One can see that the BJP governments at the Centre and in the state have built toilets, given cooking gas connections, distributed kisan samman nidhi, ensure loan waiver, brought health insurance scheme, free ration and free Covid vaccine without any discrimination, he said.The party workers should visit each family in the state to tell them that the BJP is working for the development of the society, the state and the country, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-adityanath-says-discontent-mistrust-prevailed-before-2014-101634921682740.html

22-10-2021||Lucknow||In Prayagraj, Made in India electric products outshine Chinese counterparts||‘Made in India’ electric products are a big hit among people this Diwali with consumers seen shunning their cheap Chinese alternatives, said traders of Prayagraj’s Shahganj market that caters to city as well as rural areas of the district.From attractive jhalars to decorative lamps, ‘akashdeep’ (hanging lamps), artificial candles, chandeliers, the market is flooded with both Indian and Chinese variants but there are more takers for Indian manufactured products as compared to its option made from the ‘Dragon country’, said shopkeepers. The attraction for Made in India variants are pertinent despite the fact that they are a bit expensive but comes with longer shelf life guarantee, the sellers added. Besides, the sense of patriotism associated with Made in India products has added to the popularity, they conceded. Mohd Gufran, a shopkeeper said a length of Made in India jhalars is more than 65 meters and costs ₹240 to ₹310. Its specialty is that the damaged bulbs can be replaced which is not an option for Chinese variants. Along with this, attractive 3D skirting with LED is also being sold in the market. Among the two variants of skirting, the one made in India has copper wire and is more in demand as compared to its cheaper variant having ordinary wire. The one with copper wire is expensive yet are selling like hot cakes, said another shopkeeper Rajesh Srivastava. Because of the last year’s slowdown due to the pandemic, this Diwali traders are trying to make-up the loss because of which the prices have increased by 10 to 15% as compared to last year. Some shopkeepers have also launched attractive schemes to boost their sale. Shopkeepers Raghavendra and Satyendra Singh said the market has an annual turnover of ₹20 to 25 crore. Last year the sale was quite low but this Diwali has brought promise of bigger profits. “The pandemic had completely ruined the business last year but thank god that there is some relief this time and the market is expected to pick up in coming days,” said Ranjan Mishra, another shopkeeper. This year the main attraction of the market is an electronic fountain and peacock. In the electronic fountain, eight colours of light come out surrounding the water like a waterfall. At the same time, the multi-coloured electronic peacock is quite attractive which looks like it is studded with gems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/in-prayagraj-made-in-india-electric-products-outshine-chinese-counterparts-101634919462525.html

CBI on Wednesday filed its first charge sheet in the case, charging the two arrested accused under Sections 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for murder and other offences. Ananad was mowed down by an auto rickshaw on July 28 this year when he was out for his morning walk. Two people allegedly involved in the alleged killing, Lakhan Verma and Rahul Verma, were arrested by Jharkhand police and the vehicle involved was seized.Lawyers who participated in the hearing n HC on Friday said the bench came down heavily on the central agency for not making any major headway in the investigation.“The bench observed that neither the agency took the court into confidence nor did it attach a copy of the charge sheet along with the status report and it was not expected from a professional agency like the CBI. It also said the agency has been filing a stereotyped report every week. The agency has failed to even provide any evidence to establish the motive behind the murder charge. This could ultimately help the two accused,” a lawyer said. CBI, in its submission, said it filed the charge sheet in consultation with its headquarter and is investigating further to establish the motive and unravel the conspiracy behind the murder. It said it would submit a detailed report on the next hearing on October 29. The court observed that if the headquarter was consulted before filing of chargsheet, then the bench would better summon the CBI director after seeing the report next week and seek requisite clarifications from the top officer himself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dhanbad-judge-death-j-khand-hc-pulls-up-cbi-on-lack-of-headway-101634918986191.html

The state election commission (SEC) has denied permission to go ahead with the recruitment and the officials are also involved with the election process. A new schedule will be issued after the completion of panchayat polls,” said the department notification issued on Friday.The notification comes after SEC rejected to department’s request for permission to carry on with the process for sixth phase of recruitment. This would further delay the start of the seventh phase recruitment, as the sixth phase could start only in the third week of December at the earliest and may stretch for a couple of months or more due to the cumbersome process of documents verification. So far, even first and second phase counselling has not been completed in nearly 1,200 recruiting units and the department might also go in for the third round counselling. “It is only after the sixth phase is completed that the department will have an assessment of the quantum of vacancies for the seventh phase of recruitment,” said a department official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/teachers-recruitment-bihar-to-issue-fresh-schedule-101634918982342.html

The two allies have been locked in a war of words in the run-up to the October 30 bypolls for Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly seats in Bihar, where both have fielded their candidates.“We are not in Mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) in Bihar. A decision to this effect was taken after October 16 considering what happened at Kusheshwar Asthan, which was snatched from us. What is the use of having such an alliance? The two parties are not in sync,” Congress’s in-charge for Bihar, Bhakta Charan Das, told reporters after landing in Patna.In the 2020 assembly elections, Congress had contested from Kusheshwar Asthan and RJD from Tarapur as part of seat-sharing deal in the grand alliance. Both seats were won by the ruling Janata Dal (United). Das said Congress wants to contest all the 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar in 2024.Asked if Congress would review its stance if RJD approached them to continue in the alliance, Das said, “The high command will take a decision on this.”A few days earlier, leader of opposition in the state Tejashwi Yadav, who is RJD’s de facto leader, had indicated that his party would contest all seats on its own.The simmering tension between the two allies came to a flashpoint recently when RJD also decided to contest from Kusheshwar Asthan, a seat in Darbhanga district which has been a Congress stronghold. Left parties, which are also part of the grand alliance in Bihar, are supporting RJD nominees for bypolls. “We are fighting for self-respect and cannot go on being dictated by others,” said state Congress state spokesperson Anand Madhab. State RJD president Jagdanand Singh said, “Entire Bihar knows we followed the coalition dharma and how our party chief Lalu Prasad sacrificed posts for alliance partners.” Party spokesperson Mirtunjay Tiwary blamed Congress leaders “for this state of affairs”. “They do not know the ground reality in Bihar. And it is because of leaders like Das that Congress has reached such a sorry state,” he said. The Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) took a dig at Congress and called it “a momentary threat”. “They are hurt. It is momentary but they have been humiliated by a regional party,” said BJP spokesperson Dhananjay Giri. The JD (U) called it match fixing. “Once the by-elections are over and results are announced, they will share the dias again and claim that Tejashwi is the leader of GA. This is match fixing,” said JD (U) spokesperson Nikhil Mandal. The opposition’s grand alliance had won 110 seats in the 243-member Bihar assembly in 2020 polls, in which RJD accounts for 75, Congress 19 and Left parties for 16.JAP TO SUPPORT CONGRESSMeanwhile, hours after Das met former Madhepura MP Pappu Yadav in Patna on Friday, the latter announced that his Jan Adhikar Party (JAP) would support Congress. On Thursday, state Congress president Madan Mohan Jha had written a letter to JAP president soliciting his support. “Congress in Bihar is fighting a battle to save the state. It is fighting the battle for farmers and labourers. For this reason, it has been decided to support Congress in the upcoming bypolls,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/have-exited-grand-alliance-in-bihar-cong-101634918924945.html

Raje has not actively participated in party functions in the state including the recently held state BJP executive meeting in Udaipur.Raje told reporters in Jodhpur that people will decide who will be the party’s CM’s face, and asked her supporters to get ready for assembly elections in November-December 2023 and Lok polls in April-May 2024. Raje, who is also BJP vice-president, said, “What people want is more important. One thing needs to be understood that all the communities needed to be loved and only that person will rule in the future, who gets their love in return.”Raje was on a two-day visit to Jodhpur to pay homage to mother of union cabinet minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, who passed away last week, and to former minister and Congress leader Mahipal Maderna, who died on Sunday.On infighting in Congress, she said, “It’s their internal issue but it is a fact that the Congress is a sinking ship.” Interacting with party workers and leaders at Jodhpur circuit house, she asked them to get ready for the next elections. “I have asked all the workers to get ready as the bugle for election in 2023-24 (Assembly and Lok Sabha) has to be blown. I have told them to come out in the field with great strength”, she said. Political analyst Manish Godha said she was a given warm welcome by the workers in Jodhpur and thereafter such a statement is a message to the party that people still love her and she can sway people’s sentiment.

The affidavit states that as the Prison Rules do not permit objectionable, cryptic or suspicious content being written or received through letters, with the exception of letters written to and by the family and lawyers of Dr Teltumbde, all other letters are restricted and hence the petition by Rama Teltumbde, wife of the accused, is without grounds and should be dismissed. Rama Teltumbde has filed a petition in the HC seeking an inquiry into the alleged embargo on her activist husband by the superintendent of Taloja jail from writing letters to his spouse and lawyers. Susan Gonsalves, the wife of another activist Vernon Gonsalves, who is also lodged in Taloja jail, has also filed a similar petition alleging that the letters by him are either withheld or are being posted belatedly. The petitions are being heard by a division bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice Sarang Kotwal. The affidavit by NIA filed by additional SP Anil Kumar Nair stated that the contentions of the petitioners that the communication and letters were completely stopped was ‘untrue and misleading’ as the accused could send and receive letters to family members, subject to their scrutiny. The affidavit further stated that as the petition was not filed by the accused themselves, the rights of the petitioners were not violated and hence the petition was not maintainable. The NIA affidavit further stated that Dr Teltumbde had written letters to a person called Mr Riyaz which contained allegations regarding hatching of conspiracy in connection with Elgar Parishad and the same had resulted in an article which alleged that letters were planted in the computer of another accused Rona Wilson. “The petitioner wants the husband of the petitioner to pass off prohibited material in the nature of the letter,” the affidavit states. The affidavit stated that after repeated requests by the jail authorities to the accused to desist from indulging in restricted activities, the superintendent of the jail had exercised his powers mentioned in the Prison Rules to withhold the incoming and outgoing of letters with objectionable, cryptic or suspicious contents. Seeking dismissal of the petitions, the affidavit stated, “The letters with such objectionable, cryptic or suspicious contents are only withheld and not all the communications made by the petitioner. It is further pertinent to note that letter communication with the family members and the advocates is also allowed and the petitioner is writing letters to the advocate and his family members. Hence the present petition be dismissed with cost.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dr-anand-teltumbde-writing-suspicious-content-in-letters-nia-affidavit-in-hc-101634916102045.html

However, Harshal caught Shahbaz’s hand and pulled him back before he, too, could get swept away,” police sub-inspector Pradeep Gaikwad, Mumbra police station, said.After the parents of the two missing boys approached the police, the investigating team examined CCTV footage, which showed the four boys going towards Retibunder, but only Shahbaz and Harshal were seen returning. The two survivors were subsequently quizzed and they confessed the truth, after which a search operation was mounted on Tuesday morning.The search for Sagar and Saksham entered its fourth day on Friday but still yielded no results. The coordinated search operation is being conducted from morning till sun-down jointly by the police, the Regional Disaster Management Cell of the Thane Municipal Corporation, the Thane Disaster Response Force and local residents.“We have searched the creek all the way till Kasheli, Ghodbunder and Kasar Wadavli but have found nothing yet. On Friday, we conducted the search till 1pm, after which high tide started and we called it off for safety reasons. The search will resume on Saturday,” Gaikwad said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbra-retibunder-incident-third-boy-saved-from-being-swept-away-in-current-101634915866922.html

This came against the backdrop of allegations made by Kirit Somaiya of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), that he (Ajit Pawar) bought the Jarandeshwar sugar mill with the help of shell companies. Without naming Somaiya, Pawar stated that some persons are trying to mislead people by making “baseless” accusations again and again. “People didn’t know the details. Now I have put forward every fact before you. Some mislead people by making false accusations and try to defame and target a person. I have shown the SC order and high court orders on this matter. Many agencies have done inquiries and nothing has been found,” said Ajit Pawar. Earlier in Mumbai, high drama had unfolded on Wednesday at the zonal office of the ED as Kirit Somaiya reached to give additional information against Ajit Pawar. NCP workers had staged a protest. While talking about this issue Pawar had warned on Thursday that he would list out transactions of the other sugar mills in Maharashtra which were sold. Speaking in Pune, Pawar also mentioned that there were some sugar factories which were sold at the a price of Rs3-4 crore. “While selling Jarandeshwar sugar mill, MSCB followed all due procedures. About 12-15 companies had applied in the tendering process. The highest bid was offered by Guru Commodity situated in Mumbai for ₹66 crore, and the mill was sold at this price. Other mills were also purchased by various companies,” said Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/no-irregularities-in-sale-of-sugar-mill-ajit-pawar-101634915622061.html

22-10-2021||Mumbai||Thackeray steps in as greens claim birds & flight safety study at Navi Mumbai International Airport blocked at Panje wetland||Maharashtra Chief Minister, Uddhav Thackeray, has asked the Urban Development department to look into allegations of denotified-Navi Mumbai SEZ (NMSEZ) security preventing a critical research study by the prestigious BNHS on the flights and safety of birds at the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA).Quickly responding to a complaint from NatConnect Foundation seeking his immediate intervention, Thackeray asked Bhushan Gagrani, Principal Secretary – Urban development-1, to look into the issue.“This is a serious study assigned by the city planner and State-government owned CIDCO itself to BNHS, which has reported as early as in 2015 that the wanton destruction of wetlands in the 25km radius of the NMIA project could pose bird-hit dangers for the future flights,” said NatConnect Foundation director, BN Kumar.This danger would increase as the birds could fill the skies in search of roosting and resting grounds when they miss their traditional destinations and even land at the high-ground airport site, the research body said.CIDCO then asked BNHS to do a long-term study on the subject and the ongoing research is focused on Panje Wetland as the nearly 300-hectare contiguous water body attracts thousands of different species 50 varieties such as Lesser Whistling Duck, Ruddy Shelduck Tadorna, Indian Spot-billed Duck and Little Grebe land here.BNHS’s latest report – Coastal Wetlands And Waterbirds Of Navi Mumbai: Current Status –published in 2019 mentions the need to preserve and conserve the five constantly threatened wetlands – Belpada, Bhendkhal, Panje, NRI and TS Chanakya.Though Covid has impacted the study, the researchers who have begun to spring back into action after the easing of lockdown curbs have been physically stopped by the security at Panje wetland, which CIDCO has leased out to the Special Economic Zone, allege the greens.BNHS director, Dr Bivash Pandav, has said in an online discussion hosted by NatConnect Foundation that he was also asked to leave Panje wetland when he went with his teamMedia persons, nature photographers and the local fishing community have also been stopped from entering the wetland by the security and some local vested interests, the mail to Thackeray pointed out.The NMSEZ security cabins at Panje are also illegal and the State Environment Director asked the project CEO and CIDCO to demolish them in November 2020 as the area falls under CRZ-1 category that prohibits any construction. Yet, the cabins are intact and so is the security, Nandkumar Pawar, head of Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan, said.The cabins have come up despite Environment Minister Aditya Thackeray’s order against construction at the wetland. There also has been intermittent landfill at the place. Certain unidentified people set fire crackers to chase away the protected migratory birds, Pawar said.Despite repeated attempts, CIDCO, which has a stake in NMSEZ, refused to comment on the allegations and complaint. There was no response from NMSEZ either. NMSEZ has earlier denied allegations of dumping debris in the area and also stated that Panje is not a wetland but agricultural land leased to it, a fact it said, was confirmed by the state government, which has not included it in its list of wetlands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thackeray-steps-in-as-greens-claim-birds-flight-safety-study-at-navi-mumbai-international-airport-blocked-at-panje-wetland-101634915022470.html

As per the motorist, the streetlights are not working most of the time. They complain that either some are completely off or are blinking.“These lights that are blinking make it difficult to ride. It will also lead to accidents during night hours, especially among senior citizens who ride a bike. The civic body should fix these lights with immediate effect to avoid accidents,” said Rahul Singh, 45, a motorist who takes the Shubhash Chowk bridge connecting Waldhuni in Kalyan (W).These LED lights were installed by the Smart Kalyan Dombivli Corporation Limited (SKDCL) under the smart city project a month ago in several parts of the city, replacing the old street lights in the city.

Those who have not got jabbed took the opportunity to get the jab. Some of the staff as well got the vaccination during the drive. Some colleges are having online exams currently and hence have requested to have the drive there post exams. As per the convenience of the college, they will approach us and we would arrange the session for them,” a medical officer said.Till now 7,25,232 people in the age group of 18 to 45 years have got their first dose and 2,90,240, their second.

One of the deceased has been identified as Santosh Jagtap, a resident of Rahu, while the other man killed has been identified as Swagat Bapu Khaire (24).Police believe an inter-gang rivalry over control of the illegal sand mining trade in the area is the prime reason behind the daylight killings.

Commuters and railway authorities have felt nice to see flower pots on the platforms and appreciated the efforts.Keshav Mahadik, 43, a daily commuter, feels relaxed by watching plants at the station. He said, “Generally, we have seen government bodies planting trees but not maintaining them, as a result the plants look pale and dry. But, as I travel daily from Badlapur to Thane, I have been watching these beautiful plants grow and well-maintained. Recently, I have noticed some flower plants and could not resist praising the railway authorities. They told me about the Care for Nature group that has started this project.”An officer from Thane Railway Station said, “The group is really working hard and inspires us to take care of the plants. So many commuters have told us that they feel fresh and positive by looking at these beautiful plants.”Ulhas Karle, a member of Care for Nature, said, “We have planted trees like Kamini, Nag Champa, Yellomanda, Golden Bamboo, Calathia, and Dracena. Our vice-president, Sachin Tembkar, and other members take care of them once a week as most are young and working.

22-10-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: Enter, The Modern Classic||Cars: how much they define who we are and the times we live in.One of the most powerful symbols of the end of India’s Licence Raj and its voyage into liberalisation in the nineties was when the monotony of our bulbous Ambassadors and boxy Fiats began to make way for other brands on our roads. Maruti-Suzuki, to begin with, and then everything from Hondas to Hyundai’s and Toyotas. Who will believe how thrilling it was to see their many bright colours and multiple shapes dotting our landscape, and how it spoke of newer, bigger horizons in the country’s life? In our own lives too, who can ever forget the excitement of their first car? The thrill of sitting behind its wheel and the heady fragrance of its newness and the possibilities it was offering…Indeed, cars have captured public imagination and played such a significant part in telling the story of who we are and how we live. And at the end of this month, the city will witness one such untold story with the country’s first Modern Classic Rally 2021 at the Sofitel BKC (Bandra-Kurla Complex) in Mumbai where a convoy of Jaguar E-types, Maseratis, a BMW E30 Mercedes-Benz SLs, Ford Mustangs and a few Ferraris will be driven in stately splendour by their proud owners over the Bandra-Worli Sea Link and return to Sofitel BKC where they will be feted and festooned.“What is unique about this rally is that unlike others held in the past, which featured vintage and classic automobiles from the 1930s and 40s, cars which had been the purview of Maharajas and a handful of collectors, this one will feature cars between 10 and 30 years and up to 50 years,” said Perseus Bandrawalla, the moving spirit behind the rally, whose Insta-handle description is ‘Columnist-Autocar & a car nut who loves anything with a motor fitted to it’ and ‘obsessed with modern classics’.According to Bandrawalla, the uniqueness of his upcoming rally is that it will feature exactly the cars that today’s car aficionado grew up ‘lusting after’, the ones their peers were driving, which they grew up around. “This genre of cars is very special to collectors such as Gautam Singhania and Viveck Goenka because these are cars which still drive beautifully but have old world charm, combined with modern breakthroughs. “What’s more, according to him, over the past-half-a-decade, in line with international trends, modern classics have been gaining in popularity in India. Prices of cars such as the Mercedes W123 and the Mazda Miata MX-5, among others, have shot up exponentially. And top restorers in India’s metros are now increasingly working on a number of such examples.“The Modern Classic Rally 2021 is both a reflection of the rising awareness and prominence of these cars among the country’s car enthusiasts and a celebration of their numerous attributes,” he said, adding, “their appeal lies also in their provenance. For instance when I turned 18, and use to drive my grandpa Adi Malgham’s Porsche 944 back in 2002. It was one of the four known Porsches in Mumbai. Today, you can buy almost any sports car or supercar you fancy in India from a showroom in your city. This was not the case even 20 years ago, and only a lucky few could import and own these cars. The limited numbers in which they existed back in the day makes these cars even more special today”.“I guess you can compare a modern classic to your first college crush. When we were in college, Jennifer Aniston was the big name who every boy had a crush on. So today, it doesn’t matter who’s on the current cover of Vogue, for a certain generation, it will always be Aniston. It’s exactly like that. When you can buy the latest Ferrari today, what you want is a Ferrari 355 from 1994. Along with this, modern classic cars are also loved by enthusiasts because they have a sweet blend of old school engineering and (almost) a modern electronic precision. That’s the only explanation I have for the enthusiastic response to them,” says Bandrawalla.*********************************************************************************************And so, like beautiful women who are admired, coveted and adored, the upcoming Modern Classic Rally promises the presence of many such cars, which had once fired up the imagination of some of the city’s most powerful and famous. Cars which had come of age when some of the city’s movers and shakers of today, would have been coming of age themselves. Cars that they acquired and cherished loved and lost, perhaps like much else in their own lives. Cars with riveting back stories: for instance, like the Porsche 993, once owned by the son of a top industrialist fitted with the last air-cool engine that the company had produced and the only one of its kind in India. “I used to photograph it on my way home from college,” Bandrawalla said, adding, “and gaze adoringly at it when it used to be driven to the Willingdon Club. It was subsequently sold, but what’s thrilling is that after making a dozen calls a day, my team and I have zeroed in on the new owner. And it will feature in the rally.”Or take the case of the Dodge Viper that had once belonged to a flashy diamond merchant, according to Bandrawalla an absolutely iconic Modern Classic - it was the largest engine ever to be fitted to a modern car in the nineties. “It was the only one that had come into the country and there was this serious collector – the erstwhile Maharaja of Gondal, someone known to possess a fleet of some of the world’s best cars such as a 300SL and many American supercars, but he absolutely lusted after the Dodge Viper car. And finally, he managed to buy it from the diamond merchant and it will have a pride of place at the rally.”Iconic cars, each with a fascinating provenance. Each with a story tucked in to its taillights, one that speaks of the city and the heady preoccupations and pursuits of its chosen few.Like the BMW that had once been the apple of legendary art collector and ex-sheriff of Mumbai, Jehangir Nicholson’s eye. A car that Bandrawalla said he had tracked as a school boy, dreamt of and coveted, knowing he’d never be able to afford. Until one morning, Hormazd Sorabjee, editor, Autocar India, who also used to covet the car, bought it after Nicholson died and invited Bandrawalla to jointly own and care for it.“I remember collecting the car within a few hours of the phone call and have kept it with me since,” said Bandrawalla. ********************************************************************************************************“There are lots of exciting cars coming. The ones I am looking forward to is the Lamborghini Murcielago which I first drove in 2005, the Honda NSX – a marvel of sports car engineering in its day – and American muscle in the form of the Dodge Viper, Chevy Corvette and Ford Mustangs. Also expected are iconic Porsches, Maseratis, Ferraris owned by several wealthy individuals over the years,” said Sorabjee, who is supporting the rally. “In fact the Toyota Supra we will see at the rally was the iconic one in Fast and Furious. The SL Mercs were again another Hollywood favourite and the Mini was immortalised in the Italian Job. It is certainly a day I’m looking forward to…,” he added.So this October 31, while the world will be celebrating Halloween – a day for bonfires, donning ghoulish costumes, trick-or-treating and honouring the past – here in Mumbai, there will be another kind of honouring and remembrance: when a procession featuring Jaguar E-type, Maseratis, BMWs Mercedes-Benz SLs, Ford Mustangs’, Ferrari 348, among others will roll out of BKC, take in the wide sweep of the sea link, and along the way tell the story of who we were and what we once loved.And who we are, and what we aspire to.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-enter-the-modern-classic-101634908785711.html
22-10-2021||Mumbai||Near 2 century-old Thane Civil Hospital to be converted into multi-speciality hospital||Forty seven-year-old Ganesh Vaze, a resident of Bhiwandi village, could not afford treatment at a private hospital for a leg injury. He went to the Civil Hospital in Thane but all the beds were occupied in June due to the spike in Covid cases and other monsoon-related illnesses within the district. Vaze then headed to Mumbai for treatment. However, it was difficult for his family members to stay with him or provide support throughout as it was very far from their home.With hardly 300 beds, Thane Civil Hospital caters to the entire rural population and those who cannot afford in the urban areas of Thane district. Like Vaze, there are many who are keen on getting better facilities and additional beds within the hospital.Plans to convert the more than 180-year-old hospital into a multi-specialty hospital are under way. Meanwhile, a two storied structure near the Mental Hospital, near Teen Haath Naka , has been set up where the maternity and paediatric ward will be shifted from the Civil Hospital while it is under renovation.“We have some last-minute fittings and fire safety-related measures that are under way at the new structure, as of now. Once we get a go ahead from the fire department, we shall start the hospital. It is expected soon after Diwali,” said Kailas Pawar, civil surgeon, Thane Civil Hospital.This move will be a welcome relief for the locals within Thane district as the new hospital’s capacity will be triple the current size.A two-storey structure has been converted into a special maternity and paediatric ward with NICU facilities as well near the Mental Hospital in Teen Haath Naka, Thane This structure will be converted into a special women and children’s facility once the Civil Hospital is revamped completely.“Currently, we will only start with shifting the women and paediatric ward at the additional structure. It also has a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and nutritional rehabilitation centre for malnourished children. The Covid and emergency wards will continue to be at the existing Civil Hospital. Once the renovation of the hospital begins, based on the pandemic situation, we shall take a call regarding the Covid facility,” added Pawar.“There is no such provision in the rural areas, the only affordable option is to come to this civil hospital. But the number of beds available here is not sufficient for the number of people that visit on a daily basis. Anytime we have visited the hospital for our family members or neighbours in the villages we have noticed the long waiting period and difficulty to get beds. Although treatment and immediate medical provisions are available, getting a bed becomes difficult,” added Vaze.The Civil Hospital is a stone structure built during the British era in 1835. The British used it as a medical facility and it has continued to serve patients in Thane and nearby areas all these years. After renovation, the Civil Hospital will include 900 beds – 500 for general patients, 200 for women and children, and 200 super speciality beds. It also includes a solar system, rainwater harvesting, garden and sewage treatment plant. The structure has been facing maintenance-related issues time and again.In 2017, the plan of a multi-speciality hospital was sanctioned but as the funds were not sufficient, the project was not taken further. In 2019, ₹314Cr fund was sanctioned for the project. Last week, the State health department approved the upgradation plan of the Civil Hospital at ₹500Cr. Initially, it was supposed to have 574 beds but in a Government Resolution, permission to increase it by including another 326 beds was given, taking it to 900 beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/near-2-century-old-thane-civil-hospital-to-be-converted-into-multi-speciality-hospital-101634908784305.html

Priyanka had earlier also announced that the Congress will give 40% reservation to women in the allocation of party tickets for the 2022 assembly election. Mayawati termed the Congress’s poll promises an electoral gimmick.In a series of tweets in Hindi, the BSP president said, “The Congress has started making various kinds of lucrative promises, like the BJP and SP, as part of an electoral gimmick under which this party has talked about giving smartphones and scooty to girl students if their government is formed in Uttar Pradesh, but the basic question is who can trust them and how.”Mayawati also said, “The Congress has its governments in Rajasthan and Punjab. Have they done something like this there so that people could believe them? If not, then how can people believe them? This is the reason why there is a severe lack of public confidence in the claims and promises of parties like the Congress and BJP.”She also said the Congress is facing “bad days” due to “non-fulfilment” of poll promises in the past and the BJP could also face the same fate as that of the Congress due to its alleged failure to fulfil promises made to the people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mayawati-attacks-congress-over-poll-promises-101634908662644.html

Arun's brother-in-law is not even able to walk properly. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot today listened to them and spoke to SP Bharatpur," Garg said.“The chief minister has assured them all assistance,” he added.Congress stands with the victim’s family, he said.AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had met Valmiki’s family in Agra on Wednesday.Valmiki, a sanitation worker, was accused of stealing ₹25 lakh from the storage room of Jagdishpura Police Station in Agra on Saturday night.He allegedly fell sick and died during a raid on Tuesday at his house in Agra that police conducted to recover the stolen money.

22-10-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka CM says Siddaramaiah of misled people on 17 lakh EWS houses||Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Friday accused former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah of misleading people by saying that 17 lakh houses were built for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) during his tenure. "Siddaramaiah has given a statement that he gave away 17 lakh houses when he was the chief minister. The fact is that he had only sanctioned 15 lakh houses on paper whereas he should have allocated funds too," Bommai told reporters in Hanagal. Bommai was in Hanagal, his home district, to campaign for the BJP candidate Shivaraj Sajjanar contesting the Hanagal assembly bypoll. "It is not a great achievement to sanction 15 lakh houses three months ahead of elections. If he had sanctioned it at the beginning of his tenure and completed it then it was a feat. Siddaramaiah is misleading people," Bommai said. The Chief Minister said he has sanctioned four lakh houses in rural areas and one lakh in the urban areas since he took over and now the process to identify the beneficiaries has begun. Also, at an election rally in Hanagal, Bommai alleged that Siddaramaiah's claim of giving rice under the 'Anna Bhagya' scheme could happen due to the subsidy provided by the Centre. He also said giving rice at subsidised rate has been going on since independence and there was nothing new about it. Meanwhile, Siddaramaiah challenged Bommai to come for a debate in public on the issue of development of Hanagal and questioned his ability to be the Chief Minister of the state. "The Nellur lake bund got damaged in 2018. If the tank bund could not be repaired in the past four years, then the people of this region will decide whether you are capable or incapable of becoming chief minister," Siddaramaiah said during an election rally in Hanagal. "I call upon Bommai to come to a common platform where we can debate before people what we have done under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme," the senior congress leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-cm-says-siddaramaiah-of-misled-people-on-17-lakh-ews-houses-101634904210331.html
22-10-2021||Mumbai||Despite job losses, salary cuts, Dombivli residents contribute for Diwali sweets for soldiers||Despite losing jobs or facing salary cuts, several Dombivli residents have come together to send sweets to more than 8,000 soldiers stationed at different borders of the country this Diwali. These residents are sending the goodies through several NGOs like Hindu Nav Varsh Swagat Samiti, Bharat Vikas Parishad and Sadguru Pratishthan among others.Some of these NGOS regularly have been sending Diwali sweets to soldiers for many years. However, owing to the lockdown, they were not sure if people would be willing to come forward and help. However, more than 80% of the people who regularly contribute including those who lost jobs and had to take up alternate professions or business during the pandemic have readily agreed.Kunal Sutavane, one of the organisers, said, “Every year, we send Faral, a collection of savouries and sweets, with some useful gifts to more than 8,000 Army personnel. We take permission from different places where our friends and family members are posted in the army like Jammu, Leh, Imphal, Jorhat, Shillong, Tawang and Udhampur borders. This time, we were not expecting any help from people but we have achieved 80% of the target because of the donations we have received. We know people who have suffered a lot last year but still many have saved money and contributed for this project.”Chinmay Ghokle, a 38-year-old priest from Dombivli, was unable to earn enough as temples were closed and people no longer called them home to perform pujas. “I stay with my mother and am not getting any appointments to perform any religious function. I started some freelance work and started saving a small amount every month. I decided to donate ₹5,000 from my savings for the army as, despite the pandemic, they are protecting us at the borders.”Darshna Koli, a 41-year-old professor who lost her job, started a home-cooked meal service. She has saved a share of her profit to contribute to this initiative. Koli said, “I cannot even go in cold weather due to several health issues and I protected my children from the same. I thought about how those soldiers who are also children to their parents stand in cold weather for us. We are going out now and having fun with family and friends but tension at the border is still there. We all should contribute to them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/despite-job-losses-salary-cuts-dombivli-residents-contribute-for-diwali-sweets-for-soldiers-101634905481556.html

However with less number of admissions, the deadline for admission to several courses across departments has been extended.Rajesh Raherkar, SPPU assistant registrar (admissions), said, “Currently, the admission process for all courses available with the SPPU which include postgraduate, certificate and diploma courses, is underway. For some of the courses, the admission process has been completed while for others, we have given extensions due to less number of admissions. There are a total 6,500 seats available for 200 different courses, out of which 4,300 admissions have been completed.”“The response to the science and humanities stream is good compared to other streams. The pandemic has certainly impacted the admission process as students from rural areas have not come forward to take admissions this year,” Raherkar said.While admissions to the SPPU’s postgraduate, diploma and certificate courses began a few months ago, the process has been adversely affected due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The university campus has still not reopened due to which students are unable to visit the campus and get their admission-related queries resolved. Tushar Badare, a student from Nanded said, “I had applied for the postgraduate Master of Arts (MA) course and wanted to specialise in History. However as the college and university have not yet reopened, I haven’t confirmed my admission. I will now visit Pune and complete my admission process as the university and offline lectures are set to begin.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sppu-admissions-impacted-by-pandemic-extensions-for-some-courses-101634903501411.html
22-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjabi in Punjab schools: Rhetoric versus reality||The recent decision of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) to relegate Punjabi to the status of a minor subject, from its previous status of a major subject, has triggered a controversy on what is potentially an emotive issue. Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and two of his cabinet ministers, including education minister Pargat Singh, have unequivocally condemned this decision as a manifestation of the central government’s general policy to encroach upon the constitutional space of the states, in what is supposed to be a federal polity. While the CBSE has been at pains to explain that this is merely an administrative decision, based on the number of students opting for a particular language/subject, eminent citizens, including educationists, former administrators and even NRIs, have expressed an opinion that this decision, whether by accident or by design, shall further whittle down the importance of Punjabi in the country, particularly in Punjab. Medium of instruction In this context, many of the participants in this lively debate have missed out on the provisions of the Punjab Learning of Punjabi and Other Languages Act, 2008. This enactment, which was approved unanimously by the Punjab Vidhan Sabha during the tenure of the Parkash Singh Badal Government, in which the BJP was an active ally, makes teaching of Punjabi compulsory in all schools in the state from Classes 1 to 10. This law makes it mandatory for all schools to teach Hindi from Classes 3 to 8. The enactment makes it clear that there shall be no bar in teaching English in the school, notwithstanding the provisions pertaining to Punjabi and Hindi. The Act is, however, silent on the medium of instruction. Legal experts, including education administrators, have rushed to point out that education being a concurrent list subject, a Punjab law cannot operate to impose its will on the CBSE, a statutory body of the central government. It is, however, submitted that this law does not prima facie offend provisions of any central law. The definition of school, under this 2008 law, is wide enough to include schools run by societies and trusts. It thus applies equally to schools affiliated with CBSE/ICSE Boards, since all of them are required to have a non-proprietary legal structure, such as a society/trust. Contentious section Nevertheless, Section 3 (2) is slightly contentious. It states: “No board or institution shall award matriculation certificate to any student, unless he has passed the Tenth Class examination in Punjabi subject.” Does this effectively mean that the CBSE shall not be able to issue a matriculation certificate, in respect of students of schools situated in Punjab, unless they have Punjabi as one of the subjects at the Class 10 level? While the teaching of Punjabi has been made mandatory up to Class 10, the basic question arises is whether the students can opt for either Hindi or Punjabi as one of the languages, in addition to the compulsory English, in Classes 9 and 10. This is to be seen in the context that the regulation of the CBSE, statutory in nature, will evidently provide so. In my opinion, Section 3(2) cannot be read to invalidate a matriculation certificate issued by the CBSE/ICSE, merely on the ground that Punjabi was not taken as one of the subjects in the Class 10 board exam. This is so because Section 3(2) would run counter to the statutory regulation of the CBSE and hence would effectively be inoperative, since the conflict of the Punjab law is essentially in conflict with a central law on education, a concurrent list subject. A harmonious interpretation would mean that while teaching of Punjabi in all schools in Punjab, including those affiliated with CBSE/ICSE Boards, is mandatory up to Class 10, it is purely the choice of the student whether he/she opts for Punjabi or Hindi as an elective subject in Classes 9 and 10, or even both. Section 7 of this Act allows the government to exempt a class or category of students, but not schools, from any of the provisions of this law. Thus, foreign nationals or children of defence personnel and other officers, who are liable to be transferred all over the country, may be exempted from learning Punjabi. The enactment also provides an increasing amount of civil penalty that can be imposed on the schools that are not complying with the law. It, however, stops short of criminal prosecution. Ninth most widely spoken language The promotion of Punjabi within and outside Punjab will require interventions much beyond merely a state legislation. NGOs, in particular organisations such as the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) and Chief Khalsa Diwan, must contribute their might and to encourage reading, writing and speaking of Punjabi. Punjabi University, Patiala, which was set up in 1961, essentially to promote Punjabi as a language will also need to refocus and reorient its priorities. The mother tongue in general, and Punjabi in particular, is an emotive issue and even Punjabi-speaking population across the border has been increasingly vociferous, seeking reintroduction of this language, though in “shahmukhi” script, as an official language in West Punjab, instead of Urdu. In a scenario where about 93 million people across the globe have Punjabi as their mother tongue, it being the ninth most widely spoken language, we as a nation cannot afford to allow Punjabi language to become a bone of contention in the border state of Punjab, which can easily snowball into something far more serious. Statesmanship, not politics, is required at this stage. kbs.sidhu@gmail.com The writer is a retired Punjab-cadre IAS officer.

22-10-2021||Patna||Have exited Bihar grand alliance, says Cong; RJD hits back with a reality check||PATNA: Barely a week before the by-polls and amidst the ongoing tussle between the Congress and the RJD, a senior Congress leader on Friday announced that the party has exited the Rashtriya Janata Dal-led grand alliance in the state and wants field candidates on all 40 Lok Sabha seats in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.“We are not in Mahaghatbandhan (grand alliance) in Bihar. A decision to this effect was taken after October 16 after what happened at Kusheshwarsthan which was snatched from us. What is the use of having such an alliance? The thought procedures of the two parties are not in sync,” Congress in-charge for Bihar Bhakta Charan Das told reporters after landing in Patna on Friday.Das added that Congress wants to contest all the 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar in 2024 on its own.Asked if the Congress could review its stance if the RJD approach them to continue the alliance, Das said, “The high command will take a call on this.”Das’ sharp comments come a few days after RJD leaders such as Mritunjay Tiwary also indicated that the RJD will contest all seats on its own.Das has met Jan Adhikar Party (JAP) leader Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav and solicited his party’s support.Pappu Yadav , the national president of the Jan Adhikar Party (JAP), responded promptly, announcing at a Press conference that his party will support the Congress in the October 30 by-elections. He said the Congress in Bihar is fighting the battle to save Bihar and the battle for farmers and labourers. “For this reason, to save Bihar, it has been decided to support the Congress party in the upcoming by-election,” he said.The discord in the grand alliance came to the fore recently when the Congress sought to field its candidate for the Kusheshwarsthan bypoll - it was given this seat as part of the seat-sharing pact for the 2020 assembly elections and lost. But the RJD went ahead to field its candidates from the two seats, Kusheshwarsthan and Tarapur. Upset, the Congress also fielded its candidates from both the seats. The Left parties, which are part of the grand alliance in Bihar, are supporting the RJD nominees from both, Kusheshwarstahn and Tarapur. “We are fighting for self-respect and cannot go on being dictated by others,” said Congress state spokesperson Anand Madhab. The RJD has reacted strongly to Congress leader Bhakta Charan Das swipe.“Entire Bihar knows that we followed the coalition dharma and how Lalu Prasad sacrificed posts for alliance partners,” said RJD state president Jagdanand Singh.Party spokesperson Mirtunjay Tiwary blamed Congress leaders “for this state of affairs”. “The Congress leaders do not know the ground reality in Bihar. And it is because of leaders such as Das that the Congress has reached such a sorry state,” said Tiwary. The ruling BJP took a dig at the Congress and called it “a momentary threat”. “They are hurt. It is momentary but they have been humiliated by a regional party,” said BJP spokesperson Dhanjay Giri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/have-exited-bihar-grand-alliance-says-cong-rjd-hits-back-with-a-reality-check-101634902961263.html

22-10-2021||Pune||Global Village Idiot: Importance of mundane information to being human||Growing up in the 1970s, I had a very open and intimate relationship with the world. Pawan Gandhi lived a few buildings from our building. We used to go to school together, play together, fight and spin yarns together. The Sethi, Bhosale, Mehra and Nayak families were in our building. The Kapoor, Vendantham, Kumar, Patni, Swarup and Bansal families were in the building opposite ours. The Santhanams were in the building at the end of our row. Ruel Rebecca Raymond lived in the row of buildings behind our row. (He was the fastest bowler in the colony and everybody wanted him in their team). I knew the building and flat numbers of each of these families and I leapt up and downstairs (two, sometimes three stairs at a time) and ran up and down the alleys between buildings to meet my friends around our LIC colony in Santacruz West, Mumbai (then Bombay).Ground floor flats had the advantage of being able to plant some vegetables and while anyone could enjoy the papaya from the trees that grew wild and abundantly, I have fond memories of plucking seasonal pumpkin flowers from wild pumpkins that grew here and there - I had mentioned seeing the pumpkin patches and my parents had informed me that we could make delicious “pakodas” with pumpkin flowers.I went to St Joseph’s school in Juhu and took bus number 339 to get there from Santacruz depot. We used to pass Amitabh Bachchan’s bungalow twice every day since the house was one stop away from school. I often walked into Juhu church (which was attached to the school) drawn by the choir. It was at school that I met Joseph D’Souza, Leah Fernandes, Abbas and Nishrin Neemuchwala, Lazarian D’Souza, Altaf Daruwala and Siraj Dhanani, among many others. (Pawan and other children from our colony also went to St Joseph’s school in Juhu). I knew the addresses and bus routes to all my friends’ houses by heart, which means I never wrote it down nor had to look it up. Given that my friend circle was around 40 kids - approximately half of them out of the colony - I carried a good bit of information in my head.We also had a vast family and friends circle across India - Varanasi, Delhi, Shimla, Bhopal, Chandigarh, Calcutta, Lucknow, Asansol, Siliguri, Gangtok, Haridwar, Guwahati, Chennai, Bengaluru, Jalandhar, to name a few places. I wrote regular letters which meant I remembered all the postal addresses and knew the location of the cities on a physical map and also how to get to their houses from the railway station - I used to get the route description from my cousins and friends when we met during holidays or weddings, which was maybe once in two years. So we listened and committed that information to memory as a routine task without any effort.In 1984 we shifted to Delhi for three years and that was a whole different world of relationships, school, sports, bus routes. A couple of weeks ago, my childhood friend, Vineet Sharma posted a photo of an old DTC (Delhi Transport Corporation) double-decker bus on the school group. Within moments classmates like Anand, Shashikant, Anurodh, Ghosh, Rajesh and Khurana responded, guessing the bus depot. Places were named and buses were numbered and soon enough we started retracing routes from our school in Raja Bazaar and from the bus depots at Madras Hotel and C-Sec (Central Secretariat) to everyone’s house and in particular to Patel Nagar, which is where Ghosh used to live. We were able to recall many of the regular routes we frequented, the bus stops en route and conversation even veered towards Scindia House where we got bus passes for ₹12.50.For the latter half of our stay in Delhi, I used to take bus number 960 to school. The bus started at Sayyed Gaon, literally one of the last villages then on the outskirts of Delhi, near the border with Haryana. That’s where we had our house in a colony of little houses owned by LIC employees who saved and saved and saved and then built their little dream house. And guess who we met there? The Bansals (from our Bombay LIC colony).In 1987 we returned to Mumbai and I reconnected with old friends and made new ones in junior college. Sometime in 1990, we got our first telephone and so I had to create new methods to remember and retrieve numeric info. But I had to wait for a couple of years when I went to Bengaluru for work and then to Delhi and Shimla and finally to Pune (1996) to use my new method of remembering phone numbers.Pune opened a new world to me, a world I had never before seen in a city, one of the peaceful walks. I walked from Parvati to FC Road and from FC Road to Agricultural College and from there to Pune University and back. I remembered all the gullies and bylanes between Bhandarkar road and Prabhat road (where my journalism classmate and guardian angel Sanjay Pendse still lives) and between FC and Gole and Apte roads. Later, I shifted to Saifee Lane in Camp and walked all around and all about and by 1997, I generally had a proper map of Pune from Camp to Paud road - you could wake me up in the middle of the night and I could tell you where to take a right turn to get “black daal” or left turn to the freshly simmered “Amruttulya chaha.”Then I got my first mobile phone. And for the next decade, I used to know every phone number I required of family, friends, colleagues, clients, associates, doctors, and important contacts. All the numbers I regularly used. At one point it was close to a hundred and thirty numbers. I had perfected my original method and added a musical pattern by which I remembered numbers and names and addresses and routes.Somewhere around 2011, I walked into the age of smartphones, and since then I have struggled to maintain my habit of dialling numbers or visualising addresses. I now have more than 3,000 contacts across the world and since people keep changing numbers, it kind of became a thankless exercise remembering them: I can recall less than 30 numbers today.Routes I still visualise and remember vividly. I make it a point to associate people and names and how and when I interacted with them. But technology is rapidly making itself so useful that tech companies and governments may eventually win the battle to make me useless for the very thing that used to make me human: thinking. Memory is a critical component of the thinking process. If you don’t practice thinking you can’t organise data, which means you can’t recall it. If you can’t recall it, you can’t build associations.If you can’t build associations you can’t be comfortable in your environs. If you aren’t comfortable in your environment, you’ll withdraw and isolate yourself in memories of eras gone by and then become alienated from the current world.Pawan and I are still in regular touch. He’s in Singapore and on the cutting-edge of AI and ML tech. I like talking to him because he’s still connected to the human experience and with every conversation, I learn a lot. It’s a rapidly changing world, but all that it means is that I have to work harder to stay active and aware, and consciously change to adapt to the emerging world and practice being myself.And make new associations and new routes to learning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/global-village-idiot-importance-of-mundane-information-to-being-human-101634899360877.html
22-10-2021||Mumbai||Kalyan Dombivli civic body to identify garbage vulnerable points, clear them permanently||The Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) has decided to identify garbage vulnerable points in its vicinity and permanently clear such points in the coming days to keep the streets in the city clean.For the first time, the civic body will also involve civic teachers to work on these points and help clear them. As per the civic body, around 150 civic teachers have agreed to do the job.“Once we identify the points, the health inspectors and teachers will find out the source of garbage dumping at that particular point and further ensure that all measures are taken to clear the point of garbage dumping activity permanently,” said Ramdas Kokre, deputy commissioner, KDMC.A health inspector will work at two garbage vulnerable points while a teacher will look after one such point. “Teachers have the ability to learn and teach others. They can educate people in every way once they find the source of the garbage dumping at a particular point. Teachers will be a great help to keep the city clean,” added Kokre.A special cleanliness drive will be observed in the city between October 25 and 31 for which the KDMC chief, Vijay Suryavanshi, has asked the civic officials to gear up and work towards it.Residents of KDMC have been complaining about several roads having garbage dumped on a regular basis. Recently, residents of Forest Society near Milind Nagar in Kalyan (W) complained of garbage dumped in their area leading to foul smell that made it difficult for them to breathe. The residents also took to social media to highlight the same.“The garbage dumped in the area is not cleared for several days and it leads to a very stinky environment. It is very difficult to breathe also. It is a residential area and there is poor waste management by the civic body. Even if the garbage vehicles come, they don’t lift all the garbage and leave some behind,” said Nandkumar Pol, a 68-year-old resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kalyan-dombivli-civic-body-to-identify-garbage-vulnerable-points-clear-them-permanently-101634898827034.html

The bench has sought response from the Union health ministry and a city school as well.Also Read | Delhi: Education dept asks govt school teachers to get vaccine shots by October 15Justice Rekha Palli directed the respondents to reply on a plea filed by a teacher at the school. In his plea, the petitioner argued that since allopathic treatment taken by him to cure a hand disorder led to impotency, he should not be “forced” by the respondents to get vaccinated against Covid-19. Additionally, he sought quashing of a circular dated August 9, and two circulars dated September 29--all published by the Directorate of Education (DoE) of the Delhi government--thus declaring them “illegal,” “arbitrary” and “not in consonance with the Constitution of India.”Also informing the court that he contracted the viral illness at the peak of the second wave, in April, the petitioner sought a compensation of ₹10 lakh for the “mental harassment” meted out to him.The circulars issued on September 29 make it mandatory for teachers to get inoculated against Covid-19, or be disallowed from attending schools. Also, as per the order, teachers’ absence will be treated as them being “on leave.”The directions were issued in the wake of the reopening of schools in the city, with physical lectures resuming for those in classes 9-12 from September 1. A decision on the resumption of schools for other classes was expected after Dussehra, which was observed on October 15.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/forced-vaccination-hc-seeks-response-from-delhi-govt-education-department-on-order-101634897688394.html

22-10-2021||Lucknow||Through Mahila Mates, UP aims to better women’s participation in MGNREGS||Uttar Pradesh took a significant step to amend its standing of being among the worst-performing states with respect to women’s participation in the Mahatama Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). The UP rural development department, aiming for higher women’s participation in MGNREGS, has trained 18,000 Mahila Mates and deployed 3,010 on job sites, data shows. Mahila Mates are women assistants for management and supervision of MGNREGS jobs and job sites.So, how is UP the worst performer? And how would Mahila Mates make a difference?During the Covid-19 pandemic in 2019-20, Uttar Pradesh employed a whopping 1.11 crore people under the MGNREGA, but the workforce was male-dominated.“The state generated only 32.52% of women person-days of the 30.55 crore person-days of work generated in the year. At the 28th position, UP was the lowest in the country with only Jammu and Kashmir and Lakshadweep ranking lower on the women’s employment index under the MGNREGS. But then we decided to bring in a change. Mahila Mates was one of the top ideas for this,” said Yogesh Kumar, additional commissioner, MGNREGS, Uttar Pradesh.In March, the rural development department announced that it will appoint Mahila Mates on job sites. By June, the appointment process was completed. Till now 18,000 Mahila Mates who were selected have been trained. Of these, 3,010 have begun working on their respective job sites.“We believe that the Mahila Mate concept will go a long way in increasing women’s participation in the rural employment scheme. First of all, these 18,000 Mahila Mates are getting direct employment in the scheme. Secondly, once the women in villages know that job sites are being managed by women, it will inspire women in villages to opt for work under the scheme because job sites headed by women will change the social structure of a job site and address the hesitancy among prospective women workers. We had observed that men-dominated worksites do make women shy from participating in work even if they wanted to,” he said.He said that apart from Mahila Mates, the department is also introducing a few more women-friendly factors in MGNREGS such as creating all-women worksites and women-specific work projects.The rural development department had ordered that all job sites with less than 40 workers will have a Mahila Mate to supervise the site and work there. Sites with more than 40 workers will have two Mahila Mates.To make the appointment fast and smooth, the department had selected the Mahila Mates from existing women SHGs (self-help groups) in the panchayats.Kerala, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu were the top-ranking states offering women work under MGNREGS with 91.41%, 87.04%, and 84.88% women person-days respectively last year.During these times of pandemic, with a focus on employment generation under MGNREGS, UP registered a whopping 87% increase in person-days generated in 2019-20 against the previous year. But women’s share remained unchanged in the last five years.“Yes, over the last five years, women’s participation in the MGNREGS has consistently been low and lower than the national average in UP,” said Yogesh Kumar.The national average in 2019-20 had been 52% women person-days, UP’s was 32.52%. “Now we aim to take it above 38%,” said Kumar.He said, “Socio-cultural set-up and physical intensive works are inhibiting factors behind the low participation. Women do not like to work at male-dominated worksites and on physically gruelling jobs. So, we have decided to introduce all-women worksites and women-specific works, such as plantation, gardening, nutrition gardens, nurseries or organic cultivations.”All the Mahila Mates that were selected have been trained in how to do their work- making muster roll, record attendance, making a layout for work, measuring of work done, or how to update the work demand, and how to encourage women to work. Women Mates will also have to arrange for amenities such as drinking water, shed at job sites for workers. They will get ₹290 to ₹370 wages per workday depending upon which PWD (public works department) wage circle their village falls under. On looking to increase women employment under MGNREGS, Yogesh Kumar said, “the aim is to take women participation under the scheme over 38%. Economic empowerment of women also leads to an automatic change in basic indicators of development. When money comes in the hands of women, a family’s undergoes improvements in education, health and nutrition, and sanitation.”The department will also promote horticulture, floriculture, vegetable cultivation, animal husbandry, and fisheries under convergence of MGNREGS and the rural livelihood mission as these jobs are not as physically intensive and also interest women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/through-mahila-mates-up-aims-to-better-women-s-participation-in-mgnregs-101634884120947.html

Chetan Bragta had rebelled after the party chose Neelam Saraik as it nominee and is contesting the byelection as an independent candidate. The denial of ticket also triggered a rebellion in party and the entire Jubbal-Kotkhai unit had resigned. The other leaders expelled include Yashveer Justa, state executive member; Ankush Chauhan, district president Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), Mahasu; Sushil Kadsholi, district BJYM general secretary, Mahasu; Sandeep Gangta, state executive member, BJYM; Ravinder Chauhan, special invitee member, Mahasu; and Ashok Justa, vice-president, Jubbal-Kotkhai block BJP.

22-10-2021||Other||Sub-judge convicted of raping, cheating woman in Jammu||A fast-track court in Jammu on Thursday convicted suspended sub-judge Rakesh Kumar Abrol of raping and cheating a woman, who sought his legal help in 2018.“There is a complete chain of events and facts to indicate that within all human probability the crime was committed by the accused and all the circumstances brought on record and established are consistent with the guilt of the accused and inconsistent with his innocence,” said the court, which is expected to pronounce the quantum of sentence on Saturday.“Persons of influence, keeping in view their reach, impact, and authority they wield on the general public or the specific class to which they belong owe a duty and have to be more responsible they are expected to know and perceive the meaning of authority and law with experience and knowledge. It is reasonable to hold that they would be careful in their lives...”The prosecution said the woman met Abrol in connection with the case. Abrol promised her legal help and asked her to work as his domestic help. He also promised her better education for her daughter and ₹5,000 as salary, the prosecution added. After some time, the woman’s parents asked her to return home. The prosecution said as soon as Abrol, who had parted with his wife and lived alone for seven years, got to know she was planning to leave his home, he requested her not to leave. He told her she is his wife now after smearing her head with vermilion powder. Abrol planned to solemnise the marriage with her but a year later married another woman after divorcing his first wife.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/subjudge-convicted-of-raping-cheating-woman-101634880460409.html
22-10-2021||Delhi||Clear weather, moderate air quality in store for Delhi on Friday||Delhi is likely to see a clear sky on Friday as per the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast. The minimum temperature on Friday is likely to be at 16 degrees Celsius while the maximum temperature is predicted to reach 32 degrees Celsius.The maximum temperature on Thursday was 32.4 degrees Celsius and the minimum was 16 degrees Celsius.Delhi’s air quality was in the moderate category on Friday morning. Data from the Central Pollution Control Board showed that the hourly air quality index (AQI) at 7 am stood at 192. On Thursday, the average 24-hour AQI was 199.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.On Thursday, the Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) said, “Delhi’s AQI is in the moderate category. As per SAFAR methodology, effective fire counts are 1234 and its share is 15% in Delhi’s PM2.5 as transport-level winds are favourable for intrusion. However, local winds are moderate which enhances dispersion of pollutants keeping AQI in the moderate category. The share of fire emissions is expected to increase in the next 2 days. In presence of local dry weather and north-westerly wind local dust emission leads to an increase of PM10. Additional dust input from desert areas via transport is very likely. The overall AQI is likely to degrade to poor in next 2 days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/clear-weather-moderate-air-quality-in-store-for-delhi-on-friday-101634875480768.html

The drive will be undertaken for 10 days, from October 25 to November 3.“We are proud to be a major contributor in the achievement of the one-billion mark. We are lagging behind UP in overall inoculation because the northern state was provided with more doses on the basis of their population,” the minister said.Meanwhile, Maharashtra recorded 1,573 fresh infections, pushing the count to 6,598,218 on Thursday. The tally of active cases further reduced to 24,292 as 2,968 recoveries were reported in the past 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-tops-with-highest-number-of-fully-covid-19-vaccinated-population-101634872659220.html

22-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cinema halls, auditoriums, amusement parks to reopen today; check SOPs||In view of the easing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) situation in Mumbai, the city's civic body – the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) – has allowed cinema halls, drama theatres, and auditoriums, to reopen from Friday, albeit with pandemic-necessitated protocols like the mandatory use of face masks and social distancing.In three separate orders, the BMC issued earlier this week the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the reopening of these establishments that are set to gradually bring the city's entertainment and cultural landscape back on track after a prolonged period of closure due to the infectious disease. The Maharashtra government has also allowed amusement parks to reopen ‘dry’ (without any water rides) from today.Also Read | Mumbai airport handles 91,904 fliers in a day, a Covid-19 pandemic recordThe BMC said its SOPs will be applicable to only those cinema halls, drama theatres, and auditoriums in Mumbai which fall under its civic jurisdiction. Last week, the Maharashtra government had issued broader, state-wide orders detailing the SOPs for all such establishments that can operate at 50 per cent of their audience capacity.Now, in addition to the measures announced by the state government, the establishments falling under the BMC's jurisdiction will have to abide by the SOPs issued by the civic body, which include the mask mandate and social distancing norms.Covid-19 protocols for cinema hallsAccording to the new SOPs, show timings in cinema halls will have to be “staggered” and the sale of only packaged food and beverages is allowed. However, these food items can at no point be taken inside the screening auditorium, where cinema-goers will be required to put their face masks up at all times.Hand sanitisers should also be made available, both inside the hall as well as in each of the washrooms. Spitting will not be allowed anywhere on the premises and thermal check-ups will be mandatory at entry points. Moreover, according to the SOPs, air-conditioning temperatures inside the cinema halls should be fixed between 24-30 degrees Celsius.Movie-goers should be vaccinated against Covid-19 with at least the primary dose, or their health status on the Aarogya Setu app must show “safe”, the SOPs detailed. All staff, including the workers at the food court and those involved with housekeeping, shall, however, need to be vaccinated with both doses of the Covid-19 shot, and at least 14 days must have passed since the second dose.Amusement parks to reopen ‘dry’Although amusement parks in Mumbai are also set to reopen from Friday, no ‘water rides’ shall be allowed in view of the pandemic situation.The decision was taken at a meeting of the Covid-19 task force, chaired by Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, on Monday. “We are slowly relaxing the restrictions and the number of patients seems to be decreasing,” Thackeray told reporters after the meeting. “There is also a constant demand to extend the working hours of restaurants and shops.”Earlier in the day, the chief minister met representatives of the Cinema Owners and Exhibitors Association in Mumbai and said theatres and cinema halls should constitute proper fire and structural safety checks ahead of their reopening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-cinema-halls-auditoriums-amusement-parks-to-reopen-today-check-sops-101634859835934.html
22-10-2021||Delhi||Pollution levels dip slightly as winds over Delhi pick up pace||Delhi’s air quality improved slightly as winds picked up on Thursday, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings showed, and scientists separately predicted that emissions from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana are unlikely to pose a threat immediately.CPCB data showed that the overall air quality index (AQI) on Thursday was 199, in the ‘moderate’ category and a marginal improvement from Wednesday’s 221.Union ministry of earth science’ air quality monitoring centre’s System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar) showed that 1,234 farm fires were seen in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana through satellites on Thursday, which contributed to nearly 15% of the city’s PM 2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) levels.While this was higher than Wednesday’s 12%, the pollution levels were lower because of the relatively higher local wind speeds.“Local winds are moderate that enhances dispersion of pollutants keeping AQI in moderate category. Share of fire emissions is expected to increase in next two days. In presence of local dry weather and north-westerly wind local dust emission leads to increase of PM10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres). The overall AQI is likely to degrade to poor in next two days,” the Safar air quality analysis read.Senior scientists from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that under the impact of a western disturbance, there is a possibility of cloudy skies coupled with isolated rain in some areas between October 23 and October 24. The western disturbance will also be marked by a slight increase in the temperatures in Delhi on October 22.On Thursday, the maximum temperature at the Safdarjung weather station, which provides representational data for the entire city, was 32.4 degrees Celsius. The minimum was 16 degrees Celsius, two degrees below what is considered normal for this time of the year. The maximum temperature at the Palam observatory was 32 degrees Celsius, a notch below normal, while the minimum temperature here was recorded 18.3 degrees Celsius.“The air quality is likely to remain in the poor category in the next few days. As for the temperatures, there will be a slight rise on account of the passing of the western disturbance. Temperatures might start falling by the end of October,” said a senior IMD official.For the next five days, local pollution sources such as vehicular emissions, construction dust, residential emissions and pollution from industries within and in the peripheries of the city are likely to be the primary reasons for bad air, a forecast by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology’s decision support system showed on Thursday.IITM’s decision support system, which is an early warning system that forecasts the primary pollution sources that contribute to the Capital’s air pollution at any given time of the day, showed on Wednesday that vehicular emissions are likely to be the highest contributor in the city’s pollution levels in the next five days. The share in Delhi’s PM 2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) is forecasted to range between 10-35% in the coming days.The DSS forecast said that on October 22, the contribution of vehicular emissions is expected to reach around 22%, and it will continue to rise and 30.35% on October 23 and then 32.66% on October 25.Apart from vehicular emissions, other local sources that are also expected to act up in the coming days are industries in Delhi and its peripheries (4-6%), pollution from residential sources (3-9%), construction (3-5%), waste burning (2-3%), power plants (1-2%) and road dust (1-2%).“The predominant surface wind was from northwest directions of Delhi with a wind speed of around 10-16 kmph and mainly clear sky on October 21. This will change to west/southwest with speed of 08-20 kmph and mainly clear sky October 22,” the DDS forecast read.Weather forecasters and scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that there may be a fall in the contribution of stubble fires to Delhi’s pollution, possibly because of moderate to heavy showers predicted in parts of Punjab and Haryana on between October 23 and October 24.“Under the impact of a western disturbance, there is a forecast of moderate to heavy rainfall in parts of Punjab and Haryana on October 23-24. In Delhi this would probably only cause isolated showers,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet Weather Services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pollution-levels-dip-slightly-as-winds-over-delhi-pick-up-pace-101634863101744.html

On Wednesday, the said engine was on its way from Kalka to Chandigarh when it derailed and fell into a pit, damaging its large portion. Three persons, including a loco pilot, an assistant driver and a guard, had sustained injuries and are currently undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Chandigarh. The DRM said while the loco pilot has received some injuries on his face and nose, the other two are stable and might get discharged in a day or two. Railways officials are, meanwhile, having a hard time retrieving the engine from the pit as cranes are unable to reach the spot. DRM Singh said that engineers are on the task and the engine will be transported to Saharanpur shed, its home station. On being asked about the purported reason and aspects of inquiry, the DRM said, “It has come to the fore that the brakes of the engine were of poor quality and the engine was not fit to move alone. The inquiry will look into the entire incident and responsibility will be fixed. It will be checked if that’s because of someone’s mistake or was a result of a system failure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/engine-derailed-near-chandimandir-drm-marks-inquiry-into-matter-101634857955605.html
22-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Contradiction in statements leads to man’s acquittal in 2017 harassment case||Contradiction in statements of prime witnesses and delay in registration of the FIR led to the acquittal of a Sector-8 resident on Thursday, almost after four years of being booked for harassing a girl. Madan Lal, who runs a shop in Sector 10, was arrested on March 3, 2017, after a case under sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was registered against him. As per the police, a student of DAV College, Sector 10, had lodged a complaint accusing Madan of outraging her modesty. As per the prosecution, the victim, along with her friend, had gone to the shop of the accused where he misbehaved with her and even tried to kiss her. The victim then returned the next day along with few other fellow students and started assaulting Madan. He was then handed over to the police. ‘Falsely implicated after he asked for money’ Madan’s defence counsel, AS Chahal, said he was falsely implicated. “Madan had maintained that the complainant used to buy items on credit from his shop and on March 3, he had asked her to clear the account,” Chahal said. “There was not just the delay of 27 hours in reporting the incident, but also contradiction in the statements of the complainant and her friend who had accompanied her,” Chahal added. While testifying before the court, complainant’s friend denied that Madan had misbehaved with her. “The statement of the complainant did not inspire confidence of the court,” added Chahal, while talking about acquittal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-contradiction-in-statements-leads-to-man-s-acquittal-in-2017-harassment-case-101634857715414.html

She had two more on 10th and 15th, and no bogeys. The highlight was that she picked birdies on three of the four Par-5s as she is now 2-under 142 and one shot ahead of Amandeep Drall and Pranavi Urs.Despite being an amateur Avani, straddling between the Hero WPGT circuit and the amateur tours, has been having a great season. She won the third leg in Mumbai and has since finished runners-up at the DLF Golf and Country Club in Gurugram in the eighth leg, and was again second in the 10th leg, last week in Chandigarh.Amandeep, the winner last week and second after the first day, stayed there with a second round of 73 that included a double bogey on Par-4 10th. She had three bogeys against four birdies but at 1-under 143 she is breathing down Avani’s neck.Pranavi, a four-time winner on the Hero WPGT, slipped to 2 over 74 as she had three birdies, three bogeys and a double bogey on the Par-5 seventh.Saaniya Sharma had the biggest swing in scores from first to second day as she followed up her first round 79 with a second round 66, which was flawless and equal to leader Avani’s card. Saaniya, however, had an eagle on the Par-5 third and four other birdies without dropping any shots.Vani Kapoor (71), Jahanvi Bakshi (72) and Seher Atwal (75) were tied for fifth at 2-over 146, while Rhea Jha (73), Lakhmehar Pardesi (79) and Gaurika Bishnoi (76) were occupying places eighth to 10th.With just one shot separating the top three, a keen battle is assured in the leading group, but right behind them are Saaniya, Vani and Jahanvi.The cut fell at 15-over 159 and 18 players who made the cut will figure in the final round.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hero-wpgt-amateur-avani-moves-ahead-of-amandeep-pranavi-101634853214182.html

22-10-2021||Chandigarh||Sewage entering N-Choe in Mohali: PPCB issues notice to GMADA||The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has issued a notice to the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) over the discharge of untreated sewage into the N-Choe in IT City near Airport Road.The pollution board has sought a reply within two weeks.Under Section 25/26 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, no industry, operator process or any treatment and disposal system can be established without the previous consent of the state pollution board, and no industry or process can discharge sewage or trade effluent into a stream, well, sewer or land in excess of the standards.In September, Hindustan Times had highlighted how despite the directions of the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change, GMADA has not constructed two sewage treatment plants (STPs) with 10 MLD capacity each. As a result, untreated sewage is being discharged into the N-Choe passing through the IT City, leading to harmful waterborne pathogens and bacteria, which pose a high risk to human and animal health.In 2019, the authority had built a portable STP of 500 KLD, which is also lying defunct now.Violation of any order under the Water Act, for which no penalty has been provided elsewhere in its framework, is punishable with imprisonment up to three months with/or fine of up to ₹10,000. PPCB superintending engineer Paramjeet Singh said a notice had been issued to GMADA and a reply had been sought within two weeks, following which action will be initiated accordingly.A seasonal stream, N-Choe originates in the north of Chandigarh and runs across the city, before meeting the Jagatpura drain at Manauli village in Mohali. The water finally drains into Ghaggar river.The IT City is spread over 1,722 acres across Sectors 66B, 82A, 83A and 101A near the Airport Road, and has major IT companies, industrial and commercial units, residential areas and a private school, besides campuses of two major private universities. The first housing scheme in IT City was launched in February 2014 with 325 residential plots, the second scheme in July 2016 with 750 plots, and the last scheme in April 2018.Ikesh Pal Singh, general secretary of Residents Welfare Association, IT City (Block C), said, “Despite the issue being highlighted multiple times, GMADA has made no effort to sort it out. The authority was supposed to treat the waste water generated in residential area and channel it back to houses for irrigation and construction purposes. But sewage continues to be disposed of unscientifically into the choe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sewage-entering-n-choe-in-mohali-ppcb-issues-notice-to-gmada-101634853157104.html

During the hearing, it came to light that while the girl was 18 years old, the man was aged 20. They had annexed photographs of their wedding and a marriage certificate. The court said the marriage was stated to have been solemnised at “Gurdwara Guru Nanak Niwas Sahib” in Mohali. However, it had been performed against the provisions of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, as per which the girl can’t be less than 18 years of age and the boy less than 21 years. The court directed the Mohali SSP to look into the role of the priest who solemnised the marriage and take necessary steps as warranted by law if any provisions were violated.The Moga SSP was also directed to look into the couple’s demand of security and examine the matter in light of one of them being underage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-tells-mohali-ssp-to-examine-underage-marriage-at-gurdwara-101634853155513.html

The three-member doctors’ panel that conducted the post-mortem found over 12 injuries, including two on the lips and rest on the victim’s private parts.As the post-mortem report could not establish the exact cause of death, the panel decided to refer to the case for chemical examination.The brain has been sent for histopathological examination, while her uterus has been sent to check for impregnation and her viscera samples have been sent to ascertain whether she was poisoned or not. Her vaginal swab test report is also awaited.During autopsy, the doctors tried to ascertain what led to the victim’s death. “It was discovered that the victim was gagged as she was gangraped which may have led to the snapping of oxygen supply, and she slipped into hypoxia (condition where body is deprived of adequate oxygen).

22-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Second complainant withdraws rape plaint against LIP chief Bains||In a major respite for Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) supremo Simarjit Singh Bains, one of the two women who had accused him of rape has withdrawn her complaint and alleged that Congress leaders had used her to further their political agenda. While an FIR was lodged on the first woman’s complaint following the court’s directions, no action had been taken so far on the second woman’s plaint. Addressing a press conference on Thursday, the second complainant claimed that Congress leaders Kamaljit Singh Karwal and another leader had pressured her to lodge a complaint against Bains. She claimed that Karwal, who is vying for a party ticket, had done so to malign the image of the LIP leader. She said that Karwal had even taken help of an Akali leader in formatting the complaint. “I was under tremendous pressure. My children stay abroad, and I was told that they could end up in trouble if I don’t do what I was told. I was worried about their well-being; but not anymore. I have withdrawn my complaint and will not pursue the matter further,” said the woman while interacting with mediapersons on Thursday. Since June, Bains has been maintaining that the rape complaint was false and politically motivated. However, the trouble is far from over for Bains as the first complainant continues to sit outside the police commissioner’s office, demanding the arrest of LIP chief. When contacted, Kamaljit Singh Karwal said, “Firstly, I do not indulge in such petty politics. The entire turn of events shows who is playing politics over the issue. It was the woman who levelled rape allegations against Bains. However, instead of taking action against the woman for maligning his image, Bains is using her to target me.” “I feel sad for the woman. By withdrawing the complaint, she has done grave injustice to those who are seeking justice, and no one offers them help.

This year, the number of farm fires till October 21 was 4,327 while the figure was 9,444 in 2020, according to the data of the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre (PRSC) that keeps tabs on the burning of crop residue in the state.At least 597 cases were detected on Thursday of which 162 were in Tarn Taran district of the Majha region while the Mansa district recorded the least number of cases at just 1. Nearly 50 cases each were detected in Amritsar, Ferozepur and Gurdaspur districts. Kapurthala reported 39 cases of stubble burning on Thursday, the highest in the Doaba region.Experts attributed the less farm fire incidents to delay in the paddy harvesting season. But straw burning will pick pace in the coming days. They said that the state government must take stern action against the violators, especially in districts like Kapurthala, Ferozepur, Faridkot, Ludhiana, Moga, Patiala and Jalandhar to control the rise in stubble burning to protect the environment.A senior police official from the Malwa belt said that they act as per the reports from the agriculture department to lodge FIRs in case of stubble burning. “But we too are helpless due to the ongoing farm agitation as nobody wants to take risk as the issue has been highly politicised,” he added. A Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) official said, “We still can’t predict that the trend will remain the same as harvesting was delayed. The number of incidents from Majha is increasing and it is worrying. We are exhorting farmers to desist from stubble burning.” Punjab has deputed 8,000 nodal officers, apart from asking deputy commissioners to monitor farm fires. But it has not yield much result on the ground. The state government has been conducting awareness programmes in villages, telling farmers about the ill-effects of the practice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-records-half-of-last-year-s-farm-fires-but-pace-picking-up-now-101634847573758.html

22-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab government to restart selection process of PTU V-C after finalising name for post||The Punjab government has decided to restart the selection process of vice-chancellor of the Inder Kumar Gujral-Punjab Technical University (IKG-PTU), Kapurthala, after nearly finalising the name of Prof Siby John when Amarinder Singh was chief minister. The government will again issue advertisement for the post, officials familiar with the matter said. The name of John from the Punjab Engineering College (PEC), Chandigarh, who earlier served in the IKG-PTU, was considered almost final for the post when the file recommending the name of the candidate of choice was sent to the Punjab governor for final approval on August 25, it is learnt. Earlier, the varsity’s board of governors had sent a panel of three names, including VK Paul from the National Institute of Planning and Architecture, Delhi, and Onkar Singh from Technical University Lucknow, besides John to the state government. But the process was set aside at the eleventh hour after some aspirants raised questions on selection, citing favoritism. Some had even approached the then technical education minister Charanjit Channi (now chief minister) claiming that candidates from Punjab were completely ignored. There were also reports at the time of Channi having no say in the selection process for the V-C’s post. State technical education minister Rana Gurjit Singh said the file on the V-C’s appointment was back with the government. “We will start the selection process afresh,” he said. Sixteen names of a total of 67 candidates who had applied for the V-C’s post were shortlisted for appearing before the select panel headed by the chief secretary. The post of the PTU V-C had fallen vacant on May 31 when Ajay Kumar’s term came to an end. Currently, the principal secretary (technical education) is holding the V-C’s charge. Ad hocism has taken over higher technical institutes in Punjab with three out of four state government-run universities functioning without a regular V-C. The two newly upgraded technical varsities — Shaheed Bhagat Singh Technical University, Ferozepur, and the Sardar Beant Singh Technical University, Gurdaspur — don’t have a regular V-C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-government-to-restart-selection-process-of-ptu-v-c-after-finalising-name-for-post-101634847332431.html

22-10-2021||Chandigarh||Give the BJP a chance in Fatehpur: Jai Ram||With the Fatehpur assembly segment, which has been a Congress bastion for a decade, heading for a tough three-cornered bypoll, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Thursday asked the people of the constituency to give the BJP a chance. The byelection to the Fatehpur assembly segment was necessitated due to the death of incumbent legislator Sujan Singh Pathania, who had won three consecutive elections, including one byelection, from the segment. The three-way contest is between Pathania’s son Bhawani Singh, BJP’s candidate Baldev Thakur and former MP Rajan Sushant who is contesting as an independent. “Give us just one year and I am sure you will support the BJP in next election,” said the chief minister, while addressing election meetings at Golwan, Hori Devi and Bhatoli villages. “No stone will be left unturned to develop Fatehpur. I assure you that all pending work of the last four years will be completed within a year,” said the CM. The Fatehpur election is a high-stake election as it will be used to measure the chief minister’s popularity in Kangra district and will indicate the voting pattern of the district in the 2022 assembly polls. However, factionalism has been plaguing the BJP with former Rajya Sabha MP Kripal Parmar staying away from the campaign after being denied a ticket. To top it all, the BJP is also facing farmers’ ire. Farms are annoyed over lack of markets to sell their crop and are not letting BJP workers enter their villages in some areas. Congress is the mother of inflation: Jai Ram On the issue if inflation, the CM turned the tables on the Congress saying that the party was the mother of inflation. “The Congress was in power for 50 years and all the problems that the country and state are facing is due to them,” he said. He also took a dig at newly inducted Congress member, Kanhaiya Kumar saying the grand old party had appointed leaders, who insult the army, as its star campaigners. “These are the same people who say that in Jammu and Kashmir army personnel commit atrocities on women. Congress is insulting the brave soldiers of Himachal by bringing such people to the state,” he said. He also slammed the Congress for promoting ‘dynastic politics’ and said that after the death of former chief minister Virbhadra Singh, Congress leaders are competing to become the CM. “The Congress asks us what we have done? Himachal has emerged as a model state by achieving number one position in the Covid vaccination programme. Earlier, we had only two oxygen plants. Today, we have 30 plants,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/give-the-bjp-a-chance-in-fatehpur-jai-ram-101634846852421.html
22-10-2021||Chandigarh||Derogatory posters case: SIT submits CFSL writing sample report of one sacrilege accused in court||Punjab Police’s special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 sacrilege cases on Thursday submitted the forensic analysis report of handwriting samples of a dera Sacha Sauda follower in a Faridkot court in connection with the 2015 derogatory posters case. The analysis report of handwriting samples of dera follower Sukhjinder Singh alias Sunny, who is an accused in three sacrilege cases, was received from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) at Chandigarh in a sealed envelope, which has been submitted to the court of judicial magistrate Tarjani by the SIT. The court will open the report on October 27 during the hearing on the charge sheet filed by the SIT against the accused. In May this year, the SIT led by inspector general of police Surinder Pal Singh Parmar arrested four dera followers — Sukhjinder, Shakti Singh, Ranjit Singh and Baljeet Singh — saying the posters were pasted by them on the directions of dera’s three national committee members. On June 1, the SIT collected samples of Sukhjinder to match them with the writing on the posters claiming that one of the posters was written by him, and sent samples to CFSL for matching. If the handwriting of the accused matches with the posters, it will be crucial evidence for the SIT to prove their claim in court. An official privy to the development said the SIT was confident the handwriting samples will match. The SIT led by then deputy inspector general (DIG) Ranbir Singh Khatra in 2018 had claimed that the handwriting of the accused dera followers had matched with the posters but no report was submitted to the court. Later, the CBI in its closure report filed in a Mohali court in July 2019 said the handwriting samples of the accused dera followers it had sent to the CFSL in Delhi did not match with the posters. As per the closure report of the CBI, the fingerprints and specimens of handwritings of 49 people were collected during the investigation. The CFSL report was received pertaining to 10 people, including all the dera followers named accused in this case by the SIT. However, SIT filed a nine-point opinion on the closure report of the CBI, saying that without waiting for the report of the remaining 39 persons, the agency made a hurry in filing the closure report. “Also, CFSL report mentions that the expert was not having sufficient material on record for scientific examination of fingerprints on posters with the samples sent,” the SIT claimed. In the three posters that appeared at Bargari and Burj Jawahar Singh Wala villages on September 24-25, 2015, it was threatened that the “bir” (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib stolen from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala on June 1 that year would be torn if the Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim-starrer film Messenger of God (MSG)-2 was not allowed to be released in Punjab. Parmar-led SIT has also claimed in the charge sheet that there are two witnesses who saw the four accused dera followers pasting derogatory posters at Bur Jawahar Singh Wala and Bargari villages on September 24, 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/derogatory-posters-case-sit-submits-cfsl-writing-sample-report-of-one-sacrilege-accused-in-court-101634846732530.html

22-10-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Not just another footpath sight||The pillar is slender, and swells up towards the top like a sonata soaring to a crescendo. It appears to be of red sandstone but the red has faded.You may spot this kind of fluted column inside the old houses in the Walled City, and also within temples and mosques.But it will be rare to find it by a footpath so matter-of-factly. Here, snuggled deep within south Delhi’s Chirag Delhi village, the column is half-embedded into the adjacent concrete, the other half exposed to the street like a dead body washed ashore. The column lies under a weather-beaten cement platform, which has four benches facing each other. It is a popular meeting point for the villagers. This afternoon, a bunch of men are playing a card game. One of them turns around and bends down his head to examine the column. “It is called column in angrezi,” he explains (in Hindi).A black dog jumps down from the platform, his tail fleetingly brushing the column. The scene vividly evokes Delhi’s multilayered past. Much like in Rome, Cairo and Istanbul, the previous lives of our ancient city exist in its ruins, many of which continue to survive, while many others have disappeared, or lie concealed from plain sight. Indeed, there is no knowing how often we Delhiites unsuspectingly step upon our city’s underground relics as we walk along the streets and parks. But this column doesn’t belong to any buried site. One of the card players identifies it as a discard from a nearby haveli—the area has a handful of period houses with intricately built doorways and windows. “The khamba collapsed some years ago, and was thrown out by the house owners… it was (eventually) used to lay the foundation of this platform 6-7 years ago.”A middle-aged shopkeeper contradicts the claim, insisting that the column has been on this spot since his infancy. Perhaps an archaeologist might correctly determine its antiquity. May be it isn’t old after all. Either way, the object succeeds in summoning the spirits of the dead. Lying forlorn along the muddy pathway, the stone column mutely substantiates the credence that histories and eras are literally littered over this city in material form.Meanwhile, in a leaf-strewn yard some steps away, a similar column is lying unclaimed under a neem tree.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-not-just-another-footpath-sight-101634846439059.html

22-10-2021||Kolkata||Private firm exec Subir Chaki killed because he recognised robber: Kolkata cops||KOLKATA: Subir Chaki, 61, the managing director of Kilburn Engineering, and his driver Rabin Mondal, 65, were allegedly murdered after the top executive recognised Vicky Haldar who posed as a buyer for Chaki’s three-storey ancestral house and intended to rob him, according to people familiar with the matter.Vicky, who met Subir Chaki ostensibly to seal the deal for the house in south Kolkata’s upmarket Gariahat area, assumed that the 61-year-old would be carrying a lot of cash.Vicky’s mother, Mithu Haldar, who worked as a nurse in the Kankulia Road area, was arrested on Wednesday. She was remanded in police custody for two weeks by a Kolkata court on Thursday afternoon. Police told the court that she and Vicky planned the robbery that led to the murders.“The detective department and officers from some other departments have cracked the case. A few more arrests are to be made. We will brief the media after wrapping up the investigation,” Kolkata Police commissioner Soumen Mitra said on Thursday, indirectly referring to Vicky and his associates who the police have not yet named.Vicky met Subir Chaki for the first time around 10 months ago posing as a buyer but under a different name, the police found after interrogating the suspect’s mother, father Subhas Haldar, younger brother Bilash and maternal uncle Tarun Haldar. The last three were detained on Wednesday.Police said Vicky’s mother revealed during interrogation that when Chaki recognized Vicky from their previous meeting, her son and his associates attacked the top executive with the knives they were carrying. They killed the driver too since he was a witness and decamped with Chaki’s gold rings and wallet, which had some cash and credit cards.Vicky, who failed his matriculation examination but can converse in English, according to the investigators, continued to dodge the police till Thursday evening by changing locations and phone numbers.His mother Mithu Haldar was picked up from her rented home at Diamond Harbour in South 24 Parganas district, the same locality where Vicky, Bilash and Tarun Haldar lived in another rented house.Mithu Haldar and her husband Subhas Haldar have an estranged relationship and lived separately, police said.South 24 Parganas district police officers said that in 2021, Subhas Haldar filed a complaint against his wife and Vicky, saying they tried to kill him. Mithu Haldar and her elder son were arrested and remanded in judicial custody before being released on bail.Police said although Vicky was jobless, he told some relatives that he was an engineer with the Kolaka Metro railway. Some people also told the police that Vicky worked briefly at a crematorium. Chaki’s body was found on the first floor while the driver’s body was lying on the second floor on Monday. There were multiple stab injuries.Kankulia Road residents told police that they had heard several voices, including that of a woman, coming from the house on Sunday evening. Mithu Haldar, however, claimed during interrogation that she did not visit the house.Police suspect that she was waiting in the vicinity because her landlady, Pampa Gayen, found her washing some blood-stained clothes later that night.A police sniffer dog on Tuesday picked up a smell and led the officers to the Ballygunge railway station located less than a kilometre away. Trains for Diamond Harbour pass through this station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/private-firm-exec-subir-chaki-killed-because-he-recognised-robber-kolkata-cops-101634846017192.html

22-10-2021||Chandigarh||BJP spreading hate to win UP assembly polls: Farooq Abdullah||National Conference president Dr Farooq Abdullah on Thursday said that the BJP was spreading hate and using it as a weapon to win elections in India and Uttar Pradesh. Slamming the BJP for its “politics of hate and intimidation”, he said, “We have to fight communalism and bring down the wall of hatred being created between Hindus and Muslims. To save India, we have to put an end to this hate,” he said. “...I have seen this in every election since Independence. Muslim leaders are taken to Muslim areas and Hindu leaders go to Hindu areas,” he said, adding that the BJP had won the last election over the Balakot airstrike and were spreading hate to win polls in UP. “Has the Line of Control changed? Have we taken back any area from Pakistan? The line exists. They were instrumental in shooting down their own plan there,” he said. Claiming that the NC alone can save J&K from disintegration, he said that Jammu is the gateway to Kashmir and Kashmir is the gateway to Ladakh. “There is no threat from outside but from inside, if brotherhood ends. We do not have threats from China and Pakistan. They cannot do anything as long we are strong,” he said. On the NC and its leaders being dubbed as pro-Pakistan, Abdullah said that the party lost 3,000 of its men, including its ministers, to militancy but kept the Indian flag flying high in Kashmir. Without naming Devender Singh Rana and Surjeet Singh Salathia, Abdullah said, “They are purchasing the people. Will it bring them to power? They are just watching their interests.” “They (BJP) promised to make J&K a paradise but made it a hell. Their leaders (union ministers) came, but did they come to your village. No, they went to Pahalgam, Gulmarg, Sonmarg and had a good time before returning to Delhi. For how long will you befool the people?” he asked. Abdullah also accused the BJP of gagging the media and called on the people to stay united in the face of hatemongering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-spreading-hate-to-win-up-assembly-polls-farooq-abdullah-101634846013465.html
22-10-2021||Chandigarh||Amarinder was a ‘compromised CM’, says Warring||Punjab transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring on Thursday alleged that former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had a secret understanding with the Akalis and made compromises with them. Calling Amarinder a “compromised chief minister”, Warring expressed regret that the state government could not fulfil in its first four-and-a-half years several poll promises made to the people before the 2017 assembly elections. “He (Amarinder) made compromises with those under whose regime several mafias took birth. The system was totally paralysed,” he claimed at a press conference, blaming the Badal family for the transport mafia. The transport minister said the former chief minister’s plan to set up his separate party was all a part of that compromise. On Amarinder’s charge that he was humiliated by the Congress high command, Warring said the people of the state wanted him to go. Amarinder had resigned as the CM last month after a bitter tussle with Navjot Sidhu. On Tuesday, the former CM said that he would float a new outfit soon and hoped to tie up with the BJP for the upcoming Punjab polls. Warring, who held the press conference to highlight achievements of his three weeks as the transport minister, said there was 17.24% increase in collections of the department from October 1 to 15. The collection of the government-owned buses was up from ₹46.28 crore between September 15 and 30 to ₹54.26 crore between October 1 and October 15, he added. He said the department collected ₹3.29 crore as part of pending government tax from the defaulting bus operators. A total of 258 buses have been impounded or challaned for non-payment of taxes, illegal permits, documents, etc. The minister said that an order for purchase of 842 new buses had been given and these would be on the road within 45 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amarinder-was-a-compromised-cm-says-warring-101634845652373.html

The announcement drew sharp reactions from the Congress, including Rawat who said that if Capt wants to eat crow, he can. “Stop talking about secularism @harishrawatcmuk ji. Don’t forget @INCIndia took in @sherryontopp after he was with @BJP4India for 14 years. And where did Nana Patole and Revnath Reddy come from if not RSS? And Pargat Singh was with @Akali_Dal_ for 4 years!” he was quoted as saying by his media adviser Raveen Thukral. In his no-holds-barred attack, Amarinder also questioned the Congress’ tie-up with Shiv Sena, asking Rawat if it was ok to join forces with so-called communal parties as long as it suited the party’s purpose and what was it if not sheer political opportunism. Amarinder further said that Congress had damaged its own interests by giving the state unit into the hands of an “unstable person like Sidhu” who was only loyal to himself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-amarinder-rakes-up-tie-up-with-shiv-sena-to-counter-harish-rawat-s-secular-retort-101634845352168.html

22-10-2021||Chandigarh||BJP’s policies have taken us back by decades: Mehbooba Mufti||After security forces conducted rigorous searches in Kashmir Valley after a series of civilian killings, the Peoples Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti on Thursday accused the BJP-led government of taking Jammu and Kashmir back by decades. The former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister also shared a photograph of a young girl’s belongings being frisked by paramilitary personnel in Srinagar. “Sums up the current situation in Kashmir where women & even children are suspects now. This is what BJP has brought J&K to. Their policies have taken us back by decades, “ Mufti said in a tweet. Security has been beefed up and searches by the police and CRPF have intensified across Kashmir valley, particularly in Srinagar, after a series of targeted killings, including those of minorities and non-locals this month. Union home minister Amit Shah is also expected to visit the region for a security review over the weekend. The security forces have been seen conducting searches of bikes, cars and passenger vehicles with travellers being asked to de-board for frisking, which was reminiscent of the 1990s when militancy was at its peak. Locals alleged that hundreds of two-wheelers have also been seized by the police. In a first, women paramilitary forces have been deployed in Srinagar, particularly in city centre, to frisk women and children. “The situation doesn’t seem right. There is fear. The bikes have as if vanished from roads, “ said M Amin, an auto driver of Srinagar. Authorities have suspended or reduced the speed of mobile internet services in some parts of the Old City and a few areas of south Kashmir districts, where the attacks by suspected militants were mostly concentrated.Multiple checkpoints and roadblocks have been erected across the city as the strength of security forces have increased to thwart any untoward incident and prevent further attacks.Eleven persons have been killed in targeted attacks by suspected militants this month, including five non-locals, three from local minority communities and the remaining three from the majority community. Seven of the killings were in Srinagar.“Seizing some bikes and shutting down of internet of some towers is purely related to terror violence. It has nothing to do with visit of the home minister, “ IGP Kashmir, Vijay Kumar, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjps-policies-have-taken-us-back-by-decades-mehbooba-mufti-101634845231994.html

22-10-2021||Chandigarh||Educationists should frame policies instead of babus: Pargat Singh||Coming down heavily on the bureaucratic system in the state, education and sports minister Pargat Singh on Thursday said the education policies should be framed by prominent educationists instead of bureaucrats.Addressing the bureaucrats as babus while interacting with the students at Government College for Girls, the cabinet minister said instead of enjoying and investing their creative ability in framing policies, these babus consider every initiative as a “new file”.“I don’t shy away from speaking the truth. I strongly believe that educationists should be part of the top policy making committees. I have directed officials concerned to form three committees, a committee pertaining to school education, a committee concerned with the higher education and the third should comprise educationalists and the industrialists”.The minister added that in order to generate employment for the youth, it was essential to know the requirements of the industry. “Industrialists will suggest to us the skills required in students for their placements post completing their education. To change the education system, it is important to work together as a team,” he said.The former Olympian also answered the queries of students during the ‘Punjab Da Bhavikh’ programme on the campus.On being asked by a student to give his views on the reservations in jobs and allocation of seats in top educational institutes due to which the genuine talent suffers, the minister said instead of giving reservations to students and jobs to candidates, those who are economically weak should be given financial help following which the selection should be done on the merit basis.Another student during the session accused the system of being corrupt. The student said candidates who were financially strong get the seats and many deserving candidates were left out citing one or another excuse.Singh admitted that deserving talent was losing opportunities to get appropriate jobs due to corruption in the education system, but he said the one who was giving bribes was equally responsible for exploiting the system.The minister urged the students to prudently use the internet facility.Meanwhile, former Delhi education minister Kiran Walia urged him to help the needy families in the state. “Many parents can’t afford school fee of their children. Instead of understanding their problems, schools tend to impose late fee penalties adding to their miseries. The government should pitch in for their help, said Walia.Youth Congress chief Brinder Singh Dhillon, National spokesperson of the Indian Youth Congress Gautam Seth along with Punjab Medium Industrial Development Board chairman Amarjeet Singh Tikka were present on the occasion.Meanwhile, addressing a gathering during Founder’s Day of the Sidhwan Group of Institutions at Sidhwan Khurd, Pargat Singh said a joint committee of education experts, academicians, former and present vice-chancellors, principals and teachers at school and college levels had already been constituted to proceed further as per the present needs along with the suggestions of the committee to bring major reforms in the education sector.He said a detailed roadmap was underway to ensure requisite overhauling in the education system, which would be executed within the next 60 days.The minister also called upon the Punjabi diaspora to join hands with the state government in strengthening the education system so that the students could shine at the national as well as the international levels.Hailing the efforts of the management committee of the institutions, he said the founders of institutions were the torchbearers of women education.He announced a grant of ₹5 lakh for the college from his discretionary funds.Later, he also distributed scholarships among students during the function.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/educationists-should-frame-policies-instead-of-babus-pargat-singh-101634844455907.html

Rather than providing any relief, the imposition of professional tax is adding to the misery. The market is already going through a slump as customers from other districts/states are also not visiting local markets due to frequent protests in the state. The government should provide relief to the traders at this time of crisis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-traders-protest-seek-rollback-of-professional-tax-101634844454474.html

Sidhu took the dig two days after Capt Amarinder announced his plans to set up a political party and have a pre-poll alliance with the BJP if the farmers’ issue was resolved. “The Architect of 3 Black Laws… Who brought Ambani to Punjab’s Kisani… Who destroyed Punjab’s Farmers, Small traders and Labour for benefitting 1-2 Big Corporates!! (sic)” the PPCC chief tweeted with an old video clip of Capt Amarinder as the chief minister talking about inviting private companies to the state. Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting at Delhi’s borders for the past 10 months against the three farm laws enacted by the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre. Responding to Sidhu’s remarks, Capt Amarinder called him a fraud and cheat for trying to pass off an old diversification initiative as being linked with the farm laws. “What a fraud and cheat you are @sherryontopp! You’re trying to pass off my 15-year-old crop diversification initiative as connected with #FarmLaws, against which I’m still fighting and with which I’ve linked my own political future!” he was quoted as saying by his media adviser Raveen Thukral in a series of tweets. The former CM said that Sidhu was clueless about Punjab and its farmers’ interests and clearly did not understand diversification, adding,“…yet you dream of leading Punjab. How dreadful if that ever happens!” He also questioned the timing of the Punjab Congress chief’s tweet as the Punjab government is going all out to promote its ‘Progressive Punjab Investors’ Summit’, asking him if he was opposed to that (summit) too. The investors’ meet is scheduled to be held in Ludhiana next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-calls-capt-architect-of-3-farm-laws-ex-cm-hits-back-101634844451597.html
22-10-2021||Mumbai||UK’s Carrier Strike Group warship at Mumbai coast for joint exercises with Indian Navy||The Carrier Strike Group (CSG21) of the United Kingdom, headed by 65,000-tonne HMS Queen Elizabeth, has anchored around 50 miles from Mumbai Port for joint exercises with the Indian Navy in the Indian Ocean. Information sharing and interoperability with the Indian Navy will be the Royal Navy’s focus during these joint exercises.Interacting with the mediapersons on board HMS Queen Elizabeth, Commodore Steve Moorhouse of the Royal Navy said, “We are visiting around 40 countries and will return to the UK in December. The focus will be on inter-operability and communication comparability with the Indian Navy for future joint operations. We are looking at being able to quickly and seamlessly share data with Indian ships and jets”. “CSG’s collaboration with India will build a strong relationship and also strengthen the military collaboration. Perceived as part of the UK-India Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, the aircraft carrier will also host members of the scientific, trade and corporate community in the next few days, as part of the exercise for building a friendly relationship between India and the UK,” added Commodore Moorhouse, who heads CSG.The aircraft carrier started sailing in May and had already visited Japan, South Korea and Singapore on its first journey as a central representation of the Indo-Pacific tilt in the UK’s foreign policy. She had also sailed to Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the East African coast.“We will be travelling thousands of miles and from a military perspective, it is very important in the 20th century because information sharing is one of the key points. Nearly one third of the Royal Navy’s deployment will be in the Indo-Pacific region and 10% of the time will be spent exercising with the Indian Navy,” said Commodore Moorhouse.“We want the countries to come together, and India, the UK, Japan and many other countries in the region are maritime trading nations. We believe in free flow of trade, and trade is in the DNA of India and the UK. We have a common operating procedure and can come together,” he added.CSG consists of 40 aircrafts, including F-35B lightning strike fighters on board, and is also accompanied by Royal Navy ships, a submarine armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles, naval helicopters and a company of Royal Marines, together with a tailored mix of merlin, wildcat, Chinook and Apache helicopters. The carrier also fitted with a close-in weapon system and force protection machine guns.HMS Queen Elizabeth is the first aircraft carrier in the world designed from the outset to operate fifth generation combat aircrafts. Crucially, a second ship, HMS Prince of Wales, is also in commission, meaning one carrier is always available for operations. At 65,000 tonnes, each carrier can field more than two dozen F-35B strike fighters, operated jointly by the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force, as well as by UK’s partners in the United States Marine Corps. CSG can also deliver cruise missiles, attack helicopters and naval gunfire. This formidable striking power offers reassurance to friends and allies while deterring would-be aggressors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/uks-carrier-strike-group-warship-at-mumbai-coast-for-joint-exercises-with-indian-navy-101634844091496.html

Farm leader Baldev Sirsa said the incident on October 15 was a pre-planned conspiracy to defame the protesters and end the ongoing protest against the farm laws.“After pictures of Nihang leader Baba Aman with agriculture minister Narendra Tomar and his deputy minister Kailash Choudhary were widely circulated, there is doubt that one group of Nihangs was hand-in-glove with BJP leaders. This is an agitation of farmers and not a religious one. Nihangs have no connection with the protest. We have demanded a probe into the murder of the farm labourer by an SC judge,” he added.He said the fact-finding committee of five leaders, including him, are also investigating the case on their own level and will submit their report by October 27.“We have demanded the resignation of Union minister of state home affairs Ajay Mishra Tani and will hold a nation-wide protest on October 26 on completion of 11-months of the farm stir,” Sirsa added.FIR registered against victim Lakhbir SinghThe Kundli police have booked victim Lakhbir Singh, who was allegedly killed by a group of Nihangs under Section 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) for desecrating Guru Granth Sahib.In a video, the farm labourer had claimed that he had desecrated the holy book in lieu of ₹30,000 and one of his friends was also accompanying him.Karnal man arrested for beating up Bihar migrantThe Kundli police have arrested a man identified as Naveen Sandhu, of Karnal district, for allegedly thrashing migrant labourer from Bihar, Manoj Paswan, who was involved in the business of selling chicken.Sonepat DSP (headquarters) Virender Rao said they have arrested Naveen for beating up the migrant labourer, who was selling chicken at Singhu for years.“The accused had demanded a cock from the migrant labourer. When he refused, the accused thrashed him with sticks,” the DSP added.Nihang Baba Raja Ram alleged that the accused did not belong to Nihang group and was staying in their camp by changing his identity.“We suspect that he belongs to Baba Aman Singh’s camp. He was disturbing peace of the farm stir,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/skm-demands-probe-by-sc-judge-in-singhu-lynching-incident-101634843192811.html

However, at this stage, when we dictate this order, it is stated that he does not want to state in respect of the former as he is yet to receive a copy of the petition and application, and will place his stand on records by filing an affidavit,” the court said.The apex court had on October 4 issued notice to 43 farmer unions on an interim application filed by the Haryana government seeking their impleadment in the case. The farm unions sought to be made a party to the case are steering the protest over the enactment of the three agri-marketing laws and squatting at the doorstep of the national capital.The SC on Thursday said notices have been served but only four farmer bodies were represented before them.The apex court, while hearing a petition which sought unblocking of the highways leading to the national capital, had on August 23 said the central, Haryana and UP governments must co-ordinate to ensure that the inter-state roads and national highways do not remain blocked due to farmers’ protest.However, when the protesting farmers did not turn up for talks on September 19, the state government moved an application to make them respondents in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/public-ways-should-not-be-occupied-for-protests-reiterates-sc-101634842891037.html
22-10-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers take out ‘ashes yatra’ of Lakhimpur Kheri victims in Ellenabad||Farmer unions protesting against the Centre’s three farm laws took out a ‘ashes yatra’ of four farmers and a journalist who were among eight people killed in Lakhimpur Kheri violence, at poll bound Ellenabad on Thursday.Indian National Lok Dal (INLD)’s Abhay Singh Chautala is pitted against BJP’s Gobind Kanda and Congress’s Pawan Beniwal in the assembly seat.Abhay, who is seeking a fourth consecutive term from Ellenabad, paid homage to the Lakhimpur Kheri victims when their ashes reached Ellenabad.“Innocent farmers were crushed down by a car owned by Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Mishra’s son. The minister should resign from his post. The Union government has failed to address farmers’ issues and despite the latter sitting on borders for a year,” he added.Bharatiya Kisan Union youth state president Ravi Azad said the ‘ashes yatra’ of the deceased farmers has covered nearly 35 villages of Ellenabad on Thursday and will cover the entire constituency by Saturday.“We are organising meetings in villages and urging people to vote against BJP-JJP nominee Gobind Kanda in Ellenabad bypolls. We are not campaigning in favour of any candidate but against the BJP-JJP nominee as they have failed to resolve farmers’ grievances,” he said.“Senior leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha will hold village-level meetings in Ellenabad from October 23 to 28 and urge voters to forfeit the security deposit of Kanda,” he added.Abhay slams ex-CM HoodaA day after former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda hit the campaign trail in Ellenabad, INLD nominee Abhay Singh Chautala slammed Hooda for referring to Sirsa MLA Gopal Kanda a friend.“Instead of helping his own party’s nominee, Hooda helped Kanda by terming him a friend. I want to make it clear that both the Congress and the BJP nominees will lose their security deposit in the bypolls and it will be a victory for the farmers,” he added.Former three-time MLA Rampal Majra, who had quit BJP in support of farmers protesting against the three farm laws, campaigned in favour of Abhay.“This is a battle of farmers and Abhay’s win will be a referendum against the three farm laws. It is surprising that JJP chief Ajay Chautala, who was seeking justice for an air hostess in a suicide case and demanding arrest of the then Haryana minister Gopal Kanda, is canvassing for Gobind Kanda. Ajay has lost all morality,” Majra added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-take-out-ashes-yatra-of-lakhimpur-kheri-victims-in-ellenabad-101634842716542.html
22-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ahead of Diwali, air quality of most Haryana cities deteriorates again||Air quality of Haryana’s Ballabgarh reached “very poor” category and that of 15 other cities was “poor” owing to the continuous rise in stubble burning cases in the state.The air quality had improved earlier this week due to rainfall in most parts of the state but it got polluted again with the air quality bulletin of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) revealing a jump in the incidents of stubble burning, polluting the air in the region as Haryana had reported 155 incidents of farm fires on Wednesday taking the number of total incidents of stubble burning to 1,237 from September 15 to October 20.Officials of the state pollution control board expressed concerns as they said the poor air quality ahead of Diwali will be a cause of worry.As per the Haryana Space Applications Centre (Harsac), with a maximum of 397 AFL incidents, Karnal is at the top, followed by Kaithal (342), Kurukshetra (216), Fatehabad (71), Ambala (55), Jind (51), and Yamunanagar (46).The air quality bulletin of the CPCB has revealed that Ballabgarh has the worst air quality in state with the air quality index (AQI) of 309.The air quality of 15 cities – Ambala (204), Bahadurgarh (215), Charkhi Dadri (285), Dharuhera (209), Faridabad (203), Gurugram (215), Jind (204), Kaithhal (215), Karnal (207), Kurukshetra (286), Manesar (238), Panipat (244), Rohtak (217), Sonepat (251), and Yamunanagar (243) – was categorised “poor”.The AQI was “moderate” in Bhiwani (125), Fatehabad (149), Hisar (142), Panchkula (154) and Sirsa (151).Of the 20 cities in state chosen for the air quality bulletin, not even a single city had “good” air quality. Only Palwal had “satisfactory” air quality with 61 AQI.Farm fires reach 1,237 in stateAccording to officials of the state pollution control board, the air quality has deteriorated with a sudden rise in incidents of stubble burning.The Haryana chief secretary had earlier issued directions to the deputy commissioners of all districts to check stubble burning in their respective areas. Block-level flying squads comprising BDPOs, tehsildars, agriculture department officials and police personnel were also formed by the district administrations for timely action against erring farmers, but keeping a complete check on farm fires still remains a challenge.Haryana State Pollution Control Board member secretary S Narayanan said, “There are reports that the air quality has deteriorated again after rains. We will hold another meeting in this regard and fresh directions will be issued to DCs, especially in the NCR region, to check illegal activities ahead of Diwali.”Karnal deputy director (agriculture) Aditya Dabas said efforts are being made to check stubble burning. And ₹4.30 lakh fine has been imposed on 171 erring farmers of Karnal. In Kurukshetra, deputy commissioner Mukul Kumar said 155 farmers have been challaned for stubble burning incidents in district and a fine of ₹2.02 lakh has been imposed on them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ahead-of-diwali-air-quality-of-most-haryana-cities-deteriorates-again-101634842534442.html
22-10-2021||Delhi||Turned down, stalker Delhi cop kills woman’s husband||A 32-year-old Delhi Police head constable, posted with the crime branch, has been arrested for allegedly hatching a conspiracy and hiring two “contract killers” to kill the husband of a woman who was allegedly in a relationship with him, but started “ignoring him”, police officers privy to the case details said on Thursday. The policeman, identified as Ghanshyam, was arrested on October 19 (Tuesday), nine days after the woman’s husband, a clerk retired from the army, was shot outside his home in northeast Delhi’s Ashok Nagar area, that comes under the Jyoti Nagar police station limits.“Ghanshyam, who is unmarried, was in a relationship with the woman. However, she moved on and was ignoring him. Despite this, Ghanshyam was pursuing her, and even threatened to kill her husband, Sudhir, if she would not elope with him. He hatched a conspiracy to murder her husband and hired two assailants, who shot the husband dead,” said deputy commissioner of police (northeast) Sanjay Kumar Sain.The head constable’s posting was in the crime branch’s special investigation unit-1 (SIU-1) that has been handing several important cases related to last year’s northeast Delhi riots that claimed 53 lives and left nearly 500 injured. It was not immediately clear if Ghanshyam was handling any of the cases. Incidentally, the brother of the dead ex-serviceman is also posted in the same unit of the crime branch.“Ghanshyam was sent to the district line and has been removed from the SIU-1. We are moving for his dismissal from the police department,” said a senior crime branch officer, who asked not to be named.On October 10, Sudhir was outside his home when two assailants reached there and shot him in his head. Sudhir was first rushed to Guru Teg Bahadur hospital in east Delhi, from where he was shifted to the Research and Referral Hospital in Delhi Cantonment. Sudhir succumbed to the bullet injuries on October 16, DCP Sain said.A case of murder was registered, and the investigators identified the two assailants from the CCTV cameras installed near the spot. The police learnt that the attackers were hired by someone who was yet to be arrested with the police not revealing his name. “The investigators established through technical and manual surveillance that the absconding suspect’s links with head constable Ghanshyam. It was also learnt that Ghanshyam had taken his help to hire the two assailants who executed his murder plan. We arrested Ghanshyam after we had enough evidence against him,” said the DCP.The story that emerged after the investigation and interrogation of Ghanshyam was that Sudhir retired as a storekeeper clerk in Army Supply Core on May 5, 2020 and since then he was living along with his family and parents at Ashok Nagar. As Ghanshyam was a colleague of Sudhir’s brother, he often visited his house, said an investigator.“Ghanshyam was in a relationship with Sudhir’s wife. But after Sudhir’s retirement, his wife started moving away from Ghanshyam. But Ghanshyam did not want to leave her. He threatened the woman that he will kill her husband if she refused to elope with him,” added DCP Sain.Police said that the two killers were already in jail in connection with a separate murder case. Officers said their custody will be secured for interrogation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/turned-down-stalker-delhi-cop-kills-woman-s-husband-101634842110616.html
22-10-2021||Delhi||Meetings on excluding Sunder Nagar, Bengali Market from LBZ in Delhi inconclusive||The Delhi Urban Arts Commission (DUAC) on Thursday told the Delhi high court that two meetings held to review the Centre’s decision to reject the panel’s recommendation to exclude eight city neighbourhoods from the Lutyens’ Bungalow Zone or LBZ were inconclusive. The DUAC told Justice Rekha Palli that the meetings were held after the Centre on October 5 informed the court that it has rejected the panel’s recommendation to exclude parts of Jor Bagh, Golf Links, Sunder Nagar, Bengali Market, Mandir Marg, Panchsheel Marg, Sardar Patel Marg and Chanakyapuri from the Lutyens’ Bungalow Zone. The commission said even after the discussion, the matter remained inconclusive and sought more time before any final decision can be taken with respect to the queries raised by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs. He, however, was unable to tell the next date when the commission would next sit to consider the matter.The court, while observing that such conduct is not appreciated, granted two weeks to DUAC for filing an affidavit categorically stating its stand as to whether it would re-consider the report in any manner and if yes, then on what grounds.“Accordingly, while adjourning the matter, the court on the next date would consider whether any interim orders are required to be passed..,” the judge said in an oral order. Spread over an area of over 28 sq km, the LBZ is governed by a strict building law that does not allow construction of basements and caps the number of floors. If these eight areas will be excluded from the zone, it would have meant that property owners there could undertake construction and alterations as per the Delhi Master Plan provisions. However, in LBZ This meant development in these colonies could happen as per the Master Plan of Delhi-2021 (MPD-2021) that allows FAR of up to 300 depending on plot size. However, as per the existing LBZ guidelines, a house owner is allowed the same FAR as the existing house. Due to this the FAR of each different plots in the same locality is different.Several plot owners and residents of Sunder Nagar, Golf Links, Bengali Market, and Panchsheel Marg, who want to reconstruct, or alter existing buildings, have approached the high court seeking a direction to the ministry of housing and urban affairs to implement the recommendations made by DUAC in 2019.The petitioners said the commission had recommended exclusion of these eight areas from the LBZ, and shrinking the zone by at least 5 square kilometres -- from the current 28 sqkm to 23 sqkm.In the petition concerning the Bengali Market area, the petitioner defended the exclusion on the ground that the area comprised small residential plots of land measuring 212 square yards to 500 square yards and the developed properties could not be considered as ‘’bungalows’’ as is commonly understood, and as also described in the report submitted by DUAC.In August, the court directed the ministry to decide on the recommendations made by DUAC within three weeks, while bearing in mind the peculiar bungalow style features of the zone and the fact that the recommendations did not seek to interfere with the LBZ guidelines but only suggested the exclusion of some areas that have modern constructions.The matter will now be heard on November 17.The DUAC, a constitutional body under the central government, advises the Centre in matters of preserving, developing and maintaining the aesthetic quality of urban and environmental design within Delhi, and guide any local body with respect to any development proposal which effects or is likely to affect the skyline or the aesthetic quality of surroundings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/meetings-on-excluding-sunder-nagar-bengali-market-from-lbz-in-delhi-inconclusive-101634841690635.html
22-10-2021||Delhi||Ruckus in North Delhi Municipal Corporation House over licence fee hike rollback||The North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s councillors’ meeting witnessed a disruption on Thursday over the issue of rolling back the fee hike for trade and factory licenses. The House proceedings were suspended twice by mayor Raja Iqbal Singh, as opposing sides of the House engaged in sloganeering. The corporation had hiked the rates of trade and factory licenses by up to 17 times in some categories over the last year. While the Bharatiya Janata Party-led corporation had earlier announced that the rates will be rolled back, the Opposition alleged that the notification regarding the rollback had not been issued yet.North MCD commissioner Sanjay Goel, however, informed the House that the circular regarding reduction in the license fee was issued on Thursday morning. “Traders who have been charged the enhanced license fee will be compensated by adjusting the amount in their next renewal cycle,” he added.The issue of the license fee hike was raised by the leader of Opposition Vikas Goel and the Congress’ head of municipal councillors Mukesh Goel. Opposition leader Vikas Goel said that the civic body directed the municipal commissioner to roll back the increased license fee during the last House meeting on September 22and the mayor provided anticipatory approval, but traders are still being forced to pay the increased fee. Opposition councillors alleged that a similar delay was observed in the MCD’s promise to waive taxes on properties with less than 50sqm area. As the ruckus grew, the House was adjourned till the next meeting. Chhail Bihari Goswami, the leader of the House confirmed that the order of rollback was issued and relief will be extended to the traders. Jogi Ram Jain, the standing committee chairman said that there are several formalities that need to be completed before implementing an announcement. “It may take some time due to court-related matters but the relief will be extended to traders as well as owners of properties with less than 50sqm area. It is our commitment to people,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ruckus-in-north-delhi-municipal-corporation-house-over-licence-fee-hike-rollback-101634841450576.html
22-10-2021||Delhi||After alert from Facebook exec in Ireland, cops prevent suicide attempt in West Delhi||A coordinated effort between an Ireland-based executive of social networking site Facebook and officers of the Delhi Police on Thursday helped save the life of a 43-year-old man from west Delhi, who allegedly consumed 40 to 50 bottles of a syrup used in the treatment of thyroid and uploaded a video of the act along with a message, which suggested that he was ending his life. The officers of the cyber cell (CyPAD) and the Rajouri Garden police station took an hour and 15 minutes to locate the person’s address, enter his house and find him alone in a semi-conscious state. He was rushed to a nearby hospital, where timely medical intervention helped save his life, police officers privy to the entire incident said. “The man was depressed over multiple reasons. His wife left him three years ago and shifted to Bhopal. He lost his job recently and his father had retired. Also, he was suffering from various health problems,” said deputy commissioner of police (CyPAD) KPS Malhotra.This is the third such incident in which officials of Facebook in Ireland have coordinated with the Delhi Police since August last year. The previous such case was on September 10 (World Suicide Prevention Day), when a 27-year-old man was stopped from ending his life by jumping off the Signature Bridge in north Delhi. In the latest case, around 2pm on Thursday, the CyPAD officials received an “urgent message” from a Facebook official in Ireland alerting them that a Facebook account holder had posted a message regarding a “suicide attempt”. The official also shared a video of the suicide attempt that the account holder had uploaded on his timeline. “Within 40 minutes, our cyber experts collected details and the location of the user and alerted senior officers of south-west and west districts. In the next 35 minutes, the Rajouri Garden police reached the person’s house and rushed him to the hospital after finding him semi-conscious,” said Malhotra. Malhotra said on inquiry, the man told the police that he had consumed 40 to 50 bottles of a syrup used in the treatment of thyroid allegedly because “he was upset”. In the morning, he spoke to his wife and told her that he wanted to visit her. However, she refused to meet him, the DCP said. “To mount pressure on his in-laws, the man put the suicide attempt video on Facebook. But our timely response to the urgent message from the Facebook official saved his life,” added Malhotra.HT reached out to the Facebook for its version but its officials declined comment on the incident.In August last year, a similar coordinated effort between Facebook and police of Delhi and Mumbai helped save the life of a man in Mumbai. The man was from Delhi but had gone to Mumbai allegedly after an argument with his wife, the police had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/after-alert-from-fb-exec-in-ireland-cops-prevent-suicide-attempt-in-west-delhi-101634841211785.html
22-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt receives 3,037 applications for e-autos, just 3% are from women||The Delhi government has received 3,037 applicationsfor registering electric auto-rickshaws ever since it launched a campaign on October 18 and said it aimed to have the highest number of e-autos in the country. Under the campaign, which is in accordance with the city’s electric vehicle (EV) policy, a total of 4,261 e-auto permits are up for grabs in Delhi, and of these, at least 1,406 (33%) are reserved for women.However, data accessed by Hindustan Times showed that from October 18 and until October 21, only 93 (3%) women had applied for permit to drive an e-auto, while 2,944 (97%) were male applicants. At present, Delhi has only one woman auto driver. Since the application window is open only till November 1, the state transport department is now planning to spread the word among the people by organising an “e-auto mela (fest)” from October 25 to 31. The exhibition is being organised simultaneously at two locations — the Institute of Driving Training and Research (IDTR) in Loni and Sarai Kale Khan — between 9am and 4pm. “Even though many are interested in the scheme, they are mostly apprehensive about the viability of electric autos as compared to CNG ones. Doubts about mileage and the number of charging points available for autos are common and these doubts are holding back many interested persons. So, to clear all doubts about e-autos, the Delhi government will be organising this e-auto festival. Everyone is welcome to attend,” said a senior transport official, asking not to be named. At the exhibition, people will get to see and even test drive the models of e-autos available in the Indian market. They will also be advised about the best loan financing schemes available and the one best suited to each individual. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said the government will provide a subsidy of ₹30,000 on the purchase of an e-auto. The average cost of an e-auto will be around ₹2.7 lakh, and after the subsidy, its cost will almost be similar to that of a CNG auto in Delhi. The cost of battery swapping e-autos, after subsidy, will be around ₹1.8 lakh, the minister said.In addition, a 5% interest relief in the loan for the purchase of e-auto will be provided by banks that are empaneled with the Delhi government. Currently, the city has about 95,000 registered auto-rickshaws, all of which run on CNG. There is a cap of 100,000 on the number of autos that can be registered in Delhi.To apply for a permit, all one needs is a Delhi-issued light motor vehicle driving licence (for driving cars), which means the new scheme will give young people a means to be self-employed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-receives-3-037-applications-for-e-autos-just-3-are-from-women-101634841091296.html
22-10-2021||Delhi||Senior East MCD workers to issue fines for vector-breeding violations||The East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has decided to grant challaning (fining) powers to the senior field workers in case they come across violations related to mosquito breeding, a step aimed at controlling the spread of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue, which is on the rise in the national capital. The powers will rest with them for the next two months, the municipal body officials said on Thursday.Delhi recently witnessed its first dengue death of the year. A total of 723 dengue cases have been officially reported so far, with 243 cases coming in the last week alone.EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand on Thursday reviewed the steps being taken for the prevention of mosquito-borne diseases. “During the review meeting, officials informed the commissioner that senior field workers should be given the right to issue fines so that the breeding of mosquitoes can be controlled effectively. The commissioner has accepted the proposal and the powers has been granted to senior field workers for the next two months,” spokesperson of EDMC said.A senior municipal corporation official said currently, only assistant malaria inspectors and malaria inspectors have the power to issue a fine of ₹500. “We also recover from owners the cost of insecticide used to disinfect large breeding sites; so the overall fine amount turns out to be much higher,” the official said, asking not to be named. This year alone, the east civic body has found mosquito breeding sites in 27,668 houses and 4,579 prosecutions have been launched in this connection.Anand has also ordered deputy commissioners to transfer nala beldars (sewage cleaners) in their respective areas to the public health department to overcome the staff shortage there. Dr Rajni Khandewal, medical superintendent of Swami Dayanand Hospital, said special arrangements have been made at the healthcare facility for treatment of dengue patients. “Ninety patients suffering from dengue have been admitted to Swami Dayanand Hospital. Elective surgeries, except obstetrics, will be suspended for the time being and the 40 bed surgical ward has been converted into a dengue ward,” Dr Khadelwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiedmc-gives-fining-powers-to-senior-field-workers-to-step-up-anti-dengue-efforts-101634841030564.html

The urban development minister of the Delhi government is looking into the issue. In this regard, a discussion can be held in detail between the minister of urban development and the top companies of Poland who specialise in this. They can give their presentations to the ministry.”He also said that Poland will closely help the Delhi government in promoting tourism in the national capital.Burakowski too praised the “development work being done by the Delhi government”. In a statement issued by the Delhi government, Burakowski said, “I have been following CM Kejriwal’s work since the days of India Against Corruption and I am very impressed to see his work. At the same time, I am also very impressed by the historic development work being done by the Delhi government under his leadership. I have visited Chandni Chowk many times. I am amazed at how beautifully the entire area has been redeveloped. Honestly, the work done by the Delhi government in government schools is very inspiring. Poland looks forward to working closely with Delhi to advance the public facilities and we would be happy to collaborate with it in solid waste management.”“Earlier, solid waste used to be a challenge in Poland too, but we worked efficiently towards solid waste management. Today we have beaches on the banks of the river and cleanliness is everywhere in the country. We would be happy to share our solutions to help Delhi in solid waste management. I understand that a large part of the pollution that plagues Delhi comes from other states, but implementing concrete solutions can solve this problem to a great extent,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cm-meets-polish-ambassador-discusses-solid-waste-management-101634840550692.html
22-10-2021||Delhi||55k admitted in DU so far; 3rd cut-off window closes||At least 55,000 students paid their admission fee by Thursday evening under the third cutoff list to secure admissions to around 60 Delhi University (DU) colleges. The number is expected to increase as students can apply for admission till midnight on Thursday and pay the fee till Saturday, university officials said.Data from the DU admissions branch showed that 167,981 candidates applied to the varsity under the third cutoff list, 55,482 candidates paid their admission fee, and 10,098 candidates received approval from principals of various colleges till Thursday 6.12pm.Although there are around 70,000 sanctioned undergraduate seats in Delhi, many colleges end up admitting more students than the available seats due to DU’s admission policy, which mandates that colleges must admit all students who meet the announced cutoffs. There is no first-come, first-served policy.The university is expected to release a special cutoff list on October 25, subject to the availability of seats, for candidates who were unable to take admission under the first three cutoff lists. Under the special cutoff list, candidates who met the criteria of any of the three cutoff lists, but could not take admission due to some reason, can approach colleges for admission, provided the colleges still have open seats.Candidates eligible for admission under the special cutoff list can take admission between October 26 and 27 and pay their fee by October 29. DU’s fourth cutoff list will be declared on October 30.Of the 11 courses (political science, physics, BA programme, BCom, BCom (Honours), economics and computer science) in eight collegesthat saw 100% cutoff under the first list this year, seven courses were available under the third cutoff list. While Hindu College, Hansraj College and Jesus and Mary College closed admissions to political science, computer science, and psychology respectively under the second list, Ramjas College closed admissions to political science under the third list.The college is likely to keep admissions open to the physics and BA programmes -- the other two courses also had a 100% cutoff. However, college officials said this would depend on the admissions under the special cutoff list.Of the remaining courses, Shri Ram College of Commerce is likely to close admissions to the two courses it offers-- it reduced its 100% cutoff in BCom (Honours) and Economics to 99% and 99.5% under the third list. “The unreserved category in Economics and BCom is already filled. There are some reserved category seats in both the courses and they are likely to remain open under the fourth list. There may be a marginal drop in the number of seats so that there is no over-admission,” said an official from the college, requesting anonymity.DU’s Deen Dayal Upadhyay College and Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies – which originally set a 100% cutoff in Computer Science – reduced it to 97% and 97.25% under the third list in the unreserved category. While DDU is yet to fill its seats in the unreserved category and is likely to see a drop in the cutoff percentage under the fourth cutoff list, SSCBS has filled its unreserved category seats in the computer science course.DDU principal Hem Chand Jain said, “There are only have a handful of seats left across reserved and unreserved categories in most of our 15 undergraduate courses except for BCom, which is likely to see a substantial drop in cutoff percentageunder the next list. Computer science too will see a drop in cutoff percentage as we have filled 20 of the 24 unreserved seats.”Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Khalsa College, which set a cutoff of 100% for its BCom course in the first list, reduced it to 97.25% under the third list. Principal Jaswinder Singh said that while the college had seen over-admissions to the BCom (Honours) course, it was likely to declare a fourth cutoff list for the BCom programme. “There will be a marginal drop in the cutoff for BCom and some Science courses in which there are a few unreserved seats left. However, there will only be a marginal drop in the cutoff, because even a difference of one mark would make many students eligible for the course,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/at-least-55k-admissions-after-du-third-list-special-cutoff-list-out-in-a-few-days-101634840490394.html
22-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi gets more dengue beds as infections spike, 723 cases recorded so far||Only 221 persons with dengue have been admitted to Delhi’s hospitals, 25% of whom are from neighbouring states, the government said on Thursday. In a press release, the government announced it increased the number of beds for dengue patients, in view of the rise in cases of the mosquito-borne viral infection, while reducing the number of beds earmarked for patients with coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in hospitals across the Capital.“The dengue situation in Delhi is completely under control. There is an adequate number of beds in the hospitals of Delhi. Not only that, patients from outside Delhi are also being treated in Delhi hospitals. At present, 25% of the total dengue patients present in Delhi hospitals are from outside Delhi,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain in the press release on Thursday.He added, “Things are still the same as they were in 2019. The number of coronavirus cases was high in 2020. People were at home. Because of this, dengue cases came down rapidly. But this year, the situation is expected to remain the same [as it was in 2019].”The statement added the government reduced the number of beds earmarked for Covid-19 from 30% to 10% at private hospitals in the city, and reduced the number of beds government hospitals such as Lok Nayak from 700 to 400. The rest of the beds will be utilised for the treatment of patients with dengue, other vector-borne diseases, and fevers, said the press release.Delhi recorded 723 cases and one death due to dengue till October 16 this year, the latest data available so far.The Capital had recorded one death due to dengue last year, two deaths in 2019, four deaths in 2018, 10 deaths each in 2017 and 2016, according to official data. In 2015, Delhi witnessed a big dengue outbreak that affected nearly 16,000 people and killed 60.Meanwhile, Delhi has been reporting around 20 to 30 cases of Covid-19 every day since the beginning of October.At the height of the second wave of the pandemic, the Delhi government arranged nearly 30,000 beds in various categories--isolation centres, regular wards, oxygen wards, ICUs. There were over 20,000 hospital admissions at the peak of the wave between April and May. At the time, all 2,000 beds in Lok Nayak Hospital were being used to treat Covid-19 patients, the government said.Now, normal services have resumed at Lok Nayak and all other government hospitals.According to the government, only 25% of the fever patients being admitted to hospitals are testing positive for dengue. The rest are recovering within a couple of days and are being discharged.According to experts, during 2015’s dengue outbreak in the Capital, type 2 dengue associated with a severe drop in platelet count and internal bleeding, was in circulation. For the next couple of years, the milder serotype 3 of the virus was in circulation. According to experts, this year in Delhi, a milder serotype 1 is in circulation along with serotype 2.There are four serotypes of the dengue virus based on the difference in the antigen (the part of the virus that attaches to human cells and against which antibodies are created) – types 1 and 3 are the milder serotypes while types 2 and 4 are associated with severe disease. Patients suffering from serotypes 1 and 3 display symptoms such as fever, headache, body ache, and pain behind the eyes. Type 2 is associated with more severe disease, leading to a drop in platelet count, inability to form blood clots, and internal bleeding. Type 4 is associated with the leaking of fluids from the capillaries, leading to a drop in blood pressure and circulatory shock (not enough blood reaching the organs).“Dengue is cyclic in nature; it increases every three or four years and usually when a new serotype is in circulation. The four serotypes of dengue do not protect against each other; so when many people have been infected with one, other serotypes start circulating. Also, unlike Covid-19, wherein a previous infection protects against severe disease the second time, a second dengue infection is likely to be more severe. Those diagnosed with dengue must also keep a check on their platelet count after they get a fever, because that is usually when the count dips,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-gets-more-dengue-beds-as-infections-spike-723-cases-recorded-so-far-101634840311472.html

We plan to shift it to another location,” he added.Generally referred to as Peeli Kothi clinic in the area, the site has originally housed the tuberculosis clinic from before Independence and was later upgraded to a modern chest clinic in 1999. Currently, the complex also houses other associated public utilities such as a police booth, community toilet complex, a garbage receptacle and municipal store.“North MCD intends to dispose of its property for commercial redevelopment on a freehold basis. The purchaser will be allowed to carry out construction for commercial purposes as per development control norms of the area,” the project report states.The official explained that a maximum floor area ratio -- ratio of the building’s total floor area to the total area of the land -- of 100% is permitted on the site as per MPD-2021 norms.As per the plan, the existing TB Chest Clinic will be shifted to the corporation’s available vacant property at Bagichi Madho Das, Angoori Bagh, near the Shri Rani Sati Ram Ram Mandir. “The purchaser (of the site near Old Delhi railway station) will also have to renovate the property (the new one at Angoori Bagh) to suit the requirements for running the TB Chest Clinic, and the community toilet complex will be shifted to Queens road. The overall relocation cost of various facilities is expected to be ₹2.5 crore which will be borne by the purchaser in addition to ₹86.18 crore,” said the project report.However, there has been some resistance to the redevelopment project from within the BJP. BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that they have appealed to the mayor to intervene in the matter as the clinic is popular among the local residents. “The TB clinic was upgraded in 1999 during the tenure of standing committee chairman Shanti Desai. We should continue its operations and name the facility after him,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-north-body-to-move-tb-clinic-near-old-delhi-rly-stn-revamp-site-101634840310063.html

The plea, filed by a resident of Defence Colony, sought the removal of the encroachment which had come up in front of the petitioner’s property in Defence Colony. The plea said during the Covid-19 pandemic, somebody illegally constructed a temple on public land,a footpath, on Bhishma Pitamah Marg, which is right in front of the petitioner’s property.The plea also claimed that taking advantage and shelter of the illegal construction, people gather there and resort to rowdiness and gambling, and that the structure impedes full access to the petitioner’s property. On the last date of hearing, the Delhi government informed the court that it would demolish the encroachment, an illegally constructed temple, and that the authorities are conscious about their duties.However, on Thursday, additional standing counsel Anupam Shrivastava told the court that the religious committee is yet to decide on the demolition. He insisted that the authorities — i.e the public works department (PWD) — is not shying away from demolishing the temple, but due process has to be completed.He said this was required since there might be a law and order issue in the area if the PWD goes ahead with the demolition, adding that the religious committee would look into whether sentiments would be hurt. To this, the judge said, “Just a few bricks put up, you want to get the religious committee involved? If it is a big temple, then the religious committee can be considered. But if anyone puts a few bricks overnight, then will it be considered? If this is your view then you will have whole Delhi encroached upon. Anyone can place anything outside and say it’s over.” “I am not satisfied with your stand,” justice Palli told the additional stand counsel, before adding, “It is not even a proper covered structure that you need the religious committee... It will lead to chaos. Tomorrow, if anyone puts up five bricks and one idol, will you consider the religious committee is all that I want to know.” Senior advocate PV Kapur, appearing for the petitioner, contended that the structure has still not been removed. He described the structure as “tiny” and queried whether its demolition required the religious committee’s intervention.The court too asked Shrivastava whether the intervention of the religious committee was required in the case of such a small structure, which is not even covered properly.It granted time to the Delhi government to file an affidavit detailing the cases in which the religious committee is to be considered and posted the matter to next week for further hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-pulls-up-govt-for-delay-in-removing-illegal-structure-in-defence-colony-101634839830038.html

They may have suffered injuries but fled the spot because they feared they would be arrested for their negligence. No casualty was reported till late evening, the officials said.Delhi Fire Services (DFS) chief Atul Garg said that the fire control room received a call at 1.05pm regarding a building collapse near the gurdwara in Sangam Vihar. Three fire tenders and rescue teams were rushed to the spot.Deputy commissioner of police (south) Benita Mary Jaiker said that after receiving the information, the local police reached the spot and found a building had collapsed and was leaning against another building. An electric pole had also been damaged.Upon inquiry, the DCP said they found that the building owner, Hos Ram, had contracted two brothers-- Sanjeev and Pawan Pandit--to raise the structure.The contractors in turn got labourers and jacks to do so.“Prima facie, it appears that the jacks either malfunctioned or failed to bear the weight of the structure, causing the collapse. Although locals said that no person was trapped under the debris, teams of Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), fire, electricity, and municipal departments reached the spot to assist the police in carrying out the search and rescue operation,” said a police officer.DCP Jaiker said that a case was registered in connection with the building collapse.A senior municipal official, requesting anonymity, said that the building was very old and the level of the ground floor was much below the street level. “It had not been identified in the dangerous building survey, however. There are two drains along the base of the building and water seepage might have also weakened the structure. We are carrying out a probe to identify the reason for the collapse,” the civic official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-building-being-lifted-using-jacks-collapses-in-sangamvihar-101634839589943.html

22-10-2021||World||Joe biden admin: Indian-American Neera Tanden gets big White House promotion||Indian-American Neera Tanden has been named staff secretary to President Joe Biden, a job that will put her in control of all documents headed for the president.It’s a big promotion as the post is considered to be a stepping stone to higher office - the alumni includes Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh and former White House chief of staff John Podesta - it is still not a cabinet post that she was nominated to be but did not get earlier because of bipartisan opposition from lawmakers angered by her testy tweets.Neera Tanden will be the first person of colour to hold the position, and the first Indian-American.Tanden will retain her designation of White House senior adviser, in which role she has advised the president on an entire range of issues, The Washington Post said, adding, she will be reporting to White House chief of staff Ronald Klain, who announced the appointment in a morning call with his staff.President Biden had nominated her last year to head the Office of Budget and Management, which is a key cabinet post and it would have made her the first Indian-American to hold a federal cabinet position (Nikki Haley held a cabinet-rank post as President Donald Trump’s ambassador to UN).Neera Tanden’s nomination was withdrawn shortly, at her urging, in the face of persisting opposition from lawmakers who had been the target of some very vicious tweets from her in the past. She had faced intense grilling from lawmakers from both parties at two confirmations hearings.“Your attacks were not just made against Republicans,” senator Bernie Sanders, who had been a major target for her in the 2016 race for the Democratic presidential nomination. “There were vicious attacks against progressives, people who I have worked with - me personally.”President Biden named Neera Tanden a senior adviser after the confirmation fiasco and kept her on as a key member of his team. Her elevation to the post of staff secretary does not require to be confirmed by the senate.Tanden came to the Biden from the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, which she headed as president and CEO. Earlier, she had served in the department of health and human services and served as an adviser to the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in 2008.Neera Tanden was born in Massachusetts in 1970 to parents from India, who divorced when she was five. Tanden and her brother were brought up by their mother. Tanden has spoken of her family banking on food coupons to get by. She went on to the University of California, Los Angeles and Yale University where she studied law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-admin-indian-american-neera-tanden-gets-big-white-house-promotion-101634918984768.html
22-10-2021||World||UK PM Boris Johnson says fresh Covid lockdown not on the cards||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday a new Covid-19 lockdown is not on the cards, as advisers warned that acting early with lighter measures to cut rising case numbers would reduce the need for tougher restrictions later.Johnson's government has said there is no need yet to introduce a "Plan B" involving mask mandates, work-from-home orders and vaccine passports, though such measures could be introduced if more people do not come forward for Covid-19 vaccines and booster shots.Johnson scrapped England's Covid restrictions in the summer, and he said that, while case numbers were rising, the trend was in line with what was expected.He said earlier that the widespread deployment of vaccines this year means that the link between cases and deaths has been disrupted, in contrast with earlier stages of the pandemic.Asked on Friday about the possibility of another lockdown over winter, the Conservative prime minister said: "I've got to tell you at the moment that we see absolutely nothing to indicate that that is on the cards at all."While Johnson has scrapped the legal requirement to wear masks, he said they should still be worn in confined spaces, especially when meeting strangers.Covid-19 infections in Britain are up 17.9% over the last seven days, with 52,009 reported on Thursday, and the reproduction "R" number is estimated between 1.0 and 1.2. Any figure above one suggests an exponential growth in cases."In the event of increasing case rates, earlier intervention would reduce the need for more stringent, disruptive, and longer-lasting measures," the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) said in minutes from a Oct. 14 meeting, published on Friday."SAGE advises that policy work on the potential reintroduction of measures should be undertaken now so that it can be ready for rapid deployment if required."SAGE added that among Plan B measures, reintroduction of work-from-home guidance would have the biggest impact to cut transmission, and warned that "presenteeism" might become an increasing reason for contagion in the workplace.Behaviour ChangeThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Friday found that Covid-19 prevalence had risen again. One of the areas with highest prevalence was southwest England, which was impacted by false negative test results from a lab that was suspended last week.The ONS said Covid prevalence was at its highest level since January, when England had just entered a third national lockdown, although deaths are much lower.The current rise in cases has been fuelled by high levels of infections in secondary schools, where 7.8% of children were infected in the latest week, according to ONS statistics.Though young people are less likely to fall seriously ill, ONS figures show the rise in cases there is now feeding through into older age groups.Johnson has said that the government will rely on vaccines rather than lockdowns to navigate a difficult winter, and SAGE said that things were unlikely to be as bad as last winter."Scenarios modelled for the coming winter and into 2022 suggest Covid-19 hospital admissions above the level seen in January 2021 are increasingly unlikely, but there are uncertainties around behaviour change and waning immunity," the minutes said.The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said it was investigating a Delta subvariant of the coronavirus called AY.4.2 as it was possibly more transmissible than Delta, though there was no evidence that it caused more severe disease or rendered vaccines ineffective."It is not unexpected that new variants will continue to arise as the pandemic goes on, particularly while the case rate remains high," UKHSA chief executive Jenny Harries said."However, it should serve as objective evidence that this pandemic is not over."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-says-fresh-covid-lockdown-not-on-the-cards-101634916365349.html
22-10-2021||World||Joe Biden vows to defend Taiwan if attacked by China||The United States will defend Taiwan if it is attacked by China, President Joe Biden said, seemingly changing long-standing American “strategic ambiguity” on the issue.“Yes,” Biden said at a Town Hall hosted by CNN when asked by the anchor, Anderson Cooper, if the US will come to Taiwan’s defence if attacked by China. “Yes, we have a commitment to do that,” the US president said further when the anchor pressed him, on Thursday.Joe Biden’s remarks came just a day after his pick for ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns, told US senators at his confirmation hearing that “strategic autonomy” in relation to Taiwan is working and there is no need to change it.The United States recognises China’s claims over Taiwan under its One-China Policy, but under the Taiwan Relations Act, it is committed to helping the island nation defend itself against China. The United States provides Taiwan with massive amounts of military hardware to that end.But the US has kept its commitment to coming to Taiwan’s defence in the event of its invasion by China vague, which is defined as “strategic ambiguity”.President Joe Biden seemingly changed that.The White House sought to walk back his comments. “The president was not announcing any change in our policy, and there is no change in our policy,” a White House spokesperson said after the Town Hall. “The US defence relationship with Taiwan is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act. We will uphold our commitment under the act, we will continue to support Taiwan’s self-defence, and we will continue to oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo.”That indeed remains the policy of the Joe Biden administration as stated by Nicholas Burns at the hearing. “My own view, and this is also the view ... more importantly of the Biden administration, is that the smartest and effective way for us to help deter aggressive actions by [China] across the Taiwan Strait will be to stay with a policy that’s been in place,” he said in response to a senator’s remarks that Beijing takes strategic ambiguity as a sign of weakness. “This is a policy that can succeed if we execute it consistently and with some strength.”He further said: “We recognise the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China. And, yet we have unofficial relations with Taiwan, and we have under the Taiwan Relations Act the ability, in fact, the imperative, of helping Taiwan to defend itself. Every president, Republican and Democrat, has followed that policy.”The United States has been closely watching recent escalation in tensions between China and Taiwan. Beijing sent a “record number” of warplanes close to Taiwan earlier this month forcing a top Taiwanese defence official say that tensions were at their worst in 40 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-vows-to-defend-taiwan-if-attacked-by-china-101634911841956.html
22-10-2021||World||Pfizer says Covid-19 vaccine more than 90% effective in 5- to 11-year-old kids||Kid-size doses of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine appear safe and nearly 91% effective at preventing symptomatic infections in 5- to 11-year-olds, according to study details released Friday as the U.S. considers opening vaccinations to that age group.The shots could begin early next month — with the first children in line fully protected by Christmas — if regulators give the go-ahead.Details of Pfizer's study were posted online Friday. Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration will publicly debate the evidence next week.The FDA is expected to post its independent review of the company’s safety and effectiveness data later Friday. If the FDA ultimately authorizes the shots, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will make the final decision on who should receive them in early November.Full-strength Pfizer shots already are authorized for anyone 12 or older, but pediatricians and many parents are anxiously awaiting protection for younger children to stem rising infections from the extra-contagious delta variant and help keep kids in school.More than 25,000 pediatricians and primary care providers already have signed up to get the shots into little arms.The Biden administration has purchased enough kid-size doses — in special orange-capped vials to distinguish them from adult vaccine — for the nation’s roughly 28 million 5- to 11-year-olds. If the vaccine is cleared, millions of doses will be promptly shipped around the country, along with kid-size needles.A Pfizer study tracked 2,268 kids in that age group who got two shots three weeks apart of either a placebo or the low-dose vaccine. Each dose was one-third the amount given to teens and adults.Researchers calculated the low-dose vaccine was nearly 91% effective, based on 16 Covid-19 cases in youngsters given dummy shots versus three cases among vaccinated children. There were no severe illnesses reported among any of the youngsters but the vaccinated ones had much milder symptoms than their unvaccinated counterparts.In addition, young children given the low-dose shots developed coronavirus-fighting antibody levels just as strong as teens and young adults who got regular-strength vaccinations.That’s important information considering that hospitalizations of mostly unvaccinated children reached record levels last month.The CDC reported earlier this week that even as the delta mutant surged between June and September, Pfizer vaccinations were 93% effective at preventing hospitalizations among 12- to 18-year-olds.Pfizer’s study of younger kids found the low-dose shots proved safe, with similar or fewer temporary side effects such as sore arms, fever or achiness that teens experience.The study isn’t large enough to detect any extremely rare side effects, such as the heart inflammation that occasionally occurs after the second dose, mostly in young men.While children run a lower risk of severe illness or death than older people, Covid-19 has killed more than 630 Americans 18 and under, according to the CDC. Nearly 6.2 million children have been infected with the coronavirus, more than 1.1 million in the last six weeks as the delta mutant surged, the American Academy of Pediatrics says.Moderna also is studying its Covid-19 shots in elementary school-age youngsters. Pfizer and Moderna are studying even younger children as well, down to 6-month-olds. Results are expected later in the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-says-covid-19-vaccine-more-than-90-effective-in-5-to-11-year-old-kids-101634905400159.html

The attackers, carrying guns, killed three teachers, two volunteers and a student in the world's largest refugee settlement.The violence erupted when one of the groups opened fire, killing four people at the scene, Police superintendent Shihab Kaiser Khan said. Two others succumbed to their injuries in the hospital."A drive is underway to arrest those responsible for the incident," Khan told Reuters. One Rohingya man with weapons and ammunition had been taken into custody, he said.It was unclear as to why the violence broke out, but the local media reported that the two sides clashed over establishing supremacy in the camp over an illegal drug business. A few Rohingya groups are known to be involved in crimes such as kidnapping and ransom-seeking, Bangladeshi officials have said, and they use the refugee camps to smuggle drugs from Myanmar.The attack comes three weeks after the murder of Mohibullah, a key international representative for Rohingya refugees, in the same sub-district of Ukhiya. Several arrests have been made in this case.More than a million Rohingya refugees inhabit in camps in southern Bangladesh, with most having fled neighbouring Myanmar during a military crackdown in 2007.These settlements grew increasingly violent, as per reports, with armed gangs vying for power, kidnapping critics and warning women against breaking conservative Islamic norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/six-dead-in-violent-clash-between-rohingya-refugee-groups-in-cox-bazar-101634891476206.html

Li Yundi, 39, and a 29-year-old woman, were detained by the police of Chaoyang district in Beijing on Thursday night.They admitted to the “illegal behaviour” and have been placed under administrative detention, the district police were quoted as saying by local media.Li Yundi, a national icon, wasn’t initially identified by the police who made public the news of the arrest through a cryptic post on China’s Twitter-like Weibo.A Weibo post written by the Beijing police on Thursday night, which carried the picture of a piano keyboard, said: “This world is indeed more than black and white, but black and white must be distinguished apart. Make no mistake...”People’s Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist Party of China later identified Li Yundi as the person picked up by the police.Li is a celebrity in China where learning piano is hugely popular among children and youth.Li was the youngest pianist, at 18, to win the XIV International Chopin Piano Competition in 2000. In 2015, he served as a judge for the competition.Besides performing across the world, the pianist had also performed several times at China’s national broadcaster, CCTV’s annual Spring Festival, or Chinese New Year, Gala, an annual show watched by hundreds of millions in China.On Sina Weibo, the hashtag, “Li Yundi detained for soliciting prostitute,” soared to the top of search rankings after just a few minutes, the Global Times reported.Li Yundi’s verified personal tags on Weibo, which had previously been described as “an international pianist, a member of the Standing Committee of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, a member of the Standing Committee of All-China Youth Federation, and the vice-president of the Hong Kong United Youth Association”, had been revoked and amended to “an international pianist,” the Global Times reported on Friday.The Chinese Musicians’ Association on Friday announced the removal of Li’s membership, for posing “extremely negative social impact”.A documentary film on Li and his rise in the world of classical piano music, titled The Young Romantic was released in 2010.“There are at least 20 million aspiring concert pianists in China. To all of them, Yundi is a hero.

22-10-2021||World||'No room for compromise': China tells US to act with caution over Taiwan||China on Friday urged Washington to tread carefully on Taiwan after president Joe Biden said the US would defend the self-ruled island from attacks by Beijing. “China has no room for compromise on issues involving its core interests,” foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said, warning that Washington “should act and speak cautiously on the Taiwan issue.”Authoritarian China regards self-ruled Taiwan as its own territory and has vowed to one day seize the island, by force if needed. Beijing's saber-rattling has ramped up in recent years, exacerbating fears the island of 23 million people could become a major global flashpoint.Joe Biden said on Thursday that the United States would defend Taiwan if the island were attacked by China, a declaration welcomed by the democratic island that risks fury from Beijing. However, Biden's statement was at odds with the long-held US policy known as "strategic ambiguity," where Washington helps build Taiwan's defenses but does not explicitly promise to come to the island's help. The policy is designed to deter a Chinese invasion and also discourage Taiwan from formally declaring independence, something Beijing regards as a red line.At a CNN town hall on Thursday, Biden was asked whether the US would come to Taiwan's defence if China invaded. “Yes,” he responded. “We have a commitment to that.” Biden's comments were welcomed on Friday by Taiwan, which has pushed to bolster international alliances to protect itself from Beijing.“The US government has demonstrated, through actual actions, their rock-solid support for Taiwan,” presidential office spokesperson Xavier Chang said in a statement.Biden had made a similar pledge in August during an interview with ABC, insisting that the US would always defend key allies, including Taiwan, despite the withdrawal from Afghanistan in the face of the victorious Taliban. The White House subsequently told reporters on both occasions that US policy on Taiwan “has not changed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-room-for-compromise-china-tells-us-to-act-with-caution-over-taiwan-101634889792533.html
22-10-2021||World||Beijing begins Covid booster shots four months ahead of Winter Olympics||Authorities in China have started offering booster shots against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Beijing and surrounding regions, four months before the capital city hosts the Winter Olympics, local media reports said.Beijing rolled out its booster campaign earlier this week and shots will be administered to those taking part or organising the Olympics. In addition, the Chinese capital will administer booster shots to people aged 18 and above who have been fully vaccinated and belong to at-risk groups.The Winter Olympics will begin on February 4 next year. Only residents from China will be allowed in the stands. The government will also mandate a three-week quarantine upon arrival for athletes who are not fully inoculated with vaccines approved by the World Health Organisation (WHO) or other national authorities, according to news agency Bloomberg.Authorities will enact a “closed-loop” which will limit the movement of participants to games venues and other related facilities, with designated transport. A book detailing virus countermeasures for the games might be released soon, Bloomberg further reported.Till now, Beijing has administered both vaccine doses to over 97% of its adult population. The Chinese capital, along with the whole country, has been adhering to a relentless zero-Covid approach with stringent border closures and targeted lockdowns.China, the country from where the Covid-19 pandemic originated, has for far reported 96,665 cases, 4,636 deaths, 91,511 recoveries and 518 active cases due to the viral disease. On Thursday, the country reported 43 new cases of which 28 were locally transmitted.In attempts to get rid of a new outbreak linked to a group of tourists, authorities in China have closed schools, cancelled hundreds of flights and have ramped up mass testing.The new outbreak is traced to an elderly couple who were in a group of other tourists, according to AFP. They had started their trip in Shanghai before going to Xi'an, Gansu province and Inner Mongolia. Dozens of infections have since been linked to their journey, with close contacts in five provinces and regions, including Beijing.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-begins-covid-booster-shots-four-months-ahead-of-winter-olympics-101634883597250.html

However, there have been no fatalities, the CDC said. Most of the cases were reported in August and September and largely from Texas and Oklahoma.The company has also informed health officials that since onions can be stored for months, it may still be in homes and businesses. Consumers have, as a result, been advised to avoid whole fresh red, white, or yellow onions imported from Chihuahua and distributed by ProSource.What is salmonella infection?Salmonellosis or salmonella infection is a bacterial disease caused by the Salmonella group of bacteria that typically cause gastronomical illnesses. According to the CDC, in some cases, it can also cause typhoid fever or paratyphoid fever.Symptoms of salmonella include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps that usually begin six hours to six days after developing the infection through contaminated food.Some strains of the bacteria can also cause infection in urine, blood, bones, joints, or the nervous system (spinal fluid and brain), and can cause severe disease.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also launched an investigation into the outbreak, along with the CDC and local authorities. “We will provide updates as we learn more,” it said.With inputs from Agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/salmonella-outbreak-over-650-fall-ill-in-us-from-disease-tied-to-onions-here-s-more-101634881279051.html
22-10-2021||World||China steps up psychological pressure on Taiwan with 'grey zone' jet incursions||Chinese fighter jets crowding Taiwan's radar screens are Beijing's latest tool to ramp up pressure on the democratic island, sparking fears that one mistake could suddenly turn a festering cold conflict into an all-out war.Self-ruled Taiwan has lived under the threat of a Chinese invasion since the two sides split at the end of a civil war in 1949.Its 23 million people have since learned to cope with periods of sabre-rattling from Beijing.But the sudden spike in Chinese warplanes crossing into the island's air defence identification zone (ADIZ) has focused attention on Taiwan, fuelling concerns it could become a global flashpoint.AFP has compiled a database that documents all the known incursions since Taiwan's defence ministry began making them public in September 2020, showing how sorties have crescendoed in frequency and size.The most dramatic incursion occurred at the start of this month as China marked its annual national day when a record 149 flights crossed into Taiwan's southwestern air defence zone in four days.Adding aggressiveness to the incursions, some of them even got personal.In one radio broadcast posted online by aviation fans, a Chinese pilot could be heard insulting the mother of a Taiwanese combat air traffic controller.'Psychological pressure'Those four days alone saw a 28 percent increase on the total for September which was, until then, the month with the highest number of flights at 117.Last year, Taiwan said it recorded some 380 incursions into its southwestern air defence zone. So far this year the total is already double that at 692, as of October 22.There has also been a steady increase in sorties using the kind of planes that would be used to strike Taiwan were an invasion to take place, including the nuclear-capable H6 bomber.In September 2020, the month that year with the highest number of sorties, Taiwan recorded incursions by 32 fighters and three bombers.So far this month, there have been 124 fighter jet incursions and 16 by bombers.Still, analysts say the threat posed by these incursions should not be exaggerated.The ADIZ is not the same as Taiwan's territorial airspace.Instead it includes a larger area that overlaps with part of China's own air defence identification zone -- and even covers some of the mainland.Nonetheless, it bears noting that until last year China very rarely crossed into the southwestern sector at all."These are part of what we call 'grey zone' tactics, it keeps psychological pressure on Taiwan," Lee Hsi-min, a retired admiral who stepped down as head of Taiwan's armed forces in 2019, told AFP.Greyzone is a term used by military analysts to describe aggressive actions by a state that stop short of open warfare -- what British defence secretary Ben Wallace has described as "the limbo land between peace and war".Taiwan has seen a surge in these kinds of threats since the 2016 election of President Tsai Ing-wen, whom China's leaders loathe because she views the island as sovereign and not part of Beijing's "one China".Lee cited grey zone measures such as ramped up cyber-attacks and disinformation campaigns to a massive increase in Chinese dredgers taking sand from waters surrounding Kinmen and Matsu, two Taiwanese islands just a few kilometres from the mainland.The ADIZ incursions, he added, allowed China to "improve pilot training", including the occasional night-time sorties, as well as test Taiwan's own defences.They also keep Taiwan's already ageing fleet of fighters under stress. There have been multiple fatal crashes blamed on mechanical failures.'Perfect storm'China, which has vowed to one day seize Taiwan, says little about its ADIZ incursions.But analysts say they send a message to three targets: Taiwan's government and people, China's increasingly nationalist domestic audience, and western powers.This month's record incursions came after naval exercises in the Pacific attended by multiple navies, including two US and one British aircraft carriers and a Japanese helicopter destroyer.It also came after Washington's recent deal to share nuclear submarine technology with Australia and confirmation that US special forces were training Taiwanese troops."Beijing wants to demonstrate that it will not be intimidated by regional security alliances in the making, which undoubtedly are aimed at China," J Michael Cole, an expert with the Washington-based Global Taiwan Institute."(It) also demonstrates to a domestic audience that it is not complacent about developments that favour Taiwan," he told AFP.The United States has long maintained a policy of "strategic ambiguity" towards Taiwan, selling its arms without explicitly promising to come to the island's help.But President Joe Biden has now twice stated that US forces would defend Taiwan's people if China made a move on them.While the ADIZ incursions remain far out to sea, many fear the rise in sorties increases the risk of a crash, collision or mistake that could spark a wider war.President Xi Jinping, China's most authoritarian leader since Mao Zedong, has made seizing Taiwan a key pledge as he engineers a third term push next year.China's increased forcefulness has prompted the US and Taiwanese officials to publicly warn that Beijing could be ready to invade in just a few years.Jia Qingguo, an international relations expert at Peking University who advises the Chinese government, published a stark paper earlier this summer in which he warned a "perfect storm" was brewing in the Taiwan Strait.Beijing's more aggressive treatment of Taiwan in recent years was "shaped by its growing military capabilities and increasing domestic demands for unification," he argued.China also feels pressured to act now against the growing relationship between Taiwan and the United States, where defending Taipei has become a rare bipartisan issue."The three sides have seen their interactions caught in a vicious spiral, making a military confrontation and even an all-out war an increasingly likely scenario," Jia warned.Su Tzu-yun, a military expert at Taiwan's Institute for National Defense and Security Research, said Taipei "should be more vigilant but it needn't be over-worried".An amphibious landing across the Taiwan Strait, he told AFP, still remains "the most complex military operation and if any part of the process is undermined, the operation would fail"."(China) could start a war but whether it could win it is a different thing," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-steps-up-psychological-pressure-on-taiwan-with-grey-zone-jet-incursions-101634881944483.html
22-10-2021||World||Islamic State, Al-Qaeda have increased online propaganda, warns FATF||The Islamic State and Al-Qaeda have increased online propaganda to incite unaffiliated individuals to launch attacks and to raise funds since last year and the risk of “self-financed, radicalised lone actor terrorists” is significant, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has warned.The multilateral watchdog expressed “grave concern” over a series of terror attacks in Afghanistan, Iraq and other regions, including Africa and South Asia, in a special statement issued at the conclusion of its plenary meeting on Thursday. The plenary is the decision-making body of FATF, and delegates representing 205 members of the Global Network and observer organisations, including the International Monetary Fund and the UN, participated in the hybrid meeting.“The threat of terrorism remains serious in many regions of the world,” the statement said, adding that the recent terror attacks, claimed either by Islamic State or Da’esh and its “affiliated groups, or conducted by lone attackers inspired by them”, had killed or injured hundreds, mostly civilians. “Since 2020, both ISIL and Al-Qaeda have increased their online propaganda, either to incite unaffiliated individuals to launch attacks, or to raise funds. The risk of self-financed, radicalised lone actor terrorists remains significant,” the statement said. FATF concluded that both groups have “increasingly turned to new payment technologies to raise, move and deploy funds”, and the use of virtual assets by terrorists remains a risk. “In addition, the risk emanating from expansion of affiliates of ISIL and Al-Qaeda has been increasing over the past years,” the watchdog said. Both Islamic State and Al-Qaeda have a presence in Afghanistan, which was taken over by the Taliban following the collapse of the elected government in mid-August. In a separate statement also issued on Thursday, FATF had warned “about the current and evolving money laundering and terrorist financing risk environment” in Afghanistan. The territorial defeat of the Islamic State in 2019 had significantly impacted its ability to generate revenue, but the group is “still able to raise and receive funds, through legal and illegal sources, and maintains roughly $25-50 million in reserves”, FATF said. “These funds help the group to sustain some activities and to seek a potential resurgence. Proceeds generated from criminal activities remain an important financing source for ISIL,” it added. In order to increase its revenues, the Islamic State has “focused on looting local civilians and businesses, and has generated funds through kidnapping for ransom, extortion of oil networks in Eastern Syria, and possibly through the trafficking of human beings and the trafficking of antiquities previously looted”. The group also “generates funds from investments in small and medium-sized businesses”.On the other hand, Al-Qaeda and its affiliates have “consistent streams of revenue generated from various sources, including contributions and donations from their supporters, proceeds generated from criminal activities such as drug trafficking, extortion, kidnapping and illicit taxation of smuggled goods, as well as revenues generated from investments in legal businesses”. In some instances, these terror groups collected and transferred funds under the disguise of charitable activities.While continuing with its focus on countering terror financing, the FATF has completed projects to analyse the terrorist financing risks associated with illegal arms trafficking and with ethnically or racially motivated terrorism. It has launched projects to study money laundering and terror financing risks emanating from migrant smuggling. The watchdog is also gathering and sharing information on the financing of Islamic State, Al-Qaeda and their affiliates, and will produce “updated risk indicators to help the public and private sectors detect terrorist financing”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fatf-expresses-grave-concern-says-islamic-state-al-qaeda-have-increased-online-propaganda-101634879981297.html
22-10-2021||World||Covid-19: Canada lifts advisory on non-essential travel abroad||The Canadian government has removed its global travel advisory on all non-essential travel outside the country. The caution had been in place since the spring of 2020 as the Covid-19 pandemic first spread internationally and into Canada.That advisory was updated on Thursday even as the Canadian government also announced the launch of a vaccine passport, a standardised certification of being fully vaccinated, to facilitate domestic and international travel.However, it has retained the stringent requirement for direct flights to India, keeping in place the need to get a negative RT-PCR test result, taken within 18 hours of departure, from a single laboratory based at Delhi airport.This testing requirement was enforced as the earlier ban on direct passenger flights from India was lifted on September 27. Travellers will still need to provide proof of a negative Covid-19 molecular test from the approved Genestrings Laboratory at the Delhi airport taken within 18 hours of the scheduled departure of their direct flight to Canada and “present the test report with a QR code issued by this laboratory to the air operator before boarding”.“Airlines will refuse boarding to any traveller who’s unable to meet these requirements,” it stressed. These measures have been maintained even as airlines ramp up operations between the two countries with Air Canada announcing a new direct flight from Delhi to Montreal. That city in Quebec will join Toronto and Vancouver with direct flights connecting India and Canada. “Starting October 31, just in time for Diwali celebrations, Air Canada will offer three flights per week to the growing Indian community in Montreal,” the airline had said. It has also increased the frequency of its flights between Toronto and Delhi to ten per week.As per the India-specific travel advisory, Canadians have been asked to “exercise a high degree of caution due to the threat of terrorist attacks throughout the country”. In particular, it warns against all travel to the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir “due to the unpredictable security situation. There is a threat of terrorism, militancy, civil unrest and kidnapping”. That warning excludes the union territory of Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canada-lifts-advisory-on-non-essential-travel-abroad-101634879978760.html

The move is likely to boost tourism, a sector the Asian country's economy is majorly dependent on.On Thursday, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said travellers from these 46 countries can skip mandatory quarantine as long as they arrive via air, are fully inoculated and have a document to show they are Covid-19 free.The quarantine-free travel list also includes most of the countries in the European Union, Australia, Singapore, Canada, Israel, Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong.Earlier, the government announced the mandatory quarantine requirement would end for at least 10 countries, including the US, China, the UK and Singapore.Two days ago, government officials inspected the readiness of Thailand's airports to welcome quarantine-free travellers."The entire time a visitor will spend from getting through the terminal gates to leaving the airport would take no more than 25 minutes," transport minister Saksiam Chidchob told reporters after paying a visit to Bangkok's Don Muang airport on Wednesday, according to news agency Reuters.Chidchod said travellers and investors from at least 10 countries that are in health-safe zones and are also doing great financially could visit Thailand.According to a Royal Gazette issued on Thursday, the capital city of Bangkok and other key tourist spots will be reopened once the curfews are lifted at the end of this month.Reuters further reported that in 2020, Thailand lost about $50 billion in tourism revenue, an 82% drop. This year, just 1,00,000 travellers from abroad are expected to visit the country, the tourism authority of Thailand said.Thailand has so far reported 18,31,389 cases due to the coronavirus disease which include 18,625 deaths, 1,02,317 active cases (at present) and 17,10,447 recoveries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-from-november-1-thailand-to-allow-quarantine-free-travel-from-46-nations-101634872074036.html
22-10-2021||World||Bangladesh: ‘Over 3,600 attacks’ on Hindus since 2013, rights groups concerned||With recent violent attacks against Hindus reopening old wounds for religious minorities in Bangladesh, human rights groups have now pointed out that such attacks often go unpunished in the Muslim-majority country even when there has been a “continual pattern” over nearly a decade.According to estimates provided by a Deutsche Welle report citing Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK), a Bangladeshi human rights organisation that documents attacks on minority communities, there have been over 3,600 attacks in Bangladesh targeting Hindus since 2013. The Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (BHBCUC), however, told the news agency the actual number of attacks could be much higher than what the ASK has estimated.The study found the attacks against Hindus over the eight years include cases of vandalism and arson targeting over 550 houses and 440 shops and businesses. More than 1,670 cases of vandalism and arson attacks on Hindu temples, idols, and places of worship were also reported during the same period.Also Read | Bangladesh riots: Prime suspect Iqbal Hossain arrested from Cox's BazarAs many as 11 members of the Hindu community died in these violent incidents, while another 862 were injured. Several instances of sexual assault against Hindu women were also reported during this time.Rana Dasgupta, the general secretary of the BHBCUC, also said the real extent of these damages could be much higher. “Although Hindus were also attacked in the 1990s and 2000s, we have been observing a continual pattern of such attacks since 2011, which is alarming,” he said. “We thought the Hindu community would have a better life under the Awami League government, but that didn't happen.”In Bangladesh, Hindus now comprise less than nine per cent of the total population. The census numbers have shown a marked reduction in the Hindu population over the past four decades, as per the report citing government data. It shows that over the course of the last 40 years, the percentage of the Hindu population of Bangladesh declined from 13.5% to 8.5%.Dasgupta said security crisis was the chief reason behind Hindus leaving Bangladesh for neighbouring India, although economic reasons also played a part. “The reason behind the attacks is to drive away minorities from their homes, to minimise the minority population of Bangladesh,” he said.Attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh often unpunishedDasgupta blamed religious fundamentalists, particularly supporters of Bangladesh's largest Islamic party, Jamaat-e-Islami, for attacks on the Hindu community. However, the party has been largely inactive after many of its leaders were executed a few years ago for war crimes committed during the 1971 war of independence against Pakistan.Zunaid Saki, the chief coordinator of the left-wing political party Ganasamhati Andolon, told DW the Awami League condemns the attacks, but does little to stop them from happening again.Saki has visited many locations where attacks against the Hindu community have taken place in recent years.“The pattern of these attacks is the same: First, something is posted on Facebook and is marked as ‘insulting to Islam’ by others, and then a group of people attack a particular spot where religious minorities live,” he said.“The ruling Awami League party blames religious fundamentalists after the attack and vows to take action against the culprits. But nothing happens afterward, and nobody gets punished for the attacks.”Several Hindu temples in Bangladesh were ransacked last week during violent protests triggered by video footage that showed the Quran – the holy book in Islam – being placed at the feet of a Hindu idol during Durga Puja celebrations in the country. (With inputs from DW)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-over-3-600-attacks-on-hindus-since-2013-rights-groups-concerned-101634868827734.html
22-10-2021||World||Bangladesh riots: Prime suspect Iqbal Hossain arrested from Cox's Bazar||Hours after one Iqbal Hossain was identified by the Bangladesh police as the key suspect in instigating the recent violence in Comilla and other places, he was arrested from Cox's Bazar on Thursday, according to a report by Dhaka Tribune that cited the Comilla superintendent of police (SP), Faruk Ahmed.The senior officer said Hossain, who was earlier accused of keeping the Islamic holy book Quran at a Durga Puja venue, was nabbed from the Shugandha beach area of Cox's Bazar around 10.10pm.The Bangladeshi newspaper also cited Cox's Bazar additional police superintendent Md Rafiqul Islam, who confirmed the development and said Hossain was sent to Comilla “right away” after the arrest.The 35-year-old Hossain, hailing from the Suhanagar area of Comilla, allegedly placed the Holy Quran at one of the Durga Puja pandals on October 13, which triggered the violence killing at least three persons. The man was identified after police analysed hours of video footage from CCTV cameras installed at Durga Puja venues.Hossain, in the footage, could be seen taking the Quran from a local mosque and entering a Durga Puja site. He was later seen walking away with a club, taken from an idol of Lord Hanuman.Several Hindu temples in Bangladesh were ransacked later amid violent protests after the video footage went viral on social media posts that showed the Quran being placed at the feet of a Hindu idol. On Sunday, a mob damaged 66 houses and set on fire at least 20 homes of Hindus.Police said over 450 suspected temple attackers have been arrested so far in different parts of the country. Forty-one of them have been arrested for the Comilla incident and four of them are Hossain's associates.The attacks on Hindus in the Muslim-majority country are, however, not new; human rights groups say there has been a “continual pattern” of attacks on religious minorities over nearly a decade and the recent spree in violence has only managed to reopen old wounds. According to estimates provided by a Deutsche Welle report citing Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK), a Bangladeshi human rights organisation that documents attacks on minority communities, there have been over 3,600 attacks in Bangladesh targeting Hindus since 2013. Other groups, however, note that the actual number of attacks could be much higher than what the ASK has estimated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-violence-prime-accused-iqbal-hossain-arrested-from-cox-s-bazar-101634872140455.html

For more than a week, the country has recorded over 40,000 cases. On Thursday, the daily tally crossed the 50,000-mark with 52,009 people testing positive for the virus, the highest single-day increase since July 17. As many as 115 patients died from related complications, while another 29,000 recovered during the day.At present, the UK has 14,44,489 active cases, while the cumulative tallies stand at 86,41,221 infections, 1,39,146 deaths and 70,57,586 recoveries.On Wednesday, health minister Sajid Javid said daily cases in the UK could rise up to 1,00,000, adding the pandemic was not over yet.Increase in Covid-19 hospitalisationsBesides the rise in cases, there has also been an increase in the number of hospital admissions. On Thursday, 959 patients were hospitalised, pushing the total number of admissions to over 563,000. Health care facilities are once again on the brink of being overwhelmed ahead of winter.“Everything is hitting us at once,” Tim Spector, a professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London said, according to a New York Times report. “We’re in a no man’s land,” Spector, who is leading a major study of Covid-19 symptoms, added.No fresh restrictions at presentDespite the increased spread of the virus, the Boris Johnson government has said no fresh restrictions will be reimposed for now. “We are looking closely at the data, we are not implementing Plan B at this point,” the health minister said on Wednesday.The UK has virtually lifted all restrictions over the past four months even as the infection rate remained high, the New York Times report said. According to the government, the rapid rollout of vaccines has weakened the link between infection and serious illness.Previously, Matthew Taylor, head of the NHS Confederation, had urged the Johnson administration to bring back some restrictions such as compulsory wearing of masks in crowded places, working from home (WFH) and imposing a ban on unnecessary indoor gatherings. Several European countries, including France, have reintroduced similar curbs to contain the spread of the deadly infection.‘Watching the numbers very carefully every day’: UK PMThe Prime Minister said on Thursday that his government was watching the Covid-19 figures very carefully every day. “The numbers of infections are high but we are within the parameters of what the predictions were,” Johnson said.Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, Johnson and his ministers have repeatedly faced criticism for reacting too slowly at critical stages of the pandemic.(With inputs from agencies, New York Times)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-uk-s-daily-count-crosses-50-000-again-boris-govt-says-no-to-curbs-101634865829854.html

Indian doctors affirm that there is a short term effect of vaccination in boosting mental health as highlighted by the study.However, the Indian doctors emphasized the lack of a similar study in India, which could establish a correlation between vaccination and its impact on mental health.The research by the Centre for Economic and Social Research (CESR) at the University of Southern California published recently a study in the journal PLOS that stated, "Getting the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine resulted in significant improvements in mental health beyond improvement already achieved since mental distress peaked in spring 2020."The researchers analyzed 8,003 adults who were, surveyed at regular intervals between March 10, 2020, and March 31, 2021. It found out that "people who were vaccinated between December 2020 and March 2021 reported decreased mental distress levels in the surveys conducted after receiving the first dose."Talking about the US study, Dr Nand Kumar, professor and in-charge, ICMR CARE in Neuromodulation for Mental Health, Department of Psychiatry, AIIMS, New Delhi said, "I think they have covered a good sample. They have covered over 8000 people. It is a good study. But, for vaccines per se, there is no scientific data that says that there is any biological effect of the vaccine that can boost mental health. But vaccine certainly helps in improving mental health in general."Dr Kumar noted that it is not easy to compare the people who are vaccinated and who are not vaccinated on their mental health."They have looked at the short term effects of vaccination. There have used mental health questionnaire. It's not very easy to compare the people who are vaccinated and who are not vaccinated on their mental health. You need a very robust kind of randomized controlled trial. The short term is fine. A long term study requires logistic support and good funding and design. If the short term effect of the study is concerned, then, I agree with it," he stated."Certainly vaccination has improved mental health not directly but indirectly by boosting people confidence about safety that they are vaccinated and they are safe. People have become more outgoing, confident in going out and meeting people. The fear of the pandemic and that they will be affected by the virus has come down significantly. Before vaccination, there were anxiety, apprehension and fear of getting infected, fear of death," Dr Kumar added.Sharing his observation, Dr Jaswant Jangra, Senior resident Psychiatry at AIIMS New Delhi noted that people have become assured after getting vaccinated against Covid-19."The people, I have observed have become assured after getting vaccinated against Covid-19, that they won't get admitted in hospital due to the infection, that their chance of mortality would decrease after taking the Covid- 19 vaccine," said Dr Jangra.He said that he observed that his patients, especially the ones who have completed both the doses of vaccines are now feeling a bit relaxed and their relapses are less."The stress levels and anxiety level pertaining to Covid- 19 is much less," noted Dr Jangra."However, India has not done any specific studies so far and there is a need for such studies to show a positive correlation between vaccination and mental health," he added.Sharing his insight on the US study, a Psychiatrist at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Dr Rajeev Mehta said, "This is not a direct effect of vaccines rather it's the impact of getting vaccinated. And it is true that it decreases anxiety levels."The purpose of the study was to examine short-term changes in mental distress after the first inoculation of the Covid-19 vaccine.The researchers who undertook the study said the results should be interpreted as the short-term direct effects of getting a first vaccine dose."The overall contribution of vaccine uptake on improving mental health outcomes is potentially much larger, as it affects not only those vaccinated but also the unvaccinated," stated the study.An unvaccinated individual may still benefit from the reduced prevalence rates in the population, may become less worried about loved ones, and may benefit from increased social and economic opportunities if the vaccine rollout results in more social and economic activity due to lower disease risk, added the study.The experts also talked about the vaccine hesitancy that the people experienced when the vaccine rollout began. People with mental illness were the worst affected."People with obsessive fear, anxiety disorder had a lot of stress regarding Covid-19. Initially, they had apprehension before vaccination. They asked me whether we should go for vaccination or not. They stressed contraindications on vaccines. However, I always suggested they go for it," said Dr Jangra."A lot of my patients had anxiety whether the jab will produce any result or its just eyewash. Even when people started going for vaccination, there were rumours that soon after getting their vaccine jab, people are got the infection, however, it is false as, it might have been because the people did not follow social distancing, or they mingled with someone who has contracted Covid or has not sanitized their hands properly while waiting in the crowd that came to vaccinate themselves," said Dr Mehta."This misbelieve also created a lot of anxiety among people who generally avoided getting vaccinated or kept postponing it," added Dr Mehta.About half of the population faced the psychological impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. Poor sleep quality (40 per cent), stress (34 per cent), and psychological distress (34 per cent) were the most reported problems across various studies, stated a study published in the Indian Journal of Psychiatry, on the prevalence of psychological morbidities among the general population, healthcare workers, and Covid-19 patients.Dr Kumar in this regard added, "There were relapses in the mental health patients during the Covid-19 pandemic, as they were not able to meet, there was no socialization, there was intense anxiety among people regarding the disease"."About two-fifths (38.2 per cent) had anxiety and 10.5 per cent of the participants had depression. Overall, 40.5 per cent of the participants had either anxiety or depression. Moderate level of stress was reported by about three-fourth (74.1 per cent) of the participants and 71.7 per cent reported poor well-being," stated Psychological impact of Covid-19 lockdown: An online survey from India under the aegis of the Indian Psychiatry Society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-doctors-affirm-study-that-says-1st-dose-of-vaccine-boosts-mental-health-101634864737697.html

The Palace said the Queen was admitted to the private King Edward VII's Hospital in London on Wednesday for “preliminary investigations”."Following medical advice to rest for a few days, the Queen attended hospital on Wednesday afternoon for some preliminary investigations, returning to Windsor Castle at lunchtime today (Thursday), and remains in good spirits," a statement read.The Queen returned to Windsor Castle on Thursday, where she has been living since March 2020 when the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic struck. According to news agency AFP, the decision on self-isolation was taken because of the increased risk of infection due to her age, although she has since been vaccinated against the viral disease.On Wednesday, the 95-year-old British monarch called off her visit to Northern Ireland to mark a century since the creation of the country and Buckingham Palace said she “reluctantly” accepted medical advice to rest for a few days.In less than a fortnight, the Queen is due to host world leaders at the United Nations (UN) climate summit in Scotland.She has had a busy schedule in recent days. Last week, the Queen delivered a speech at the opening of the Welsh Assembly in Cardiff. During the weekend, she spent a day at the Ascot racecourse.On Monday, she held a virtual audience with New Zealand's new governor-general, and on Tuesday, she received two ambassadors, also by video link.On Tuesday evening, the Queen hosted a reception at Windsor for global business leaders who were attending a government investment summit, including Microsoft's co-founder and billionaire Bill Gates and senior British ministers.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-elizabeth-ii-spends-a-night-in-hospital-after-years-for-tests-101634861925966.html

Khan, however, said she would "fully support efforts to reassert that authority."Google and Verizon declined comment while the others did not immediately respond to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/internet-providers-collect-staggering-amounts-of-data-us-ftc-chair-101634854790974.html

The phase three trial with “10,000 participants 16 years of age and older” showed “a relative vaccine efficacy of 95.6% against disease during a period when Delta was the prevalent strain”, the companies said in a statement.The study presented the “first results” of a booster trial, with a third shot of the vaccine demonstrating a “favourable safety profile”. “These results provide further evidence of the benefits of boosters as we aim to keep people well-protected against this disease,” said Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla.The preliminary results would be shared with regulatory agencies “as soon as possible”, the companies said.Infections, fears rise across Britain, ChinaUnder pressure from rising infections and worried health experts, the British government on Wednesday urged millions of people to get booster vaccine shots but resisted calls to reimpose restrictions such as mandatory mask-wearing.Health secretary Sajid Javid said the government would “stay vigilant, preparing for all eventualities”, but would not trigger its “Plan B” of bringing back restrictions on daily life. He made the plea as he warned that new daily virus cases could rise to 100,000.China reported 20 local infections on Thursday following a flare-up in the northwestern provinces, with cases spreading across the country to areas including Beijing. At least eight provinces have reported infections in the past week, fuelling concerns.

China firmly rejects them,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a press conference on Thursday.“Issues related to Taiwan, Xinjiang and Hong Kong are purely China’s internal affairs that brook no foreign interference. The accusation of the so-called ‘genocide’ in Xinjiang is an outrageous lie fabricated,” he said.Burns emphasised building alliances in the Indo-Pacific as essential to countering China. He also gave what would be a rare bit of credit from the Biden administration to its predecessor, praising President Donald Trump and his last secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, for reinvigorating a bloc with Australia, India and Japan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-can-t-be-trusted-says-biden-s-pick-as-new-us-ambassador-to-china-101634843032870.html

The independent Congressional Research Service (CRS), in a latest report this week, said that although the US, Russia and China possess the most advanced hypersonic weapons programmes, a number of other countries, including Australia, India, France, Germany and Japan, are also developing hypersonic weapons technology. While Australia has collaborated with the US, India has collaborated with Russia on this, the CRS said in its report. India has collaborated with Russia on the development of BrahMos II, a Mach 7 hypersonic cruise missile, the CRS report said. “Although BrahMos II was initially intended to be fielded in 2017, news reports indicate that the programme faces significant delays and is now scheduled to achieve initial operational capability between 2025 and 2028. “Reportedly, India is also developing an indigenous, dual-capable hypersonic cruise missile as part of its Hypersonic Technology Demonstrator Vehicle programme and successfully tested a Mach 6 scramjet in June 2019 and September 2020,” the CRS said. India operates approximately 12 hypersonic wind tunnels and is capable of testing speeds of up to Mach 13, said the Congressional report which is prepared by independent subject area experts for members of the US Congress. The Financial Times this week reported that China has tested hypersonic missiles. However, China denied it, saying it tested a hypersonic “vehicle” and not a nuclear-capable hypersonic “missile” as reported by the leading British newspaper which also said that the missile missed its target by about two-dozen miles. The report said that China tested the nuclear-capable hypersonic missile in August that circled the globe before speeding towards its target, demonstrating an advanced space capability that caught US intelligence by surprise. According to the CRS, since 2007, the US has collaborated with Australia on the Hypersonic International Flight Research Experimentation (HIFiRE) programme to develop hypersonic technologies.The most recent HIFiRE test, successfully conducted in July 2017, explored the flight dynamics of a Mach 8 hypersonic glide vehicle, while previous tests explored scramjet engine technologies, it said. HIFiRE’s successor, the Southern Cross Integrated Flight Research Experiment (SCIFiRE) programme, is to further develop hypersonic air-breathing technologies. SCIFiRE demonstration tests are expected by the mid-2020s. In addition to the Woomera Test Range facilities, one of the largest weapons test facilities in the world, Australia reportedly operates seven hypersonic wind tunnels and is capable of testing speeds of up to Mach 30, the report said. Like India, France has also collaborated and contracted with Russia on the development of hypersonic technology. And Japan is developing the Hypersonic Cruise Missile (HCM) and the Hyper Velocity Gliding Projectile (HVGP), it said. The CRS said that in recent years, the US has focused such efforts on developing hypersonic glide vehicles, which are launched from a rocket before gliding to a target, and hypersonic cruise missiles, which are powered by high-speed, air-breathing engines during flight. The Department of Defence (DOD) is currently developing hypersonic weapons under the Navy’s Conventional Prompt Strike programme, which is intended to provide the US military with the ability to strike hardened or time-sensitive targets with conventional warheads, as well as through several Air Force, Army and DARPA programmes, the CRS said. According to the CRS, unlike programmes in China and Russia, US hypersonic weapons are to be conventionally armed. “As a result, US hypersonic weapons will likely require greater accuracy and will be more technically challenging to develop than nuclear-armed Chinese and Russian systems,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-among-select-few-countries-developing-hypersonic-missiles-us-congressional-report-101634924922690.html

A delegation of the organisation submitted representations to chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb’s office and the state director general of police, asking them to ensure steps are taken to stop the attacks and legal action taken against the persons behind the incidents. “No person from the Hindu and Muslim communities in Tripura supports this kind of violence in Bangladesh. We have also protested against it,” the organisation’s president Mufti Tayebur Rahman told reporters at Gedu Miah mosque in Agartala on Friday evening.He added that some mosques and residential areas of the minority community were attacked, mostly in parts of West, North and Gomati districts of Tripura.BJP spokesperson Nabendu Bhattacharya said: “Our party workers, mainly from minority cell, are keeping a close watch everywhere to ensure such undesirable activities do not happen.”CPM secretary Jitendra Chaudhury expressed hope that the state government takes proper steps to maintain peace.Top Tripura police officers could not be contacted for their reaction to the group’s representation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-muslim-body-alleges-attacks-on-mosques-says-attempt-to-malign-govt-101634924442749.html

Aryan Khan moved the high court soon after his bail plea was rejected by the special NDPS court. The details of Aryan Khan's high court plea has now come to the surface.In his bail plea, Aryan Khan said that the chats that are being relied upon by the NCB are ex-facie (on the face of it) and those chats are from a period prior to the incident. "By no stretch of imagination can those purported messages be linked to any conspiracy for which the secret information was received," it said.Shah Rukh Khan, Aryan spoke on intercom inside jail, no special treatment given: Reports"The interpretation of the WhatsApp messages is that of the investigating officer and such interpretation is unjustified and wrong," the appeal said.'Let's have a blast', 'jugaad', 'Bulk quantity': What NCB said about Aryan Khan's WhatsApp chatsAryan Khan was arrested on October 3 from a Goa-bound cruise where a rave party was being hosted. He was not found carrying drugs while his friend Arbaaz Merchant was found in possession of six gram charas. The allegations against Aryan Khan of being a part of a drug network have been brought based on his WhatsApp chats. Bollywood actor Ananya Panday has also been called based on WhatsApp chats.NCB said Aryan Khan's WhatsApp chats had mentions of hard drugs and bulk quantity. He was also in touch with drugs suppliers, the agency said.He had written 'Let's have a blast' to Arbaaz Merchant, the NCB has disclosed to the court. He had also asked Ananya Panday for ganja 'jugaad', to which Ananya replied that she would arrange and this happened thrice. WhatsApp chats with Ananya took place during 2018-19, reports said, while Ananya has reportedly refused the allegations and said she never arranged drugs for Aryan. She said her chats were meant as a joke.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/misinterpreting-whatsapp-chats-what-aryan-khan-said-in-his-high-court-plea-101634921742530.html
22-10-2021||India||Successful UPSC candidates have no right to be allocated cadre of their choice: Supreme Court||Setting aside the orders passed by the Kerala high court, the Supreme Court on Friday said that successful civil services candidates have no right to be allocated a cadre or place of appointment of their choice as they opt to serve anywhere in the country with “eyes wide open”. A bench comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramanian held that if candidates from Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), or Other Backward Class (OBC) get selected in the general category without recourse to the benefit of reservation, they cannot use it for getting cadre or place of appointment of choice.Justice Gupta, who authored the 36-page judgement for the bench, noted that “scramble for the home cadre” starts once the candidates get selected to All-India Service. Referring to the Indian Administrative Service (Recruitment) Rules, the bench said that the procedure for allocation of cadre is a “mechanical process” and the State has no discretion at its “whims and fancies.”“It was held that a selected candidate has a right to be considered for appointment to the IAS but he has no such right to be allocated to a cadre of his choice or his home state. As stated above, allotment of cadre is an incidence of service,” the court said.“The applicant as a candidate for the All-India Service with eyes wide open has opted to serve anywhere in the country. Once an applicant gets selected to service, the scramble for the home cadre starts...,” Justice Gupta noted.The observation came after the Central government challenged a verdict of the Kerala high court which had asked it to grant home cadre Kerala to A Shainamol, a Muslim woman IAS officer who was posted in Himachal Pradesh. Shainamol secured 20th rank in the UPSC civil services examination 2006 under the general category despite belonging to the reserved Muslim OBC category.She was allocated Himachal Pradesh cadre but the IAS officer moved the Ernakulam Bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal against the allocation. The tribunal directed the Centre to accommodate her against “the outsider OBC vacancy in the Maharashtra cadre by virtue of her merit over the candidate already identified and allotted the Maharashtra cadre.”After both the Centre and the IAS officer challenged the verdict in Kerala high court, it allowed Shainamol’s plea seeking the declaration that she was eligible to be allotted home state cadre.“The entire basis of the claim of the applicant is that there was no consultation with the State of Kerala. The said argument is however untenable. The applicant was allocated to the State of Himachal Pradesh and there was consent duly given by the State of Himachal Pradesh for her allocation to that State. In fact, no consultation was required to be carried out in respect of the applicant with Kerala State,” the apex court held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/successful-upsc-candidates-have-no-right-to-be-allocated-cadre-of-their-choice-supreme-court-101634919499140.html

In Punjab, the jurisdiction of BSF was extended to 50 kilometre (km), up from the existing 15 km, along the international border in the state.Channi’s office insisted that restoring the status quo of BSF’s jurisdiction will“enable BSF and Punjab Police to work together against anti-national forces for safeguarding sovereignty and territorial integrity of India”.Similar extensions are also being enforced in West Bengal, and Assam whereas in Gujarat the existing jurisdiction of 80 km is being rolled back to 50 km, and in Rajasthan, the jurisdiction, which currently extends to 50 km of the international border, will remain unchanged.The two opposition-ruled states-Punjab and West Bengal - criticised the Centre’s move as an “attack on the country’s federal structure”. Channi had vehemently criticised the extension, telling reporters that the Congress government will not accept the Centre’s decision to allow BSF’s jurisdiction to be extended from the existing 15km as "it is against the spirit of federalism".Channi insisted that the state police is more than capable of handling law and order situations across the state as it has been doing so since the days of militancy and ensuring communal harmony is not disturbed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/relook-and-restore-status-quo-punjab-cm-on-centre-s-decision-to-extend-bsf-s-jurisdiction-101634917935816.html

The protests would also mark the completion of 11 months of farmers’ protests against the Centre’s three farm laws, the SKM further said.The SKM, an umbrella body of several farmer unions, in a statement on the day asked the Union government to fulfil its “legitimate demands” namely, repeal of the three farm laws, legal guarantee on minimum support price (MSP) and the removal of Mishra from his ministerial position.“The SKM has now put out a call to all constituents to mark October 26 with country-wide protests, to intensify the demand for Ajay Mishra Teni's dismissal and arrest, and to mark the completion of 11 long months of peaceful struggle,” news agency PTI reported quoting the SKM’s statement.Also read | SKM suspends Yogendra Yadav for meeting kin of BJP worker killed in Lakhimpur Kheri violence“On that day, between 11 am and 2 pm, there will be sit-ins and marches,” the SKM further said. Previously, the SKM demanded that Mishra be removed from his post before October 11, failing which it would intensify the protests. While the minister’s son has been arrested in connection with the case, the senior Mishra continued as a minister.Earlier on October 3, eight people were dead in the violence that broke out in Lakhimpur Kheri where a running vehicle, allegedly carrying BJP workers, had rammed into a group of protesting farmers. Of the eight dead, four were farmers. Also, two BJP workers and their driver and a journalist were also killed in the violence that followed. Farmers have alleged that Ashish Mishra was in one of the vehicles, a claim denied by him and minister Ajay Mishra.In a related development, the SKM has also postponed a ‘Kisan Mahapanchayat’ (farmers’ gathering) that was scheduled to be held on October 26 in Lucknow protesting the Lakhimpur incident. However, it has now been postponed by the body due to adverse weather conditions and the harvest season, news agency PTI reported on the day.On October 18, the SKM held ‘rail roko’ agitations by protesting on the railway tracks against the incident, reiterating its demand for the removal of Mishra. The protests lasted for six hours between 10am and 4pm on the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-violence-skm-calls-for-countrywide-protests-on-oct-26-demanding-resignation-of-minister-ajay-mishra-101634917535604.html
22-10-2021||India||‘Why are you so perturbed’: Punjab deputy CM now directly attacks Captain over Aroosa Alam||Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa on Friday took to Twitter and asked former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh why he is so perturbed if the government investigates the ISI link of Captain's Pakistani friend Aroosa Alam. He also said the government will probe who sponsored her visa, after Amarinder Singh slammed the ‘personal attack' following Sukhjinder Singh's announcement of the investigation. On Friday, the deputy chief minister who also is the home minister of the Union territory said the government will look into the ISI links of Captain's friend Aroosa Alam. Captain raised the issue of drones coming from Pakistan, he said. The war of words on Friday touched a new low following Captain's resignation from the post of Punjab chief minister. Amarinder Singh has not yet resigned from the party but has announced that he will form a new outfit which will be open to ally with the BJP if the farmers' issue is addressed. Time and again, Captain mentioned that Sidhu is a threat to national security because of his closeness with Pakistan and Pakistan army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa. (4/4) By the way,sir @capt_amarinder why are you so perturbed over probe on Aroosa and ISI links? Who sponsored her visa and everything concerning her will be throughly probed. I do hope eveyone concerned will co-operate with police in probeIt is in the same thread of security that Punjab deputy chief minister referred to Aroosa Alam.Amarinder Singh slammed the personal attack and said the government is deploying its resources in a baseless investigation instead of focusing on maintaining law and order. Amarinder Singh also said that Aroosa Aam had been coming to India for 16 years with due clearance from the government of India. "You were a minister in my cabinet. Never heard you complain about Aroosa Alam," Captain tweeted through his media advisor tagging Sukhjinder Singh Randhwa. He also asked the deputy CM whether he hinted that all the governments at the Centre in the last 16 years, including the UPA, connived with Pakistan ISI.What Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa said“I am a true nationalist and you better know @capt_amarinder from which point our differences had erupted. Whereas, you don’t worry about law and order situation as we have not outsourced the Punjab govt to 'anyone'. Now, police is protecting people, not cheekus and seetafal. Regarding poll promises, let me remind your sir that it was you who failed to take the probe in Maur blast, Bargari sacrilege and drugs cases to logical conclusions Rest assured, all these cases will be taken to logical conclusion in coming days. Almighty is always great as you have suffered because you failed to fulfil the commitment towards Guru Sahib even after taking oath of holy ‘Gutka Sahib’. Punjab is and will remain in safe hands under the Congress government. By the way, sir, why are you so perturbed over probe on Aroosa and ISI links? Who sponsored her visa and everything concerning her will be thoroughly probed. I do hope eveyone concerned will co-operate with police in probe,” the minister wrote on Twitter, replying to all the allegations that Amarinder Singh brought against him, including personal attack, Punjab's law and order situation, Congress's ‘tall promises’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-are-you-so-perturbed-punjab-deputy-cm-now-directly-attacks-captain-over-aroosa-alam-101634915801354.html

The camp would be held in 50,000 vaccination centres, state health minister Ma Subramanian on Friday said.“The 6th ‘Mega Vaccine Camp’ is scheduled to be held at 50,000 centers under the guidance of the Hon'ble Chief Minister (MK Stalin),” Subramanian tweeted. “Nearly, 30.43 lakh beneficiaries will be administered the second dose in the sixth mega camp,” news agency PTI quoted the minister as saying earlier on October 18.Meanwhile, the state has so far held five mega vaccination camps, which the government has claimed is being used not only to improve the vaccination rate but also to create awareness among the public. Earlier in September, TN chief minister MK Stalin had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi noting that conducting such camps at regular intervals, in addition to the daily vaccinations, would help in increasing the vaccine coverage among the eligible population in the state.Also read | ‘Covid-19 vaccine a shield, but can’t let our guard down': PM on 1 billion dosesMore than 2.8 million people received the vaccine during the first camp and the count was above 1.6 million people during the second camp. The third and fourth camps saw over 2.4 million people and over 1.7 million people receiving the jabs respectively. Another 2.2 million beneficiaries were jabbed during the fifth camp, held on October 10.What changes this time ?The state government has decided to conduct the vaccine camp on Saturday this time, a deviation from all the previous camps that were held on Sundays.Subramanian said that the move is intended to ensure the participation of people who have been avoiding the Sunday camps. He said some people preferred the consumption of alcohol and meat on Sundays and have been avoiding the vaccination drives.“This time, the sixth mega COVID-19 vaccination camp will be held on October 23 instead of on the next day as those preferring meat or alcohol on Sundays have been avoiding the drive, as they are under a false impression that vaccine should not be taken due to the intake of non-vegetarian food or alcohol,” news agency PTI quoted the minister as saying. “But, this is not so. Anyway, the camp will be advanced to Saturday to ensure those avoiding it for some reason come and get the shots without fail,” he added.So far, 67% of the population have been administered at least one dose in the state while 25% have been fully vaccinated. On Thursday, 1,164 new Covid-19 cases and 20 more fatalities. As of 7am on Friday, 54,345,766 doses of the vaccine have been administered in TN, the Union health ministry’s data showed.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6th-mega-covid-19-vaccine-camp-in-tamil-nadu-on-october-23-to-be-held-in-50-000-vaccination-centres-101634914114544.html

We urge CM Sawant to read the Constitution from page to page and understand that he is not the king of a dictatorship, instead he is a public servant of democracy,” Congress spokesperson Himanshu Tivrekar, said. “He may also learn about the rights of the citizens before he behaves this way again. This democracy is very dear to us Goans. Chief minister Sawant, do not forget that a government is of the people, for the people and by the people. Without us Goan people, there is no government!” he added.The copy of the Constitution has been ordered online, and the Congress leader shared a screenshot of the online order. The delivery address is the chief minister’s official residence in state capital Panaji’s upmarket Altinho locality.“The CM also fails to understand that police may use force only in exceptional circumstances and that too upon instructions of the District Magistrate. There was no such written order issued by the DM (District Magistrate) given for lathi charge yesterday. Such unconstitutional behaviour by the chief minister of Goa is highly unprecedented and extremely dangerous,” Tivrekar said. To be sure, senior Goa police officers have denied that there was any lathi charge. The claim angered Congress leaders who promptly sought to rebut the police with a video of lathi-wielding cops beating Congress workers towards the end of the march. The Congress said some party workers sustained injuries.A few hours earlier, the party leaders also called on senior police officials and said they have handed over a bouquet of flowers.Chief minister Pramod Sawant remained unreachable for a comment on the Congress’ swipe. The Congress, however, said that they were unsure whether Sawant would ‘accept’ the package shipped to his residence and that whether he accepts the Constitution of India ‘in spirit’ was also under question.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-cong-orders-constitution-copy-for-pramod-sawant-says-it-isn-t-dictatorship-101634912592833.html

After the flight test, the ministry of defence said in a statement that the target aircraft will meet the requirements of HEAT for the armed forces. Defence minister Rajnath Singh congratulated DRDO for the successful flight trial of Abhyas, which was carried out as a part of developmental flight trials.Designed and developed by DRDO’s Aeronautical Development Establishment (ADE), the indigenous unmanned aerial vehicle will be used as a target for the evaluation of various missile systems. Abhyas HEAT is launched using twin under-slung boosters which provide the initial acceleration to the vehicle. The state-of-the-art UAV is powered by a small gas turbine engine to sustain a long endurance flight at subsonic speed.The ministry of defence said that the performance of the target aircraft was monitored through telemetry and various tracking sensors. The expression of interest for the production of the vehicle has already been floated to Indian industries, it added.Terming Abhyas as a force multiplier, DRDO Chairman Dr G Satheesh Reddy congratulated the teams associated with the successful flight test of the aerial target which demonstrated the accuracy and effectiveness of the UAV.Abhyas HEAT is equipped with a MEMS-based Inertial Navigation System (INS) for navigation along with the Flight Control Computer (FCC) for guidance and control. According to the ministry, the vehicle is programmed for fully autonomous flight and their check-out is done using a laptop-based Ground Control Station (GCS).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-successfully-flight-tests-abhyas-aerial-target-vehicle-from-chandipur-itr-101634912129774.html

They speak, say will meet again||NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party (SP) chief and former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav bumped into ex-ally Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on a Vistara flight to Uttar Pradesh capital Lucknow on Friday, their first interaction after their two parties contested the 2017 UP assembly elections in a partnership and split up when they figured it didn’t work.Friday’s afternoon’s brief interaction - someone also took a photo on their mobile phone, placing the two rivals in the same frame - on the afternoon flight to Lucknow was described as “cordial”, an aide to Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said.The aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they told each other that “they should meet soon”.It is not clear if the remark was just a courteous way to end the conversation. Or could their parties explore the possibility of a partnership in the not-so-distant future?Elections to Uttar Pradesh’s 403-member assembly are less than five months away, and both parties are trying to dislodge chief minister Yogi Adityanath-led Bharatiya Janata Party government which came to power with 312 seats in 2017 riding a Modi superwave.Ahead of the 2017 elections, the two parties came together in a campaign titled `UP ko ye saath pasand hai’ (UP likes the two together). The short-lived pact, however, fell apart after a dismal showing where the BJP left just 47 seats for the incumbent SP and just seven seats for the Congress.SP leader Udaiveer Singh said an alliance with the Congress wasn’t possible.“There is zero chance of any alliance between the two,’’ said SP leader Udaiveer Singh, adding, “As my leader has said that we are not going to ally with any national party but will only tie-up with smaller parties that can help us strategically take down the BJP government.’’Priyanka Gandhi has also been seen publicly attacking Akhilesh Yadav. In an interview to HT this month, when asked about a possible alliance, she said.“If you look at the last two years, when have you seen Mr Akhilesh Yadav come out on the street for any agitation? Did you see him during the NRC-CAA protests or during the Hathras incident? Did you see him on the street representing the farmers? You did not.’’However, HT has learnt that the Congress did send some feelers to Akhilesh Yadav earlier in the year but he did not respond to the Congress’ overtures. He has maintained in the past that the 2017 alliance was a bad idea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyankas-1st-interaction-with-akhilesh-yadav-after-2017-breakup-is-on-a-plane-101634908603278.html

22-10-2021||India||Parliament winter session could begin from fourth week of Nov: Report||The winter session of Parliament is likely to commence from the fourth week of November and will be held following by strictly adhering to Covid-19 protocols, people familiar with the developments told news agency PTI.The session will also conclude ahead of Christmas and will likely hold around 20 sittings.The winter session of Parliament was not held in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The pandemic led to curtailing of the budget and the monsoon sessions as well. There has been no official announcement but according to the PTI report, the session could begin from November 29 and end around December 23.The Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha sessions will be held simultaneously but the members will have to follow social distancing norms. The first few sessions could be held at separate timings to ensure that not many people are present inside the Parliament complex. The parliamentarians during the winter session will be required to wear masks all the time and could be asked to undergo Covid-19 test.The winter session is significant as it is being held months before the legislative assembly elections in five states including the politically crucial Uttar Pradesh. The issues related to inflation, rise in fuel prices, rise in prices of edible oil, recent attacks on civilians in Kashmir and the continuing protests by farmer’s groups are likely to be raised by the Opposition to corner the government.The monsoon session was marked by protests by the Opposition who wanted answers from the government over the Pegasus spyware issue and repeal of the farmer’s law. It was curtailed sine die two days ahead of its scheduled adjournment. The government during the monsoon session successfully managed to introduce 15 bills and get Parliament’s approval for 20. According to a report by HT, the monsoon session saw the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha function for just 22% and 28% of their allocated time - lowest since the winter session of 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-winter-session-could-begin-from-fourth-week-of-nov-report-101634907332382.html
22-10-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: October 23, 2008 — Chandrayaan-1: India successfully launches first mission to the Moon||Sriharikota: There was no uncorking of champagne, no historic poses for the cameras, no after launch parties, no grand statements.Seconds after India’s moon rocket rode a blaze of flame into the dawn sky from Sriharikota spaceport, a gaggle of reserved, mostly south Indian scientists at Mission Control on this Bay of Bengal island pumped fists, briefly hugged each other, flashed a thumbs-up sign to the media, shared a meal and travelled back to their facilities across south India. “We met for a mission review and later shared a meal. That’s all,” said Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre Director K. Radhakrishnan.“The Chairman has left for Bangalore, and we are heading back to our places (of work).”“I am back at work in Bangalore at nine tomorrow morning,” Chandrayaan-I project director Mylaswamy Annadurai told HT.By dusk, the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft and its mother ship — the workhorse Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle — were orbiting the earth, gathering pace to free themselves from earth’s gravity and slingshot themselves to the moon.Chandrayaan-I is scheduled to reach its orbit 100 km from the Moon (about 3, 86,000 km from earth) on November 8, and drop the Moon Impact Probe, with the Indian tricolour painted, on it a week later.The launch marked the beginning of new initiatives to study other celestial bodies of the solar system — Mars, asteroids and comets. These efforts would coincide with plans to send an Indian into space by 2015.Addressing his colleagues, Indian Space Research Organisation chairman Gopalan Madhavan Nair called the launch a “historic moment”.“We have started our journey to the Moon and the first step has gone off perfectly well,” he said.“It’s a remarkable performance by the launch vehicle and every parameter was on the dot.”India’s next target:Mars, the 4th planet from the sun and more than 146 times further from the earth than the moon.“Mars is the next natural destination,” Nair told reporters. “We’ve just started planningfor it and are looking for proposals from our scientific community to design instrumentsfor an orbiter to the red planet.”Nair also spoke about Chandrayaan-II, a Rs. 425 crore joint Indo-Russian mission, planned for 2012.“The lander (a clutch of instruments that will land on the Moon) will be designed andmade by Russia, while we will design other experiments,” he said. “If we have some morespace, then we will invite international teams.”Wednesday’s flight of the 316-tonne polar satellite launch vehicle (PSLV-C11) from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre was a dream come true for about 1,000 space scientists and technologists.The flawless flight was preceded by some anxious moments: Overcast skies, a nagging problem with the rocket fuel as it was loaded on to the rocket during the countdown.“We lost almost all hope of making a launch on Wednesday morning due to inclementweather,” said Nair. “To our luck, the rain gods and the clouds kept away.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-october-23-2008-chandrayaan-1-india-successfully-launches-first-mission-to-the-moon-101634906381867.html

Amarinder Singh's media advisor Raveen Thukral tweeted the statement of the former chief minister in which Amarinder Singh clarified that Aroosa Alam had been coming to India for 16 years with due clearance from the government of India. "You were a minister in my cabinet. Never heard you complain about Aroosa Alam. And she had been coming for 16 years with due GOI clearance. Or are you alleging that both NDA and Congress-led UPA governments in this period connived with Pak ISI?" the statement aimed at Punjab deputy CM Sukhjinder Randhawa said. ‘You were a minister in my cabinet @Sukhjinder_INC. Never heard you complain about Aroosa Alam. And she’d been coming for 16 years with due GoI clearances. Or are you alleging that both NDA and @INCIndia led UPA govts in this period connived with Pak ISI?’: @capt_amarinder 2/3"What I am worried about is that instead of focusing on maintaining law & order at a time when terror threat is high and festivals are around the corner, you’ve put DGP Punjab Police on a baseless investigation at the cost of Punjab’s safety," the statement read.

Swiggy announced that it has accommodated a “no-questions-asked, two-day paid monthly period time-off policy” for its women delivery partners, a move that enables more women to come forward in onboarding with Swiggy as a delivery agent.“Discomfort from being out and about on the road while menstruating is probably one of the most underreported reasons why many women don’t consider delivery to be a viable gig,” Mihir Shah, Swiggy's Vice President of Operations said in a recent blogpost.The period time-off policy is completely “voluntarily” and ensures that those who opt for it are still eligible for a minimum earnings guarantee for that duration. This means that women delivery agents at Swiggy can opt for 24 days of voluntary time-off in a year.“This industry-first initiative gives our female DEs the option to voluntarily take time-off during their menstrual cycle and be eligible for a minimum earnings guarantee during that time,” Shah informed.Last year, Zomato had announced an initiative by introducing 10 paid leave days for its female employees to cover ‘those days’ during their menstrual cycle.Apart from the period time-off, Swiggy has also taken a number of steps like introducing ‘safe zones’ and better hygiene facilities to employ female delivery partners and ensure their safety on the job. The food aggregator platform is also working towards facilitating EV cycles and bikes for women employees who do not have a vehicle at their disposal.Swiggy has nearly 1,000 female delivery agents now, in the span of about five years. The first batch of women executives in Swiggy’s delivery fleet were introduced in 2016 in Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/swiggy-floats-no-questions-asked-period-leave-policy-for-women-delivery-agents-101634898201103.html

Chandran, who lost her leg in an accident, made a comeback and won accolades as a dancer as well as an actor. She said that the process of opening her prosthetic leg is painful and airport authorities have been requested every time to use ETD (Explosive Trace Detector) but to no avail.“Good evening, this is a very personal note that I want to tell to our dear Prime Minister Narendra Modi Ji, this is an appeal to the central government, I am Sudhaa Chandran, an actress and dancer by profession, who has danced with an artificial limb and created history and made my country very proud of me,” Chandran said in a video post on Instagram.“But every time that I go on my professional visits, each time, am stopped at the airport and when I request them at the security, to the CISF officers that please do an ETD (Explosive Trace Detector) for my artificial limb, they still want me to remove my artificial limb and show it to them. Is this humanly possible, Modi ji? Is this what our country is talking about? Is this the respect that a woman gives to another woman in our society? It is my humble request to you Modi ji that please give senior citizens a card that says they are senior citizen,” she further added.Chandran said that she did not like being grilled every time she had to go through the airport security and requested the central government to take prompt action.We will examine why the lady personnel concerned requested Ms. Sudhaa Chandran to remove the prosthetics.

In a video widely shared on social media, Malik, the current Meghalaya governor, was heard alleging that Mufti was a beneficiary of state land under the Roshni Act of 2001, which was scrapped last year following an order from the Jammu and Kashmir high court.He said that the Roshni Act, originally called the Jammu and Kashmir State Land (Vesting of Ownership Rights to the Occupants) Act, 2001, was introduced by the Farooq Abdullah government promising that the funds accrued giving ownership rights to the unauthorised occupants of state land will be used to improve the electricity situation in the erstwhile state."The electricity situation did not improve but plots were given to Farooq Abdullah, his son and Mehbooba... I cancelled the allotments and constituted an inquiry," Malik alleged.The legal notice stated the allegation was not only incorrect but also defamatory in nature with the "sole objective of tarnishing her otherwise politically neat and clean image." The PDP has called upon the Meghalaya governor to pay ₹10 crore within 30 days of the receipt of the legal notice, saying the amount will be donated or utilised for the public good.Earlier this week, Mufti said that the "false” and “unsavoury” statements of Malik were highly mischievous, warning him to either withdraw the comments or be prepared to get sued.“False & unsavoury utterances of Satya Pal Malik about me being a beneficiary of Roshni Act is highly mischievous. My legal team is preparing to sue him. He has the option to withdraw his comments failing which I will pursue legal recourse,” she tweeted while sharing the video.False & unsavoury utterances of Satya Pal Malik about me being a beneficiary of Roshni Act is highly mischievous.

"Captain Amarinder Singh is now saying that there is a threat from ISI. We will look into the woman's connection with it. Captain kept raising drones issue coming from Pakistan for last 4-5 years," the deputy chief minister said, as quoted by ANI. "So Captain first raised this issue and later got BSF deployed in Punjab. We will ask DGP to look into this matter," the minister said referring to Aroosa Alam's link with ISI.Amarinder Singh has been raising the security issue and said Navjot Sidhu is a threat to the country's security because of his close relationship with the ISI and Pakistan. When the Captain was in New Delhi to visit Union home minister Amit Shah, Captain also met National Security Advisor Ajit Doval.Amarinder Singh: Floating new party, open to alliance with BJP ahead of Punjab pollsFollowing his acrimonious exit from the post of the chief minister, Amarinder Singh burnt the bridge with the Congress as he recently announced his decision to float a new party ahead of the election. The party will be launched soon, the former Punjab chief minister said, adding that his new party will be open to ally with the BJP if the farmers' issues are addressed.Who is Aroosa Alam?The daughter of yesteryear Pakistan politician Aqleem Akhtar, Aroosa Alam at present is a journalist. According to reports, Aroosa Alam met Amarinder Singh in 2004 when Amarinder went to Pakistan.This is not the first time that her name has been dragged into Punjab politics. In fact, in August this year, Sidhu's then advisor Malvinder Singh Mali reportedly posted Amarinder Singh's photo with Aroosa Alam and questioned Amarinder Singh. "I used to think that this is your personal matter but now that you have linked Navjot Sidhu's advisors with Congress politics and national security, I am compelled to post this," Mali reportedly posted.In 2007, Aroosa Alam for the first time was romantically linked with Captain Amarinder Singh. At that time, at an event in Chandigarh Press Club, Aroosa Alam had termed their relationship as platonic. "I am his friend and not in love with him," she had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-govt-to-probe-amarinder-singh-s-friend-aroosa-alam-s-link-with-isi-minister-101634897276134.html
22-10-2021||India||2019 Jamia rioting case: JNU student Sharjeel Imam denied bail||Jawaharlal Lal University (JNU) student Sharjeel Imam was denied bail by a Delhi court on Friday in connection with allegedly delivering an inflammatory speech which incited violence in 2019. The court observed that the speech was on communal lines and the content of the speech tended ‘to have a debilitating effect on the peace and harmony.’According to Delhi Police, Iman allegedly delivered a speech during the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) which was provocative in nature on December 13, 2019 which led to riots two days later when a mob of over 3,000 people attacked cops and torched vehicles in Delhi’s Jamia Nagar.The additional sessions judge Anuj Agarwal while denying Imam the bail said that the cursory and plain reading of the speech displays that it was on communal lines. “The tone and tenor of the incendiary speech tend to have a debilitating effect upon public tranquility, peace, and harmony of the society,” he said.The judge also quoted Swami Vivekananda while delivering the verdict. “We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what you think; Words are secondary; Thoughts live; they travel far,” he said, according to a report by news agency ANI.The judge also did note that the evidence in support of the allegations that the rioters got instigated by Imam's speech and following which they indulged in the acts of rioting, mischief, and attacking the cops was sketchy. It said that whether the speech would fall in the ambit of section 124A (Sedition) Indian Penal Code or not still requires deeper analysis at an appropriate stage.Alongside this case, Imam is accused of being the "mastermind" of the February 2020 northeast Delhi riots, which led to deaths of 53 people and injured over 700.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2019-jamia-rioting-case-jnu-student-sharjeel-imam-denied-bail-101634896959744.html
22-10-2021||India||Kerala new-born missing case: Govt orders probe||The Kerala government on Friday ordered a probe into “serious lapses and delay” on the part of its agencies in locating the baby of the daughter of a ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI (M) leader, who has accused her parents of snatching away her newborn as they disapproved of her relationship with her Dalit husband.Health minister Veena George said they will do everything possible to locate Anupama S Chandran’s baby. “We will also examine the role of the child welfare committee and other agencies. I have sought a report from the social welfare secretary,” said George.The Kerala State Women’s Commission on Thursday also ordered an inquiry in the case.The CPI (M) too pledged support to Chandran. Anavoor Nagappan, a CPI (M) district secretary, said the party will stand with Chandran and help locate her baby. Chandran, 23, reiterated the party was aware of everything and did not expect justice from it. She added it was forced to react as the case has hit national headlines. Chandran said she has been struggling to trace her baby after she was allegedly separated three days after birth last October.“When I approached the district secretary (Nagappan), he was rude to me. He was also instrumental in expelling my husband from the party. After I filed a police complaint against my father for kidnapping my child, he was elevated and given new responsibility... What the district secretary is saying is a bunch of lies.”Chandran, who is a leader of the Students Federation of India, said she lodged a police complaint in April, approached the chief minister, police chief saying her baby was snatched. She added they feign ignorance now. Chandran said police failed to take action due to political pressure and she was forced to go to the media. She said since she went public, she feared for the baby’s life.PS Jayachandran, Chandran’s father, has claimed said since the baby was born out of wedlock, they sent the baby to the government-run children’s home in Thiruvananthapuram with his daughter’s consent. He added Chandran signed on stamp paper but the daughter has said she did so under duress.“My father is misleading the investigation. At times he says the child was shifted to Tamil Nadu and later he said the baby was in the children’s home in the state capital (Thiruvananthapuram). The DNA test of two children admitted at the same period in the children’s home was also done but they did not match us,” she said.The opposition Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have sought a probe and the baby’s return to the mother. “It really shocked the conscience of the state but the party is still clinging on technicalities and dismisses it as a mere family issue,” said Congress leader V D Satheessan.BJP leader K Surendran questioned the CPI (M)’s claim of being a rights champion. “How can it deny the right of a mother?

They had also been asking the Union government to draft strategies to increase the production of vaccines in India, including resorting to methods like sharing of patents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/could-have-achieved-this-6-months-ago-sisodia-on-govt-s-vaccination-feat-101634895402160.html

The development is not sudden as Harish Chaudhary's name was being speculated as a replacement for Harish Rawat for some time amid the Congress's trouble in Punjab."Congress President has appointed Shri Harish Chaudhary as AICC In-Charge of Punjab and Chandigarh with immediate effect. Harish Rawat is being relieved from his current responsibility as AICC General Secretary In-Charge of Punjab and Chandigarh. He shall continue as a member of CWC. The party appreciates his contributions as General Secretary," said AICC general secretary K C Venugopal in a statement.Chaudhary's name was speculated at a time when Sidhu resigned from the post of the Punjab Congress chief following his differences with Charanjit Singh Channi over appointments. At that time, Chaudhary said he will take whatever opportunity the party will give him.The differences between Channi and Sidhu were resolved and Sidhu continued in the post of the party president. The situation was overcome after it was decided that a coordination committee will be formed.While the change in the party affairs in-charge was due, an apparent new threat to Punjab Congress is Amarinder Singh floating a new party that may tie up with the BJP. The Congress however asserted that this will not be a threat for the party; Amarinder Singh's outfit will only divide the rival votes, the Congress said.Harish Chaudhary was a key part of the developments that rocked Punjab in the last few months, including the resignation of Amarinder Singh. Chaudhary was appointed as an observer of the party's affairs by Congress president Sonia Gandhi.Harish Rawat, on the other hand, had been requesting the party leadership to relieve him from Punjab Congress in-charge duty as he wanted to focus on plans for the upcoming Assembly elections in Uttarakhand, reports said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-minister-harish-chaudhary-replaces-rawat-as-punjab-congress-incharge-101634894777469.html
22-10-2021||India||PM Modi shares ‘half-baked ’ information: Congress spokesperson Gourav Vallabh||The Congress on Friday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for devaluing the hard work of India’s scientific community and researchers and sharing “half-baked” information in his speech on the billionth Covid-19 shot administered in the country on Thursday.“Modi has shared incorrect and misleading data. He has not recognised the hard work our scientific community and our researchers have put in,’ said Congress spokesman Gourav Vallabh. He added Modi ignored their research by saying this was the first time India has made a vaccine. Vallabh said Rajiv Gandhi started vaccination drives against six diseases or the universal immunisation programme when he was the Prime Minister in 1985. He added Gandhi also launched the Leprosy Eradication Programme without fanfare, unlike Modi.Vallabh’s comments came after Modi, in a televised address to the nation on Friday, said India has given a befitting reply to those who questioned the country’s ability to vaccinate its population and face the challenge of the pandemic by achieving the target of administering one billion Covid-19 vaccine doses.The billionth shot was administered on Thursday exactly nine months and five days after the country’s Covid-19 immunisation programme kicked off on January 16. Only China has been able to administer more doses.Vallabh said Modi has been comparing India to nations with smaller populations. “China administered 216 crore vaccines and inoculated 80% of its population with both doses. But India on the other hand has doubly vaccinated only 21% of the population.” He asked the government to apologise to the families of those who lost their lives during the second wave of the pandemic this summer. “Deaths in the second wave took place due to poor governance and inefficiency.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-accuses-pm-of-devaluing-hard-work-of-scientific-community-sharing-half-baked-info-101634893602206.html

The first round of questioning took place on Thursday and on Friday, the actor was called at 11am, though Ananya started from her Bandra house at around 2pm. Reports said that Ananya has denied the allegation of supplying drugs to Aryan Khan. She has also told the NCB officials that she never consumed drugs in her life. "Ananya denied the supply related talks in the chat conversation and told the NCB officials that she has never consumed or supplied the drugs," news agency ANI reported citing NCB sources. Another report said Ananya Panday said that the WhatsApp chats in which she purportedly promised to arrange ‘ganja’ for Aryan Khan were meant as a joke. Why Ananya Panday is being questionedNCB officials said Ananya Panday's name cropped up in Aryan Khan's WhatsApp chats. According to reports, Aryan Khan's chats indicate that in the year 2018-19, Ananya Panday helped supply drugs to Aryan Khan thrice by providing him with the numbers of drug dealers, ANI reported. Ananya Panday and Aryan Khan are known to be childhood friends and hence the actor has now come on NCB's radar following Aryan Khan's arrest.  #WATCH | Mumbai: Actor Ananya Panday arrives at NCB office for questioning in the ongoing drugs case pic.twitter.com/DCg4vUwKg5Ananya Panday is not an accused in the caseNCB officials on Thursday said that summoning her for interrogation does not indicate that she is an accused in the case.

Both days, she failed to turn up at the NCB office on time. What questions did NCB ask Ananya on 1st day of interrogation?Though the drugs case now involves 20 arrests, Ananya's questioning is specific to Aryan Khan and his WhatsApp chats. It is based on those WhatsApp chats that the NCB opposed Aryan Khan's bail plea claiming that Aryan is not new to drugs and has been consuming drugs for some time.Ananya Panday was asked whether she knows anything about Aryan Khan's drugs consumption, whether she has consumed drugs, whether she arranged drugs for Aryan Khan etc. It has been learnt that Ananya Panday has dismissed any link with drugs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ananya-panday-told-ncb-she-never-consumed-drugs-to-face-questioning-for-2nd-day-101634892251858.html

The agency said it is expecting one additional piece of information from the Covaxin manufacturer which has been submitting data to the WHO on a rolling basis.“We are aware many people are waiting for WHO’s recommendation for Covaxin to be included in the #COVID19 Emergency Use Listing, but we cannot cut corners - before recommending a product for emergency use, we must evaluate it thoroughly to make sure it is safe and effective,” the WHO said in a series of tweets.The WHO nod for Covaxin’s emergency use authorisation is a much-anticipated one for its widespread acceptability as a safe and effective vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-covaxin-awaits-nod-who-official-says-it-takes-longer-sometimes-101634882987797.html
22-10-2021||India||SC to hear UP govt plea against ex-Twitter India head in Ghaziabad assault case||The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear a petition of the Uttar Pradesh government challenging an order of the Karnataka high court quashing a notice against former Twitter India managing director Manish Maheshwari in connection to a probe into a communally sensitive video. The video uploaded on the microblogging site was related to the alleged assault of a Muslim man in Loni Ghaziabad. A bench, comprising Chief Justice NV Ramana, Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli, heard the government's plea. Appearing for the Yogi Adityanath government, solicitor general Tushar Mehta questioned the territorial jurisdiction of a high court, a Livelaw report said.   “There's a question of law that needs your examination. For the time being, ignore the reason why the summon was issued. It was a 41A notice, so there's no question of arrest. The question is the territorial jurisdiction of the high court,” Mehta said.The court asked senior advocates AM Singhvi and Siddharth Luthra, appearing for Maheshwari, to accept the notice. “We have to hear the notice,” the CJI said. The video, which went viral on social media, showed a Muslim man alleging that he was assaulted and forced to chant "Jai Shri Ram", with miscreants also chopping his beard off. Although the Uttar Pradesh police has ruled out any 'communal angle' in the case, an FIR was registered over offenses insinuating criminal conspiracy and enmity between religious groups.Maheshwari has been held accountable by the Uttar Pradesh government for the uploaded video, which the prosecution says "resulted in violence".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-up-govt-plea-against-ex-twitter-india-head-in-ghaziabad-assault-case-101634883909313.html

22-10-2021||India||1 billion jabs identity of a new India: PM Modi||India gave a befitting reply to those questioning the country’s ability to vaccinate its population against Covid-19 and surmounted the challenge posed by the pandemic by administering one billion shots in a short time, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday.Modi also took a swipe at his opponents and said economic growth was getting a boost from rising vaccinations, a day after India administered the billionth Covid-19 shot to much fanfare.“100 crore vaccinations are not just a figure, but a reflection of the strength of the country, it is the creation of a new chapter of history. This is a picture of a new India that sets difficult goals and knows how to achieve them,” the PM said in a televised address to the nation.He said that while other countries had the expertise, India achieved the target by basing the vaccination programme on scientific methods. “Questions were asked if Indians can cope with this pandemic, where will it get the money to purchase vaccines, will Indians get the vaccines or not, will it be able to inoculate so many to stop the (Covid-19) spread… This one billion is an answer to these questions,” he added.The billionth shot was administered on Thursday, nine months and five days after the country’s Covid-19 immunisation programme kicked off on January 16. Only China has been able to administer more doses. The vaccines were administered in roughly 430,000 centres and a total of at least around 2 million health workers were directly involved in the process.Modi said the success belonged to every citizen. He referred to the initial scepticism about India’s ability to administer vaccines to its large population and added that the speed with which it crossed the one billion mark is being appreciated worldwide. “...but there is one thing that has not been taken into account. Where did we begin? ...other countries... had expertise in research, etc, India was largely dependent on vaccines from these counties.”Modi said given the numbers of those vaccinated, the world will now consider India safe. “India has got recognition as a pharma hub and the whole world is looking at it.” He said the vaccine drive was the biggest example of the “sabka sath, sabka vikas” (inclusive development for all) mantra of the government.“At the beginning of the pandemic, there were apprehensions that it would be hard to fight the pandemic in India. But we ensured a free vaccination drive. There was only one mantra -- no discrimination in giving vaccines. There would be no VIP culture. No matter how rich or powerful a person was, they would get the vaccine like ordinary people will.”Modi spoke about vaccine hesitancy and said India proved the sceptics wrong. “Some said people will not turn up for the vaccination. In many countries, vaccine hesitancy is a big challenge, but Indians have made them speechless.” He took a pot shot at those who criticised his call for lighting lamps and appreciating the health care workers by clanging metal plates in 2020. “…some asked will the disease go away, but for us, we saw the unity and collective power in that. And this is what has helped us reach one billion in such a short time.”Modi credited the use of technology and scientific temper for accelerating the speed and reach of the vaccination. “It is a matter of pride that the whole programme was science bound, science-driven and science-based. From manufacturing to administering vaccines, there was a scientific approach at each step.” Modi referred to the CoWIN platform for vaccination registration and said it helped ordinary people and made work easier for the medical staff.Data shows that about three-fourth (75.6%) of India’s nearly 940 million adults have now received at least one dose while around 31% are fully immunised. Of these, around 886 million doses have been of Covishield (the brand name under which Pune-based Serum Institute of India has been manufacturing the vaccine developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca), while around 115 million doses have been of Covaxin (the shot developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the country’s apex biomedical research regulator, the Indian Council of Medical Research).The event was marked with a series of events across India on Thursday, including the launch of a theme song. The largest khadi tricolour in the country, weighing around 1,400kg, displayed only on special days, was unfurled to mark the occasion, and 100 monuments under the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) were illuminated in tricolour and local artists displayed 100 different ideas across 100 districts.But Modi cautioned that people still needed to be careful.“We cannot drop the ball, no matter how modern the shield. Till the war is on, weapons are not laid down. We need to celebrate our festivals with great care and masks have to be on. Just as we wear shoes, we must make wearing a mask a habit.” He asked those yet to be vaccinated to make it a priority, and those who have been jabbed to inspire the others to follow suit.The Congress criticised the Prime Minister, accusing him of “devaluing” the hard work of India’s scientific community and researchers and sharing “half-baked” information in his speech. “Modi has shared incorrect and misleading data. He has not recognised the hard work our scientific community and our researchers have put in,’ said Congress spokesman Gourav Vallabh.Vallabh said Modi has been comparing India to nations with smaller populations. “China administered 216 crore vaccines and inoculated 80% of its population with both doses. But India on the other hand has doubly vaccinated only 21% of the population.”Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Delhi’s deputy chief minister, Manish Sisodia also criticised the central government saying that the milestone could have been achieved at least six months ago if the Union government had made adequate arrangements and not exported vaccines at a time India faced a shortage of doses.“While celebrating the 100 crore vaccine milestone, we must remember that if the central government made adequate arrangements in time and not invested in public relation activities, such as exporting doses when India was facing a shortage, then the medical teams across the country could have achieved the milestone at least six months ago,” Sisodia said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-capable-of-setting-difficult-targets-and-achieving-them-too-pm-modi-on-vaccination-feat-101634881540253.html

The country had one mantra- if the Covid-19 disease does not discriminate, then there cannot be any discrimination in vaccination too. Hence, it was ensured that the VIP culture does not overpower the vaccination drive.”Also Read| In PM Modi's billion jab praise to ‘new India’, a message for detractorsThe Prime Minister said at the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis, fears started arising that it would be very difficult for a democracy like India to fight this pandemic.“It was being said for India and its citizens, how so much control and discipline will work here.

22-10-2021||India||UK foreign secy begins India visit today; tech, infrastructure deals on cards||The United Kingdom will announce a series of tech and infrastructure deals, including a £50.4 million investment to fund green tech infrastructure projects across India, during foreign secretary Liz Truss’ visit beginning Friday. As part of the India-UK 10-year roadmap, Truss and her Indian counterpart S Jaishankar will announce the “Strategic Futures Forum”, bringing together leading figures from government, business and academia of both countries to drive closer links in key areas such as tech and security and to shape the long-term, strategic vision for the bilateral partnership. The tech and infrastructure deals to be finalised during Truss’ two-day visit are aimed at boosting jobs and increasing green growth. She will unveil the £50.4-million ($70 million) investment by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office’s investment arm CDC to fund green tech infrastructure projects across India through the joint Green Growth Equity Fund. Truss will also announce an £11.5-million British investment in two venture capital funds aimed at supporting India’s transition to cleaner energy. “Both funds will return a profit to the UK taxpayer and make use of UK expertise,” a statement from the British high commission said. There will also be an investment of £500,000 by the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) to build a new virtual network of Indian and British labs working to promote net-zero targets in key industries such as glass, cement, and metals. In a statement ahead of her arrival in India, Truss said, “I want the UK and India to step up their partnership in critical areas like technology, investment, security and defence. India is the world’s largest democracy, a tech and economic powerhouse and a vital strategic partner for the UK.”Closer ties between the two countries in areas such as tech and infrastructure “will deliver jobs and growth in both countries, boost developing world economies and help us promote our values on the global stage,” she added. Truss will also outline agreements to deepen investment ties between the two sides and work together on finance and technical support packages for the developing world. “The deals include more tech transfer and knowledge sharing with developing countries alongside heavy capital investment – a model that the UK is looking to replicate with partners around the world,” the statement said. These agreements will help drive forward the “Build Back Better World” initiative launched by G7 leaders in June to meet the huge need for clean infrastructure in the developing world.While India has the third-highest number of tech start-ups in the world, the UK has the third-largest number of tech “unicorns” or start-ups valued at more than $1 billion. Truss wants to strengthen Britain’s economic, technology and security links with fast-growing economies and like-minded partners and build “a network of liberty” around the globe, the statement said. “Closer ties with like-minded democracies such as India are key to that ambition,” it added. The Roadmap 2030 for India-UK ties was finalised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his British counterpart Boris Johnson at their virtual summit in May. Besides Jaishankar, Truss will meet environment minister Bhupender Yadav in Delhi to discuss areas for closer collaboration. During her meeting with Yadav, Truss is also expected to discuss climate targets and underline the importance of making concrete progress on climate change ahead of the COP26 Summit in Glasgow next month. She will note that India already leads the world in renewable technology and express her hope that New Delhi will commit to a “more ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution”.She will then travel to Mumbai, where she will visit the UK carrier strike group, which is led by Britain’s largest warship, the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth. Truss will also meet Indian business leaders at a Build Back Better World roundtable in Mumbai on Saturday to boost infrastructure in the developing world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-foreign-secretary-to-visit-india-this-week-tech-infrastructure-deals-on-cards-101634878960138.html

22-10-2021||India||Sonia Gandhi set to overtake cumulative years her family members led Congress||In 2010, when Congress leaders wanted to celebrate Sonia Gandhi’s record as the longest-serving party president, she asked them to cross-check with then finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, who was known for his memory. Eleven years later, as she continues to lead the party, she is set to overtake the cumulative years her family members Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, and Rahul Gandhi led the party. This includes her leadership as the interim or provisional president from August 2019 after Rahul Gandhi quit the post following the Congress’s debacle in the national elections.Sonia Gandhi has served roughly 21 years as the Congress chief—almost the same years her family members have led the party. Her stint is set to continue for another 12 months. The Congress Working Committee, the highest executive body of the party which met on October 16, announced she will continue to be the interim president till her successor is elected between August 21 and September 30 next year. At the meeting, Sonia Gandhi hit back at dissenters for “talking to her through media” and reminded them that she has been “a full-time and hands-on Congress President.”India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, a key figure in both pre-Independence and post-Independence Congress, presided over the All-India Congress Committee session first in 1929. He was also the Congress president in 1930, 1936-37, 1951-54. Nehru led the party for eight years.Indira Gandhi, who led the party for seven years, first got its leadership in 1959. She led the party again from 1978 to 1984. Her son, Rajiv Gandhi succeeded her as the party president and Prime Minister in 1985 before he was also assassinated six years later in 1991.Narasimha Rao and Sitaram Kesari led the party until Sonia Gandhi shed her initial reluctance and became the Congress president in March 1998. She became the longest-serving chief of the party before Rahul Gandhi took over from her in 2017. Sonia Gandhi again took the top post in 2019 after Rahul Gandhi resigned citing the poor performance of the party in the general elections. The Congress bagged just 52 out of the 543 seats in Lok Sabha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-gandhi-set-to-overtake-cumulative-years-her-family-members-led-congress-101634876979802.html
22-10-2021||India||‘Cruel joke on citizens by Centre’: Rahul Gandhi’s jibe on rising fuel prices||Congress leader and former party chief Rahul Gandhi once again took a dig at the Central government on Twitter over the increasing petrol and diesel prices. He claimed that the government is playing a joke on the public.“GOI is playing a cruel joke on our public. #TaxExtortion,” the Wayanad MP tweeted, along with an image captioned, “FILLIONAIRE: One who can afford a full tank in India.”This tweet came after the price of petrol and diesel rose by 35 paise per litre, resulting in prices rising for the second consecutive day. Before this hike, there was no change in the rates on October 18 and 19.However, this is not the first time the opposition has reacted to the sky-rocketing fuel prices. On October 18, Priyanka Gandhi reacted to the fuel rates costing more than aviation fuel. “The BJP government promised that people wearing hawai chappal (slippers) will travel in airplanes. However, the BJP has increased the fuel prices so much that now it is more difficult for the middle class to travel by road,” she tweeted in Hindi and attached a newspaper clipping comparing aviation turbine fuel prices with that of petrol and diesel.Rahul Gandhi chimed in too, tweeting, “Sabka vinash, mehengaai ka vikas (destruction of all, development of rising prices).”While petrol prices have already crossed the ₹100-mark for a litre across all metropolitan cities, diesel prices have only crossed the mark in over a dozen states.The Centre is currently in talks with countries exporting oil to India. According to news agency ANI, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has raised concerns over rising prices of crude oil, supply and demand of oils to the major oil-producing countries. “As crude oil prices rise internationally, the petroleum ministry has called on the energy ministries of many countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, Russia and others,” ANI quoted a person familiar with the development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cruel-joke-on-citizens-by-centre-rahul-gandhi-s-jibe-on-rising-fuel-prices-101634876319945.html

Personnel from local police stations, as well as those from other districts, were deployed on security duty.About 45 minutes before the chief minister's arrival, one Jatshankar Shukla, a representative of the Gaur block, reached the spot. According to a report by HT's sister publication Live Hindustan, Jitendra Pandey, the brother-in-law of Shukla's younger brother Amardeep, also entered the auditorium with his licensed revolver, but was later pulled out by the police personnel present there.Basti SP Ashish Srivastava told news agency ANI, “There was a VIP event of the chief minister in Basti district. Forty-five minutes before his arrival, a man arrived at the auditorium with his licensed revolver; the circle officer present there on duty saw him.”He said the man was later taken out of the auditorium and had his identity ascertained. Given that the gunman managed to enter the auditorium where a high-profile event was being held, the role of a number of policemen soon came under the lens.“In the initial probe, seven police personnel, including four posted in Basti district, were found to be negligent,” the Basti SP said. “Two of them were posted in Siddharthnagar and another in Sant Kabir Nagar.”“The four policemen posted in Basti district have been suspended, and reports have been sent to the SPs concerned regarding the remaining three policemen. Departmental action will be taken,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/major-lapse-in-cm-yogi-s-security-man-enters-auditorium-with-revolver-4-cops-suspended-101634864579862.html

On the occasion, he visited Delhi's Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital to interact with doctors and health care workers there.The Prime Minister may also, once again, stress on the need to not let one's guard down during the ongoing festive season as this could lead to a third wave of the viral illness. Over the last few days, the country has seen less than 20,000 daily Covid-19 cases.The nationwide vaccination drive against the coronavirus disease began on January 16 with two vaccines--Covaxin and Covishield. Since then, four other jabs have been given emergency use authorisation (EUA) by the Drugs Controller General India (DCGI). Among these, two--Covaxin and ZyCoV-D--are indigenously made shots. While the former has been developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech International Limited, Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadilla has developed the latter.Currently. only those aged 18 and above are eligible for inoculation against Covid-19.

22-10-2021||India||Women comprise nearly half of informal sector workers, data from new national portal shows||Nearly half of 40 million workers of the country’s informal economy registered on a recently launched national portal are women, and most workers regardless of gender are from disadvantaged castes, official data that shines new light on India’s invisible unorganised labour force shows. Trends in registrations of poor, mostly migrant workers, suggest that there could be as many women in the labour pool as men, or even more, a fact hitherto unbeknownst to policymakers. The countrywide registration drive is aimed to count all such workers who lose out on social security benefits because they are undocumented. In 2020, India saw a reverse migration of millions thousands of such workers from industrial and urban centres back to villages under distressful conditions when the government clamped a stringent lockdown to control the pandemic’s first wave. The government wasn’t able to respond with any immediate help because there was no database of who these people were. The then labour minister, Santosh Gangwar, told Parliament in September 2020 that there was no data on how many migrant workers left cities or how many died en route their homes. The migrant workers’ portal is supposed to address this gap. It is a joint venture between the labour and employment ministry and common service centres (CSC) run by the electronics and information technology ministry. Workers who have registered so far belong to diverse occupations, such as construction, apparel manufacturing, fishing, gig and platform work, street vending as well as domestic work. “In some of these sectors, an overwhelming proportion of migrant workers are also engaged. All unorganized workers. including migrant workers, can now take the benefits of various social security and employment-based schemes through registration on the e-Shram portal,” an official said, requesting anonymity. Lack of data on informal economy workers mean that few benefit from labour welfare schemes. Data from the portal show that 50.02% registrations are women. A nearly equal proportion of men and women have been registering themselves, the labour ministry official cited above said. “The trends show that women workers make up one half of the informal labour force. This is significant simply because we didn’t know this and women-specific policies, such as maternity and child care benefits aren’t available to these workers,” said Gopal Renjen, the CEO of Staffing Solutions Pvt Ltd. Renjen said a women-led informal workforce could be a possibility and gender and caste compositions of further registration should be monitored to appropriate policies. Around 65.68% of workers who have enrolled so far are in the 16-40 age group, pointing to a younger labour pool. They mostly belong to backward social categories. Workers from other backward classes (OBC) make up 43% of such workers, while 23% and 7% belong to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, respectively. The registrations enable unorganised workers to receive a digital card and a universal account number for social-security benefits. Such workers are eligible to get ₹200,000 for injury due to accidents and on death or permanent disability and ₹100,000 on partial disability. While there are no official estimates of migrant workers, a novel statistical tool developed by former chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian had revealed an annual “interstate migrant population of about 60 million and an interdistrict migration as high as 80 million” between 2001 and 2011.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/women-comprise-nearly-half-of-informal-sector-workers-data-from-new-national-portal-shows-101634862406702.html

The party’s organisational secretary and former minister, D Jayakumar filed the complaint at Chennai’s Mambalam police station on Wednesday night. The AIADMK has sought action against Sasikala for “cheating by impersonation, promoting disharmony, enmity and hatred and circulating statements with intent to cause fear or alarm.” On October 17, on the day AIADMK rang in its golden jubilee year of founding, Sasikala, along with her supporters, went to party founder M G Ramachandran’s (MGR) memorial to unveil a plaque with an engraving identifying her as general secretary. “Sasikala knew that the said conduct on her part was dishonest and in effect impersonation of an office to which she has no claim,” the AIADMK’s written complaint read. They went on to explain the circumstances that led to Sasikala’s expulsion and the eventual consolidation of the party under the dual leadership of O Panneerselvam and Edappadi Palaniswami. Jayakumar reiterated how the Election Commission of India settled the dispute over the party name and symbol following J Jayalalithaa’s death by recognising the dual leadership as the ‘real AIADMK’. “It’s a settled matter. Even elections are over. She’s doing this out of boredom,” Palaniswami said on Wednesday while interacting with reporters. “She has no links with the party,” he added. When Jayalalithaa died while she was still the CM, in December 2016, Paneerselvam was swiftly sworn in to the chair. Sasikala was elected as general secretary-- the highest post in the AIADMK--previously held by MGR and Jayalalithaa. After Paneerselvam resigned to make way for Sasikala to be chief minister, in a dramatic turn of events, he rebelled against her. Sasikala handpicked Palaniswami as chief minister before surrendering as a convict in 2017 in the disproportionate assets case in a Bengaluru jail. But Pannerselvam and Palaniswami eventually merged their factions and expelled Sasikala and the party made Jayalalithaa the permanent general secretary. Pannerselvam and Palaniswami function as coordinator and co-cordinator of the party. The AIADMK had previously complained against Sasikala for using the party flag on her car bonnet after she returned from prison earlier this year in February. Sasikala has been trying to reclaim her position in the party. Her latest move comes after the AIADMK’s humiliating defeat in the recently concluded rural body polls in nine newly carved districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmkfiles-police-complaint-against-sasikala-for-identifying-as-party-gen-secy-101634846012301.html

22-10-2021||India||6 women HC judges in Kerala for first time||With the swearing-in of two more women judges on Wednesday, the number of women judges in Kerala High Court rose to six, a first in the judicial history of the state. The two judges, Justice Sofi Thomas and Justice C S Sudha took oath on Wednesday. There are four other women sitting judges, Justice Anu Sivaraman, Justice Mary Joseph, Justice V Shersy and Justice M A Anitha.“It is a glorious chapter in the judicial history of the state. Usually, women judges’ numbers will be minuscule in higher courts. This is the first time six women judges are taking up their position in the High Court. It is a good day for the judiciary, but we need more,” said senior lawyer and former director-general of prosecution T Asaf Ali, adding representation is still poor as out of 41 judges, only six are women. “I am sure the situation will change as more women are taking up judicial positions,” he said.“It is a welcome trend as it recognises the long expectations and aspirations of women law officers. Though it may not be reflecting the demographical share of women, it is a positive step. I am sure this will inspire more women to choose a career in law and judiciary,” said Supreme Court lawyer M R Abhilash.Interestingly the state contributed the country’s first female judge Anna Chandy in 1937, who later became the first female judge of the Kerala High Court in 1959. The first women Supreme Court judge Justice Fathima Beevi (1989), also hailed from Kerala and later became the governor of Tamil Nadu in 1997.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-women-hc-judges-in-kerala-for-first-time-101634845653683.html
22-10-2021||India||Bengaluru: ED attaches assets worth ₹7.48 crore of retired chief engineer||Assets worth around ₹7.48 crore of a retired chief engineer of the Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) has been attached on charges of money laundering, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) said on Thursday.“The attached movable/immovable properties include balance amounts lying in bank accounts, 3.41 kg gold and diamond jewellery along with immovable properties situated in various locations in Bengaluru and Mysuru which includes 2 residential sites, 1 commercial complex and 6 residential flats,” the ED said in a statement on Thursday.The developments come even as allegations of corruption are made against the officials and elected representatives in Bengaluru.The action has been taken under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). “ED initiated (a) money laundering investigation on the basis of FIR registered by Karnataka Lokayukta, Bangalore City Division, under Section 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. As per the charge-sheet filed by Karnataka Lokayukta in 2018, S.M. Basavaraju had amassed wealth beyond his known sources of income and was in possession of disproportionate assets worth Rs. 4.45 crore in excess to his known sources of income,” the agency said in its statement.The investigation revealed that there was money laundering by the engineer who had amassed wealth beyond his legitimate sources of income and purchased various movable/immovable properties in his name or as benami properties, in the name of his family members including his mother-in-law.On Wednesday, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) demanded that a white paper be furnished by chief minister Basavaraj Bommai over the spending of ₹20,000 crores on Bengaluru roads over the last five years.They alleged that the money was misused and charged the government and officials of pocketing the money while the conditions of roads in India’s IT capital remain in a pitiable condition.Raids and searches by the Income Tax Department on October 13 on people allegedly close to former chief minister BS Yediyurappa and his son BY Vijayendra unearthed ₹750 crores of cash and other assets.The IT had raided associates of Yediyurappa in an irrigation-related scam which was, among others, raised by a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator, AH Vishwanath.The huge budget in Bengaluru is also one of the reasons why Bommai has retained the district incharge portfolio as his cabinet minister slug it out to gain control over the finances over one of India’s biggest cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-ed-attaches-assets-worth-rs-7-48-crore-of-retired-chief-engineer-101634845532130.html
22-10-2021||India||After several rounds of talks, Congress declares Kerala office-bearer list||After several rounds of heated discussion and uncertainty, the All India Congress Committee (AICC) on Thursday released the list of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) office-bearers.Releasing the list, state Congress president K Sudhakaran said the party is supreme and all those who love the party will have to abide by the decision of the high command. Instead of an earlier jumbo list of 150 office-bearers, this time, the list contains just 56 members.The party will have four vice-presidents, 23 general secretaries, 28 executive members and one treasurer.Former Speaker N Sakthan, V T Balram, V J Paulose and VP Sacheendran are the PCC vice presidents.Among general secretaries, three are women -- former Youth Congress general secretary Deepti Mary Verghese, K A Thulasi and A Jameela. Though former chief minister K Karunakaran’s daughter Padmaja Venugopal’s name was doing rounds for some time, she failed to get into the list. Prathapa Chandran is the new treasurer. Aryadan Shoukath, Sony Sebastian, P A Saleem and A A Shukoor are prominent names in the general secretary list.The revamping of the PCC list got delayed due to pulls and pressures from various factions. The party was also cautious this time as the District Congress Committee (DCC) presidents’ list two months back triggered a revolt in the party, which led to many expulsions and resignations. To avoid such a situation, the party had several rounds of discussion with senior leaders.After a humiliating defeat in the April assembly elections, the party was forced to carry out major surgery in the state unit. It decided to clip the wings of two powerful groups and elevate a new crop of leaders. K Sudhakaran, a tough leader from Kannur, became the PCC president, and another popular leader V D Satheesan appointed as the opposition leader, sidelining two powerful blocs led by the former chief minister of state Oommen Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala, who led the party for more than a decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-several-rounds-of-talks-congress-declares-kerala-office-bearer-list-101634845472047.html
22-10-2021||India||Karnataka: Protests against CM Bommai for remarks on moral policing||Activists, human rights workers, lawyers, LGBTQIA community and several other sections of the society gathered in huge numbers across regions in Karnataka on Thursday in protest demanding an apology from Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai for his October 13 remarks in Mangaluru after a spate of incidents relating to moral policing, communal violence and hate crimes.“The communal health of the state is fast deteriorating owing to the rising violence by Hindutva groups. These organizations are effectively imposing social segregation on the basis of religion, gender and caste which is contrary to the core principles of the Constitution of fraternity and secularism. In fact, in S.R. Bommai vs. Union of India (UOI) and Ors., the Supreme Court has categorically held that secularism is a basic feature of the Constitution. Despite this, you have failed to take any action against any such groups,” the protestors said in a statement released on Thursday.“We wish to bring to your notice the oath taken by you when you were sworn in as the 23rd chief minister of the state of Karnataka under the third schedule of the Constitution of India, in which you have solemnly affirmed to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution as by law established, to uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India, to faithfully and conscientiously discharge your duties as the chief minister for the state of Karnataka, and to do right to all manner of people in accordance with the Constitution and the law without fear or favour, affection or ill-will. And you have acted in complete violation of this constitutional obligation,” the protesters said in its statement.The protests come at a time when Karnataka has seen at least 10 incidents of moral policing and communal violence with perpetrators almost getting a free hand to indulge in activities like assaulting interfaith couples, questioning and discriminating against persons from other religions and sometimes, murdering people for any relationship from other communities.“When sentiments are hurt, it is natural that there are actions and reactions. Even the youth should keep in mind these sentiments and act accordingly. This is a societal question. Society needs morality. Can we live without morality? No, we cannot. Relationships and peace are maintained by this morality,” Bommai had said on October 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-protests-against-cm-bommai-for-remarks-on-moral-policing-101634845294973.html
22-10-2021||India||Kerala women commission takes note, orders inquiry in missing child case||The Kerala state women’s commission on Thursday ordered an inquiry into the missing child case of Anupama Chandran, daughter of CPI(M) leader Jayachandran, six months after she filed a complaint against her parents for allegedly snatching away her new-born child.Women commission chairperson P Sathi Devi, also a former member of parliament, directed the state director general of police to inquire into the incident and locate the baby at the earliest. The commission has also decided to call a sitting next week and asked all involved to appear before it.Police were forced to register a case against her parents and four others on Tuesday after Anupama appeared on a news channel narrating her bitter tale. She said she knocked on many doors for six months and turned to the media finally on missing child’s first birthday, October 19.The red-faced CPI(M) leaders are yet to react on the matter, and most of them avoided a reply saying the state party secretary will explain it later. However, party insiders said many women leaders are upset with the way the sensitive issue was handled, as it gave enough opportunities to corner the party. A prominent section of the CPI (M) dubbed it only as “a family issue”, but admitted it dented the party’s image. “Finally, the women commission opened its eyes. If this is happening to a member of the party, what about others? Her parents should be arrested immediately, and police should locate her baby,” said Congress leader Bindhu Krishna criticising the silence of the left intellectuals and women activists. “The party is exposed terribly, and it is reduced to a criminal gang. Shockingly, even Politburo members failed to get her justice,” said BJP general secretary Geroge Kurian seeking action against all who tried to cover up the mother’s plight.The incident triggered enough outrage after the mother Anupama S Chandran (23), said she even approached senior leaders of the Politburo, including Brinda Karat and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to get her child back, but she failed to get justice. Anupama said her parents opposed their relationship as her husband belonged to Dalit Christian sect. Though her father, P S Jayachandran, party branch committee member and CITU leader, claimed that the child was with a government-run child welfare committee home, the couple failed to trace the child. Police booked the father, mother and four others under sections including 361 of the Indian Penal Code (kidnapping baby from lawful guardianship). Though most of the sections are non-bailable, the police are yet to make an arrest.Jayachandran’s father, late Peroorkada Sadasivan, was the CITU state general secretary and longest-serving member of the Kerala party committee.Though Jayachandran claimed that the baby was with the government-run child welfare committee home (an orphanage), the couple failed to trace the baby. Police have booked the father, mother and four others under sections including 361 of the Indian Penal Code (kidnapping baby from lawful guardianship). Though some of the sections are non-bailable, no arrest was carried out, the police said.On April 19, Anupama registered a complaint with the police and sent a copy of it to the chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and state police chief alleging that her relatives forcibly took away her baby and they feign ignorance now. She said the police failed to take any action due to political pressure, and she was forced to speak on a news channel after her all attempts failed. According to her complaint, the baby was found missing three days after delivery on Oct 19, 2020.Jayachandran claimed that since the child was born, the couple decided to shift her to a care home with the full consent of Anupama. He said she signed on stamp paper, but Anupama said she signed under duress, and she had several problems post-delivery because it was a C-section. Both Anupama and her husband Ajith are active workers of the Student Federation of India (SFI) and Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI), CPI (M) feeder organisations.Jayachandran said they opposed their relationship because Ajith had already married and had a child. But Ajith said he got married to Anupama only after his divorce from his first wife, and now his in-laws were opposing their relationship since he belonged to a Dalit family. But Jayachandran insisted that if they want their child back, they can proceed legally.“I was shooed away from many offices. Some of them later pleaded helplessness, fearing the wrath of the party. Is this the way to treat a distraught mother? How can they deny a mother’s legitimate rights citing silly issues,” she said, adding she was tortured while pregnant and taken to several places to abort but failed after they denied her consent.“My father sometimes says the child is in Tamil Nadu or north Kerala. The DNA test of two children admitted at the same period in the children’s home was also done but both failed to match us. I am ready to fight it out for my baby,” she said.“I am facing the worst kind of ex-communication. When I sought some jobs party leaders intervened and foiled my chances. I was also thrown out of the party. This is not Communism that I was taught,” said her husband.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-women-commission-takes-note-orders-inquiry-in-missing-child-case-101634845172528.html
22-10-2021||India||Kerala rains abate, blame game takes centre stage||As the dark clouds hovering over Kerala receded, a blame game on the political front began as the opposition parties have accused the ruling CPI (M), led by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, of failure to deal with the flash floods and landslide that claimed the lives of 42 people across the state. State opposition leader V D Satheesan, who visited the affected areas, said the government failed to prepare itself despite enough warnings. He also said that CM Vijayan is surrounded by sycophants and is not ready to face criticism or questions on how his government dealt with recurring natural disasters. “If someone questions or criticises him, they will be branded as traitors or anti-nationals just like Prime Minister Narendra Modi is doing. There is no difference between their style and functioning,” he said. He said despite the state witnessing four back-to-back natural calamities and losing hundreds of human lives since 2018, the state government failed to place a system to anticipate such disasters and deal with them. Satheesan also said a red alert was issued after the tragedy in Kottayam and Idukki districts. “The State Disaster Management Authority is reduced to a big disaster. The government needs to be aware of areas that could be affected by floods if water rises a bit in Pampa, Meenachil, Bharathapuzha or any other river for that matter”. He said Congress has repeatedly called for the strengthening of the early warning weather system since 2018, but nothing happened. “It seems we are waiting for another tragedy to occur. We need long-term strategies to deal with such calamities, and we have to check ecological degradation of fragile areas also,” he said. The BJP also came down heavily on the government, saying its inept handling led to the loss of precious lives and properties. “The government failed miserably even after the tragedy also. Volunteers and NGOs are distributing food, water, clothing, masks and other necessities in relief camps,” state BJP president K Surendran said, adding that enough funds were not allocated for relief works.State Congress president K Sudhakaran also accused the CM of not learning a lesson despite his much-touted trip to the Netherlands to study ways to tackle floods. “The LDF government collected billions in the name of Flood Relief Fund and Rebuild Kerala project, but nothing happened on the ground. People are still running from pillar to post for help,” he said, adding thousands of people who lost everything in the calamities in the previous years were still living on the roads and relief camps. However, CPI(M) acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan said that Sudhakaran was playing cheap politics during a calamity. “He has an uncanny knack to attack the CM personally. He proved beyond any doubt that he is not fit for the position he is holding,” he said. Though weathermen predicted heavy rains in four districts, situations were under control, and many areas remained sunny. Currently, around 30,000 people are staying in 428 rehabilitation camps across the state. “We are with the suffering people. We don’t want to play politics now,” said state revenue minister K Rajan referring to the opposition criticism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-rains-abate-blame-game-takes-centre-stage-101634845112400.html
22-10-2021||India||Panchamasali seer raises quota pitch before Karnataka bypolls||In a veiled threat to the Basavaraj Bommai-led government, an influential seer from the Panchamasalis, one of the biggest sub-sects of the dominant Lingayat community, on Thursday demanded action on their reservation-related request or expect a backlash in the October 30 bypolls. Kudalasangama-based Panchamasali Mutt seer Jagadguru Basava Jaya Mrityunjaya Swami on Thursday said that the government should get the report from the backward classes commission before the October 30 bypolls. “There is some discontentment among the people. Last time when the results of Maski and Belagavi came, the media showed that it was the impact of Panchamasali discontentment,” the seer said. Though he said that there was no relation with the October 30 bypolls and the demands made by the sub-sect, the seer added that members of this community account for a significant portion of Hanagal and Sindgi constituencies.“In both places there are several of our people. In Hanagal there are 60,000 Panchamasalis, in Sindgi there are around 37,000 people. If any candidate has to win, they have to get the votes of all the communities. In this backdrop, there has been some major discontentment (among the people in the community) that we did not get reservation, the chief minister’s post (for a member of this community) and no ticket also was given. There is discontentment for various reasons,” the seer said. The developments come even as all three political parties undertook fervent campaigns in the run up to the bypolls. In Karnataka’s deeply caste-based political culture, dominant communities are seen to be backing particular political parties and both sides use this to their advantage when required. The Lingayats are believed to back the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) while the Vokkaligas, found in large numbers in the old Mysuru region, back former prime minister HD Deve Gowda-led Janata Dal (Secular). The Congress is believed to have the backing of minorities, backward classes and Dalits among other sections. The Panchamasalis have threatened to revive their agitation to be included in 2A category of the state backward list. After this demand, several other dominant communities like the Vokkaligas, Valmikis and Kurubas among others have also raised similar demands for better reservation opportunities that have added to the challenges of the Bommai government. A collective of extremely marginalised groups have approached the courts to block any move of the government to give in to the demands of the Panchamasali as it would further deprive extremely backward communities of more opportunities. The community had called off their decision to hold an indefinite agitation from October 1 after assurances from the chief minister the previous day. Leaders of the community then said that they will give the government three months time after receiving the report from the backward classes commission. The seer said that it may take a long time for the government to give the community its ‘rightful’ reservation but the least they can do is get the report from the backward classes commission. Leaders of the community are also reaching out to members of their community in all parts of the state including Bengaluru to raise awareness and put more pressure on the government to heed to its demands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panchamasali-seer-raises-quota-pitch-before-karnataka-bypolls-101634844992265.html
22-10-2021||India||Kerala HC: Woman habituated to intercourse no reason to absolve rape accused||A woman or girl being of easy virtue or habituated to sexual intercourse cannot be reasons to absolve someone of rape, especially a father who is expected to be the “fortress and refuge” of his daughter, the Kerala High Court has said convicting a man for repeatedly raping his daughter which also resulted in her becoming pregnant.The high court noted that when a father rapes his daughter, it was worse than a gamekeeper becoming a poacher or a treasury guard becoming a robber.The observations by Justice R Narayana Pisharadi came after the victim’s father claimed that he was being falsely implicated in the case as his daughter has admitted that she had sexual relations with another person. Rejecting his claims of innocence, the high court further said that DNA analysis of the baby, born in May 2013 as a result of the sexual assault, reveals that the victim’s father was the biological father of the infant also. The high court said, “Even in a case where it is shown that the victim is a girl of easy virtue or a girl habituated to sexual intercourse, it may not be a ground to absolve the accused from the charge of rape. Even assuming that the victim is previously accustomed to sexual intercourse, that is not a decisive question.” “On the contrary, the question which is required to be adjudicated is, did the accused commit rape on the victim on the occasion complained of. It is the accused who is on trial and not the victim.” The high court further said that the father “was duty bound to provide the victim girl protection and support.” “But, he perpetrated sexual assault and rape on her. One cannot even imagine the trauma the victim would have suffered. The indelible imprint which the incestuous act has left in her mind cannot be ignored. She may feel the mental agony and pain for years to come,” it said.The high court also observed that “There can never be more graver and heinous crime than the father committing rape on his own daughter. The protector then becomes the predator. The father is the fortress and refuge of his daughter.“Charged of raping his own daughter under his refuge and fortress is worst than the gamekeeper becoming a poacher and treasury guard becoming a robber.” In the instant case, the high court also noted that due to the rape committed by her father, the victim delivered a male child and therefore, the sufferings endured by her “would be beyond imagination”. “In such circumstances, the accused is not entitled to any leniency in the matter of punishment,” it added.The high court while convicting the man for rape and sentencing him to 12 years in jail, set aside the trial court’s decision to sentence him to 14 years imprisonment under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offence (POCSO) Act on the ground that the prosecution was unable to prove the victim was a minor when the rapes occurred between June 2012-January 2013.The high court also set aside the man’s conviction and sentence for criminal intimidation of the victim, saying the prosecution has not proved that she was being threatened with dire consequences by her father.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-woman-habituated-to-intercourse-no-reason-to-absolve-rape-accused-101634844933045.html
22-10-2021||India||India invited Pakistan to attend conference on Afghanistan: Shah Mahmood Qureshi||Islamabad: Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said on Thursday that Pakistan has received an invitation from India to attend a conference on Afghanistan and a decision about attending the meeting would be taken in due course of time.Qureshi made the comments while addressing a press conference in Islamabad after returning from his day-long visit to Kabul where he met Afghanistan’s acting Prime Minister Mullah Hassan Akhund along with a high level delegation and discussed various issues.“Currently ties between Pakistan and India lack warmth…We will decide the issue of attending the conference after consultation,” he said.Ties between India and Pakistan nose-dived after a terror attack on the Pathankot Air Force base in 2016 by terror groups based in the neighbouring country. Subsequent attacks, including one on an Indian Army camp in Uri, further deteriorated the relationship.The relationship dipped further after India’s war planes pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp deep inside Pakistan on February 26, 2019 in response to the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed.The relations deteriorated after India announced withdrawing special powers of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcation of the state into two union territories in August, 2019.India has told Pakistan that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Islamabad in an environment free of terror, hostility and violence. India has said the onus is on Pakistan to create an environment free of terror and hostility. Earlier this month, Indian Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla, when asked about the possibility of improvement in India’s ties with Pakistan, said unless the basic core issue of terrorism emanating from the neighbouring country is dealt with, “I think we will not see much forward movement in the relationship.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-invited-pakistan-to-attend-conference-on-afghanistan-shah-mahmood-qureshi-101634844931865.html
22-10-2021||India||Gauri Lankesh murder accused to face charges under KCOCA: Supreme Court||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Thursday directed one of the accused in the murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh to be tried under the Karnataka Control of Organised Crime Act, 2000 (KCOCA). Mohan Nayak, the accused in question obtained an order from the Karnataka high court on April 22 which held that the charges under the 2000 Act were not made out against him. The high court went on to quash the charge sheet filed by the special investigation team (SIT) in the case. Setting aside the HC order on separate appeals filed by Lankesh’s sister and filmmaker Kavitha Lankesh and the Karnataka government, a three-judge bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar said, “The High Court committed manifest error and exceeded its jurisdiction in quashing the charge sheet filed before the competent court qua the writ petitioner – Mohan Nayak N, regarding offences under Section 3(1)(i), 3(2), 3(3) and 3(4) of the 2000 Act.” Lankesh was shot dead in Bengaluru in September 2017 and Nayak was accused of providing shelter to one of the shooters involved in the incident. Initially, a case of murder was registered on September 5, 2017 but after the investigation stood transferred to SIT, it was found Nayak was in close touch with Amol Kale, the main accused in the murder. Incidentally, Kale is also facing probe in connection with the murders of political activist Govind Pansare at Kolhapur in Maharashtra in February 2015 and noted Kannada writer MM Kalburgi in August 2015 in Dharwad, also in Maharashtra. Connecting the dots, the SIT took approval from the Karnataka’s additional director general of police on August 14, 2018 to invoke KCOCA provisions against Nayak to show he was part of an organised crime syndicate. On prima facie reading, the approval was granted and SIT filed a supplementary charge sheet under KCOCA provisions against Nayak in November 2018. The trial court also took cognisance of this charge sheet a month later. This approval granted by the Karnataka police was challenged by Nayak in the HC, which proceeded on the basis that for a person to be charged under KCOCA, there must be past criminal cases or charge sheets filed against him. The bench, also comprising of justices Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar, said, “The specific role of the concerned accused is not required to be and is not so mentioned in the state prior approval (of August 14, 2018). That aspect would be unraveled during investigation, after registration of offence of organised crime. The high court, thus examined the matter by applying erroneous scale.” The bench further stated that the HC judgment glossed over the “core and tangible facts” which required that the persons accused under KCOCA need not be one who has direct role in the commission of an organised crime as such. Even the requirement of having more than two criminal cases or charge sheets in the preceding 10 years will not be applicable for invoking provisions under the 2000 Act to show nexus with the accused, who is a member of organised crime syndicate and where the person charged has been found to play the role of an abettor or facilitator in the crime, the bench added. In the present case, the SIT discovered Nayak’s nexus with the “brain behind the entire event being none other than Amol Kale and master arms trainer Rajesh Bangera” who were part and parcel of an organised crime syndicate and had committed organized crimes as such. The court finally clarified that the judgment will not come in the way of the accused seeking any other relief as the consideration was limited to the correctness of prior approval for invoking KCOCA provisions against Nayak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gauri-lankesh-murder-accused-to-face-charges-under-kcoca-supreme-court-101634844691733.html
22-10-2021||India||Death case of Jayalalithaa’s driver reopened||The Salem Rural police have reopened the road accident case of late Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa’s car driver, Kanagaraj, who died five days after the April 2017 heist at the Kodanad estate in Nilgiris district, which was used by the former AIADMK supremo as a retreat.The case was reopened after obtaining required orders from the district court and an inquiry will begin soon, police sources said on Thursday.Valuables from the Kodanad property were looted while the security guard was killed.Kanagaraj, the prime suspect in the heist and murder case, died in a road accident on the Salem-Chennai National Highway, while attempting to cross the road on a two wheeler on April 28. The family members of Kanagaraj and his brother had lodged a complaint suspecting the accident to be a murder, as another suspect Sayan also met with a mishap in Palakkad in Kerala at the same time, in which his wife and daughter were killed.However, after investigation, the case was closed on the basis of postmortem report, citing Kanagaraj was drunk at that time.As the trial in heist and murder case was going on in a court in the Nilgiris district, the Salem Rural police have reopened this case and a special team will be formed to investigate it, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/death-case-of-jayalalithaa-s-driver-reopened-101634844632037.html
22-10-2021||India||Industrialised India has special climate responsibility: Frans Timmermans||Days ahead of the Glasgow climate change conference (COP 26), Frans Timmermans, executive vice-president of the European Commission in-charge of the European Green Deal, who is on a three-day visit to India, in an interview to Jayashree Nandi, says he expects clear commitments on reducing emissions from developing countries in the next two weeks. He also sees contentious issues like a new carbon trading scheme and the issue of loss and damage being resolved at COP 26. With India, the EU will be working closely on green steel, green hydrogen, and other renewable energy projects. Edited excerpts:Do you think the target of net zero emissions by mid-century is feasible and is it possible to keep global warming under 1.5 degree C?It is extremely difficult. Humanity has been asked to change its ways in such a radical way in such a short period of time… I believe net zero by the middle of the century is possible and desirable. Net zero doesn’t mean there is going to be zero emissions, but that we will not emit more than the atmosphere can absorb. I think it is achievable. If major emitters on this planet reduce their emissions and the richest countries get serious about helping the poorer nations to reach the same goal, then 1.5 degree C is still within reach. We need to start moving now. It’s only 30 years from now. When the Berlin wall came down 30 years back, I was already an adult. I am not sure if I will make it to 2050, but my children will and I want them to make it in a planet that is able to live within its boundaries.What are your expectations from India? The goal of net zero emissions is a global one, do you expect every country to commit to it?It would be a noble undertaking if all countries commit individually to net zero by mid-century. But there is a special responsibility for industrialised countries and in many aspects, India is an industrialised country. There is a differentiated approach but common responsibility. Countries I represent here have had 200 years of building their societies on the basis of carbon and so built up 200 years of emissions. Other countries like India did not have these 200 years. Some countries still aspire to give their population the human development that we almost see as self-evident in Europe. Every human on this planet has the right to aspire to the same level of development as many of my co-citizens. No one can escape their responsibility, but this responsibility is differentiated on the basis of history, development and wealth and that I think would be a fair approach to the issue.One of the most contentious issues to be discussed at COP 26 is a carbon trading mechanism. How do you see it coming up?Globally, if you want to decarbonise your economy, you have to put a price on carbon. You can do this in different ways: through taxation, through regulation. We have decided to let the market do this. With the rights to emissions, initially this system was seen as unsuccessful and people were complaining about the fact that price of carbon was so low that it did not have an effect on the behaviour of market parties. Now, the complaint is that the price is too high. The fact of the matter is that the market is used to it, the system is working, those who must work with the system are decarbonising. So, we strongly believe in this system. A major emitter like China has also introduced carbon trading. Of course, everyone is free to choose how to do it, but that we have to put a price on carbon seems to me an essential element of decarbonising our economy.Another unresolved issue is Loss and Damage (compensating vulnerable countries affected by climate disasters for the loss). Will there be consensus on that?We have been dodging around this issue for so many years and it is linked to so many other issues that need to be clarified, such as share of proceeds, transparency, accountability, common timeframes, part of global compromise that could emerge. Loss and damage should be part of that compromise in fair ways, so that everyone can recognise themselves. I think it’s possible to reach that compromise in Glasgow. For the EU what is important is that on a global scale we can compare apples to apples and not apples to oranges. For us, (EU) elements of transparency and accountability are extremely important. If we get good understanding on that then the issue of loss and damage becomes within reach of compromise.There is a lack of trust among developing countries because the $100 billion climate finance hasn’t come through. Will the money come and what are your views on a post 2025 climate finance goal?I think we should concentrate now on the $100 billion and I have been doing everything I can to increase the contribution of the rich nations. I believe we in EU are making a serious effort to do our part. The president of EC has increased our contribution, which was already the largest. Our total contribution is around $25.4 billon. This gives us the right to tell other nations to do more. At the same time, I will not hide the fact that I am encouraging my own member states to do more. It’s very tough. We are not there yet. But I hope we can use the next days and weeks to get us over that line. Once that is achieved, we can also create a positive basis upon which we can start discussing the post 2025 finance goal.The developing and developed countries stand divided ahead of COP 26. Developing nations expect rich countries to transition to net zero in advance so that there is carbon space for others. What will be your measure of success at the end of COP 26?The measure of success in my view is at the end of COP 26 can we say with justification, with facts that we will stay well below 2 degrees C of temperature rise, we still have a shot at 1.5 degrees C. That is the measure of success and for that to happen, we need clear commitments on mitigation also from developing countries. So, I hope we can use the next couple of weeks to stimulate clarity on NDCs. Of course, that also means stimulating clarity on what richer countries will do on adaptation and finance. Everything starts and ends with mitigation. If there is no mitigation, then why invest in adaptation as the whole thing will get out of control anyway. But without adaptation, you will not be able to convince countries to invest in mitigation because they will say you are leaving me on my own here. The climate crisis is happening now, case in point the floods in India in the past few days.What kind of meetings and partnerships did you forge during your visit in India?I really enjoyed my conversations with environment minister (Bhupender Yadav) and power minister (RK Singh) where we discussed very concrete things we could do together. I am very impressed with the commitment in material and political terms to massively increase the generation of renewable energy in India. The 450 GW renewable energy target by 2030 is quite something. We have laid groundwork on increased cooperation between India and EU on several issues, including green hydrogen where EU is leading. We will build on our cooperation on renewable energy also, strengthen our supply chains, build our solar capacity, grids and share knowledge on smart grids. One area obviously is steel. We are on the verge of green steel, wherein we use hydrogen to create the furnaces to make steel. India as a steel producing country could profit enormously if we could jointly make that transition. Indian companies are already involved in it in Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/industrialised-india-has-special-climate-responsibility-frans-timmermans-101634844452860.html
22-10-2021||India||Prime Minister Modi to attend COP 26 summit in Glasgow, says Bhupender Yadav||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend the U.N. climate summit in Glasgow, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav said on Thursday, in a boost for efforts to agree steeper emissions cuts to tackle global warming.India is the world’s third-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases after China and the United States, and Modi’s participation in the COP26 summit, which runs from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12, was seen as critical amid uncertainty over whether Chinese President Xi Jinping would attend.Both India and China, which have not yet made stronger pledges to cut emissions, known as nationally determined contributions or NDCs, face pressure to do so at the conference.“The prime minister is going to Glasgow,” Yadav said in an interview, adding that India was doing its bit to help tackle climate change.Summit host Britain welcomed Modi’s decision to attend.“India plays an important role in this and the prime minister has had a number of conversations with Modi on the importance of climate change, so we look forward to discussing it with them further,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman told reporters.Growing public pressure for action on climate change has spurred promises by countries and companies worldwide to contribute to the effort, which will be reviewed and amended at Glasgow.U.S. climate envoy John Kerry has visited India twice in the past few months to urge the Modi government to raise its climate ambition and consider a net zero commitment as scores of other countries have done.Net zero means balancing out greenhouse gas emissions with actions such as planting trees, restoring soil and using technology to prevent emissions reaching the atmosphere.But energy-hungry India, which still relies heavily on fossil fuels, says it should not be expected to make deep carbon cuts like rich countries because it is a developing economy.India’s Cabinet, chaired by Modi, will decide the position to be taken at COP26, most probably within a week, an environment ministry spokesperson said.Yadav said India was doing its part to cut emissions.“India’s NDCs are quite ambitious,” he said. “We are doing more than our fair share. Our NDCs are more progressive than major polluters.”The country is on track to increase green energy capacity to 450 GW by 2030, he said. It has installed more than 100 GW of renewable energy, which accounts for more than 25% of overall capacity.India has not yet committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050, considered a vital goal in limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.Government sources have told Reuters that India is unlikely to bind itself to that goal, as tougher deadlines would hit demand growth that is projected to outstrip that of any other nation over the next two decades.Last month, India’s chief economic adviser K.V. Subramanian said rich nations should commit much more than $100 billion to help poor countries fight climate change, due to their high historical share of emissions.“Even today, India’s per capita greenhouse emission is one-third of the world average,” Yadav said.About 120 countries have submitted revised NDCs, but there is a lack of consistency with no common timeframe for meeting pledges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prime-minister-modi-to-attend-cop-26-summit-in-glasgow-says-bhupender-yadav-101634844151618.html
22-10-2021||India||Shouldn’t expect favourable results in every round of China talks: Army chief||India should not expect favourable outcome in every round of talks being held with China to settle border issues and “points of divergence” with the neighbouring country will be resolved as long as both the nations keep talking, army chief General MM Naravane said on Thursday.“What I would like to put across is that we should not expect a favourable outcome in every round of talks. There are always going to be some points of convergence, some differences . As long as we keep talking, we will be able to resolve those points of divergence,” the army chief said at a defence conclave.Earlier this month, India and China failed to make any headway in resolving the 17-month standoff in the remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh during the 13th round of military talks between the two countries.The situation that developed in eastern Ladakh last year required acclimatisation of a large number of IAF personnel and stretching of equipment to limits, but the force is “much better prepared” now in case there is a “long haul”, Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhari said.“The situation that developed in eastern Ladakh last year was something that we were not very familiar with, particularly in the kind of environment that we needed to operate. It required acclimatisation of a large number of personnel at short notice, required stretching our equipment to limits, which some of it were not cleared for,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shouldnt-expect-favourable-results-in-every-round-of-china-talks-army-chief-101634844031688.html
22-10-2021||India||1 billion Covid doses: Across the country, a billion cheers||As part of his daily routine, 30-year-old Rajeev Singh was waiting for the passenger train that would take him back to his village in Janjgir Champa at the Bilaspur Railway station. Like every day, Singh was tired and short of sleep, having spent the night guarding a parking lot in the city. At 10 minutes past 10 o’clock though, Singh was shaken out of his reverie. A loud, cheerful voice boomed across the public announcement system, congratulating the nation on achieving the vaccination of one billion vaccine doses.As the crowds around him began to chatter, struck by the enormity of the number, Singh smiled to himself. One month ago, he had received his first Covishield shot. “I am happy that I am part of that billion,” Singh said.The first announcement had come in English.“Today India has achieved landmark milestone of 100 crore Covid vaccine doses. This is the world’s largest and fastest vaccination drive,” said the announcement. It was only when it was repeated in Hindi, that Singh wrapped his head around the number. “Sau crore (100 crore). It gives me a sense of security. That was all we could talk about on the train back.”There were celebrations all across the country on Thursday -- with the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) on Thursday illuminating 100 monuments, sweets were distributed at health centres in several districts, announcements rang out in airports and railway stations, and political leaders across parties congratulated heath workers for administering a billion doses since the start of vaccination drive in January.At the Rourkela government hospital at around the same time as the announcement was heard in Bilaspur, there was something else playing over the speakers. In a festive atmosphere, singer Kailash Kher’s voice serenaded the hospital, belting out “Bharat ka teekakaran, yehi jaan bachayega” (India’s vaccination, this only will save lives) as over a hundred nurses, doctors and other health workers milled around a rangoli celebrating the one billion mark. Former Union minister Jual Oram felicitated the 100th, 200th, and 300th people to get their vaccine shots at the hospital on Thursday, as well as every health care worker. “It feels good to celebrate a milestone. Even we have given over 1 lakh Covid shots at our centre,” said Dr Santosh Swain, director of RGH.At the Katju Hospital in Bhopal, Shubhi Singh from Kolar, seven months pregnant, was one of the patients that received the vaccine closest to when celebrations broke out in earnest, 15 minutes past 10am. “I had not been able to get my vaccine shot because of some medical complications. I was cleared a little while ago, but was deferring it until I read that India would hit one billion today. I wanted to be part of that so I came to the hospital,” she said.Some kilometres away, at the primary health care Centre in Kshipra, Indore, Dr Tripati Kandare marvelled at the change in attitudes she was seeing in front of her. Here, too, there was a Rangoli and sweets that were being distributed, but one patient after another came up to shake her hand. Kandare said that during the first wave, she had been attacked in the rural parts of Indore for holding vaccination camps. “This appreciation now feels wonderful,” she said.Leaders from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) hailed the achievement, and said that this could be achieved because of the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. BJP leaders held media interactions in various parts of the country -- Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said the feat was achieved under “guidance and leadership of the PM Modi, and Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai called it an “achievement sure to inspire the world”.Several chief ministers from other parties -- Arvind Kejriwal of Delhi, Pinarayi Vijayan of Kerala, and Uddhav Thackeray of Maharashtra -- said the occasion signified the dedication of health workers. “Congratulations to all the countrymen on administering 100 crore vaccines. Salute to the doctors, nurses and front-line workers who made this possible,”Kejriwal tweeted. Thackeray stressed that health workers worked tirelessly since the outbreak of Covid in March last year.President Ram Nath Kovind in Patna termed the achievement as “historic” and said it was because of collective effort of all Indians.Some Congress leaders, however, appeared to be at odds over how to tag the milestone.MP Shashi Tharoor said credit should be given to the government for achieving the 100 crore landmark, but drew a response from party colleague Pawan Khera, who asserted that giving credit was an “insult” to millions of families that “suffered due to the mismanagement” of the pandemic.Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) President TV Narendran said that unyielding efforts and sacrifices made by India’s researchers, doctors, health care workforce, administrative teams, and police personnel were extraordinary and laudable. “This is a truly inspiring achievement under the committed leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” said Narendran.So far, all adults in nine states and Union territories -- Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Lakshadweep, Sikkim, Uttarakhand, and Dadra & Nagar Haveli -- have received at least one dose of the vaccine.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-billion-covid-doses-across-the-country-a-billion-cheers-101634843855576.html
22-10-2021||India||Aamir Khan ad has created unrest among Hindus: BJP MP||Taking objection to an advertisement by tyre major Ceat Ltd in which actor Aamir Khan is seen advising people not to burst crackers on the streets, BJP MP Anantkumar Hegde has asked the company to also address the “problem blocking roads in the name of Namaz and noise emitted from mosques during Azan.” In a letter to the company’s MD and CEO Anant Vardhan Goenka, he requested him to take cognisance of the recent advertisement creating an “unrest among the Hindus”, and expressed hope in future the organisation will respect the “Hindu sentiment”.“Your company’s recent advertisement in which Aamir Khan advising people not to fire crackers on the streets is giving a very good message. Your concern to public issues needs applause. In this regard, I request you to address one more problem faced by people on roads, i.e., blocking roads in the name of Namaz on Fridays and other important festive days by Muslims,” Hegde said.In the letter dated October 14, he said, it is a very common scene in many Indian cities where Muslims block busy roads and perform Namaz, and at that time, vehicles like ambulances and firefighter vehicles are also struck in traffic causing “grave losses”.Also, requesting Goenka to highlight the issue of noise pollution in the company’s ads, the MP from Uttara Kannada said, every day, “loud noise is emitted from mikes arranged on the top of mosques in our country when Azan is given”.“That sound is beyond the permissible limits. On Fridays, it is prolonged for some more time. It is causing great inconvenience to people suffering from different ailments and taking rest, people working in different establishments and teachers teaching in classrooms. Actually, this list of sufferers is very long and only a few are mentioned here,” he said.“As you are very keen and sensitive towards the problems faced by the general public and you also belong to the Hindu community, I am sure you can feel the discrimination done to the Hindus since centuries,” he further said, adding, nowadays, a group of “Anti-Hindu actors” always hurt the Hindu sentiments whereas, they never try to expose the wrong doings of their community.“Therefore, I kindly request you to take cognisance of this particular incident where your company’s advertisement has created an unrest among the Hindus,” Hegde said, as he expressed hope that in the future Goenka’s organisation will respect the Hindu sentiment and will not hurt it directly or indirectly by any means.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aamir-khan-ad-has-created-unrest-among-hindus-bjp-mp-101634843791409.html
22-10-2021||India||War of words erupts between Maha minister, NCB official||A verbal war erupted between Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik and Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) zonal director Sameer Wankhede on Thursday over an ongoing drug case against Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan and others.Malik, a Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and minister of minority affairs, alleged that Wankhede was brought in by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to harass Bollywood actors and visited Maldives and Dubai as a part of extortion schemes. Hours later, Wankhede hit back, saying he was never in Dubai and that his family was being targeted.Wankhede supervised a raid on a cruise liner off the Mumbai coast earlier this month that led to the alleged recovery of drugs, following which Aryan Khan, 23, and 19 others were arrested. Malik, whose party is a key constituent in the state’s Maha Vikas Aghadi government, has repeatedly attacked Wankhede in the past and claimed that the NCB was unfairly targeting Aryan.“Attempts were made to implicate certain people in false cases. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the entire film industry was in the Maldives. What was the officer and his family doing in the Maldives and Dubai? This has to be clarified by Sameer Wankhede,” said Malik. “We are very clear. All this ‘vasuli’ (extortion) took place in Maldives and Dubai and I will release those photos,” he added.Malik said Wankhede was appointed after the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput in June last year and filed “bogus cases” against celebrities to get publicity. “Actor Rhea Chakraborty was framed based on the payment of ₹4,000. Based on WhatsApp chats, dozens of actors and actresses were paraded at the NCB office,” said the NCP spokesperson. Chakraborty is currently out on bail and the Central Bureau of Investigation is probing Rajput’s alleged suicide.Malik said Wankhede targeted his son-in-law Sameer Khan and put him in jail for eight-and-a-half months. “The court, while giving him bail, said that the offence against him doesn’t stand legally. All this is an attempt to defame Maharashtra government and Bollywood and BJP is behind the conspiracy,” the minister added.He referred to Wankhede’s sister Yasmeen as “lady don” and said she was in Maldives with him. Malik also released photos of Yasmeen, purportedly taken in the Maldives.“It is a challenge to Wankhede, within a year you will lose your job. You were trying to put us in the jail, now the people of the country will see you going to jail. I have proof that he is a bogus officer,” Malik said.Wankhede hit back, saying his family was being targeted because he was doing his job, but added that it would not affect his morale. He said photos released by Malik alleging he was in Dubai were actually taken in Mumbai. “The allegations of my visit to Dubai are totally false. This is false information. I was in Mumbai on the date the minister has mentioned in his allegations and he can fully investigate it,” he said.“I had gone to Maldives with my family and took appropriate permissions from government authorities for it. You cannot call it as an extortion. My wishes are with Nawab Malik if he wants my job to go. My family has been abused and threatened because I am doing my job. This will not lower my morale,” the officer added.Wankhede said he didn’t meet any celebrity in the Maldives. “He (Malik) is a big minister and I am a small government servant..., if he wants to send me to jail for service to the nation, honest work and anti-drugs action then I am welcoming it,” said the officer.“There has been continuous personal attack since the last 15 days against my dead mother, my retired father and my sister and I am condemning the attack,” he added.Yasmeen Wankhede, the officer’s sister, said she was free to go anywhere. “It is my personal life. I can go wherever I want to, so why should I tell him what I was doing there. Who is he, what authority does he have? I will tell this to my family and my brother. Tell him to go to court, do not waste the time of the people and press,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sameer-wankhede-visited-maldives-dubai-as-part-of-extortion-schemes-nawab-malik-101634843611504.html
22-10-2021||India||Time for India to start exports to help lower-income nations: SII's Adar Poonawalla||Nearly nine of every 10 Covid-19 vaccine doses given to people in India have been of Covishield made by Serum Institute of India (SII) in Pune. The company’s contribution has been a reflection of its position as the world’s largest vaccine maker by volume as well as India’s position as ‘the pharmacy of the world’. In an interview with HT, SII chief executive officer Adar Poonawalla says India must now resume exports to build on its position and help under-served regions, particularly before considering booster doses. Edited excerpts: India has now administered one billion Covid-19 vaccines; what do you have to say about the journey so far? The first milestone was finding the right partner and the right vaccine in terms of technology and potential efficacy. We have been incredibly fortunate and lucky to have Oxford and AstraZeneca as partners. After that came execution challenges, like getting funding, building facilities, going through permissions and the approvals -- [after] all those milestones, we were licensed in India on January 3rd. We were approved by the WHO (World Health Organization) in February, which was another key milestone because that meant we could export to other nations. And in March-April, we partnered with the government to build capacity and we succeeded and now are at 220 million a month. Covishield continues to remain the mainstay of India’s Covid vaccination programme; did you expect this? I feel relieved that it all worked out; the blood and sweat my team, my workers and I put through for the last one-and-a-half years. It is a validation that all this effort was worth it. I feel relieved and happy that India is safe in terms of its vaccine supplies security and going forward, you’ve got other Indian manufacturers who will scale up as well. What about vaccine exports; how soon do you see it happening? It’s time actually for India to start exporting and look at getting back to being the pharmacy of the world. The Covax facility and the lower income countries, particularly the African continent is where I am really looking forward to contributing. This should happen now in November and December and more so as we go into January, February, (quarter one of 2022), by when India will have reached two doses for all these beneficiaries we have today. What’s your take on booster doses? There is a scientific argument and there’s an ethical argument; the scientific argument still says that if you are the vulnerable and elderly, then yes may be after a few months you could take a third dose. The ethical and equitable argument is that there are many cases in the world where everyone should get first two doses before we even think and talk about the third dose. In Africa only 3% are covered, and even in India, everyone should get two doses before we get to talk about a booster. Have you made any profits? Of course, we have. We have worked with the government to come to a price where there’s some basic profit, which is sustainable because you have to be able to re-invest. Otherwise, how else am I going to be able to make factories and create jobs? In fact, they [the government] were very particular that you must make a sustainable profit otherwise you cannot re-invest and scale upIs the pressure off somewhat now? There were times when there was stress but now we are in a very relaxed situation as everyone understands and everyone has what they wanted and we performed; in fact, surpassed the promises we made of producing a billion doses by 2021. The pressure in some sense is still there because there is a long way to go still. I don’t want to rest until we have given billions of doses to the world, and launched some of my other vaccines, including Covovax for children, which we hope to launch by the first quarter of 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/time-for-india-to-start-exports-to-help-lower-income-nations-adar-poonwalla-101634843442170.html
22-10-2021||India||RSS wants BJP to undertake another outreach to farmers before UP elections||New Delhi: Worried that continuous agitations against the agricultural laws along with the recent violence in Lakhimpur Kheri may hurt the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has suggested that the party make a fresh outreach towards farmers ahead of the Uttar Pradesh elections next year.According to people aware of the details, the Sangh has also urged the party to ensure that it does not end up alienating minorities such as Sikhs and caste groups such as the Jats during the elections.The people cited above said that RSS joint general secretary Krishna Gopal met a select group of legislators, ministers and MPs, particularly from western Uttar Pradesh, in the past one week to take stock of the situation on ground. “The Sangh is concerned that the party should not be perceived as anti-minorities. The Sangh is already accused of being anti-Muslim, which is not true. Now, because of the ongoing farmers’ stir and the utterances of some BJP leaders, there is a sentiment brewing that the Sangh and the BJP are also anti-Sikh. Such perceptions need to be contested,” one of the persons cited above said, seeking anonymity. The Sangh always distances itself from electoral politics but has a key functionary to coordinate with the BJP on a host of issues, particularly related to governance and politics. The joint general secretary who has that mandate now is Arun Kumar, who took over the role from Krishna Gopal earlier this year. HT had earlier reported how the Sangh planned a special outreach in Punjab, the epicentre of the farmers’ protest, over concerns of a pro-secessionist movement gaining ground in the state. “There are some political groups trying to create a wedge between the BJP and various caste groups. Earlier, they tried to project the party as anti-Dalit, now they have turned to the Jats. But the people will see through these conspiracies as the work done by the BJP for the upliftment of all castes speaks for itself,” a BJP functionary said, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rss-wants-bjp-to-undertake-another-outreach-to-farmers-before-uttar-pradesh-elections-101634843371375.html
22-10-2021||India||New House panel report on data protection bill likely by Nov 6||A new draft report by the joint parliamentary committee (JPC) looking into the Personal Data Protection Bill is likely to be circulated among all members by November 6, people familiar with the matter said, after marathon discussions were held over some contentious clauses and suggestions.The report is expected during the winter session this year.“Most of the changes have been agreed upon by the committee,” one such person said, asking not to be named. “There was a lot of deliberation on how the new law must be in consonance with existing guidelines.”Unverified accounts and what action to take against them was also discussed by the panel, the person added. The constitution of the Data Protection Authority is also being closely worked out, with suggestion of a member appointed by the attorney general being floated.A second person familiar with the matter said that there was a lack of unanimity on certain issues. “Clause 35 and how many exemptions the government needs were highly debated,” this person said. “There needs to be a limit to the powers and whether they should be within the government or outside was discussed,” this person said.The person added Clause 28, wherein the law proposes to make social media companies liable for content moderation, was also discussed. “Then issues of delegated legislation and whether there should be a process to verify the capacity of a child to give consent was also brought up. The last two days have seen intense session.”The draft Personal Data Protection law was referred to a JPC to iron out several contentious issues in 2019. A previous draft was scheduled to be circulated among the members earlier this year but was abandoned when the then head, Meenakshi Lekhi, was inducted into the government and was replaced by the incumbent, PP Chaudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-joint-parliamentary-committee-report-on-personal-data-protection-bill-likely-by-november-6-101634843131194.html
22-10-2021||India||Centre can’t pull ₹8 lakh limit for EWS quota out of thin air: Supreme Court||Suggesting the Union government should do a “high-level policy rethink,” the Supreme Court on Thursday observed that the Centre cannot “pull” the ₹8 lakh annual income limit to identify economically weaker section (EWS) for providing 10% quota in public jobs and educational institutions “out of thin air” and questioned if the attempt was to “make unequals as equals”.A bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna took a grim view of the government’s inability to explain the methodology adopted in fixing the income criteria for EWS, as it examined a clutch of petitions that have challenged the 10% quota for EWS within all-India quota (AIQ) seats in medical admissions from the current academic year, 2021-22.“You must have some demographic or sociological or socioeconomic data. What is the exercise that you have done? Please, tell us that. You cannot just pull out ₹8 lakh out of thin air,” the bench told additional solicitor general(ASG) KM Nataraj, who was appearing for the Centre in the case.Demanding a categorical affidavit from the Centre within a week to explain the basis of fixing the ₹8 lakh ceiling for EWS, the court also questioned how the 50% ceiling on reservation, as laid down by the Supreme Court in the Indra Sawhney judgment of 1992, could be breached by providing for 10% reservation for EWS through an executive order when quota for scheduled castes (SC), schedules tribes (ST) and other backward classes (OBC) already constitute 49%.The 10% EWS quota was introduced under the 103rd Constitution (Amendment) Act, 2019 which is under challenge before a five-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court.Since the Act has not been stayed by court, the government issued a notification on July 29 introducing 10% EWS quota along with 27% quota for OBC within AIQ seats for postgraduate medical courses from this academic year. By this decision, 2,500 PG seats in government medical colleges would go to OBCs and 1,000 to those from EWS.This decision was challenged in a clutch of petitions that came up for hearing on Thursday. The income criterion of ₹8 lakh fixed by the Centre was one of the grounds taken by the petitioners to question the July 29 decision.Meanwhile, the ASG sought to argue that the income criteria was based on recommendations of the 2010 Sinho Commission report, and some other inputs, which were in the nature of “policy matters” and hence exclusively in the domain of the government. The three-member commission, headed by Major Gen S R Sinho (retired), was instituted by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, and submitted its report in July 2010.But the bench was unimpressed with the law officer’s tacit appeal to it to not interfere.“There has to be some exercise done before fixing this criterion. The only thing you argue is that it is for parity with OBC. But that will have a serious constitutional hurdle for you. You are making unequals as equals by applying ₹8 lakh limit. We gave you two weeks on the last date to file your affidavit and you should have done that in a matter as serious as this,” it told Nataraj.Clarifying the apex court will not stay away, the bench added: “You may say that these are issues of policy but we will have to interfere for adhering to the constitutional principles. You will have to set your house in order.”The court pointed out that unlike OBCs, EWS are not considered as socially and educationally backward under the constitutional scheme. “The creamy layer of OBC category is identified by the ones who have become advanced and have an annual income of more than ₹8 lakh. On the other hand, you fix the same income criteria of ₹8 lakh to include the beneficiaries under EWS category. So, you use the same criteria to exclude one segment of the OBC and include EWS. Is that justified? Have you taken factors like rural and urban areas into account? Or the residential flat category or exclusion of asset?” it asked the ASG.The bench then proceeded to frame specific issues that needs to be answered by the government in the affidavit to be filed before October 28 – the next date of hearing.The first two questions asked whether the Union government undertook any exercise before arriving at the income criteria to determine EWS and if so, whether the Sinho Commission report was the basis of this fixation.“The income limit for determining creamy layer in OBC and EWS is same at ₹8 lakh. In the OBC, those economically progressed is excluded so that social backwardness diminishes. In EWS, it is done to include the segments. Therefore, the income criterion in OBC, which is based on exclusion, is based on inclusion for EWS. In such a scenario, will it be arbitrary to provide similar income limit for EWS and OBC,” asked the court.It further sought a response from the Centre whether difference in rural and urban purchasing power has been accounted for while deriving the income limit of ₹8 lakh, and the reasons why assets are excluded in arriving at the annual income for EWS.“It would be necessary for the Centre to disclose before the court the nature of exercise undertaken in accordance with Article 15 (power of the State to make special provisions for identified classes). We make it clear that we are not entering area of policy but need the disclosure for adhering to constitutional principles,” recorded the bench in its order.It also told Nataraj that one of main contentions by the petitioners is that there is already 49% reservation combining SC/ST and OBC but by an executive order, the 50% ceiling on reservation has been breached to include 10% EWS. “If you want to do a high-level policy rethink, then do that,” the bench told the ASG.Representing the petitioners, senior advocate Arvind Datar and Shyam Divan have argued in the case that the per capita income in states differs widely and therefore, determining EWS at the all-India level requires careful study by an expert committee, so that the ends of social justice are attained. For this year, the lawyers have pleaded, EWS reservation should not be given effect in the absence of any criteria explaining the reservation.The petitions have also referred to a government order of January 17, 2019 which said income from all sources will be counted for EWS reservation. However, in August 2021, another government communication referred to the Sinho Commission that formed the basis for providing EWS reservation by fixing ₹8 lakh as the income limit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-can-t-pull-8-lakh-limit-for-ews-quota-out-of-thin-air-supreme-court-101634842953790.html
22-10-2021||India||SC resumes physical hearings after 19 months||The Supreme Court on Thursday held physical hearings, on a limited scale, for the first time since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, with Chief Justice of India (CJI) N V Ramana hinting that the top court may ramp up physical sessions after the Diwali break.The corridors of the top court were crowded and bustling as lawyers returned to the premises after a year and seven months. Expressing happiness over the resumption of physical hearings, Justice D Y Chandrachud said: “It is so good to see so many lawyers who bring joy and sunshine into this court intellectually. You cannot imagine how lonely it was to see the screen every day.”In a fresh standard operating procedures (SOP) issued on October 7, the top court had said that all matters listed on Wednesdays and Thursdays would be heard in physical presence of lawyers and litigants in courtrooms only. Hearings on Mondays and Fridays, when fresh matters are usually taken up, will strictly be conducted on virtual mode.The SOPs came into effect from Thursday. “It is a pleasure to come to the court and argue. We had been missing it all this while. Today morning, I came to the court at 9.45, much before the court began at 10.30 to catch up with my friends and colleagues at the bar,” senior advocate Dushyant Dave said.Speaking on similar lines, advocate Prashant Bhushan, after appearing for one of the cases, said: “We are happy that physical hearing of cases has begun.” Advocate VK Biju, who was present in the court on Thursday, urged the judges to consider holding physical hearings on all days.“Physical hearing of cases must resume. Junior lawyers have been suffering while seniors are not affected if virtual hearing continues,” Biju said. To this, Justice Chandrachud said: “Let us hope that we keep seeing your faces physically.” Advocate Biju’s concerns were also echoed by eminent jurist Fali S Nariman during an online lecture organised by the Indian Law Institute- Kerala chapter. “If the health situation is good, we must resume physical hearings. I know several young advocates in the Supreme Court who are facing difficulties and are suffering,” he said. While hearing a case, CJI Ramana suggested that the physical hearings are here to stay. “After Diwali, we may start physical hearing on a large scale,” he said.Another bench, led by Justice Rao, also told lawyers during the hearing of a case that physical hearing will be expanded after the Diwali break. Later in the evening, the CJI held a meeting with a group of representatives from the Bar to discuss the October 7 SOPs after senior lawyers Kapil Sibal and Abhishek Manu Singhvi demanded that the virtual hearing facility be available even on Wednesday and Thursday. Four other senior judges, Justices Uday U Lalit, AM Khanwilkar, Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and L Nageswara Rao, were also present in the meeting, besides attorney general K K Venugopal, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, Bar Council of India chairman Manan Kumar Mishra, Supreme Court Bar Association president Vikas Singh, Supreme Court Advocates on Record Association (SCAoRA) president Shivaji Jadhav.People familiar with the developments said the meeting culminated into the judges agreeing to modify the October 7 SOPs, considering the sensibilities of the request made by the senior lawyers. “It has been decided that lawyers may make requests for hearing of their cases through virtual mode even on Wednesday and Thursday. The bench concerned may accede to such a quest after examining the reasons cited,” the people cited above told HT. Meanwhile, the first day of the physical hearing witnessed several lapses in the implementation of the SOPs. For instance, social distancing was not maintained in the corridors and outside the court. “I was in Court 5 where a reservation matter was being heard throughout the day. Nearly 40-50 lawyers were present in the courtroom, and nobody was asked to vacate for sanitizing the courtroom,” said advocate Sachin Patil, practising in the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-resumes-physical-hearings-after-19-months-cji-says-may-continue-on-larger-scale-after-diwali-101634842951996.html
22-10-2021||India||Singh questions Cong’s secularism, accuses it of ‘sheer political opportunism’||Former Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh hit out at the Congress on Thursday for its “sheer political opportunism” in joining forces with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and inducting people like Navjot Singh Sidhu from the Sangh Parivar, a day after AICC Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat questioned his secular credentials.Singh resigned as the CM last month after a bitter tussle with Punjab Congress chief Sidhu. On Tuesday, he said he would float a new party soon and hoped to tie up with the Bharatiya Janata Party for the forthcoming state polls. The announcement drew sharp reactions from the Congress, including Rawat who said that if Captain wants to eat crow, he can.“Stop talking about secularism @harishrawatcmuk ji. Don’t forget @INCIndia took in @sherryontopp after he was with @BJP4India for 14 years. And where did Nana Patole and Revnath Reddy come from if not RSS? And Pargat Singh was with @Akali_Dal_ for 4 years!” said Singh’s media adviser Raveen Thukral on Twitter quoting him.In his no-holds-barred attack, Singh also questioned the Congress’s tie-up with Shiv Sena, asking Rawat if it was okay to join forces with so-called communal parties if it suited the party’s purpose.Responding to Rawat’s charge that he helped the Akalis, the former CM tweeted: “Today you’re accusing me of helping my rival @Akali_Dal_ for 4-and-a-half years. Is that why you think I’ve been fighting court cases against them for the last 10 years? And why I’ve won for the Congress all elections in Punjab since 2017?” Singh further said that Congress damaged its own interests by not trusting him and giving the state unit into the hands of an unstable person like Sidhu who was only loyal to himself.Meanwhile, Sidhu and Singh traded barbs once again on Thursday after Sidhu called the ex-CM the “architect” of the three central farm laws.“The Architect of 3 Black Laws… Who brought Ambani to Punjab’s Kisani… Who destroyed Punjab’s Farmers, Small traders and Labour for benefitting 1-2 Big Corporates!! (sic)” the PPCC chief tweeted with an old video clip of Singh in which he, as chief minister, talked about inviting private companies to the state.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting at Delhi’s borders for nearly a year against the three farm laws enacted by the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre.Responding to Sidhu’s remarks, Singh called him a fraud and cheat for trying to pass off an old diversification initiative as being linked to the farm laws. “What a fraud and cheat you are @sherryontopp! You’re trying to pass off my 15-year-old crop diversification initiative as connected with #FarmLaws, against which I’m still fighting and with which I’ve linked my own political future!” he was quoted as saying by his media adviser Thukral in a series of tweets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarinder-singh-questions-congress-s-secularism-accuses-it-of-sheer-political-opportunism-101634842535728.html
22-10-2021||India||Priyanka Gandhi promises smartphones for 12th pass girls if Congress wins UP elections||After promising to reserve 40% of seats for women candidates, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Thursday announced smartphones for Class 12 female passouts and electric scooties for women graduates if her party was voted to power in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections slated for early next year. “Yesterday I met some girl students. They said they needed smartphones for their studies and their security. I am happy that today the UP Congress has decided, with the consent of the manifesto committee, that it will provide smartphones to inter pass girls and electronic scooties to graduate girls on forming its government,” the Congress leader tweeted in Hindi.Priyanka Gandhi, who is the party’s UP in charge, also attached with her tweet a video of a group of college girls interacting with a journalist. In the video, one of the girls said Priyanka Gandhi asked if they had a phone for clicking selfies. “We said we neither have phones nor are they allowed in colleges. She then asked us if she should get it announced that girls should get phones and we said what more can we ask for our safety,” the student said in the video.“She asked us to study hard. I want her to continue to meet and talk to us like this,” another student is seen saying in the video.The girls said Priyanka Gandhi also told them about the Congress slogan “Ladki Hoon, Lad Sakti Hoon”.“Please make sure to take these announcements to the people and post them on social media platforms,” UPCC organisation secretary Anil Yadav said in a communication to party workers.A Congress leader, who did not wish to be named, said: “These announcements will be part of the Congress’s poll manifesto to be released later.” On Tuesday, Priyanka Gandhi had announced that 40% of candidates fielded by the party for the assembly elections next year would be women.A close scrutiny of data by the Election Commission of India suggests that as on January 1, 2021, Uttar Pradesh has 145.85 million voters, of which 67.05 million are women. On Congress’ latest announcement, state BJP vice-president and MLC Vijay Pathak said: “Congress is making all such announcements in view of the 2022 assembly elections. Everybody knows how the Congress did not keep its promise of loan waiver in Madhya Pradesh. People are also aware of what the Congress has done for women in states where the party is in power.” “Announcing freebies in elections has become a norm for political parties in recent years. It’s better to promise something to young girls in the education sector than making announcements on caste or community lines that are not healthy. As far as the issue of giving 40 per cent Congress tickets to the women is concerned, this may not cut much ice unless the party addresses other serious issues like rising unemployment,” Professor Roop Rekha Verma, former vice chancellor of Lucknow University, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-promises-smartphones-for-12th-pass-girls-if-congress-wins-up-elections-101634842471043.html
22-10-2021||India||Big milestone for vax drive: Billion doses and counting||The billionth shot of the Covid-19 vaccine was administered in India on Thursday morning – exactly nine months and five days after the country’s massive Covid-19 immunisation programme kicked off on January 16.The significant milestone in the country’s grand vaccination drive, one of the world’s largest, comes at a time when the second wave of Covid-19, which ravaged India in the summer, continues to recede with new infections currently at the lowest levels in more than seven months – a factor that experts have credited, at least in part, to the success of the vaccination campaign.In absolute numbers, the billion (100 crore) shots place India as the second country in the world (next to China with 2.2 billion shots administered) in terms of total Covid-19 vaccine doses administered. The vaccines were administered in roughly 430,000 centres and a total of at least around 2 million health workers were directly involved in the process. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed gratitude to doctors, nurses and all those who worked on crossing 100 crore vaccinations. “India scripts history. We are witnessing the triumph of Indian science, enterprise and collective spirit of 130 crore Indians. Congrats India on crossing 100 crore vaccinations. Gratitude to our doctors, nurses and all those who worked to achieve this feat. #VaccineCentury,” he tweeted . On Thursday morning as the news broke of the country’s billion-dose milestone, the PM visited Delhi’s Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital’s vaccination centre and interacted with hospital officials, beneficiaries, and frontline workers. He was accompanied by Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya.As of 11pm on Thursday, 100,6152,914 shots of the Covid-19 vaccine have been administered across the country to 710.9 million people, according to data from Union health ministry’s CoWIN dashboard. This means that about three-fourth (75.6%) of India’s nearly 940 million adults have now received at least one dose while around 31% are fully immunised, data shows.Of these, around 886 million doses have been of Covishield (the brand name under which Pune-based Serum Institute of India has been manufacturing the vaccine developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca), while around 115 million doses have been of Covaxin (the shot developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the country’s apex biomedical research regulator, the Indian Council of Medical Research). To celebrate the event, a series of events were held around the country, including the launch of a theme song and the release of an AV. The largest khadi tricolour in the country, weighing around 1,400 kg, displayed only on special days, was unfurled to mark the occasion, and 100 monuments under the Archeological Survey of India (ASI) were illuminated in tri-colour and local artists displayed 100 different ideas across 100 districts.The UN health body, World Health Organisation (WHO) also congratulated India. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus congratulated PM Modi, scientists, health workers and Indian citizens. “Congratulations, Prime Minister @narendramodi, the scientists, #healthworkers and people of #India, on your efforts to protect the vulnerable populations from #COVID19 and achieve #VaccinEquity targets,” he said in a tweet.The roll out of the vaccine drive was patchy, largely on account of supply issues but after the second wave, the pace of vaccinations has picked up – more than half of the billion shots have been administered since August 1. “There were some issues in the beginning, but gradually the supplies improved as companies increased their monthly vaccine production. For the month of October, The Centre has been promised about 280 million vaccine doses that includes 220 million doses of Covishield and another 60 million of Covaxin. This is going to go up further. Zydus, for example, should be able to give 6 million doses of their vaccine ZyCoV-D. Increased supplies also lead to increased number of single day vaccinations that puts the whole vaccination drive at a far better place then where we were a few months ago,” said a senior government official aware of the matter on condition of anonymity.The makers of Covaxin and Covishield, Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute of India also appreciated Indian government’s efforts to administer such a large number of doses in nine months.“Reaching the 1 billion mark of Covid-19 vaccinations in just nine months is a remarkable achievement for India. Bharat Biotech is proud to have contributed to this historic landmark. This is a unified effort of the government, vaccine manufacturers, health care workers and all the vaccinated citizens of India, making it a true success story of atmanirbharta,” said Krishna Ella, chairman and managing director, Bharat Biotech. Suchitra Ella, joint managing director, Bharat Biotech, thanked the government and all the stakeholders. “We thank the PMO, ministry of health, Indian Council of Medical Research, academic collaborators, industry partners, stakeholders, suppliers and employees for enabling us to maximise our efforts and deliver Covaxin successfully to India’s vaccination.” Serum Institute of India’s CEO, Adar Poonawalla, said he feels he made the right decision by tying up for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. “Everyone has been watching this journey and has been a part of this journey along with us; ever since we tied up and made the decisions. The first milestone was finding the right partner and the right vaccine partners in terms of technology and which vaccine will work. We have been incredibly fortunate and lucky to have Oxford and AstraZeneca as a partner,” said Poonawalla.THE PATH AHEADIndia’s next target is to fully vaccinate all adults by the end of the year. The demands on the pace of vaccination drive remain high, with the daily dose rate having seen a near-consistent decline from the peak levels seen during the second half of September – a factor that Union health ministry officials and experts have attributed to low turnout during the ongoing festive season and the country nearing a ceiling in terms of coverage of population. The seven-day average of daily vaccinations, which touched a peak of 9.7 million for the week ending September 23, dropped nearly 60% to around 4 million shots a day in the past week.An easy way to understand the impact of this drop in vaccination pace is to see it as the required run rate in the final overs of a cricket match. In the race for vaccination, as is the case in a run chase, a slower run rate in the middle of an innings requires heavy slogging in the final overs. In the case of vaccination, it means that if India had sustained its shot rate from September end, then it would have been on course to meet its year-end target; but the recent drop has now pushed the required rate to more than 12 million doses every day till the end of the year. Such a calculation, of course, assumes that the entire adult population of the country will want vaccines, an unlikely proposition. Most experts fear the vaccine drive will hit a ceiling around the 75-80% level. At 75%, it would mean India has to administer only 875 million more shots till the end of the year. In a press briefing on Thursday, Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala raised the required rate of vaccination to criticise the government. “Data shows that in 70 days, 106 crore Covid-19 vaccines need to be administered... Will the Modi government, instead of making television headlines, answer how it is going to administer 106 crore vaccines in 70 days, and what is going to be their policy?” the Congress leader asked. India has around 940 million people aged 18 and over, which means that it actually has to administer around 875 million shots over 71 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/big-milestone-for-vax-drive-billion-doses-and-counting-101634842170188.html

22-10-2021||India||FATF retains Pak on its ‘grey list’||The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Thursday retained Pakistan in its grey list and urged the country to do more to investigate and prosecute senior leaders and commanders of UN-designated terror groups involved in terror financing.FATF president Marcus Pleyer said after a three-day plenary meeting of the multilateral watchdog that Jordan, Mali and Turkey had been added to the list of countries under increased monitoring or grey list because of serious issues in their regimes to counter money laundering and terror financing. Following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, FATF also expressed “concern about the current and evolving money laundering and terrorist financing risk environment” in the war-torn country. “Pakistan remains under increased monitoring,” Pleyer told an online news briefing. “Pakistan has taken a number of important steps but needs to further demonstrate that investigations and prosecutions are being pursued against the senior leadership of UN-designated terror groups,” he said. Pakistan was added to the grey list in mid-2018 and given a 27-point action plan by FATF to control money laundering and terror financing. In June this year, FATF asked Pakistan to implement another seven-point action plan to address serious deficiencies related to money laundering. Pleyer said Pakistan had “addressed or largely addressed” 30 out of the 34 items in the two action plans. He said the country had made “good progress” on the 2021 action plan by tackling four out of the seven items, including checks on businesses and enacting legislative amendments to ensure international cooperation.But Pleyer insisted Pakistan must deliver on the sole remaining item in the 2018 action plan by demonstrating that its investigations and prosecutions are targeting senior leaders and commanders of UN-designated groups. He brushed aside several questions from Pakistani journalists that FATF’s actions were political in nature and said that the watchdog made all decisions within a technical framework following voting by the organisation’s members. FATF said in a statement that Pakistan had made significant progress in addressing its “strategic counter-terrorist financing-related deficiencies”.The statement added: “Pakistan should continue to work to address its other strategically important AML/CFT deficiencies, namely by: (1) providing evidence that it actively seeks to enhance the impact of sanctions beyond its jurisdiction by nominating additional individuals and entities for designation at the UN; and (2) demonstrating an increase in ML investigations and prosecutions and that proceeds of crime continue to be restrained and confiscated in line with Pakistan’s risk profile, including working with foreign counterparts to trace, freeze, and confiscate assets.”In a separate statement on Afghanistan, FATF said that the watchdog, “as the global standard setting body for anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, expresses its concern about the current and evolving money laundering and terrorist financing risk environment in the country”.FATF affirmed the UN Security Council Resolutions on the situation in Afghanistan, especially resolution 2593 which “demands that Afghan territory not be used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or to finance terrorist acts”. The statement on Afghanistan added, “The FATF calls on all jurisdictions’ competent authorities to provide advice and facilitate information sharing with their private sectors on assessing and mitigating any emerging ML/TF risks identified, in accordance with the risk-based approach.”At the same time, FATF reiterated the “upmost importance of ensuring non-profit organisations (NPOs) and all other humanitarian actors can provide the vital humanitarian assistance needed in the region and elsewhere, without delay, disruption or discouragement. The FATF calls on all jurisdictions to protect NPOs from being misused for terrorist financing.”The FATF, together with its affiliates APG, EAG and the Global Network, will “closely monitor the situation, including any changes to money laundering and terrorist financing risks in Afghanistan”, and consider all options to help promote security, safety and the integrity of the global financial system.At its last virtual plenary meeting in June, the watchdog had retained Pakistan in its “grey list” for failing to adequately investigate and prosecute leaders of UN-designated terrorist groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fatf-retains-pak-on-its-grey-list-101634841990164.html
22-10-2021||India||Probe widens: NCB knocks SRK’s door, quizzes Ananya||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Thursday expanded its probe into drugs found on a cruise ship three weeks ago, questioning Bollywood actor Ananya Panday for two hours and visiting actor Shah Rukh Khan’s home in Mumbai to collect evidence in connection with charges against his son Aryan Khan. NCB officials said Panday, 22, was called in for questioning after investigators found relevant WhatsApp conversations between her and Aryan, 23, who is in jail on drug consumption and conspiracy charges. She visited the NCB office accompanied by her father Chunky Panday to record her statement and is scheduled to appear before the agency on Friday, said officials. An NCB team searched her house in the morning, and seized her mobile phone and laptop. Later in the day, a five-member NCB team visited Khan’s home in Bandra to collect evidence in connection with the case and left after half an hour. “Today, a team of NCB Mumbai Zonal Unit Officials visited Mannat, the residence of Aryan Khan in connection with CR 94/21 (Aryan Khan cruise drug case) for seeking certain material related to the investigation of the case from Shah Rukh Khan, father of Aryan Khan by following due procedure of notice etc. It wasn’t a raid as erroneously reported in certain sections/channels of media,” said Sameer Wankhede, NCB’s Mumbai zonal director. The day began with the 55-year-old Khan visiting his son at Arthur Road jail for the first time since he was arrested on October 3. Khan reached the jail at 9.15am, spoke to Aryan for 15 minutes over an intercom system and separated by a glass wall, said a prison official. He left the jail surrounded by body guards at 9.40am, briefly greeting the crowd gathered outside. This was the first day that family visits resumed at the jail after a pandemic-enforced six-month break. “The actor was allowed to meet his son, as per the prison manual, like any other family member of a prisoner and no special treatment was given to him,” said a second prison official on condition of anonymity. “Four guards were present along with them during their conversation,” the official added. Aryan is lodged in Arthur Road jail for alleged consumption and conspiracy under the stringent Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act after the NCB raided Cordelia, a Goa-bound holiday cruise ship on October 2 and recovered multiple drugs, including 13 grams of cocaine, 5 grams of mephedrone, 21 grams of Charas, and 22 pills of MDMA (ecstasy), and ₹1.33 lakh in cash. Wankhede had led the raid on the cruise ship, docked at Mumbai’s International Cruise Terminal at Green Gate on October 2. Since then, 20 people, including Delhi-based event management professionals, Nigerian nationals, and Mumbai-based drug peddlers, have been arrested under various sections of the NDPS Act. The NCB sought Aryan’s custody, claiming that his WhatsApp chats revealed that he was in touch with a person abroad who appeared to be part of an international drug trafficking network. On Wednesday, a special NDPS court denied him bail, saying there was prima facie evidence that the 23-year-old was indulging in “illicit drug activities” on a regular basis, and could commit a similar offence if released.Aryan approached the Bombay high court (HC) for bail, but the court posted the bail application hearing to October 26 even as a special court extended his judicial custody to October 30. Aryan has already received ₹4,500 (the maximum permissible amount for an inmate in a month) from his family to buy eatables and other items from the jail canteen. Aryan had earlier spoken to his family over a video call a few days ago.ANY COMMENT ON WHAT PANDAY SAID IN HER STATEMENT? Since Aryan’s arrest on October 3, noted film personalities, including Hrithik Roshan, Zoya Akhtar, Farah Khan and Raveena Tandon, have expressed their solidarity with Khan and his wife Gauri.

22-10-2021||India||NCB delayed producing Nigerian before judge. HC does the math, orders bail||PANAJI: A Nigerian national detained for a day before being arrested in March this year was ordered to be released on bail by the Bombay high court at Goa on Thursday because the Narcotics Control Bureau, or NCB, did not produce him before a magistrate within 24 hours of his detention.Justice Manish Pitale rejected NCB’s contention that the agency formally arrested the 39-year-old Nigerian national on March 8, and the 24-hour period should be calculated from this date.“It was found that the moment the accused was out under complete control of the officers with absolute restrictions on his movement, his arrest was complete in law,” the judge ruled, granting the accused bail on this ground of delay.But it will be some time before Ugochukwu Solomon Ubabuko is released on bail. Given that he is already facing four drug trafficking-related cases, the judge ordered him to apply for a fresh passport from jail (since he claimed to have lost his original passport), get a valid visa and then surrender it to the investigating officer. He will also have to report to NCB’s Goa office every Monday once he is released on bail.Ubabuko petitioned the high court for bail, citing Article 22 (2) of the Constitution which requires “every person who is arrested and detained in custody” to be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of 24 hours of such arrest.He told the court that NCB raided his house and detained him at 6.25pm on March 7 this year, placed him under arrest at 5.30pm on March 8 and produced him before a magistrate only on March 9.Ubabuko contended that the failure of NCB to produce him before a magistrate on March 8 violated his right guaranteed by the Indian constitution and was a ground to be granted bail.According to him, the federal drug enforcement agency officials raided his house in Mazal vaddo Assagao on March 7 this year home where he lived with John Infinity alias David, from Congo. The raids were part of a probe to find out the drug suppliers who allegedly supplied drugs to the intermediaries who ultimately supplied them to actor Sushant Singh Rajput.According to the case records, Ubabuko resisted a search by officers who knocked on his door on March 7 evening but was brought “under control”. The officers allegedly seized contraband from his house.Ubabuko and David were taken to the police station and the formalities about the seizures were completed at 1:20am on March 8. He was, however, kept in the police station the entire day of March 8 and on March 9, he was produced before the Magistrate in the morning at about 10am.According to NCB, there was nothing illegal about his detention since he was placed under arrest at 5:30pm on March 8 (nearly 24-hours after the raid) and was produced at 10 am on March 9 before the magistrate, and at 3 pm before the special NDPS court which remanded him in judicial custody.“The applicant was neither detained nor arrested during this period (between the raid and his arrest). The procedure of searching the premises of the applicant was followed in a strictly legal manner and that Ubabuko voluntarily accompanied the raiding officers to the police station for recording his statement,” lawyer Mahesh Amonkar, appearing for NCB, argued.Ubabuko’s lawyer Raju Poulekar contested this claim, contending that he was effectively under arrested from 6:25pm the previous day, when the raid started and his freedom of movement was curtailed.“Even as per the panchanama, at 6:25pm on March 7 itself, the applicant (Ubabuko) was detained as his movements were controlled and curtailed,” Poulekar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncb-delayed-producing-nigerian-before-judge-hc-does-the-math-orders-bail-101634841691892.html
22-10-2021||India||Key tunnel for Tawang likely to be completed before deadline||A strategic tunnel under construction in Arunachal Pradesh will be ready ahead of deadline by June 2022, permitting swifter deployment of weapons and soldiers to forward areas near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Tawang sector in all-weather conditions, officials familiar with the development said on Thursday. The Sela tunnel, a ₹700-crore project announced by the government in 2018, will be the longest twin-lane tunnel above 13,000 feet in the world, and will cut down travel time to Tawang by at least one hour as well as provide all-weather connectivity, said Sela tunnel project director Colonel Parikshit Mehra.Winter connectivity to Tawang over the 14,000-foot pass, Sela, posed a logistics challenge for the army for decades, with the movement of men, weapons and stores severely affected for at least three months, said a second official cited above. The Sela project, being executed by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO), involves the construction of three tunnels --- a main tunnel, an escape tube, and a shorter third tunnel --- and a road connecting the main and the third tunnels. The tunnels are coming up through two ridges west of the Sela pass. The main and escape tunnels are 1,555 metres long each, the shorter tunnel 980 metres and the road stretches 1,200 metres (only tunnels longer than 1,500 metres have to have an escape passage alongside).The Sela tunnel is a part of the Balipara-Charduar-Tawang road, one of the key strategic projects near the Chinese border. The main tunnel was fully excavated last week, with defence minister Rajnath Singh presiding over the breakthrough blast via video conferencing. The escape tube of the Sela tunnel was excavated last year. The BRO has set Army Day 2022 (January 15) as the target for the complete excavation of the third tunnel.Singh said on October 14 that the Sela Tunnel, located in West Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh, will play a crucial role in bolstering national security and ensuring the region’s socio-economic development.“All-weather connectivity in this critical sector is critical. The Sela tunnel project will result in speedy mobilisation of troops and equipment as also enhance the army’s logistics support capability. This is important as China has built roads right up to its anticipated ingress points,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd).As many as 50 engineers and 500 workers are directly involved in the construction of the Sela tunnel using latest Austrian tunneling techniques. The Austrian method involves observing and studying the rock, and designing tunnel support according to rock behaviour, Mehra said. He was handpicked for the Sela project last year factoring his experience in the construction of the Atal tunnel in Rohtang, a project he was associated with for five years --- from beginning to end.He was moved to Nuranang to accelerate the Sela tunnel by applying the lessons learnt in Rohtang. “The lessons of poor geology learnt in Rohtang have helped us here. If bad rock is coming our way, we are taking measures in advance. We are using extra tunnel support so that deformations and collapses can be avoided,” said Mehra, who holds an M. Tech degree from IIT Delhi and another master’s degree from Austria.Around 4,000 army and civilian vehicles are expected to use the tunnel daily. Its dimensions will support the movement of all types of army vehicles and military hardware, including the Bofors guns that have to be towed to forward areas by Scania trucks.On Tuesday, eastern Army commander Lieutenant General Manoj Pande said both India and China were attempting to scale up infrastructure near the LAC in the eastern sector. The Indian Army is regularly picking up increased military vehicular movement across LAC in the Arunachal Pradesh sector due to improved Chinese infrastructure. There is a tremendous thrust on building infrastructure in Arunachal Pradesh whether it is through the development of border roads or the efforts of the civilian government, Major General Zubin A Minwalla, the commander of the Rupa-based HQs 5 Mountain Division, said earlier this week. The division’s responsibilities encompass the sensitive Tawang sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/key-tunnel-for-tawang-likely-to-be-completed-before-deadline-101634841571096.html
22-10-2021||India||Akhada Parishad split down the middle weeks after seer’s death||The apex body of Hinduism’s 13 monastic orders, the Akhada Parishad, suffered a major split on Thursday with half of its members distancing themselves from an upcoming meeting to elect a new governing body and naming their own office bearers. Seven influential akhadas announced a new president, general secretary and working committee members to steer the apex body, drawing an angry response from Akhada Parishad officials. “The appointment of the new working committee of the Akhada Parishad was done in an open and transparent manner, which augurs well for the seer community,” said Mahant Ravindra Puri, a member of Maha Nirvani Akhada who was named president of the Akhada Parishad by the rebel faction. He said the meeting and appointment of the new office bearers was done under acting president Devendra Shastri so it was a legal electoral process.But the current office bearers of the Akhada Parishad dismissed the new appointments and called them illegal. “Actual meeting regarding the election of Akhada Parishad new working committee has already been announced and convened at Baghambari Math in Prayagraj raj on October 25. So, the decision and election of new working committee along with president and general secretary will only take place there only. The majority of Akhadas and saints are with us only,” said Hari Giri Maharaj, the Akhada Parishad general secretary. Niranjani Akhada secretary Ravindra Puri Maharaj also termed the rebel faction’s appointments as “inappropriate” and questioned how the meeting could be held without current office bearers of the Akhada Parishad. The open rebellion indicates a deepening of the crisis roiling the Akhada Parishad after the death of its erstwhile chief, Mahant Narendra Giri, on September 20 by alleged suicide. The Central Bureau of Investigation is probing the death, and has arrested three people named in the seer’s suicide note.Giri, an influential figure with ties to top politicians, had controlled the Akhada Parishad and the Baghambari Gaddi Math in Prayagraj for 15 years. On October 5, Giri’s successor at the Baghambari Math was announced but swirling speculation about his suicide note, veracity of his will and circumstances before his death prevented the Akhada Parishad from naming its chief. Giri’s death also sparked a tussle between members of the Akhada Parishad for control of the powerful body that has a decisive say in key Hindu festivals and events, such as the Mahakumbh. This is the first split in the Akhada Parishad in almost a decade. The body split into two factions in 2010 but the warring groups reconciled three years later. The seven akhadas were led by Shri Panchayati Maha Nirvani Akhada, which has thousand of seers and followers.Three Bairagi Akhadas — Nirmohi, Digambar and Nirvani — who played a major role in fanning the rebel faction, also backed the move. Since the Mahakumbh in Haridwar in April-May 2021, the three Bairagi Akhadas have been demanding representation in the Akhada Parishad working committee , general secretary post , land allocation and other facilities at par with the Juna and Niranjani Akhadas -- the two biggest constituents of the Akhada Parishad who have traditionally steered the body. They claimed support from Maha Nirvani, Nirmal and Bada Udasin Akhadas.“Bairagi Akhada has been raising issues of due representation at the Akhada Parishad. It’s a decision of seven Akhadas done in the interest of the body, and we are now representing Akhada Parishad,”said Mahant Rajendra Das of Nirmohi Ani Akhada, the newly elected general secretary of Akhada Parishad.But the rebel faction was condemned by major members of the Akhada Parishad, including the Juna Akhada , Niranjani Udasin Akhada,Agni and Aahwan Akhada. “Any meeting is called after 15 days prior information. This meeting as well as election procedure is illegal and violative of Akhada Parishad rules and regulations. We term the new working committee as void and the Akhada Parishad meeting at Prayagraj will discuss this issue in length. Action may also be taken against those who violate the Akhada Parishad constitution,” said Hari Giri Maharaj. Akhada officials from both sides indicated at a major showdown at the October 25 meeting in Baghambari Math, the seat of the former chief Giri. The exact strength of each side will be clear at the event, they added. Noted Akhada and Kumbh follower Mahesh Parikh, who has written a book on the subjects’ histories, said that political ,social and financial power that wrest with Akhada Parishad has led to the current division.“Its quite surprising that within a month of the death of Akhada Parishad president Narendra Giri, Akhada Parishad has broken into two factions.Now, the Prayagraj meeting will decide the outcome as two biggest Akhadas ,Juna and Niranjani,” said Parikh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/akhada-parishad-split-down-the-middle-weeks-after-seer-s-death-101634841510736.html
22-10-2021||India||Uttarakhand toll hits 64, trekkers among dead||The death toll from floods, landslides and building collapses in Uttarakhand due to intense rain earlier this week reached 64 on Thursday, with at least 11 people still missing, officials said. Authorities began assessing the damage to personal property, infrastructure and agriculture, as Union home minister Amit Shah carried out aerial surveys of some of the affected regions. Shah, who reached Dehradun late on Wednesday from Ahmedabad, accompanied chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, governor Lt Gen Gurmit Singh (retd), Union minister of state for defence Ajay Bhatt, Rajya Sabha member Anil Baluni and other senior officials of state and central government. “During the aerial survey of the affected areas for about two hours, many things came up. At least 64 have died so far while over 11 are still missing. The property loss is, however, yet to be ascertained as it requires ground survey by the official which takes time. It would be done by the officials of home ministry along with the state government officials in a couple of days which will then send a report to the Centre for appropriate assistance,” said Shah while addressing media persons in Dehradun. At least 13 people, including 10 trekkers, died in separate incidents in the higher reaches of the state after being trapped in snowfall, officials confirmed on Thursday. Officials said 65 people are still trapped at different regions in the upper reaches.“Over 65 tourists are trapped in higher reaches of Bageshwar — 20 at Kafni and 34 at Dwali glacier besides the 10 at Sunderdhunga. We have sent three rescue teams from the district along with one helicopter and one NDRF team from Dehradun to rescue the tourists, who are mostly from Kolkata,” said Shikha Suyal, district disaster management officer, Bageshwar.Of the 13 confirmed dead, three were porters working for the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) posted at the Indo-China border in Uttarkashi district. The 10 trekkers who died included eight who went missing while on their way to the Lamkhaga Pass near Harsil in Uttarkashi district, 230km from Dehradun, on October 14. Seven of the eight were from West Bengal while the remaining person was from Delhi.Devendra Patwal, district disaster management officer, Uttarkashi, said, “The rescue workers compromising SDRF and air force personnel spotted five bodies near Lamkhaga Pass on Thursday morning. The bodies will soon be airlifted from the spot.” The other group of trekkers who died were in the Bageshwar district. Four from this group were rescued near Sunderdhunga glacier. Shah said, “Timely warning issued by the Centre to the state government on October 16 helped in saving many lives.” “The warning issued before 24 hrs of the heavy rain forecast definitely helped in minimising the damage... Fewer lives were lost due to timely actions taken by the state government on the basis of the prior warning,” he said. He added that “17 teams of NDRF, 60 of SDRF, 15 companies of PAC and over 5,000 personnel of state police are on the ground at present for rescue works in the affected areas”. “Because of the alertness of these along with central forces — ITBP, army and air force — the Char Dham pilgrims were asked to stay in safe places in the three days of heavy rains. Due to this, not a single pilgrim or tourist lost his/her life. These rescue forces also rescued about 3,500 people and evacuated over 16,000 people to safety as a precautionary measure,” said Shah. The home minister, after holding a meeting with the officials, also said that the road connectivity has been restored in most places, except few where roads have been completely washed away. “In those places, new roads are to be constructed by cutting the hills which will take some time. Power supply has also been restored up to 60% in the affected areas. Apart from this, 80% phone connectivity has also been restored,” said Shah. While assuring the state government of “every possible assistance”, he added that the Centre last month provided “ ₹250 crore from the disaster management department to Uttarakhand for disaster mitigation”. “Apart from this, the Centre will provide more financial help to the state as soon as it receives the assessment report of property loss in the state by the officials.” Addressing the media on the steps being taken by the government to manage such disasters in the future, the Union home minister also said the Centre would soon open an institute for research and mitigation of disasters in Uttarakhand. “A proposal for the same had already been sent by the state to the Centre a few months ago. At least four meetings on the same have happened on it...It will soon be established after which it will not only be beneficial for the Himalayan region but entire country,” said Shah, adding, “Centre is standing with the people of Devbhoomi in this hour of need.” Earlier on Wednesday, CM Dhami had conducted an aerial and ground survey of the flood-affected areas in the Kumaon division of the state during which he too had assured all possible help to the victims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-toll-hits-64-trekkers-among-dead-101634841331151.html
22-10-2021||India||UP custodial death: Dalit man died of heart attack, says autopsy report||The post-mortem report of a sanitation worker, who died in the police custody after being arrested in connection with a theft of ₹25 lakh from a warehouse, showed heart attack as the cause of his death, the Uttar Pradesh police said on Thursday. “In compliance with the norms laid down by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), the post-mortem was conducted by a panel of doctors. According to the post-mortem report, the cause of death is myocardial infarction (heart attack),” said Agra senior superintendent of police (SSP) Muniraj G. “Further investigation in the matter is underway,” the SSP added. The sanitation worker, Arun Valmiki, was arrested by the police in connection with the theft of ₹25 lakh from the warehouse of Jagdishpura police station in Agra on Sunday (October 17). He was accused of stealing the money on Saturday night from the “malkhana” (a storage house where items confiscated by police are kept) of the Jagdishpura police station, where he worked as a cleaner. Valmiki died in police custody on Tuesday night. “During questioning, he confessed to the crime. Police recovered ₹15 lakh from his home. During recovery, he fell ill. Police and his family rushed him to the hospital. The doctor declared him brought dead. An FIR has been registered,” the Agra SSP had earlier said. Citing the post-mortem report, people aware of the developments and speaking on condition of anonymity said there were some injury marks on the body of the deceased, but were not serious enough to have caused his death. They, however, could not ascertain if these injury marks, including blue marks on the hips and scratch on legs, were recent or old. Meanwhile, additional director general of police (Agra) Rajiv Krishna said, “Our officers are in contact with his family. They’re cooperating. Action will be taken if there was any negligence. The family has filed a complaint. They suspect he was beaten up by the police following which he died. FIR was registered and the matter will be probed.” (With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/upcustodial-death-dalit-man-died-of-heart-attack-says-autopsy-report-101634841210628.html
22-10-2021||India||The numbers behind India’s billion dose landmark||India administered its billionth dose of Covid-19 vaccines early on Thursday, the only country other than China (2.2 billion doses administered) to cross the milestone. India’s adult population (the only ones eligible for vaccines right now) is estimated at 940.2 million, and this milestone in absolute numbers is a milestone in coverage too. As of 5pm, around 76% of adults in the country had received at least one dose of the two-dose vaccine. And around 31% have been fully vaccinated.Seen in the context of the last national sero-prevalence survey (these test for antibodies) that showed that almost two-thirds of the population had been exposed to Covid-19, and the current low daily case numbers, the vaccination statistics mean that India will likely not see a third wave of infections according to experts.But India’s high population (1.3 billion) mean that the country’s vaccine drive still has some distance to cover.Half the districts have covered 75% of their population with at least one doseThe 1 billion dose count has come along with coverage of 75% adults with at least one dose. At the district-level, a little over half the districts – 345 of 628 districts of 2011 census with all of Delhi’s and Mumbai ‘s districts taken together – have reached this level of coverage. The top five districts in terms of coverage of first doses are Diu, Kolkata in West Bengal, Gurgaon in Haryana, Solan in Himachal Pradesh and Dadra and Nagar Haveli. The first dose coverage in these districts is the complete adult population as estimated through the number of electors.Another 261 districts have given at least one dose to 50%-75% of their population. Only 22 districts have vaccinated less than 50% of their population. 16 of these 22 districts are in the north-eastern states (nine in Nagaland alone) and the other six are in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.
22-10-2021||India||Remove all illegal constructions in animal corridors near Kaziranga: SC to Assam||A Central Empowered Committee (CEC), constituted by the Supreme Court, has directed the Assam government to remove all illegal constructions in the nine animal corridors around Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve.In a letter to Assam chief secretary Jishu Baruah on October 6, a copy of which HT has seen, the panel also sought an action taken report from the government within four weeks in this regard. “It is requested that immediate action is taken to remove all constructions made in violation of Hon’ble Supreme Court order dated 12.04.2019 and not permit any new constructions along the nine identified animal corridors,” CEC member secretary Amarnatha Shetty said in the letter.The CEC’s latest directions came after a report by the Union environment ministry in September indicated that several new structures had cropped up in the concerned corridors in violation of a top court ruling in April, 2019. The report was prepared by Laetitia J Syiemiong, deputy inspector general of forest (central) of Shillong office of the Union environment, forest and climate change ministry, on the CEC’s order. The CEC had sought inspections of the nine corridors after activist Rohit Choudhury complained about the new constructions. The inspection revealed that a temple, shops, hotels, restaurants, tea estates and even a government building were built in eight corridors. Most of the constructions were found in Haldibari and Kanchanjuris corridors. The report noted a lack of coordination between the district administration, forest department and police, and blamed them for violating the top court order. It added that no action was initiated to remove the constructions. The report also noted that while delineation of the nine animal corridors, spread over 44.205 km, has taken place, the state government is yet to formally notify it. It suggested demolition of illegal constructions in the animal corridors and a proper survey.“The problem is that the animal corridors fall in revenue land and not in the forest area. Therefore, the forest department cannot remove structures constructed there. It is the duty of the district administrations to do that,” Amit Sahai, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), said. “We have asked the government to constitute a committee, comprising district administration as well as the forest department, so that this issue can be resolved,” he added. Principal secretary (forest and environment) Avinash Purushottam Das Joshi said the government has received the letter and necessary directions have been issued for action.Choudhury said the government appeared to be least bothered about encroachment on animal corridors that hamper the safe movement of wild animals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/remove-all-constructions-from-animal-corridors-sc-panel-directs-assam-101634814926153.html
22-10-2021||India||6-yr-old killed for resisting sexual assault bid by 3 minors, say police||A six-year-old girl, whose body was found in a toilet at a stone quarry in Assam’s Nagaon district earlier this week, was murdered for resisting a sexual assault attempt by three boys who were addicted to watching pornographic clips, investigators said on Thursday.All the three accused, aged between 8 and 11, were taken into custody on Wednesday while the parents of one of them were arrested for alleged criminal conspiracy and destruction of evidence. While the minors were produced before a juvenile justice board and sent to a remand home, the parents were remanded to judicial custody by a local court on Thursday, the investigators added. Police said the girl’s body, with injury marks on her head and chest, was found in the toilet of a non-functional stone quarry in Kaliabor area on Monday hours after she went missing from home. Preliminary probe indicated that the minor was hit with a blunt object. While a post-mortem report is awaited, prima facie it appeared to be a case of physical assault and molestation but not rape, police added. “On Monday, the three minors took the girl to the quarry and tried to molest her. When she resisted and threatened to complain against them, the minors hit her on the head and chest with a stone which resulted in her death. The minors then hid the body in the quarry’s toilet,” Mrinmoy Das, a sub-divisional police officer, said.“The security guard of the quarry told us the victim’s body was first spotted by the minors. The boys said the body was removed from the spot by the guard. When we questioned the guard again, he said the crime was committed by the minors,” he added. Police said the accused minors were the son and nephew (both aged 11) of the guard, and another eight-year-old who lived near the victim’s home. The girl’s mother had passed away and she used to stay with her father, a daily wager, and her grandmother.Investigators said the guard had purchased a smartphone for his son to attend online classes but the child, along with the other accused, started watching pornographic clips instead. The phone’s browsing history confirmed the same, they said. It was learnt that the accused used to molest other minor girls as well, police said.A case under section 302 (murder) of Indian Penal Code has been registered and more sections are likely to be added after approval from court, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-boys-killed-6-year-old-girl-for-resisting-sexual-assault-police-101634809945913.html
22-10-2021||India||India scripts history, administers one billion Covid-19 vaccine doses||At 10.35 am on Thursday, India achieved the milestone of administering one billion Covid-19 vaccine doses as part of the national immunisation drive started in January with Prime Minister Narendra Modi thanking doctors, nurses, and others who worked for making it possible.In a tweet, Modi said, “India scripts history. We are witnessing the triumph of Indian science, enterprise and collective spirit of 130 crore Indians. Congrats India on crossing 100 crore vaccinations. Gratitude to our doctors, nurses and all those who worked to achieve this feat. #VaccineCentury.”All major monuments under the Archaeological Survey of India were being illuminated as part of the celebrations planned to mark the achievement. Ships anchored on Indian ports hooted at a pre-decided time while artists were working on 100 different ideas across 100 districts to celebrate the milestone. At the main celebration event at Delhi’s Red Fort, the longest national flag will be unfurled while an anthem and a short film on key vaccination components will be released to mark the occasion.Among the monuments to be illuminated include Cellular Jail, (Andaman and Nicobar Islands), excavated remains of Nava Nalanda Mahavihara (Bihar), Sher Shah Suri’s Tomb (Bihar), Raipur Circle (Chhattisgarh), Chandigarh Capitol Complex, Astodia Gate (Gujarat), Sun Temple (Gujarat), Kangra Fort (Himachal Pradesh), Tipu Sultan’s Palace (Karnataka), Bekal Fort (Kerala), Gwalior Fort (Madhya Pradesh), Aga Khan Palace (Maharashtra), Temple of Vishnu (Manipur), Dimapur Fort (Nagaland), Qutub Minar (Delhi), Konark Sun Temple (Odisha), Kumbhalgarh Fort (Rajasthan), Vellore Fort (Tamil Nadu), Golconda Fort (Telangana), Ancient Fort (Jammu & Kashmir), Fatehpur Sikri (Uttar Pradesh), and Metcalfe Hall (West Bengal).Free rides at all major ropeways across the country will also be offered to people who have been fully vaccinated.The Union health ministry created hashtag #VaccineCentury and a digital clock ticking backward to determine the number of vaccination doses left to be administered to reach the one-billion target.The World Health Organization (WHO) congratulated India for achieving the target.“Huge congratulations to India for marking yet another milestone -- a billion COVID-19 vaccine doses administered. This extraordinary feat in a short span was not possible without strong political leadership, inter-sectoral convergence, dedicated efforts of the entire health and frontline workforce, and the people themselves. India’s progress must be viewed in the context of the country’s commendable commitment and efforts to ensure that these life-saving vaccines are accessible globally,” said Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, WHO, South-East Asia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-administers-one-billion-covid-19-vaccine-doses-101634794885385.html

22-10-2021||Today's||HT Exclusive: PM Modi writes on Covid-19 about 1 billion vaccine doses||India completed 1 billion (100 crore) vaccinations on October 21, in just about nine months. This has been a tremendous journey in dealing with Covid-19, especially when we recall how things stood in early 2020. Humanity was dealing with a pandemic of this nature after 100 years and no one knew much about the virus. We remember how unpredictable the situation appeared then. We were faced by an unknown and invisible enemy that was mutating rapidly. The journey from anxiety to assurance has happened and our nation has emerged stronger, thanks to the world’s largest vaccination drive.It has truly been an effort reminiscent of Bhagirath (who brought the Ganga down to Earth) involving multiple sections of society. To get a sense of the scale, assume that each vaccination took two minutes for a health care worker. A billion vaccinations translate into 4.1 million man-days or approximately 11,000 man-years of effort.For any effort to attain and sustain speed and scale, the trust of stakeholders is crucial. One of the reasons for the success of the campaign was the trust that people developed in the vaccine and the process followed, despite various efforts to create mistrust and panic.There are some among us who only trust foreign brands, even for simple everyday necessities. However, when it came to something as crucial as the Covid-19 vaccine, the people of India unanimously trusted “Made in India” vaccines. This is a significant paradigm shift.India’s vaccine drive is an example of what the country can achieve if citizens and the government come together with a common goal in the spirit of Jan Bhagidari (citizen partnership). When India started its vaccination programme, there were many people who doubted the capabilities of 1.3 billion (130 crore) Indians. Some said India would take three to four years to complete its vaccination drive. Others said people would not come forward to get vaccinated. There were still others who said there would be gross mismanagement and chaos in the vaccination process. Some even said that India would not be able to manage supply chains. But just like the “Janata Curfew” and subsequent lockdowns, the people of India showed how spectacular the results can be if they are made trusted partners. When everyone takes ownership, nothing is impossible. Our health care workers traversed hills and crossed rivers across difficult geographies to vaccinate people. Our young people, social and health care workers, and civil society and religious leaders, all deserve credit for the fact that India has faced minimal vaccine hesitancy when compared even to developed nations. There was a lot of pressure from different interest groups to give preferential treatment to them in vaccination, but the government ensured that, much like our other schemes, there was no VIP culture in the vaccination drive either.In early 2020, when Covid-19 was rampaging across the world, it was clear to us that this pandemic would have to be eventually fought with the help of vaccines. We started preparing early. We constituted expert groups and started preparing a road map right from April 2020.Till today, only a handful of countries have developed their own vaccines. More than 180 countries are dependent on an extremely limited pool of producers and dozens of nations are still waiting for the supply of vaccines, even as India has crossed a billion doses! Imagine the situation if India did not have its own vaccine. How would India have secured enough vaccines for such a large population and how many years would that have taken? It is here that credit should be given to Indian scientists and entrepreneurs for rising to the occasion. It is due to their talent and hard work that India is truly Aatmanirbhar (self-reliant) when it comes to vaccines. Our vaccine manufacturers, by scaling up to meet the demands of such a large population, have shown that they are second to none.In a nation where governments used to be known as a roadblock impeding forward movement, our government has instead been an accelerator and enabler of progress. The government partnered with vaccine makers right from Day 1 and gave them support in the form of institutional assistance, scientific research, funding, as well as an accelerated regulatory processes. All ministries of the government came together to facilitate vaccine-makers and remove any bottlenecks as a result of our “whole of government” approach.In a country of the scale of India, it is not enough to just produce something. The focus has to be on last-mile delivery and seamless logistics. To understand the challenges involved, imagine the journey taken by one vial of the vaccine. From a plant in Pune or Hyderabad, the vial is sent to a hub in any of the states, from where it is transported to the district hub. From there, it reaches a vaccination centre. Across India, this entails thousands of trips taken by flights and trains. During this entire journey, the temperature has to be maintained in a particular range, which is centrally monitored. For this, over one lakh units of cold-chain equipment were utilised. States were given advance notice of the delivery schedule of the vaccines so that they could plan their drives better; the vaccines reached them on the pre-decided days. This has been an unprecedented effort in the history of independent India.All these efforts were complemented by a robust technology platform, CoWIN. It ensured that the vaccine drive was equitable, scalable, trackable, and transparent. It ensured that there was no scope for favouritism or jumping the queue. It also ensured that a poor worker could take the first dose in his village and the second dose of the same vaccine in the city where he worked, after the required time interval. In addition to a real-time dashboard to boost transparency, the QR-coded certificates ensured verifiability. There are hardly any examples of such efforts not only in India but also the world. In my Independence Day Address in 2015, I said that our country was moving ahead because of “Team India” and that this “Team India” was a big team of our 1.3 billion people. People’s participation is the biggest strength of democracy. If we run the country through the participation of 1.3 billion Indians, our country will be moving ahead 1.3 billion steps every moment. Our vaccination drive has yet again shown the power of this “Team India”. India’s success in its vaccination drive has also demonstrated to the whole world that “democracy can deliver”.I am optimistic that the success achieved in the world’s largest vaccination drive will further spur our young people, our innovators and all levels of government to set new benchmarks of public service delivery which will be a model not only for our country, but also for the world.Narendra Modi is Prime Minister of India||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/how-india-responded-to-adversity-with-achievement-101634863176504.html
22-10-2021||Today's||The abiding relevance of integral humanism||“All ideologies are idiotic, whether religious or political, for, it is conceptual thinking, the conceptual world, which has so unfortunately divided man”, renowned philosopher Master Jiddu Krishnamurti once lamented. Europe was the mother of ideologies – from the capitalism of Adam Smith to the social conservatism of Thomas Hobbes and John Locke to the liberalism of John Stuart Mill to the communism of Karl Marx. All these ideologies have created schisms and confusion across the world, forcing American historian and social thinker Morris Berman to warn, “An idea is something you have. An ideology is something that has you.”India has historically been the land of ideas. From the Vedic rishis through Mahavira, Buddha, Shankara, Aurobindo, and Vivekananda, the great men of India have generally been philosophers, articulating profound ideas for human welfare. India has not produced any ideologues such as Marx or Mill. Yet, the deeply philosophical ideas of its sages and savants have continuously inspired and influenced mankind across history and geography.In the realm of socio-political ideas, there was only one original contribution made by India in the last century. That was Mahatma Gandhi’s non-violence and truthful resistance – famously known as ahimsa and satyagraha. Gandhi’s ideals inspired freedom-seeking peoples all over the world. Ahimsa entered the socio-political lexicon of the world for good.But there was another originally Indian idea propounded in the middle of the last century, which was Deen Dayal Upadhyay’s integral humanist philosophy.Philosophical doctrines are not easy to comprehend. Karl Marx and Frederic Engels propounded their communist ideology through Das Kapital in 1867. Marx continued his efforts at elaborating on it for more than a decade-and-a-half until his death in 1883. Yet, it took five decades for communism to find political expression in 1917 in Russia.In the case of integral humanist philosophy of Deen Dayal Upadhyay, the effort needed to take forward the precis and develop it into a complete political philosophy was not made by his followers after his untimely passing in 1968. It looked complicated, and hence vague and fanciful theories such as Gandhian socialism preoccupied them for some years before they finally settled on a relatively easier formulation of cultural nationalism.The world passes through various phases of transition from time to time. Nations get an opportunity to play a role in that transition. One such opportunity came after World War II in the last century when a new world order began to take shape. It was shaped largely by European and Western thought, although Gandhi too made a significant contribution. That world order has served mankind for over seven decades. But a new world order is taking shape today, in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic.In that post-Covid world order, India has an opportunity to play a bigger role in the domain of ideas. Deen Dayal Upadhyay’s integral humanist philosophy can act as the sheet anchor for that. But the problem is two-fold. One, wider Indian scholarship since Independence has been so deeply influenced by the Western paradigm that many cannot even think that India can offer an alternative worldview at this transitional juncture.Two, in the liberal view, Deen Dayal Upadhyay represented India’s Right, conservative Hindutva movement. Globally a dominant force in the intellectual world, liberals abhor conservatism. They branded Hindutva as retrograde and unintellectual hocus-pocus and even attempted “dismantling” it recently.Deen Dayal Upadhyay, thus, needs to be rescued from apathy on one side and antipathy on the other. His views regarding nation-building, national identity, social institutions such as caste and political institutions such as democracy remain as relevant today as they were six decades ago. They should be revisited from the prism of the contemporary Euro-centric ideas. Such an effort should not end up as Euro-scepticism but help throw light on the contemporary relevance of ideas that are rooted in Indian wisdom and milieu.For example, contrary to the propaganda about Hindutva’s fascist credentials, Deen Dayal Upadhyay had zealously upheld democracy as the best available form of governance. But he added an Indian dimension to it by saying, “A democratic government, ‘Jana Rajya’, must also be rooted in Dharma, i.e., a ‘Dharma Rajya’. In the definition of democracy – of the people, by the people and for the people – ‘of’ stands for independence, ‘by’ stands for democracy and ‘for’ indicates Dharma. The true democracy is one where there is freedom as well as Dharma.” “The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways. The point, however, is to change it”. These words were inscribed on Karl Marx’s tombstone. All interpretations of philosophers from the time of Plato were about making a “new man” — a “moral man”. Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly in 1950, United States President Harry Truman had said: “The United Nations represents the idea of a universal morality, superior to the interests of individual nations. Its foundation does not rest upon power or privilege; it rests upon faith. They rest upon the faith of men in human values — upon the belief that men in every land hold the same high ideals and strive toward the same goals for peace and justice”.Those words sound hollow and hubristic today. But Deen Dayal Upadhyay’s integral humanist vision offers some hope.Ram Madhav is a member of the national executive member of RSS and the board of governors of India Foundation.

22-10-2021||Editorials||A harbinger of change||In 2007, the inaugural Twenty20 (T20) World Cup proved to be a game-changer. For world cricket, and, in a deeper and wider sense, for Indian cricket. A young, long-haired captain who engineered the improbable, edgy victory, gave the country a new phenomenon — the rise to the top of cricketers who did not come with big city privileges. Mahendra Singh Dhoni, over the next decade, heralded a new era for Indian cricket, even as the World Cup firmly established the newest version of the game, which had till then stumbled along with a whiff of irrelevance. It led directly to the wild and unprecedented success of the Indian Premier League (IPL) launched the very next year. IPL shifted the financial might of cricket decisively towards India, and set the template for T20 leagues that are now ubiquitous across nations. T20 was here to stay, and over the next decade, would threaten to eclipse all other formats, at least in terms of spectator interest.
