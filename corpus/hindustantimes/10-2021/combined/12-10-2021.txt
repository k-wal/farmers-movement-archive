12-10-2021||Noida||Loni’s air quality monitoring station may be relocated to city forest||Officials of the Ghaziabad municipal corporation are planning to relocate the Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Station (CAAQMS) at Loni to the city forest area in Ghaziabad. They said that the CAAQMS at Loni has been recording very poor/severe air quality index (AQI) readings, which is affecting the overall AQI reading of Ghaziabad and may, in turn, also affect their performance-based grants accorded by the Fifteenth Finance Commission for air quality improvement.Ghaziabad, currently, has four CAAQMS systems at Vasundhara, Loni, Sanjay Nagar, and Indirapuram. According to official records of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the monitoring station at Loni recorded the highest levels of PM2.5 and PM10 among all four stations during the years 2019 and 2020.Official CPCB records indicate that the annual average PM2.5 reading recorded by the monitoring station at Loni was 121.03 micrograms per cubic metre (mpcm) in 2019--the second-highest among all four stations--and 122.07mpcm in 2020--the highest among all four stations.Likewise, the annual average PM10 level recorded by the monitoring station at Loni was 263.22mpcm in 2019--the highest among all four stations-- and 233.98mpcm in 2020--also the highest among all four stations.The standard reading for PM2.5 is 60mpcm, and for PM10 it is 100mpcm.“The Loni station does not portray an accurate picture, as its AQI readings are added to the readings from the three other stations. Loni is anyway out of the jurisdiction of the corporation area. So, we have planned to relocate the monitoring station at Loni to the city forest at Karhera,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner.Once relocated, the monitoring station will be installed about 14km away from Loni in the clean surroundings of the city forest, which is near the Hindon river.The city forest is managed by the Ghaziabad development authority (GDA), while the corporation is the custodian of the 100-acre land on which the forest is located.“For the past several years, the city’s AQI reading has been impacted by the high readings of the Loni monitoring station and it will, in the long term, affect our performance-based grants allotted by the Fifteenth Finance Commission. So, we are taking the necessary steps. We have received approval for relocation from the state officials and now we have sought permission from GDA to install the station,” Tanwar said, adding that the works for relocation are likely to be completed within a month.Another station whose location is leading to high readings is the one at Sanjay Nagar. Corporation officials said that they are also considering relocating it elsewhere.Officials of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) said that once the monitoring station at Loni is relocated, they will start monitoring AQI manually in the area.“The Loni station’s readings remain high because there are bad roads, regular construction activities and even garbage burning and illegal factories in the area. Once we relocate the station, we will start manually monitoring the AQI at Loni. In the next financial year, when more funds are allotted, an online CAAQMS will be installed in Loni and its readings will be recorded separately in the CPCB’s daily AQI bulletin,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer, UPPCB.However, environmentalists said that the relocation of the monitoring station is the administration’s attempt to conceal the true picture of air pollution in the city.“It seems that the measure has been taken only with the aim to get funds. Loni is a part of the Ghaziabad district and its citizens have the right to clean air if the readings are poor. Instead of relocating the station, the administration should make efforts to lower pollution. Further, relocating the monitoring station to a green area will give low readings. This will conceal the true picture of the city as a whole,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist and lawyer.Sushil Raghav, another environmentalist, said that if relocation goes through, he will challenge the decision before a court.“In case they relocate the monitoring station, we will challenge it in a court. Instead, the city should have more monitoring stations, like in Delhi, so that the correct picture can be ascertained. If there is no CAAQMS in Loni, then real-time figures will not be available and Loni residents will continue to suffer due to bad air,” Raghav said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/lonis-air-quality-monitoring-station-may-be-relocated-to-city-forest-101634062759230.html
12-10-2021||Noida||Noida: Gautam Buddha University prepares to resume in-person classes from October 25||The Gautam Buddha University (GBU) in Greater Noida is set to resume in-person classes from October 25. The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by Meerut divisional commissioner Surendra Singh who took additional charge of the university’s vice-chancellor on Tuesday. Around 4,500 students of GBU are presently taking online classes. The offline classes at the university have remained suspended since March 2020 in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The varsity had briefly opened its campus in March this year but it had to shut down again on account of the second wave of the pandemic. “The normalcy is returning to the city since a significant population has been vaccinated. We are of the opinion that the university should also open so that the academic studies are streamlined,” Singh, 42, said. The new vice-chancellor inspected different departments of the varsity and directed the officials to plan for offline studies from October 25. “The university will give additional 15 days for the first-year students to report to the campus. The health department will organise a vaccination camp for the students and the staff from October 23,” he said. Singh has succeeded Prof BP Sharma, who retired on October 9. The new vice-chancellor said that the admission in this academic session is going on.Officials said that the hostels will also open for the students soon. There are nearly 5,000 rooms in 12 boys’ and six girls’ hostels in the university. AK Singh, director (international relations), GBU, said the university also attracts a significant number of international students from countries such as Vietnam, South Korea, Canada, Myanmar, Magnolia, Nepal, Yemen, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh. “There are around 200 foreign students enrolled in different programmes. They are presently in their respective countries. We will inform them to join the offline classes,” he said. The university offers 124 academic programmes in technology, management, engineering, law, humanity, cyber security, business analytics, data science, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-gautam-buddha-university-prepares-to-resume-in-person-classes-from-october-25-101634062699817.html

Of the total cases, 221 have been reported in October so far, the data showed. Till Tuesday evening, Ghaziabad had a total of 533 dengue cases. Officials of the district health department said that they are keeping a close watch on number of cases and taking every possible measure to tackle the dengue outbreak. “We have about 75 rapid response teams working for control of dengue and more can be roped in if cases continue to rise. However, no death due to dengue has been reported as yet,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, district surveillance officer. The last time the district recorded death due to dengue was in 2016 when 621 cases emerged. According to official records, the district recorded 928 cases and two deaths in 2014, and 413 cases with one death in 2015. According to the officials, 22 dengue patients are currently admitted in government facilities while 57 are in private hospitals. “The cases of dengue are coming in at a rapid pace and it is expected to decline after the Deewali festival. This year the count has shot up due to frequent heavy rains which resulted in waterlogging in many areas,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter). This year, the first dengue case was detected in Ghaziabad on September 1. The district recorded the first 100 cases on September 15 in a span of 15 days and the next 100 cases came in another nine days on September 24. The next 100 cases were reported in six days on September 30. On October 6, the district recorded another 100 cases and crossed the figure of 400 in six days while next 100 cases were recorded in five days with tally at 500 on October 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/dengue-cases-cross-500-mark-in-ghaziabad-101634062644816.html
12-10-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Land worth ₹100 crore freed up in Dasna||Nearly three decades after it was encroached upon, officials of the Dasna Nagar Palika, with the help from the local police, on Monday freed up nine acres of land worth about ₹100 crore. The officials said that encroachers who belong to nomadic tribes had illegally occupied the land meant for burial. The officials said they had to face stiff resistance from the encroachers. “They (encroachers) set afire several shanties and then threw some LPG cylinders in the fire. However, our staff pulled out the LPG cylinders from the fire. It has been about five times during the past decade that our teams tried to drive them away but each time they put up stiff resistance,” said Manoj Kumar, executive officer of Dasna Nagar Palika. Kumar said that when the municipality staff were sent to announce the demolition drive on October 7, the encroachers threatened them of dire consequences. He also said that during previous drives, the encroachers untied their monkeys and horses and the municipality teams had to make hasty retreat. “We got two FIRs lodged against them in 2017 and 2018. Due to the encroachment, it was not possible to bury a body on the land. So, we decided to take help from police and got the encroachment removed,” Kumar added. The officials said that they will now level up the land and erect a proper boundary wall. They added that the cost of land, valued at around ₹100 crore, could be much higher as the rates have shot up after the construction of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway. “The land in question was freed up by teams of administrative officials, along with police personnel. We have not received a complaint against the encroachers from the officials as yet,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural).Shahid Ahmad, head of the nomadic group, denied allegations that members of his group attacked the teams which arrived for freeing up the land. “We have been staying on this land for about 40 years now. The team of officials drove us out of the land and pulled down our shanties. We have never been violent with anyone. Our houses have been razed and we have nowhere to go now,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-land-worth-100-crore-freed-up-in-dasna-101634062640893.html
12-10-2021||Lucknow||Cong leader gets show cause for making viral poster welcoming Varun to party||PRAYAGRAJ: A poster bearing photographs of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and BJP MP from Pilibhit Varun Gandhi, welcoming the latter to the Congress, has gone viral on social media here. The poster carrying the message “Suswagatam! Dukh bhare din beete re bhaiya, ab sukh aayo re…” (Most welcome! Sad days have passed brother, happy days are here...) in Hindi also bears photographs of two local Congress leaders, including city Congress committee secretary, Prayagraj Irshad Ullah and former president of city Congress committee Abhay Awasthi. Even as the poster attracted a lot of attention on social media, Irshad Ullah was served a show cause notice on Tuesday and now faces possible action if the party remains dissatisfied with his reply over allegedly making the poster viral on social media platforms. The viral poster comes close on the heels of BJP leaders Varun Gandhi and Maneka Gandhi being dropped from the 80-member National Executive of the BJP within days of Varun Gandhi’s tweets on Lakhimpur Kheri violence. The notice to Irshad Ullah has been served by Pradeep Narayan Dwivedi, vice-president (administration) of the city Congress committee, Prayagraj , seeking a reply within 24 hours. In the notice sent to Irshad, it has been said that on October 12, the poster was released by him on the Internet and social media with the message welcoming BJP leader Varun Gandhi in the Congress along with his picture and the photographs of Congress national president Sonia Gandhi. The notice goes on to claim that his continuous actions were damaging the image of the party while warning that if his reply was not satisfactpory, he could be dismissed from all posts and responsibilities given by the party and also expelled, said city Congress committee, Prayagraj president Nafees Anwar. He said that the act of Irshad Ullah fell under the category of indiscipline and the party would take a decision on it after going through his reply to the notice. Congress leader Abhay Awasthi distanced himself from the poster, maintaining that he neither made the poster nor shared it. He said that it was now the responsibility of the city Congress committee to look into the incident and take a decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/cong-leader-gets-show-cause-for-making-viral-poster-welcoming-varun-to-party-101634062519481.html
12-10-2021||Chandigarh||HP bypolls: Mandi and its tryst with the blue blood||Mandi parliamentary constituency, the second largest in the country in geographical terms, truly has been described as a ‘Battlefield of Royals’. Mandi’s tryst with the blue blood began right from the first election post-Independence when Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, daughter of King Harnam Singh and scion of the princely state of Kapurthala, was elected from Mandi in 1952 general polls. In 1957, it was a high-stake battle when the eighth ruler of Mandi and Congress candidate Joginder Sen Bahadur defeated another royal and Independent candidate Anand Chand, the scion of the erstwhile Bilaspur state.It was represented by Congress leader and erstwhile ruler of Suket princely state Lalit Sen for two consecutive terms in 1962 and 1967.In 1971, Virbhadra Singh, the scion of Bushahr princely state, was elected from Mandi, who later went on to become the chief minister of Himachal and tallest political figure in the state politics. The first commoner to win the election from Mandi was Janata Party’s Ganga Singh, who defeated Virbhadra Singh in 1977 amid anti-Congress sentiments. However, Virbhadra returned in 1980 after the fall of the Janata Party’s government.The first-ever election with no royal in fray from Mandi was held in 1984 when Congress veteran Sukh Ram defeated BJP’s Madhukar. However, in 1989, a royal again stepped into the poll arena, this time from the BJP. Maheshwar Singh, a scion of the Kullu royal family, won the election.In the next election in 1991, Sukh Ram defeated Maheshwar while in 1996 it was again a contest between two non-royals and Sukh Ram retained the seat.Two royals, Maheshwar Singh and Pratibha Singh, wife of former chief minister Virbhadra Singh, locked horns in another high-stake battle in 1998 in which the former emerged victorious. In 1999, Maheshwar Singh defeated Congress’ Kaul Singh.Five years later, Maheshwar was defeated by Pratibha while in 2009, Virbhadra returned to represent the constituency. Pratibha returned as Mandi MP in the 2013 byelection after her husband vacated the seat to become the chief minister of Himachal. Riding on the Narendra Modi wave, Ramswaroop Sharma defeated Pratibha in the 2014 elections. Sharma retained the seat in 2019 defeating Sukh Ram’s grandson Aashray Sharma. War veteran slugs it out against a royalHowever, Mandi’s association with the royals is yet not over as Pratibha is back in the poll fray. BJP candidate and a Kargil war veteran, Khushal Singh Thakur, would slug it out against her in an election wherein emotions are likely to eclipse the political issue. The Congress is seeking votes in the name of Virbhadra, who passed away in July, and hopes to cash in on the sympathy wave.All odds are stacked against the BJP. The election would be a litmus test for chief minister Jai Ram Thakur for Mandi being his home turf. It would also be a reality check of his popularity.Farmers of Balh, the most fertile valley in Himachal, are already angry with the state government over the issue of a proposed international airport. There also prevail anti-BJP sentiments among the people affected by the Chandigarh-Manali four-lane project. Interestingly, BJP nominee Khushal led their movement for compensation, but he abandoned the cause once the BJP came to power and chose to become chairperson of ex-servicemen corporation.Lack of development is one issues where both the parties have failed. Mandi comprises remote and tribal areas of Kinnaur, Lahaul-Spiti, Bharmour and Pangi which are still underdeveloped with poor connectivity. The villages along the China border, particularly in tribal Lahaul and Spiti and Kinnaur districts, still lack proper roads, water supply and schools. The majority of the population in the border villages have migrated to the semi-urban and urban areas for better future prospects. Himachal shares a 260km porous border with China. Of the total border length, 140km lies along tribal Kinnaur district, while 80km of the border is along Lahaul and Spiti district. Though the state’s border with China remains peaceful, the fast pace of development in neighbouring country has been a matter of concern for the government. China is continuously strengthening its infrastructure and constructing new roads along the border, particularly in the sensitive Kaurik sector in the Kinnaur district.Himachal will strengthen its basic infrastructure in different phases under the border area development programme. The government would spend more funds on the development in 76 villages that lie within a close range from the international border. Tattered health and educational services compound the problems for the people. While the electors in the last election voted in favour of the BJP, which had promised to eliminate all their troubles, that promise has not been fulfilled. Anti-incumbency against the state government may also hurt the saffron party dearly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hp-bypolls-mandi-and-its-tryst-with-the-blue-blood-101634062279324.html
12-10-2021||Bhopal||Row over meeting to ‘increase’ liquor consumption in Madhya Pradesh||The commercial tax department of Madhya Pradesh had to cancel a proposed meeting on “increasing the consumption of liquor” in the state after a controversy erupted, with the Congress pointing out that the state government had promised to make the state “liquor free.” In February, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced that he wants to make Madhya Pradesh a liquor-free state which will be done by running a campaign to stop people from consuming alcohol. A circular was issued on Monday in which the deputy secretary of the commercial tax department called a meeting of commissioners and deputy commissioners of the excise department through video conference on Tuesday. The circular read “madira khapat mein vriddhi hetu baithak (meeting on increasing the consumption of liquor)”. However, the department cancelled the meeting after the controversy erupted. Excise department commissioner Rajeev Dubey called it a normal meeting to discuss the status of revenue through liquor and said that it couldn’t take place because of other scheduled meetings. An officer of the excise department, requesting anonymity, said, “The meeting was called as the tax collection from liquor sale has been decreased by 10% after the MP Excise (Amendment) Act came into force. Now, a shopkeeper has to give a bill on the purchase of any liquor but they are selling liquor without a bill. Black marketing is rampant and the meeting was called to discuss how to crack down on this black marketing.” Dubey also accepted that there was a dip in the sale of liquor in MP. He said, “Like slow-down in the sale of many other products, the sale of liquor has also dipped due to Covid-19 but it doesn’t mean that we were going to make a policy decision to increase the consumption. It was a routine meeting which happened every week to discuss income and consumption rate.” However, the opposition launched an attack on the BJP-led state government for fooling people. Congress senior leader and MLA Govind Singh said, “The state government and BJP leaders are staging the drama of putting a ban on liquor in MP but in reality they want more people to start consuming alcohol. The government has nothing to do with people and their health, they are focussing on minting money only.” BJP spokesperson Hitesh Vajpayee said the circular had a typo. “The meeting was called to discuss the consumption rate of liquor in MP not to increase the consumption but opposition leaders, who don’t have any issue to raise, are taking advantage of a typing error.” After Gujarat and Bihar, the MP government was also planning to prohibit the sale of liquor in a phased manner. In 2017, the MP government shut 58 liquor shops located within 5 kilometres of the Narmada river. However, the state government changed its stand in 2018 and the then finance minister Jayant Malaiya said the ban of liquor would decrease the revenue and it will affect many people-centric schemes. But the matter again came to light in February this year when the former chief minister and BJP senior leader Uma Bharti announced to hold a campaign against the consumption of alcohol and CM Chouhan also announced in Katni that a campaign will be run to stop people from consuming alcohol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/row-over-meeting-to-increase-liquor-consumption-in-madhya-pradesh-101634062040961.html

Multiple localities in urban and rural areas have emerged as dengue hotspots. On Tuesday, 33 new cases of dengue fever were identified in the district, which led to a total of 254 cases in rural and urban areas. Out of these, 142 patients are undergoing treatment in hospitals. As many as 502 patients out of the total 750 have recovered. The first dengue patient was detected in the district on August 18 and the number soon swelled to 750 by October 11. Localities like Maliyana, Kankerkhera, Jai Bheem nagar, Sabungodam and Rajban has emerged as hotspots of dengue in city area, while in rural area majority of the cases were detected in Rohta , Mawana , Jani , Daurala and Saroorpur . Divisional surveillance officer Dr Ashok Taliyan claimed that anti-larva spray and fogging were being done. Teams were also conducting home surveys to ensure there was no stagnant water in containers, flower pots and other vessels, because dengue mosquitoes breed in stagnant water. He said that notices had also been issued to people in houses where larvae of dengue mosquitoes were found. Dr. Taliyan shared that the best possible way to ward off dengue was that people should not allow stagnation of water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/dengue-fever-raging-in-meerut-750-afflicted-in-past-55-days-101634061860835.html

The takeover of the three colonies has been pending since February 2016.“A review meeting was held with DLF regarding DLF Phases 1, 2 and 3. DLF had decided to fix all deficiencies instead of paying the MCG for doing so and handing over the colonies with immediate effect. DLF is yet to fix the existing civic deficiencies and they were directed in Tuesday’s meeting to complete them at the earliest,” Vivek Gill, superintending engineer (SE), MCG, said.Gill said that DLF had sought time till March 31, 2022, to fix the civic deficiencies in the three colonies. “We did not approve DLF’s March deadline and instead have given them a stern direction to complete the task by December 31. DLF officials also agreed to this,” Gill said.Representative of DLF did not respond to requests for comment.Gill said that Rama Rathee and Kusum Yadav, respective councillors of wards 34 and 35, in the meeting requested the MCG to start taking up civic amenities in the three colonies other than those that are yet to be fixed.Before taking over privately developed colonies, MCG carries out a deficiency assessment survey to check if the civic amenities, as listed by the developer at the time of procuring building plans, have been completed and if the condition of the existing amenities is optimum.Each DPR contains details of the amenities found to be missing or in poor condition during an MCG survey.According to MCG’s 2017 deficiency assessment report, ₹14.12 crore was required to fix civic deficiencies in DLF Phase-1, ₹9.43 crore for DLF Phase-2 and ₹11.89 crore for DLF Phase-3.“The two councillors requested us to take up civic work besides those mentioned in the DPR. We will be taking up this matter with MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar this week. If the MCG commissioner gives approval, we will immediately start offering civic services in the three colonies,” Gill said.MCG chief engineer, TL Sharma, said, “Civic services that are not under the purview of DLF will be started by the MCG in the three colonies.”During a House meeting on Monday, MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja had directed Sharma to start the formalities of the takeover process from Tuesday. Sharma said that providing additional services in the three colonies was also a part of this direction.According to a senior MCG official who attended the meeting, the repair and upgrade of most civic deficiencies in the three colonies have been completed by the developer. “DLF officials disclosed during the meeting that work on most deficiencies has been completed; only around 30% of all road projects are left, along with few minor works in horticulture, sewerage, and water supply,” the official said, requesting not to be named.According to Rathee, work on renovating roads of G Block in DLF Phase-1, J and L blocks in DLF Phase-2 are among the pending works.Both Sharma and Gill said that another review meeting will be held within the next 15 days with DLF, under the chairmanship of the MCG commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/colony-transfer-mcg-sets-developer-dec-31-deadline-for-fixing-infra-in-dlf-1-2-and-3-101634061802832.html

The victim, Vineet Kumar, was a 24-year-old student pursuing a BAMS (bachelor of ayurvedic medicine and surgery) degree and was allegedly shot dead by Lucky, a law student of the university, on October 8 over a personal rivalry. A case of murder was registered against the main accused and his three accomplices at the Rajendra Park police station, but no arrests have been made in the case so far.According to SGT University officials, the students on Tuesday demanded answers from the police on the latest developments in the matter. Subsequently, they called the Gurugram police to the campus.“A group of students held a condolence meeting inside the campus. The students wanted to know more about the police investigation. A team of Gurugram police came to the campus and assured students that they were investigating the matter,” Rajneesh Yadav, public relations officer (PRO), SGT University, said.Yadav said that the university has beefed up security since the incident, allowing only people with identification cards on the campus, setting up barricades at various entry and exit points and installing CCTV cameras across.

The road is currently under construction and once completed, will provide better connectivity to residents.In the drive, which started around 1pm, a car service station, car painting station, building material store, three vegetable vends, a flower shop, three welding shops and two furniture shops were demolished with the help of an earthmoving machine.Sandeep Lot, junior engineer, estate office 1, said, “The demolition drive was carried out in heavy police presence and the violators were warned not to indulge in encroachment again or the department will get FIR registered against them. We had already issued notices to the shop owners and 15 days earlier, they were asked to remove the goods and items from these shops, but they did not do so voluntarily. So, action was taken.”According to HSVP officials, a sizeable area still needs to be cleared as many owners had obtained stay orders from courts against demolition. The team had also planned to carry out a drive on Sector 89/90 Road, but it had to be postponed as some owners had obtained stay orders from courts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/hsvp-clears-encroachments-from-road-connecting-rampura-chowk-pataudi-road-on-nh48-101634061800288.html
12-10-2021||Gurugram||Winter pollution: Grap implementation for air quality to start from Friday||Officials said that a Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) to prevent deterioration of air quality during winter will be implemented from October 15, following directions from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Tuesday.The CPCB, in its first meeting on Grap, said that some of the actions under the ‘very poor’ category should commence from October 15 in the National Capital Region (NCR).States and cities in the NCR were suggested to implement 10 measures — stopping coal/firewood use by hotels and open eateries, augmenting bus and Metro services, including frequency of operation, stringent checks on garbage burning in landfills and other places, including the imposition of heavy fines, closing all brick kilns, periodic mechanised sweeping and water sprinkling on roads with heavy traffic and dust generation potential, enforcing PUC [pollution under control] norms and rules for dust control in construction activities, by penalising motorists or impounding vehicles causing pollution and closing non-compliant construction sites, respectively, and deploying traffic police for smooth traffic flow at points vulnerable to jams.According to the minutes of the meeting, the member secretary of CPCB, who chaired the meeting said that “with onset of winters, implementing agencies must intensify efforts to control air polluting activities.”“Sub-committee deliberated on the meteorological conditions and actions under Grap. It was agreed that in addition to actions under ‘poor’ to ‘moderate’ category, some of the actions under ‘very poor’ category should commence from 15th October, 2021, though the AQI is expected to remain in ‘satisfactory’ to ‘moderate’ category,” states the minutes of the meeting.Very poor air quality is recorded when the level of particulate matter having a diameter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) is between 121-250 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) or when PM10 level is between 351-430 µg/m3. Under Grap, the use of diesel generator sets is stopped when air quality dips to the very poor category.S Narayanan, the member secretary of Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), said, “From October 15, Grap is being implemented in NCR districts of the state and the Grap subcommittee on Tuesday decided that measures to tackle deteriorating air quality should be implemented, before it dips to very poor category due to onset of winter and other local sources. Review meetings will keep happening on a regular basis and more directions will be issued in the coming weeks.”In Gurugram, 18 areas have been identified by the state pollution control board as hotspots for vehicular emissions and traffic congestion. These areas include Iffco Chowk, Rajiv Chowk, Subhash Chowk, Vatika Chowk, Delhi-Gurugram border at Sirhaul, among other places.Officials said that action regarding the operation of diesel generator sets will be taken up in the next meeting, given the satisfactory to moderate AQI in NCR cities at present. The date for the next meeting is yet to be decided.A total of 40 departments, including the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority, Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran and transport department, among others, will be responsible for the implementation of measures under Grap, under the supervision of the HSPCB.Apart from stopping the use of diesel generator sets, measures like surge in parking fee by three to four times, stopping use of coal or firewood in eateries and urging people with respiratory or cardiac problems to stay inside; are measures implemented when the AQI dips to the very poor category.On Tuesday, Gurugram recorded an AQI of 184 (in moderate category), according to the CPCB’s air quality bulletin, and the primary pollutants were PM 2.5 and PM 10.Meanwhile, light rain is expected on October 17 and 18, due to which the AQI is likely to remain in the moderate or satisfactory category for the next four to five days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/winter-pollution-grap-implementation-for-air-quality-to-start-from-friday-101634061799209.html
12-10-2021||Lucknow||Oppn demo in Kheri a “super flop show”: Minister||Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Sidharth Nath Singh termed the much-publicised demonstration by the opposition in Lakhimpur Kheri on Tuesday a “super flop show”.“People are well aware that the opposition is just engaged in spreading fear and lies for their petty political gains. The opposition could gather a handful in the name of “opposition unity”. Their ‘super flop show’ at Lakhimpur today (Tuesday) was another example of the failed conspiracy to put the entire state into a turmoil,” Singh, who is also the state government’s spokesman, said.He alleged that the opposition leaders, desperate to regain their lost political ground, were solely engaged in political stunts instead of helping the people.“None of the locals came out to support the movement. The reason is that every person has witnessed the series of measures taken by the Yogi government in ensuring a fair investigation and justice in the Lakhimpur case,” he said.Targeting Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, he said, “The Congress is using the Lakhimpur Kheri issue to revive itself in the state ahead of polls.”“It is ironic that Priyanka Gandhi, who had been too vocal on the issue lately, was not even allowed to speak. Probably, she also would have been shocked to realise that people in Uttar Pradesh will no longer fall prey to the opposition’s foul play,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/oppn-demo-in-kheri-a-super-flop-show-minister-101634061559539.html

12-10-2021||Delhi||Manish Sisodia urges Centre to allow Chhath celebrations, says Covid-19 situation in Delhi is ‘under control’||Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday wrote a letter to the Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya, urging the Centre to issue guidelines for the Chhath festival as soon as possible following consultation with health experts. This came after protests were staged by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers outside Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supremo Arvind Kejriwal’s house earlier in the day, which even led to party MP Manoj Tiwari sustaining injuries.In the letter, Sisodia wrote that Chhath is celebrated especially by “people from Purvanchal” with “deep faith and sacrifice.” “In is also celebrated very dedicatedly in Delhi every year. This year too Purvanchali people are eagerly awaiting celebrations of Chhath with their families and dear ones,” he added.A statement issued by Sisodia’s office further quoted him as saying that the Covid-19 situation is “under control in Delhi and the central government should allow the celebration of Chhath at public places.”The Delhi deputy CM further mentioned that last year too, Chhath celebrations were done as per “directions of the government of India.” “As you are aware, the whole country, including Delhi, has faced the situation caused by Covid-19 in an unprecedented manner in the past 18 months,” Sisodia wrote in the letter.Notably, Chhath celebrations at public places such as on riverbanks, water bodies and other areas were banned last year and have been prohibited this year as well. On this matter, Kejriwal had earlier said that the decision was made in view of the health and safety of people due to Covid-19.However, BJP has criticised the move by saying that Kejriwal is “insulting” the sentiments of the Purvanchal community. The party’s chief in the national capital Adesh Gupta said on Monday that they will celebrate Chhath while adhering to Covid-19 protocols in all the three municipal corporations.Northeast Delhi MP Tiwari has also been critical of the Kejriwal-led government’s decision to prohibit Chhath celebrations, while permitting Dusshera, Ramleela and other public gatherings during the ongoing festive season.Notably, Tiwari was rushed to the emergency wing of Safdarjung Hospital after he sustained injuries while protesting outside the Kejriwal’s house against the ban on Chhath celebrations at public places. He was reported to be stable after being taken to the hospital.Delhi police used water cannons to disperse protesters, and an officer told Hindustan Times that Tiwari got injured after toppling down from a barricade he had climbed onto.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/manish-sisodia-writes-to-mandaviya-urges-to-issue-chhath-puja-guidelines-101634060244233.html

Check details||To make the transport-related transaction hassle free, the Delhi transport department will soon issue QR code-based smart cards for driving licenses and registration certificates, reported news agency PTI. A statement from the Delhi government read that the move was aimed at making Delhi a "hub of innovation in governance".While the new driving licence will have an advanced microchip with features like Quick Response (QR) code and Near Field Communication (NFC), the new registration certificates will have the owner's name printed on the front while the microchip and the QR code would be embedded at the back of the card, according to the statement by the Delhi government."The cards earlier had embedded chips, but there have been issues with reading the information coded into the chip, chip reader machine was not available in required quantity with both the Delhi traffic police and the enforcement wing of the transport department."Moreover, chips were designed and implemented by the states concerned, which resulted in difficulties in reading the chip and retrieving information, especially in case of defaulters," the statement said, explaining the need for the upgrade.The QR-based smart card will enable unification in linking and validating one's information to smart cards with Sarathi and Vahan, the two web-based databases of all driving licenses and vehicle registrations, it added.The QR code is also expected to have an added advantage of acting as a "safety feature" on the smart card."The department will be able to retain records and penalties of the holders of driving licenses for up to 10 years on the VAHAN database as soon as a driver or owner's smart card is confiscated."The new DLs will also help the government in maintaining records of differently-abled drivers, any modifications made to the vehicles, emission standards and the person’s declaration to donate organs," the statement said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-to-issue-qr-code-based-smart-cards-for-driving-licenses-registration-certificates-soon-check-details-101634060003235.html

The email, which allegedly contained malware, was reportedly sent from an email account similar to that of a senior inspector of a cyber police station under Mumbai Police.Another police source said that the email was sent with the subject ‘Terrorists behind JK attacks gunned down in Mumbai’. The email had an attached PDF document named ‘Report Intelligence’. On clicking the document user’s computer system got compromised.The email was sent from the email ID: ps.eastcyber.mum@mahapolice.gov.in . This id belongs to the east region cyber police station, and it is in the name of the in-charge of the police station- senior inspector Rajesh Shivajirao Nagawade.Following the incident, the Maharashtra cyber police on Tuesday wrote to all the police commissioners and district police superintendents in the state alerting them.The deputy commissioner of police (DCP), cyber wing, on Tuesday, visited the police station to make further inquiries in the matter.Officials said that the attackers may have done this by hacking the email account or by simply spoofing the email account of the cyber police officer.“Preliminary enquiry has revealed that the email was sent from the Punjab province of Pakistan. But we are not sure if the email in reality was sent from Pakistan, or the cybercriminals used other methods to show it that it is sent from the servers in Pakistan. The investigation is on,” an officer said requesting anonymity.A senior IPS officer said that the cybercrime police station system has nothing to do with it as of now. Experts are still checking if it was malware or something else.

12-10-2021||Delhi||‘No power outage in Delhi, AAP ensuring supply via gas-based electricity’: Jain||Delhi's power minister Satyendar Jain on Tuesday said there have been no power cuts in the national capital despite a crisis as the Arvind Kejriwal government is ensuring round-the-clock supply through electricity generation from gas at much higher rates.Speaking to news agency PTI, Jain said the city buys electricity from coal-based power plants in neighbouring states, but these states are unable to generate electricity due to coal crunch.The power minister further claimed that the National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC) has to provide 3,500MW power to Delhi under the purchase agreement, but it is giving only 1,750MW which is half of the agreement.ALSO READ | Central govt orders power firms to boost supply to DelhiThe NTPC, however, clarified that it was providing required power to Delhi although city discoms have been scheduling only 70% of the electricity."NTPC has been making available required #power for Delhi. As the data shows (1st October to 11th October), Delhi DISCOMs have been scheduling only 70% of power that has been made available by NTPC," the thermal power producer said in a tweet.Jain said all coal-based power plants in Delhi are non-functional and that the BJP was spreading "rumours" about the same.He said the national capital has gas-powered electric power plants, but the Centre has stopped giving gas to the city at a controlled rate. Thus, the Delhi government has to buy gas at market rates to generate electricity, he added."This has increased the cost of power generation to the Delhi government. Despite this, there has been no power cut in the city and the AAP government is ensuring 24×7 electricity to the people,” the minister asserted.ALSO READ | ‘No shortage of coal? But power plants are shutting’: Baghel counters CentreHe also asked the Centre whether there is really a coal shortage in the country or is it "deliberately" cutting power.Last week, Jain had warned residents of an acute coal shortage in thermal power plants across the country and cautioned that the national capital had enough coal stocks to last one more day.He said chief ministers of around six states have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the issue.“Be it Punjab, Andhra Pradesh or Uttar Pradesh, power cuts are being imposed everywhere in the country except Delhi,” Jain added.However, Union minister RK Singh refuted these claims insisting that the demand for coal is actually a sign of the economy recovering after the brutal second wave brought things to a standstill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-power-outage-in-delhi-aap-ensuring-supply-via-gas-based-electricity-jain-101634058903982.html

Four others, including journalist Raman Kashyap, Mishra’s driver Hari Om Mishra and two BJP workers Shyam Sunder and Shubham Mishra, were later killed during the violence.So far, the police have arrested four accused, including the Union MoS’s son, his two accomplices Luv Kush and Ashish Pandey besides Ankit Das’s driver Shekhar Bharati, in connection with FIR lodged for mowing down the farmers. The police claimed that three other accused, including Mishra’s driver and two BJP workers, were killed during the violence.Earlier in the day, the police took Ashish Mishra to the crime branch office at reserve police lines in Lakhimpur Kheri for interrogation. Senior prosecution officer SP Yadav on Monday told reporters that a local court in Kheri had allowed his three-day police custody starting on Tuesday morning. The court has put the condition that Ashish Mishra would not be harassed and his lawyer would remain present at a certain distance during interrogation.Ashish Mishra was earlier questioned for 12 hours by the investigation team headed by deputy inspector general Upendra Agarwal before his arrest on Saturday. Elaborate security arrangements had been made in and around the police lines, Yadav added.Ashish Mishra was named in an FIR following allegations that he was in one of the vehicles that mowed down four farmers protesting over UP deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya’s visit to Kheri on October 3. Ashish Mishra, 35, looks after the political activities of his father in his Kheri parliamentary constituency and was also vying for party ticket from Kheri’s Nighasan assembly seat to contest polls.

12-10-2021||Noida||Emerald Court: CBRI team visits twin towers facing demolition||A team from the Central Building Research Institute (CBRI), along with a group of experts and Noida authority’s senior officials, on Tuesday visited the Supertech’s Emerald Court project in Noida’s Sector 93A. The three-member team from the Roorkee-based institute inspected the 40-storey twin towers in the project, whose demolition was ordered by the Supreme Court on August 31.The CBRI team that spent more than an hour at the site was also accompanied by a group of residents living in the towers adjacent to the twin towers. Later, the team discussed the demolition-related issues at length with the Noida authority’s top officials, including town planners from the planning department.According to authority officials, the CBRI team discussed impact of demolition on nearby towers and methodology related with the demolition work. The Emerald Court project has 15 11-storey towers which were built in the first phase of the project. About 650 families are living in these 15 towers, the officials said. The second phase of the project consists of two under-construction towers which have to be demolished. The officials said that of the 633 people who booked flats in the second phase, 133 have shifted to other projects and 248 have already taken refunds, while 252 homebuyers still have bookings with the company in the project. The apex court has directed to refund money of all remaining buyers with 12% interest. “The CBRI team visited the site and then discussed the issues related with demolition with us. We have also discussed the matter with the Supertech Limited that has to hire an agency for the demolition of twin towers. According to the court’s order, we have to provide the technical support in the task,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer of the Noida authority.In its order, the apex court had said that the CBRI and the Noida authority will supervise the demolition of the twin towers built in violation of the building bylaws.The CBRI has also suggested that a committee should be formed consisting of experts having experience in construction and demolition. The experts from state-owned National Building Construction Corporation and other agencies will be roped in for the job, the officials said.“We have formed an internal committee that will supervise the demolition work. We hope that Supertech will hire an agency for the purpose in the next 10 days,” said Maheshwari.The developer also carried out a survey at the site on Tuesday and it will do the same again on Wednesday to understand how the job can be done in a manner so that it does not affect the adjoining towers, the officials said.“We will discuss this issue again on Thursday and then decide the future course of action on the matter,” said Maheshwari. Supertech officials were not available for comment on the issue.The Supreme Court on August 31 said that the violation was a result of “nefarious complicity” between the Noida authority and the real estate developer”.The issue was first taken to the Allahabad high court in 2012 by the Emerald Court residents’ welfare association claiming that several rules were violated in constructing the two 40-storey towers -- Apex and Ceyane. On April 11, 2014, the high court ordered the demolition of the two towers, observing that they stood too close to each other. The Noida authority had appealed against the verdict claiming that no norm was violated. On September 2, the Supreme Court directed Supertech to demolish the twin towers in three months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/emerald-court-cbri-team-visits-twin-towers-facing-demolition-101634059943775.html

The party in its meeting decided to push for the same by making a formal request with the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.Nawab Malik, chief spokesperson, NCP, said that the decision would be beneficial for the shopkeepers and restaurant owners in the backdrop of the financial losses they had faced owing to the one-day shutdown. The party has also decided they will fight against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the central investigation agencies allegedly being misused against them with full strength.The decision was taken in a meeting chaired by the party supremo Sharad Pawar at YB Chavan Centre on Tuesday. It was attended by NCP Members of Parliament, ministers and senior leaders. Pawar is expected to hold an interaction with media persons on Wednesday.In Mumbai, shops and restaurants are allowed to open till 10pm. The timings will be different in other cities and districts as the state government has empowered the local bodies to decide the timings of the establishments based on the respective Covid-19 situation.The bandh was observed in Mumbai and in the state to condemn the Lakhimpur Kheri incident in which four cultivators were mowed down by an SUV during a protest that triggered the violence. The farmers have claimed Ashish Mishra, son of Ajay Mishra, Union minister of state for home, was driving the vehicle that killed the farmers.“The party has decided the timings of shops and restaurants will be increased and more time be given to them as they have faced economic losses during the bandh. We want the timings to be extended more than the regular time considering the upcoming festivals such as Dussehra and Diwali. It will be proposed to the chief minister (Uddhav Thackeray) so that a final decision can be taken,” Malik told reporters.“It will be beneficial and also provide relief to shopkeepers and restaurant owners,” he added.The ruling party in the state also decided not to bow down against the BJP led central government and the action by the central investigation purportedly to harass the MVA leaders and their families.“The BJP is misusing the central agencies such as the income tax (I-T) department and Enforcement Directorate (ED) to create trouble for our political leaders. In today’s meeting, it was decided to firmly face their action and stand with the affected leaders and their families. We have decided to fight it with full strength,” Malik said.Last week, the I-T department carried out searches at premises of multiple sugar mills and real estate groups, including those linked to the deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and his three sisters. Pawar himself told journalists that the I-T department was raiding places linked to him and his three sisters. He also said he doesn’t know the purpose of these raids as he was tax compliant. I-T sources said the premises of a company linked to Pawar’s son Parth was also searched during the operation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncp-pushes-for-extending-timings-of-shops-restaurants-in-maharashtra-101634059279036.html
12-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Police to open 5 counselling centres for survivors of sexual crimes, violence||Mumbai Mumbai Police are all set to open five counselling centres – one each policing regions of the city – for psychological counselling of survivors of sexual offences, acid attacks and assault in order to help them get out of the post-incident trauma. Expert psychiatrists would be roped in for this initiative, the police said. The move has comes in the backdrop of the Sakinaka rape and murder case. The initiative, ‘Saksham’ is being implemented by the city police in collaboration with a non-profit organisation (NGO). Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale is likely to inaugurate the first counselling centre at Vikhroli police station in a few days, sources said. “During this counselling, the cops and NGO members will also try to help the survivors get jobs in order to ensure that if survivors restart their life their financial problems don’t become a hurdle on their way,” said a senior police officer. As per National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) reports, Mumbai ranks number two among metro cities across the country with regards to crimes against women. In 2020, the city had reported 4,583 crimes against women, only second to Delhi city, which had recorded 9,782 crimes. In 2018, Mumbai had recorded 6,058 crime cases against women, while in 2019, the number was 6,519. Besides giving psychological support to women, experts at these centres will also help children who have been survivors of sexual and domestic violence. “Children were included in this initiative as serious crimes leave long-term, adverse impacts on their minds making them prone to choose wrong paths ahead in their life” said another police officer. The accused arrested in crimes against women would also be profiled and subsequently counselled by cops and psychiatrists after they are released on bail. This is to deviate them from the path of crime and prevent further crimes. The counselling centres would see to it that if there is a scope of rehabilitation in any offender’s case, then they would try to help them in all possible ways, the officer said. Another cop said that there has been already a counselling centre at place in Mumbai Police, but it generally deals with very few cases, probably due to lack of awareness among citizens. Officers there counsel mostly women filing complaints of dowry or domestic violence or divorce-related issues. Now with the new initiative, the police will cater to a broader need of psychiatric counselling to survivors of serious crimes. Last year, Mumbai reported 332 rape cases (sexual assault on women above the age of 18 years), as compared to 967 in the country’s capital Delhi. However in cases of cybercrimes related to women (posting objectionable literature, defaming women, morphing, blackmailing, publishing or transmitting sexually explicit material), Mumbai ranked third with 58 cases, after Bengaluru (144) and Chennai (80 cases).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-to-open-5-counselling-centres-for-survivors-of-sexual-crimes-violence-101634058438980.html

Since the trap was laid in the evening, and norms forbid women from being arrested post sunset, Patil was arrested the next day, ACB officials had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-woman-police-officer-gets-bail-after-held-by-acb-in-bribery-case-101634056819429.html
12-10-2021||Lucknow||Lakhimpur in focus, BJP mulls damage control measures||LUCKNOW Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker and the country’s junior home minister Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’ and his son Ashish are in the news ever since the Lakhimpur violence left four farmers among eight dead on October 3. The minister’s son has been arrested, but the opposition is now pressing for the removal of the union minister. Battling the latest crisis, and one which provided fresh ammunition to the opposition months ahead of the 2022 UP polls, this is not the first time when the ruling party has been embarrassed by its own leaders. The elections are due in a few months and the buzz is that the BJP could replace many sitting lawmakers in a bid to beat incumbency. It’s in this backdrop that party leaders admit that ahead of the ticket distribution the party needs to send out a strong signal that indiscipline won’t be tolerated. “Being in the ruling party has its own responsibilities. Acts of some of our people are tarnishing the party’s image. Ahead of UP polls, we do need to send out a message and that’s what the party would be mulling too. One bad statement or deed causes immense damage,” said a senior BJP leader. Since June, the BJP in UP has consistently run into problems caused by its own leaders. During his recent meetings with party lawmakers and functionaries, chief minister Yogi Adityanath has been talking of the need to project a good image of the party, admitted leaders. The RSS too is reportedly unhappy at the manner in which some leaders have been bringing the party to disrepute. “If I start counting the number of initiatives taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi or chief minister Yogi Adityanath for the people, it will possibly consume all of newspaper space. Yet, despite doing such good work, it is opposition build-up over Lakhimpur that is dominating media space and that is what is frustrating. Moreover, this isn’t the first time we have faced flak due to our own people,” a party leader admitted. In June, even as the party was recovering from the barrage of complaints of lack of medical treatment and inadequate health infrastructure during the second Covid surge in April-May, not just from masses but from party’s lawmakers too, a viral video of a local leader Narayan Singh Bhadauria allegedly helping a wanted criminal escape after his arrest in Kanpur made the party leadership squirm. Bhadauria was subsequently stripped of his post and arrested. But by then, the opposition had rammed the ruling party over the manner in which its leaders were undermining law in the state. The BJP had come to power in 2017 promising an end to what it termed ‘goondaraj’ (lawlessness) during the Samajwadi Party rule. BJP’s Unnao MP Sakshi Maharaj also didn’t help matters when he publicly blessed a candidate for district panchayat chief’s post, who contested as an independent despite being replaced by the BJP leadership. The BJP was forced to change the ticket of Arun Singh after the Unnao rape victim objected to the party’s choice, alleging that he was “very close” to former BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, who was convicted for the crime. Sengar, a former lawmaker from Unnao’s Bangarmau seat, was accused of rape by the victim in 2017. A Delhi court had sentenced Sengar to life imprisonment in the case in December 2019. “Such actions by a section of party people lead to unnecessary controversy and a lot of precious time is wasted in damage control. The BJP governments at the centre and in UP have done great development, but such things divert focus and give an opportunity to the opposition to get at us,” said a party leader. This party leader too spoke of the need to rein in such leaders. “Under the BJP government, the police have a free hand. As and when cases have come to light, action has been initiated both by the party and the police. The party has stripped such leaders of post and the police have quickly arrested the accused. The latest example is the arrest of the son of the union minister of state for home. Yet, such is perception and political play that despite the party making it clear that police have been given a free hand to unravel the truth behind the Lakhimpur violence, opposition is focused on their demand to dismiss the minister,” said another BJP leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lakhimpur-in-focus-bjp-mulls-damage-control-measures-101634057239013.html

12-10-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra approves 10-year action plan for safety, conservation of wildlife||The Maharashtra government has approved an action plan that suggests comprehensive measures for the safety and conservation of wildlife. The action plan has been prepared for the next 10 years — 2021-2030. Maharashtra has become the first state to have prepared such an action plan. The approval was granted in the 17th meeting of the state wildlife board held on Tuesday.It has also approved an extension of the boundary of Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve by around 79 sq km. Located in Chandrapur district of Vidarbha region, Tadoba sanctuary is a popular tourist destination owing to frequent tiger sightings.In the board meeting, it was decided to include 78.79 sq km in the core area of Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve. The decision was taken owing to the rising number of tigers in the sanctuary, the officials said.The existing area of the sanctuary is 509.27 sq km.“The man-animal conflicts have increased in the area as there is a rise in the number of tigers in the reserve. A tiger requires at least 40 sq km land and due to the total number of tigers the existing area is falling short,” said a senior forest official.Out of 312 tigers in the state, 203 are within Tadoba and its buffer zone. The man-animal conflict in Chandrapur forest, which houses Tadoba, has resulted in the deaths of 33 people in 2020 and 18 so far, this year.The action plan has been divided into 12 chapters which include conservation of rare species, control on poaching and illegal trade of wildlife, measures and rescue work on man-animal conflict, wildlife health management, conservation of regional ecosystem conservation systems, conservation of coastal and marine ecosystems, wildlife tourism management, conservation awareness, public participation, strengthening research and monitoring, ensuring sustainable funding for wildlife, strengthening and expanding the network of protected areas in the state.The plan will be implemented in a timely manner by setting up a committee of concerned government departments, scientific organisations of the concerned field and non-governmental organizations. The state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray has directed the officials to set up a monitoring committee to see if the implementation of this plan is going well or not.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-approves-10-year-action-plan-for-safety-conservation-of-wildlife-101634056820151.html
12-10-2021||Mumbai||Coal shortage costs ₹340 crore for Maharashtra power companies||The shortfall of coal for power generation has resulted in the additional burden of Rs340 crore on the cash-strapped state-run power companies in the past few weeks. The state- run companies have been purchasing power at a high rate to meet the gap of 4,000MW daily. The state has, however, said load shedding would not be initiated in the state. Energy minister Nitin Raut, however, blamed the central government for the current coal supply crisis in the country. The coal shortage in the state resulted in a drop in power generation by more than 3,300MW in the past few days, widening the gap between supply and demand to 4,000MW. This has forced the state government to buy the power from the open market at a high rate which goes up to Rs20 a unit during the peak hours. The state government spent Rs197 crore in September for the purchase, while it has borne the cost of Rs140 crore in 11 days of October after the peak hour rate increased significantly due to shortfall in power across the country.Against the daily requirement of 18,000MW, the production was hit by around 4,000MW as seven units of thermal power at state-run stations (three of them are shut for maintenance) and six units at private stations providing power to Maharashtra. The shortfall has been made up by purchasing power – ranging from 1,200 to 3,600MW daily since September 12 from open market. This has cost dear to the power discomm as the average purchase rate increased to Rs10.70 in October from Rs4.21 a unit in September. The rise in power rate increased tremendously in the past two weeks due to the shortage of coal.“We have coal stock of 217,000MT and we have been getting 70,000MT coal daily against our requirement of 135,000. Besides that, although Mahavitaran has a power purchase agreement with Coastal Gujarat Power Limited and JSW for 760 and 240MW respectively, the two companies have not been providing us power for the past few months. Both the companies have stopped generation because of the spike in the imported coal they use for the generation. Despite this, we have been coping with the shortfall by purchasing the power from open market. There is no load shedding initiated anywhere and no load shedding is our mantra,” said Maharashtra power minister Nitin Raut.Besides the power purchase, the state companies have also increased the hydro power generation to 2,000MW and reduction in the supply by 2 hours to the agricultural pumps.The opposition has, however, attacked the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government for its “inefficient” management of coal stock, lifting of stock. Former energy minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Chandrashekhar Bawankule said that the mismanagement by the state government has thrown the power companies in debt and they do not even have the funds to pay off the bills for coal supply and labour payments. “The outstanding dues towards the payment of coal purchased from the central companies has increased to Rs2,800 crore. The state generation company has not been able to pay the dues. Either the state government should fund these companies or the companies should raise debts from the open market. This has happened because of mismanagement by the state government and lack of coordination between the power companies,” Bawankule said. Responding to it, Raut said, “Bawankule is misguiding by quoting wrong figures. The outstanding is Rs1,500 crore, of which Rs430 crore will be paid in next few days. The amount of dues during BJP-led government had mounted to Rs1,565 crore. The power shortage is because of the short supply of coal by the BJP-led central government. The shortage has arisen because of the mismanagement of Coal India and it has been endorsed by ministry of coal and mining in its letter to the company on September 27,” he said. Raut has slammed coal India for short supply and the sub standard of the coal supplied to the state. “The shortage is the result of the clumsy and unplanned management by Coal India. The company was expected to ensure adequate stock of the coal ahead of monsoon, but the reduction in the mining could not enable it. Besides it, the rise in the rate of the import of the coal from outside the country has affected the power generation by the private companies,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/coal-shortage-costs-340-crore-for-maharashtra-power-companies-101634056818899.html
12-10-2021||Mumbai||New TB drug trial starts in Shatabdi Hospital in Mumbai||A 40-year-old patient is the first to receive pretomanid, new anti-tuberculosis (TB) drug, as a part of a clinical trial commenced at the civic-run Shatabdi Hospital in Govandi, Mumbai, on Tuesday. The hospital is among the nine clinical trial sites across five states in the country that will together recruit 400 patients. Pretomanid is the newest anti-TB drug after bedaquiline and delamanid. The drug will be used as a part of three-drug regimen, which includes bedaquiline and another drug called linezolid. This regimen is known as the BPaL regimen. “A BPaL trial conducted in South Africa has shown promising results, and we believe that this regimen can be a game-changer for a city like Mumbai which has a high burden of drug-resistant cases,” said Dr Vikas Oswal, the principal investigator of the trial at Shatabdi Hospital. “In the current regimen, these patients take anywhere between 13 and 15 pills a day and the treatment course goes on for 18-24 months. In BPaL regimen, the patients effectively take three pills for a period of six months. We will be working with different dosages under the trial,” he said, adding that a patient –a 25-year-old man in the pre-XDR (extensively drug-resistant) phase – has also given consent and is likely to start the regimen in a day or two. Shatabdi Hospital will recruit 75 patients for the trial. These patients will be in the pre- XDR phase or in the multi-drug resistant (MDR) phase with failed drug outcomes. Other trial sites include Savoday Hospital in Ghatkopar, King George’s Medical University in Lucknow, SN Medical College in Agra, BJ Medical College in Ahmedabad, Government Medical College in Surat, National Institute of TB and Respiratory Diseases and Rajan Babu Institute of Pulmonary Medicine and Tuberculosis (RBIPMT), Delhi, and Government Rajaji Hospital, Madurai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/new-tb-drug-trial-starts-in-shatabdi-hospital-in-mumbai-101634056638733.html
12-10-2021||Mumbai||ED resorting to selective disclosure to media to malign me: Anil Deshmukh to Bombay HC||Former home minister Anil Deshmukh informed the Bombay high court (HC) that he wanted to dispel the impression that he was running away and was willing to cooperate with the probe, provided it is undertaken with “fairness and objectivity” which is not the case. Hence, he was seeking protection from coercive action as he apprehended that he would be arrested under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), when he responded in person. Deshmukh was arguing for the quashing of proceedings arising out of the summons issued to him by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). He further submitted that the agency was making “selective disclosure” to the media to portray him in bad light before every court hearing so as to create a wrong public perception. A division bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice Sarang Kotwal, while hearing the petition filed by Deshmukh, was informed by senior advocate Vikram Choudhri that apart from showing haste in issuing summons, despite the Supreme Court granting liberty to exhaust his legal remedies, ED had been resorting to a smear campaign against his client.In the previous hearing on October 7, Choudhri had submitted that while the Apex court on July 30 had said that it would pass orders on Deshmukh’s petition seeking ‘no coercive action’ on August 3, ED had issued him a summons on the same evening and asked him to appear before it on August 2.While making the submissions on Tuesday, Choudhri added that soon after the Apex court said that Deshmukh could approach HC on August 16, ED had again issued him a summons on the same day, without giving him a chance to pursue his legal remedies.Choudhri further stated that ED could have only joined the probe under PMLA in connection with the first information report (FIR) filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on April 21, provided there was some recovery of property. However, though there was no recovery, ED had filed an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) and started summoning him.The bench was then informed that the agency was trying to malign his client by making selective disclosures to the media before every hearing to make it look as if he was running away. Choudhri added that ED was also using its Twitter handle to disclose such information, however, the fact was that he was willing to cooperate, provided there was a fair investigation which is monitored by the court and by persons not connected with the zonal Mumbai office of ED.Choudhri then argued that as ED kept on issuing summons without reciprocating to any of Deshmukh’s responses, which sought list of documents, request for appearing through an authorised representative or through the audio-visual mode, he had a valid ground to be apprehensive of being arrested under the relevant sections of the PMLA if he responded in person to the summons and hence sought protection.Due to paucity of time, Choudhri could not complete his arguments and the court adjourned hearing to Wednesday.Meanwhile, the state filed a petition against the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Tuesday in HC against the summons being issued to Maharashtra chief secretary Sitaram Kunte and director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Pandey asking them to appear before it this week. The petition is expected to be mentioned before the bench of justice Jamdar on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ed-resorting-to-selective-disclosure-to-media-to-malign-me-anil-deshmukh-to-bombay-hc-101634056518648.html
12-10-2021||Mumbai||PIL in Bombay high court seeks removal of term ‘PM’, national flag and emblem from PM CARES fund||A public interest litigation (PIL) has been moved in the Bombay high court (HC), seeking directions for removal of the word ‘Prime Minister’, the national flag and the emblem from the name of the trust PM CARES (PM’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund) as it is a private trust and the amount collected by it does not go to the Consolidated Fund of India. The PIL stated that as the trust is a private entity, the use of the name, flag and emblem violate the laws and rules governing the said symbols and hence sought directions for removal of the same. HC has sought a response and posted the hearing to October 25.The division bench of justice AA Sayed and justice SG Dige, while hearing the PIL filed by Vikrant Chavan, Thane district president of the Congress, through advocate Sagar Joshi, was informed that the trust was formed on March 27, 2020, and though PM and various other ministers are its trustees, it is not a government body. The PIL further stated that as the trust had been soliciting funds and had collected ₹3,076.62 crore for relief work by using the name and photograph of PM as well as the national flag and emblem to solicit funds, there was a violation of provisions of laws and rules governing the symbols. The petition stated that relevant provisions of the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950, The Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Rules, 1982, The State Emblem of India (Prohibition of Improper use) Act, 2005, and The State Emblem of India (Regulation of Use) Rules, 2007, were being violated.“Respondent No 1 (trust) undisputedly does not discharge any regal, governmental or sovereign functions. The trust is not the offspring or the blood and bones or the voice and hands of the government of India. In fact it has been an admitted position that respondent No 1 is not government of India’s fund and the amount collected by it does not go to the Consolidated Fund of India (sic),” the petition stated.The PIL further stated that the conjoint reading of Act of 1950 with Rules of 1982 clearly indicates that use of names and emblems set out in the Schedule of the Act of 1950 is prohibited except in such cases and under such conditions prescribed by the Central government. An embargo has been put on the competent authority itself to register any company, firm or body of persons bearing any name set out in the Schedule of the Act of 1950.In light of the above, the PIL has sought removal of the name PM (pictorial depiction too), national emblem and flag from the site and name of the trust.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh for the Central government sought time to file a reply, after which the court adjourned the hearing of PIL to October 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pil-in-bombay-high-court-seeks-removal-of-term-pm-national-flag-and-emblem-from-pm-cares-fund-101634056460748.html

PSI Shrikant Sawant said, “The accused is a lawyer who cheated Amar Builders and we have lodged a case against the lawyer named Parag Deshpande, and the crime took place on different days since August 2021.” The police have booked him under IPC 417 (cheating), 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will) ,470 (forgery), 471 (fraudulently or dishonestly using as genuine any document or electronic record) and 472 (counterfeiting seal).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/charity-commissioner-files-fir-against-lawyer-for-cheating-builder-in-pune-101634056158659.html
12-10-2021||Chandigarh||Navjot Sidhu to meet Venugopal, Rawat in Delhi tomorrow||Chandigarh Amid continued factional feud in the Punjab Congress, state unit president Navjot Singh Sidhu will meet All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretaries Harish Rawat and KC Venugopal in Delhi on Thursday. Rawat, who is Punjab affairs in-charge, said Sidhu will meet him and AICC general secretary (organisation) Venugopal to discuss organisational matters. “Sh. Navjot Singh Sidhu, President Punjab Congress will be meeting me and Sh. Venugopal ji for discussion on certain organizational matters pertaining to Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee at Venugopal Ji’s office on 14th October at 6pm (sic.),” he tweeted on Tuesday. The two central leaders and Sidhu will meet two days before the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting in which the forthcoming assembly elections in five states, including Punjab, are on the agenda. The Congress has been in turmoil in Punjab for the past several months and the replacement of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, who had faced revolt by Sidhu and several other ministers and MLAs, has failed to put an end to factionalism. The PPCC chief is peeved with new chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi over two senior appointments and allocation of a few key portfolios and had announced his resignation from the state chief’s post on Twitter a fortnight ago with a terse resignation letter addressed to Congress president Sonia Gandhi. Though Sidhu and Channi had a meeting and agreed to a “consultation mechanism” to allow the former to have a say in important decisions, the two leaders are not the same page and their strained relations remain a worry for the party with just three months to go for the state polls. The Congress president has not taken any decision on his resignation. A state unit leader said the appointment of district chiefs and constitution of the state body has been pending for a long time and is likely to be discussed in the meeting. Sidhu had held a series of meetings with party leaders last month to discuss the names for the district chiefs and other posts. “We have done most of the work and the appointments are likely to be finalised in a week or two,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/navjot-sidhu-to-meet-venugopal-rawat-in-delhi-tomorrow-101634055978871.html

When all the other colleges are allowing students to pay fees in instalments, similarly SP College should allow students the same. All students have been told to pay the full fees in one instalment. Also, the sports quota admissions have been stopped due to which students with sports’ backgrounds are unable to get admission. We have repeatedly given letters to the college for our demands, but they didn’t listen and so we protested,” said Shubhankar Bachal, Pune city secretary of ABVP.More than 25 students shouted slogans against the college administration and also gheraoed the vehicle of college principal Savita Datar when she arrived on campus. Talking about the issue, Datar said, “We have got the demand letter from the ABVP students, and we are discussing the issue with our head office. Within two days a decision will be taken.

12-10-2021||Patna||Bihar panchayat polls: Migrants visiting home in festive season set to boost turnout||Bihar’s migrant population returning home during the festive season ahead of Chaath could ensure a higher turnout in rest of the phases of the ongoing panchayat polls than the average 60% recorded in the first three phases, according to officials of the State Election Commission ( SEC). As per data compiled by the SEC, voting percentage has varied from 50 to 55% in the first three phases in districts in Kosi and parts of north Bihar where migrant population from villages go to western states for work. For instance, in second phase, Saran recorded voting percentage of 43.44% while Khagaria recorded 53.24% and Madhepura recorded 47.50%. Other districts from where migrants go to other states for work, like Araria, Darbhanga , Sitamarhi and Madhubani in north Bihar, also recorded a poor turnout (50-52%) in the second phase.Another reason for a lower turnout could be the introduction of biometric system for verifying the identity of voters and to check bogus voting, say poll panel officials. State Election Commissioner Deepak Prasad said use of biometric machines for checking voter identity had led to a check on bogus voting “There were negligible complaints of electoral malpractices in the last three phases,” he said. However, social scientists attribute the low voter turnout to the absence of the large migrant population, especially in Kosi region and in north Bihar. “But I feel the voter turnout will be good in coming rounds in end of October and November as the migrant population would be returning home in the next few weeks,” said D M Diwakar, former director of A N Sinha Institute of Social Sciences, currently in his village in Madhuabni. “We did a study a few years back and found that voter turnout in elections held in October-November goes up by 5-6% because of migrants returning home,” he said.The total electorate in panchayat elections is 6.39 crore while migrant population from Bihar is around 20 lakh, as per official records. SEC secretary Mukesh Kumar Sinha said there could be some impact on the voter turnout as people living outside the state usually return home during the festive season. The 11-phase panchayat polls will conclude on December 12. The fourth to ninth round of polls will be held from October 20 to November 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-panchayat-polls-migrants-visiting-home-in-festive-season-set-to-boost-turnout-101634055332201.html

Hostels within colleges and on the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) campus have not yet opened. Namdev Kharabe, a student from Jalna said, “I came to Pune last week. We are currently staying in a flat with five friends. The flat rent is ₹12,000 and we cannot afford it, so our demand is that university hostels be started immediately.”Another student Krishna Thakur from Nanded said, “We have a fixed monthly budget. Also we cannot work as it is my final year and I need to concentrate on my studies. Our major issue of accomodation needs to be resolved.”Prof N S Umrani, SPPU pro-vice-chancellor said, “The university hostels will certainly open and admissions for the same will happen for this academic year once we receive clear guidelines about opening up of hostels.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/students-demand-hostels-be-allowed-to-reopen-in-pune-101634055139119.html
12-10-2021||Patna||Bihar by-polls: All eyes on Nitish, Lalu, Kanahiya||The bypolls for the two assembly seats in Bihar, though not crucial to the survival of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government in the state, has nevertheless become a battle of prestige for the ruling Janata Dal (United) and the main opposition party, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD).The importance attached to the bypolls for Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan could be gauged from the fact that RJD has decided to field its chief Lalu Prasad for campaigning while the Congress has decided to use the services of newly inducted Kanahiya Kumar after talks with RJD to contest jointly failed.JD (U), which won both the seats in 2020 polls, would be banking heavily on chief minister Nitish Kumar. The party’s star campaigners also include present president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Sing and union minister R C P Singh, besides former union minister Upendra Kushwaha. Top Bihar BJP leaders, including state unit president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal, former deputy CM and Rajya Sabha MP Sushil Kumar Modi and others will also campaign,” said a senior BJP leader. According to JD(U) functionary, CM Kumar would be addressing at least two meetings in each of the two constituencies. “The number of meetings will be increased if required,” he said. However, all eyes would be on RJD chief Lalu Prasad and Congress leader Kanahiya Kumar. “Lalu Prasad, who suffers from various ailments, would be campaigning after a long gap and this would be Kanahiya’s first election campaigning after Lok Sabha polls. Both are crowd pullers and it would be interesting to see how they communicate with the voters and their response,” said Gyanendra Yadav, associate professor of Sociology, College of Commerce, Patna.Nitish Kumar had already started mingling with the voters a month before the elections were announced. “The elections were announced in September last week and CM Kumar had taken a boat ride to Kusheshwar Sthan block in the last week of August,” Yadav said.What the bypolls meanResults wise, even if RJD wins both the seats, it is not going to affect the health of NDA government, which has 126 MLAs — BJP (74), JD-U (43) HAM-S (4), VIP (4), besides support of one independent MLA who is a minister. If JD(U) retains both seats, its tally increase to 45. The party won 43 seats in 2020 polls, after which but two MLAs, one from LJP and one from BSP, joined the JD(U). In the Opposition, the Mahaghathbandhan has 110 MLAs in the 243-member house. RJD has 75 members, Congress 19, CPI-ML 12 and CPI and CPM two each. Asaduddin Owaisi led-AIMIM has five MLAs. “Even if RJD wins both seats in bypolls an Owaisi’s party supports the RJD-led alliance, it would still be five be short of majority mark of 122. “The only gain, either for RJD or JD (U), will be a morale booster,” said Sanjay Sinha, professor of English in Patna University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-by-polls-all-eyes-on-nitish-lalu-kanahiya-101634055018748.html
12-10-2021||Pune||Confusion as few colleges reopen in Pune; many stay shut awaiting state govt guidelines||PUNE Barring some colleges, most in Pune remained closed on Tuesday, October 12, despite an order issued by the civic authorities permitting them to reopen for physical classes.Colleges said they are exercising caution and awaiting clear instructions from the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) and the state government.Following an announcement by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) last week issued an order allowing physical classes in colleges with students and staffers who have been fully vaccinated.For those that opened their gates on Tuesday, it was after a perion of one year that students returned to class. Prominent institutions like Fergusson College and SP College started offline lectures, however, Modern College and all departments of the Savitribai Phule Pune University’s (SPPU) chose to remain shut, pending clear guidelines issued by the state higher education department.At Fergusson, the excitement among students was palpable, with group photos and selfies domiating the early action. Some student organisations also distributed chocolates to students coming in to college. “Coming back to college and studying in an acutal classroom is always better than online. Physically, a class experience is always different and we were eagerly waiting for it. I have not met most of my friends in the last 1.5 year. We were only talking on the phone or chatting, but the feeling of a college campus is always happening,” said Hariom Shinde, a first-year Master of Arts student at Fergusson College.Student Swamini Harshe, from Class 11 said, “When the Covid-19 pandemic began, I was in Class 9 and for the last two years it has been online studying at home. Me and my friends all were bored studying online. Many of us had a migraine problem because of sitting continuously in front of a screen. Now after a gap of two years we have come to the college campus which is most exciting for us.”The main criterion by the state government is that only studens who have taken both vaccination doses are allowed on campuses. “We have started all our undergraduate and postgraduate courses completely in offline mode now. None of the classes will be held online. We are following all the Covid protocols given by the state government. It will take a month for things to be streamline. On the first day, 80 classes, from Class 11 to postgraduate were held physically in classrooms,” said Prof Ravindrasinh Pardeshi, principal, Fergusson College.According to Shamakant Deshmukh, vice-principal of Modern College, “The students will be called in a phase-wise manner, initially for practical classes and later on actual lectures will start. The offline lectures will start after Diwali and not immediately. The first preference will be given to third year students for offline classes.” At SPPU, there were no students on campus on Tuesday.State technical and higher education minister Uday Samant tweeted, “In next two days we will declare a date for college reopening across the state. We have sent the proposal to the relief and rehabilitation ministry and it will be then sent to the chief minister for final approval.”Principals from other colleges said they will reopen campuses once the government issues guidelines.“We are waiting for clear instructions from the state higher education department and Savitribai Phule Pune University, as most colleges are affiliated to it,” said Sudhakar Jadhavar, general secretary, Maharashtra State Principals Federation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/confusion-as-few-colleges-reopen-in-pune-many-stay-shut-awaiting-state-govt-guidelines-101634054658606.html
12-10-2021||Pune||Demand to reopen all gardens, extend timings grows louder in Pune||PUNE: There is growing demand among citizens and people’s representatives that all gardens within the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits should be reopened and their timings extended beyond the current 7pm as most other utilities have resumed with extended timings following relaxations in Covid-19 norms. So far, only 110 out of the 204 gardens in the city have reopened after the civic body began relaxing restrictions. Also, the timings of these gardens are 6am to 10am and 4pm to 7pm which many want extended.Aditya Malave, a corporator from Shivajinagar and member of the tree committee, demanded during the PMC general body meeting on Tuesday that all gardens in the city should be reopened at the earliest as citizens are facing problems due to closure of these gardens. “Only 60% of the gardens have been reopened which makes no sense. Everything else has reopened in the city. There are many groups that indulge in fitness activities in these gardens. They are facing problems. I have submitted a written application to the mayor of Pune and also to the garden department to take action on this and reopen all gardens in the city,” said Malave. Prior to Covid restrictions, some gardens in the city were even open till 8 or 9pm. With gradual relaxation in Covid curbs, citizens have demanded that the operational hours of gardens be extended.PMC authorities said that the decision to reopen all gardens is under consideration and timings will be increased only after the state government issues instructions. “Small gardens where it is difficult to maintain social distancing have been kept closed. If the Covid situation continues to be under control, a decision related to the reopening of all these gardens will be taken. We have allowed children into the parks as schools have reopened. Also, senior citizens are being allowed as most of them are fully vaccinated. The timings are as per the orders issued by the government of Maharashtra,” said Ashok Ghorpade, head of PMC’s garden department.Meanwhile, office goers are finding it difficult to visit gardens due to the 7pm deadline. “I used to go for a walk in the garden near my house from 6.30 pm to 7.30 pm. But now it is closed after 7pm. Those who are attending office find it difficult to follow this deadline. Everything else is reopening in the city, including schools and colleges. The civic body should think of extending this deadline,” said Chitra Ingole, a resident of Karvenagar. With the vaccination having gathered pace and schools too reopening, senior citizens and children are allowed entry into the gardens. “I go to Sutar garden in Kothrud daily but the closing time in the evening is 7 pm which used to be 8 pm earlier. Hopefully, the timing will soon be extended,” said Arun Sahastrabuddhe, a senior citizen from Kothrud. “#Pune Restaurants now open till 11 pm..schools opening up... swimming pools opening up... ALL GOOD! But did someone forget about the public parks and gardens?? They are still closing at 7 pm?! (Normal closing time: 9 pm),” tweeted Amit Paranjape, Chairperson, IT & ITES Committee at MCCIA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/demand-to-reopen-all-gardens-extend-timings-grows-louder-in-pune-101634054238685.html

When the Congress was in opposition, we were assured that the demands will be fulfilled when the party comes to power. The Congress came to power in 2018 but our demands are still unaddressed," he said.Yadav claimed that the strike will affect revenue collection of about ₹4 crore.The strike has been called on a day when the RAS recruitment exam (prelims), 2021, will be held and the state government has announced free travel to the candidates appearing in the exam.Yadav said the information of the strike was given to the state government and roadways management on October 6 in advance."When we gave notice to the state government, there was no announcement of free travel to the candidates of the competitive exam."It is the responsibility of the state government to take care of things.

The man was a relative who had stayed with the girl’s family but was told to leave after the family suspected his motives.The girl, a class 8 student, died within minutes of the brutal attack that took place in full view of the children present at the Bibwewadi playground. The girl and her friends were just about to start their first game of kabbadi when the prime suspect, Shubham Bhagwat aka Hrishikesh, reached there with his two accomplices on a bike.The man asked the girl to come aside since he wanted to speak with her. She did. Witnesses told the police that they appeared to have had an argument before the girl faced the bloody attack.Namrata Patil, deputy commissioner of police (Zone V) said the girl was at a playground where a local group holds kabaddi practice and fitness classes for children.The the attacker initially targeted her neck, then elsewhere on the body.“The attack was so brutal that the girl died on the spot,” Namrata Patil said.Sunil Zaware, senior police inspector, Bibwewadi police station, said Shubham was a relative.“Shubham had been stalking her for some time though after knowing about this, girl’s parents warned him to leave their house and he went to stay in another area of Chinchwad,” said Zaware.Police officers are still piecing together the exact sequence of events. An officer said a toy pistol recovered not far from where the girl died indicated that Shubham or his accomplices might have used it to scare others at the playground not to intervene.The two persons who accompanied the prime accused have been detained after hacking her to death, all three accused fled the spot though two suspects were apprehended up from Upper Indiranagar area.“We have detained two attackers who were with the main accused Shubham Bhagwat,” said Zaware, adding that police was trying to trace Bhagwat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/minor-girl-hacked-to-death-in-pune-during-kabaddi-practice-101634053219471.html

Both parties denied a willingness to have a discussion on this proposal and approved it by a majority at a special general body meeting. Congress, Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Nav Nirman Sena (MNS) opposed it saying that by changing the alignment, BJP and NCP changed the reservation of more than 0.1 million square feet of land. The changes had been made at Kothrud, Karvengar, Gandhi lawns to Alankar chowky, Vadgaonsheri and Lohegaon. Even the BJP’s Srinath Bhimale suggested one change at Parvati, which also got approved. Congress leader Aba Bagul said, “The DPR of the HCMTR got approved earlier, but the ruling party keeps changing its alignment instead of starting it on the ground. Former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis is aggressive, but BJP is wasting time making changes. “ The congress blamed BJP MP Kirit Somiya for objections on the Parvati land where the reservation is getting changed. Congress leader Arvind Shinde said, “The land which is objected to by the BJP’s leader is getting free by changing reservation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-and-ncp-vote-in-favour-of-hcmtr-realignment-in-pune-101634053158513.html

It alleges that Patole has brought casteist colour to the party as they both belong to Kunbi caste. “Patil was earlier with Kunbi Sena and supported the Bharatiya Janata Party Lok Sabha candidate Vishwanath Patil in 2014. He later switched sides once Patole joined the Congress and Patil was given the prime post,” said a party worker. “We are paying the price of being loyal to the Congress party and it is up to Rahul Gandhi to decide whether the party needs loyalists or opportunists, who joined the Congress for their selfish needs,” he added. A copy of the letter has also been sent to senior Congress leader KC Venugopal.In the just-concluded Palghar zilla parishad and panchayat samiti bypoll, Congress was drubbed heavily and finished fourth with some candidates even losing their deposits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/300-congress-workers-resign-over-new-chief-in-palghar-101634052438580.html
12-10-2021||Pune||PMC to execute riverfront devp project; Sangam bridge to Yerawada first||PUNE Finally, after five years, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to execute its riverfront development project. Sangam bridge to Yerawada will be the stretch developed in the first phase. The total project cost is Rs2,619 crore.The same consultant that worked on the Sabarmati riverfront in Ahmedabad will now advise the PMC.Standing committee chairman Hemant Rasane said,”Like Gujarat’s Sabarmati development project, the Mula-Mutha riverfront, a total of 44km, will be developed.” This project wil require 768 hectares. Along the river there will be gardens, jogging tracks, and recreational areas. The state government has already cleared this project. Even environment clearance has been received. As PMC is executing this project, it will either get developed on a PPP (public private partnership) basis or by opting for finance.What is Pune River Development Project? Build Embankments for flood protection: The project proposes to protect low-lying areas along the river from flooding by building a variety of well-modulated embankments along the banks of Pune’s riversReduce impact of man-made obstructions on flow of water: The project’s first concern is to address the threat of flooding in city. The project first proposes to reduce the impact of indiscriminately built obstructions such as bridges, causeways, weirs, check dams on flow of water in Pune’s rivers by removing, streamlining, remodeling, or rebuilding them. Create public realm along the river: Having such a continuous public realm will ensure that unlike today, people will be able to move along the length of the river.Curb outflow of drainage and sewage: The project proposes to curb sewage flowing directly into the rivers by laying an interceptor sewer which will curb and divert the sewage to the nearest existing and proposed STPs along the river bank. Enhance connectivity: The project thus proposes to strengthen the existing street network by introducing bridges and access roads that will further enhance the connectivity to the river. Pedestrian and cycling routes will also be planned along the promenades of the riverfront.Integrate the river in the life of the city: Another objective is to create a network of gardens, open spaces, public promenades that will preserve the natural environment and turn the rivers into an important asset for the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-to-execute-riverfront-devp-project-sangam-bridge-to-yerawada-first-101634052318330.html
12-10-2021||Mumbai||Thane civic body begins serosurvey as preparation for Covid third wave||The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) started its first serosurvey as a part of its third wave preparation to find out how many people have developed antibodies to Covid in the city.The survey, which started on Tuesday, will be conducted for the next three weeks across the city. A total of 1,400 representative samples will be collected in the first stage. On the first day of the drive, samples were collected from health centres in Uthalsar, Naupada, Kopri and Pokhran Road. On Wednesday, samples will be collected from four other centres in Pokhran and Ghodbunder Road.“This survey will help identify people from varied age groups and areas who have developed antibodies. Moreover, we can find out how many have been vaccinated in various wards and also get details on the impact of the virus such that we can declare those areas as containment zones if need be,” said Naresh Mhaske, Mayor, Thane.Mhaske was the first to give blood samples.According to officials who were part of the drive, “We have four teams including a field officer and a technician. While the technician continues to take samples, the field officer will help the representatives to fill a form online through an application that helps understand the background of the sampler. Moreover, the testing will be done from age 12 years. They will be divided into five different age groups. People from different strata of society in each ward of the city will also be surveyed,” said a senior officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-civic-body-begins-serosurvey-as-preparation-for-covid-third-wave-101634052019130.html
12-10-2021||Pune||PMPML to introduce e-cabs in Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad||PUNE: The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) has initiated an online survey with the aim to soon launch e-cabs for the citizens of Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. The e-cabs will be cheaper than auto-rickshaws as well as Uber and Ola services, officials said. This may be the first time the public sector transport agency is considering adding air-conditioned e-cabs to their existing fleet.Dattatreya Zende, traffic manager, PMPML, said, “This is a big project for us and as of now, we are conducting an online survey to find out what commuters’ needs are and how we can best fulfill them. A consultant from Ernst & Young is helping PMPML create this new service model.”The proposed model has 200 such e-cabs plying between the city’s main areas such as Shivajinagar, Deccan, Swargate, Camp and Pune railway station, with 150km to be covered daily.“We also plan to introduce a pink cab service dedicated to women. Once the model is approved, which should be in six months, we will introduce an app for booking. We are also going to have e-cab stands for on-the-spot booking for those who don’t have smartphones. The fares of these cabs will be pegged at Rs10 per kilometre which is cheaper compared to other private services as of now,” Zende said.The PMPML e-cabs will also offer daylong and Pune darshan (tourist spots) services.Meanwhile, regular commuters on PMPML buses and auto-rickshaws welcomed the idea.Ajit Paradkar, a professional, said, “I am a regular traveller on the PMPML bus from Aundh to Marketyard though I often wait for e-buses which are very comfortable to travel. I will be glad to use e-cabs if they are introduced. When we go out as a family, private cab services tend to be expensive especially during peak hours. If the PMPML offers the same comfort for less, we will definitely opt for the service.”Sakhiee Nagpure, for whom e-cabs may be a godsend, said, “I often use auto-rickshaws to visit the peths and that is harassment as drivers blatantly refuse to ferry you to your destination. If I am getting better service than them, I will gladly use e-cabs.”A commuter from Kalyani Nagar who has to frequently travel to Camp finds private cab services unreliable and expensive. “If the PMPML is offering a better deal and that too an air-conditioned cab, I will surely opt for that,” she said.Anjali Raju is very happy with the e-buses except when they break down. “I will be happy if they have a woman driver on the cabs because that way, we will be much more comfortable travelling from point to point in the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmpml-to-introduce-e-cabs-in-pune-pimprichinchwad-101634051658041.html

Data obtained from the civic body on 16,149 deaths recorded till October 10 also showed that 36% patients did not have any underlying disease, while the remaining 4% deceased had conditions like tuberculosis, chronic kidney disease, ischemic heart disease, among others. According to the data, 6,336 or 39.2% deceased had diabetes, 3,311 or 20.5% had hypertension and 5,862 or 36.3% had no co-morbidity. “Not just Covid-19, diabetes and hypertension have been the leading co-morbidities when it comes to the worsening impact of other diseases as well,” said critical care specialist Dr Kedar Toraskar from Wockhardt Hospital, who is also a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force. “Covid-19 infection affects the pancreas. In addition to this, the treatment required for some patients may include steroids that are known to elevate blood sugar levels. All these factors together contribute to higher complications among patients,” he said. The pancreas is an organ that regulates blood sugar. Experts say Sars-CoV-2 either damages the pancreas through direct injury or through inflammation of the pancreas. Due to such injury, the organ’s ability to regulate blood sugar is impacted. Similarly, Covid-19 patients may have severe outcomes when they have high blood pressure, which is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular diseases. Medical experts say that hypertensive patients are more prone to suffer from a severe form of Covid-19, longer hospitalisation and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. A scientific brief published by the World Health Organization this June stated that the available evidence is consistent overall in suggesting that hypertension increases the risk of Covid-19, admission to intensive care units, severe disease and mortality. “Whether these increased risks were independent of other risk factors, however, has not been fully elucidated,” it said. Medical experts said that obesity was also among the factors of concern, even as the civic body does not list it as a co-morbidity while analysing the deaths. “In most cases, the Body Mass Index (BMI) of the patients is not captured which is a problem,” said Toraskar. “We have seen overweight and obese patients at more risk of severe Covid-19,” he said. He said that some patients with obesity may have been counted under the 36% patients with no co-morbidities, as they may not have any known underlying conditions. “Most patients without co-morbidities who have succumbed had developed the severe disease,” said Dr Avinash Supe, who heads the Covid-19 death audit committee. “It will be right to say that the disease killed them. Many of them went into a cytokine storm,” he said. Cytokine storm is a severe immune reaction that leads to organ damage. While experts say that some patients may have undiagnosed underlying diseases, some deaths may also be due to failure or inadequate health infrastructure at some level. An analysis by the death audit committee shown that nearly 60% patients have died within five days of hospitalisation, suggesting either delayed treatment or hospitalisation or rapid progress to severe disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-deaths-diabetes-hypertension-top-co-morbidities-in-mumbai-101634051478110.html

As per the proposal, PMC will pay Rs23.28 crore to the contractor for the cars for a period of eight years. Standing committee chairman Hemant Rasane said, “We have given the nod to procure the cars from a private contractor, but we decided to cancel the drivers and PMC will use its own drivers.” The cost of th drivers was Rs28,000 percar per month, said Rasane. Though the ruling BJP voted in favor of it, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Shiv Sena opposed the proposal. Rasane said, “Recently, environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray announced that from April 2022, all the government officers would need to purchase or hire only electric vehicles in Maharashtra. These vehicles will be used by office bearers and the administration.” PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar moved this proposal as an “emergency”, without floating of tenders or inviting expressions of interest. Energy Efficiency Private Limited company will provide the vehicles to the PMC. After completion of eight years, the company will allow PMC to purchase the vehicles at five per cent of the cost. PMC also adopted a policy to purchase electric buses for public transport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-standing-committee-clears-proposal-to-hire-e-vehicles-but-no-drivers-101634051298116.html

With the party inviting only a limited number of leaders and functionaries at the indoor event at Shanmukhanand Hall, the former Sena environment minister is likely to be axed from the list of invitees.Party insiders said that the Sena chief was not happy with the audio clips where Kadam was heard expressing happiness over action against Sena minister Anil Parab by district authorities. The audio clips were put out by Maharashtra Navnirman Sena leader Vaibhav Khedekar alleging that the information against Parab was leaked by Kadam through Prasad Karve, the Right to Information (RTI) activist in Ratnagiri district.“We are inviting a limited number of people including ministers, leaders and functionaries in the hierarchy of the party. Since we have to follow Covid-19 protocols, it won’t be possible to accommodate everybody. Kadam may be dropped from the invited [leaders] along with some other party functionaries,” said a senior party functionary. Party insiders also added that former union minister and Sena leader Anant Geete may not be invited after he called Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar a “backstabber”.Sena chief spokesperson Arvind Sawant, “The gathering will be held at Shanmukhanad Hall with 50% capacity. Only a limited number of people will be asked to come there; around 1,300 people will be there... I am not sure if Ramdas Kadam is invited or not.”With around four months to go for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections, Sena chief, and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is expected to speak on the party’s plan to keep control of the civic body. Interestingly, Kadam is a legislator who is elected to the state legislative council from the Mumbai local self-government bodies. Kadam’s term ends on January 1, 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ramdas-kadam-to-be-dropped-from-list-of-invitees-for-shiv-sena-dussehra-rally-101634050818096.html

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, UPCC chief Ajay Kumar Lallu, Rashtriya Lok Dal chief Jayant Chaudhary and Samajwadi Party leaders including its district president Rampal Singh Yadav were among those who paid tribute to the deceased.Samyukta Kisan Morcha and BKU leaders, including Rakesh Tikait, Darshan Singh Pal, Joginder Singh Ugrahan, Dharmendra Malik besides local farm union leaders also arrived in the village to pay tributes to the deceased, who were allegedly mowed down by speeding vehicles on during a protest.The antim ardas was held amidst heavy police presence in a paddy field barely a kilometre away from the spot of violence in Tukunia on Oct 3.The deceased included four farmers, including Daljeet Singh and Gurvinder Singh of Bahraich district, Nachhattar Singh of Dhaurahra (Lakhimpur) and Lavpreet Singh of Pallia (Lakhimpur), a journalist Raman Kashyap of Nighasan (Lakhimpur), two BJP workers and a driver. The violence started when an SUV belonging to BJP minister Ajay Mishra Teni allegedly rammed into the protesting farmers.Farmers coming to attend the antim ardas were stopped at police pickets set up on the road to Tikunia and not allowed to proceed with their vehicles. But majority of them reached the spot on foot.The paddy field was cleared for the antim ardas and rugs were spread on the ground for people to sit. Family members of the deceased and farmer leaders sat on a raised platform while political leaders were not allowed to share the stage by the organisers.Paying homage to the deceased, farmer leaders reiterated their demand for the arrest of Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra. His son Ashish Mishra was accused of killing the farmers by mowing them down in an SUV. He was arrested on Saturday by the police team investigating the matter.“Insaf tabhi hoga jab mantri giraftar hoga (Justice will be done only after the minister is arrested,” said a local farm leader at the venue. Family members of the deceased farmers also reiterated the same demand. “The police cannot conduct a fair investigation till minister Ajay Mishra resigns from his post and is arrested for criminal conspiracy that resulted in the violence,” said Gurjinder Singh, uncle of deceased farmer Gurvinder Singh.Preachers from the nearby Kodiyala Ghat Gurudwara offered prayers at the venue. More than 400 Sikh volunteers served water, helped with parking arrangements, directed movement of crowd and ran ‘langar’ (community kitchen ) at the paddy field.Units of the police, PAC and RAF were deputed near the venue to ensure law and order and avert any untoward incident. Senior police and administrative officials also camped in a nearby school and overlooked the proceedings while remaining in touch with farmers.“We are in touch with farmer leaders and organisers of the antim ardas. They have assured us that the event will be organised in a peaceful manner and they will cooperate with the administration to ensure law and order,” said SN Sabat, acting ADG.PRIYANKA, JAYANT STOPPEDCongress national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who had left for Delhi late on Monday evening after the silent protest in Lucknow, landed in the state capital again on Tuesday morning to go to Lakhimpur Kheri to participate in the ‘antim ardas’.

He had taken a flight from Delhi to Bareilly and was heading to Lakhimpur Kheri. He too reached Lakhimpur and participated in the ‘antim ardas’.Will begin stir if minister not sacked: Tikait Addressing the gathering during the ‘antim ardas’, BKU leader Rakesh Tikait reiterated his demand for the removal of MoS (home) Ajay Kumar Mishra, blaming him for the violence in Tikunia on October 3. He also warned of an agitation if the minister was not dismissed from his cabinet post.“If videos of Tikunia violence had not come into public domain, farmers would have been held responsible for the incident,” said Tikait. He said four farmers and a journalist killed in the Tikunia violence would be counted among those 600 farmers, who had laid down their lives opposing the three farm laws. Outlining the further course of agitation, Tikait said a ‘Kisan Shaheed Yatra’ with ‘asthi’ (mortal remains of the deceased) would be taken out across all states and districts. These urns would be religiously disposed in the respective districts and states.On Vijay Dashmi (October 15), effigies of BJP leaders would be burnt to mark the protest against the “anti-farmers policies of the BJP government,” he said.On October 18, a six-hour-long ‘Rail Roko’ movement would be launched from 10am to 4pm, followed by a ‘Kisan Mahapanchayat’ in Lucknow on October 26, during which further course of action would be decided, added Tikait.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/priyanka-other-leaders-take-part-in-antim-ardas-pay-tribute-to-deceased-farmers-101634050578209.html

12-10-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan constitutes transgender welfare fund||The Rajasthan government has set up a welfare fund, among the first such in the country, dedicated to the upliftment of the transgender community. The fund will be utilized for the social and financial upliftment of the community, and bring its members to the mainstream, officials said. In August 2016, Rajasthan constituted a Transgender Welfare Board with three members from the community with the social justice department minister as its chairman. The welfare fund is part of 2021-22 budget announcements. Welcoming the government’s decision, Member of Transgender Welfare Board, Pushpa Nai said, “Rajasthan is the first state in the country with a separate development fund for the community.” She said the transgender development fund will focus on skills, awareness, education, and infrastructure like the setting up of community halls. “A sum of ₹8.82 crore as annual allocation has been made by the government for the fund. The state has made provision of financial assistance for sex change, under which ₹2.5 lakh will be provided to the applicant,” said Pushpa. There are provisions of financial aid in one form or the other in very few states across the country. Tamil Nadu provided ₹4000 as financial aid to transgenders in light of the pandemic to start small businesses, while Karala also provides financial assistance for sex realignment surgeries for the members of the community. As per census 2011, the transgender population in Rajasthan was 16,500. Thereafter in joint mapping with the UNDP, it was found to be around 22,517. It is expected that the population has reached 75,000, said Pushpa. The guidelines of the welfare fund state that the money allocated will be utilized for ensuring financial assistance, housing, medical facilities, education, and employment to the transgender community. For self-employment and skill development, the transgender community between 21 and 50 years of age will be given 25% cost or a maximum of ₹50,000. The state government has also decided to organize festivals, cultural and traditional fairs, games and sports competitions for the community at the state and district level on National Transgender Day held on November 20 every year. For state-level programmes, ₹10 lakh is sanctioned and ₹1 lakh for district level. The state government will allocate two bigah land near Jaipur for state-level community hall and old age home along with counselling at all the seven divisional headquarters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-constitutes-transgender-welfare-fund-101634050279556.html

The Hanuman Koliwada Macchimar Vikas Sanstha had moved the court in December 2018 seeking judicial intervention into the dumping of garbage on mangroves. The Uran Municipal Council advocate submitted to the court that an alternative site for the garbage has been identified. The council also promised the court that the civic body would not dump solid waste in the restricted area and sought time to file a detailed affidavit. The hearing had been adjourned to January 30, 2019. In the affidavit filed by the Raigad district collector on February 19, 2019, it was stated that land for solid waste dumping is yet to be identified and allotted, the court noted. When the case came for hearing on Friday, the petitioners’ counsel Meenaz Kakalia pointed out that the dumping continues and presented the latest photographs of the site where a JCB machine was seen spreading the garbage and the site on fire, billowing dark smoke. Justices SJ Kathawalla and Milind N Jadhav said in their order, “The fact remains that the statements made before this court and recorded by the court in its order dated December 19, 2018, has been breached.” This was also established from the photographs submitted by the advocate for the petitioner, the judges said. Terming the matter “very serious”, the judges directed the Uran Municipal Council to file a fresh affidavit by October 13. The hearing is fixed for the next day. NatConnect Foundation, which has also taken up the issue with the Prime Minister and the chief minister, said for 15 years locals and environmentalists have been literally banging their heads on walls with no respite to pollution, breathing problems and frequent sickness, apart from the damage to mangroves. Pointing out that the Swachh Bharat campaign has been thrown to winds in Uran, Kumar said “None of the authorities seems to respect mangroves as frontline soldiers against tidal attacks.” In response to a Right to Information (RTI) application, Uran Municipal Council informed NatConnect that it has requested the Raigad collector for a five-hectare plot at Jasai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/garbage-dumping-on-mangroves-in-uran-serious-bombay-hc-pulls-up-municipal-council-101634050158183.html

An editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana added that after Article 370 was removed striping off the special status granted to Jammu and Kashmir, the extremists and Pakistan sympathisers have been emboldened.On Monday, five army personnel, including a junior commissioned officer (JCO), and two terrorists were killed in three encounters in various districts of Jammu and Kashmir. The soldiers were martyred in an encounter in the Surankote area of Poonch.“After stripping off all the special status granted to Jammu and Kashmir, the Pakistan sympathisers have been emboldened. The terrorists in Kashmir, who operate at the directions of Pakistan, have again created a perverse environment to not allow persons of any other religion to step foot in the valley. After killing a Kashmiri Pandit, a Sikh woman, the terrorists have dared to kill five army personnel. Before the blood of the five soldiers killed in the Surankote encounter dries, revenge must be exacted five times the soldiers killed,” the editorial said.The Sena mouthpiece likened the recent incidents to the 1990s when the terror incidents were at their peak. “The Indian minds will not get peace till the time terrorists who killed the five soldiers are pulverised... For how long will we have to suffer the killings of our jawans? The recent incidents of violence have reminded the decade in the 90s,” the editorial remarked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/exact-revenge-for-jawans-killed-in-jammu-and-kashmir-sena-101634049978031.html

I still feel that I am in the chair. It is because of the leaders like Manda Mhatre, Ganesh Naik, Narendra Patil, who keep supporting me, that I never felt that I am no more in the chair. The people of Maharashtra never let me realise that I am not the CM now. Whenever I get the blessings (to become CM again) I will first come to goddess Govardhani (deity of Navi Mumbai) to take blessings,” he said.Fadnavis said that in the past two years he has been working tirelessly for the people. “After all, it is not important which position you occupy, but the work you do talks for you. I have done a fabulous job as the leader of Opposition,” he said.His remarks invoked criticism from Congress which said that Fadnavis needs proper counselling.“The formation of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government two years ago was an unexpected event for Devendraji Fadnavis. The mental shock may invoke such psychological symptoms. Sometimes even the reduction in the salt in the blood may lead to illusion. Fadnavis needs to see a doctor immediately as the period of two years is not less and the people in Maharashtra need him as the leader of Opposition,” said Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant.Another Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe said that Fadnavis should stop daydreaming and accept the fact that he is the leader of Opposition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/still-feel-i-am-in-maharashtra-cm-s-chair-says-devendra-fadnavis-congress-slams-remark-101634049857879.html

The task force will record the problems and suggestions of the public and attempt to resolve them at the earliest, he said. The main objective of the campaign is to improve citizens’ participation and engagement by providing a platform, he added.Highlighting the important achievements of the government’s mission in the last four and half years, the CM observed that emotional integration and confidence-building among the people in the hill and valley in the state has improved after the introduction of the ‘Go to Hills’ mission.In ‘Meeyamgi Numit’ (people’s day), a routine monthly meeting with the public, the grievances of many families were addressed, he said. While celebrating 4 years of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led coalition government in the state in May this year, Biren Singh informed that it took the governance to people’s doorsteps covering around 2,691 villages in a year, besides reviving the government’s public transport system after a gap of 15 years.“Such types of people-centric initiatives bring a change in the state,” he said.Similarly, around 8 lakh people have benefitted from PM’s Ayushman Bharat and Chief Ministergi Hakselgi Tengbang, a state health scheme in the state, he added.

In highly built-up urban areas, heat and light also reflect off and radiate from buildings and roads, creating heat islands. In addition, buildings in India are the second-largest consumer of electricity. By 2030, buildings will likely become the largest consumer of electricity. However, it is possible to design and construct energy-efficient buildings and avoid the urban heat island effect. In a business-as-usual scenario, without any additional building energy policies, the total final energy consumption in Indian buildings can double between 2010 and 2050, reaching 5000 TWh and emitting 3,543 million metric tonnes of CO2e emissions. However, there is a significant opportunity to avoid steep rises in energy consumption from the building sector – 50% of the buildings that will exist in 2030 are not yet constructed! Is low-carbon comfort possible?Can we have comfortable buildings without warming the planet (too much)? The genius of architects, developers, energy experts and the options available in designs, building materials and appliances is such that comfortable, well-lit, ventilated buildings that keep energy consumption and electricity bills down are already possible. Building energy codes are effective tools for ensuring energy efficiency in building design, construction, and operation. Estimates suggest that energy performance standards that require new buildings to incorporate energy efficiency designs can yield a 30 to 40 per cent reduction in energy use and yet be more comfortable. Building energy codes can catalyse changeAmong the most urbanised states in the country, Maharashtra has a crucial role in ensuring that new buildings are energy efficient. In addition, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) is by far one of the biggest real estate markets in the country.The architecture design and construction industries already have technologies for energy-efficient buildings. However, since Maharashtra does not have an institutional framework or system to integrate such measures in new buildings, these technologies have not been extensively deployed.The Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC), applicable to commercial buildings, prepared by the central government’s Bureau of Energy Efficiency, was released in 2007 and amended later in 2017, is available for states to adopt and implement. These building energy codes, if implemented, can result in substantial energy savings. So far, 18 states and two union territories (UTs) have notified ECBC 2007 and ECBC 2017. Telangana and Andhra Pradesh were among the first states, and Madhya Pradesh is the latest to do so.The Maharashtra Energy Development Authority (MEDA) is the state nodal agency to facilitate ECBC implementation. Notification of the ECBC by the Maharashtra government and its incorporation in building bye-laws for new commercial buildings can drive sector transformation.“By 2030, India will have added nearly one billion square meters of new commercial floor space — more than the land area of New York City and Washington DC combined. Building smart from the start is a real opportunity to reduce emissions, save energy and enhance prosperity. Gujarat and Maharashtra are key states in India’s transition to energy-efficient buildings. Successful implementation of the code in these two states will give a huge boost to India’s efforts on building energy savings,” says Prima Madan, lead consultant with Natural Resources Defence Council (NRDC) India Programme. Maharashtra has taken initial steps to draft a state amended code. It has identified the roles of different stakeholders and completed demonstration projects to showcase the actual energy savings of ECBC compliant buildings. In 2021, the state constituted a technical committee with officials of urban development and housing departments to fast-track notification. A simple process, backed by a pool of certified experts to support the real estate developers with compliance, will be important for a large state like Maharashtra to successfully implement ECBC.Conversations with some top developers reveal a positive attitude towards formalising the ECBC in Maharashtra, provided the permissions process can be kept simple. Some shared that green buildings help create a brand image, especially with potential overseas and multinational clients for office and commercial space.The state government has stated its commitment to climate action. The timely notification of the ECBC in Maharashtra will enable the building construction industry to play a significant role in avoiding future carbon emissions with more energy-efficient buildings.Sanskriti Menon is senior programme director, Centre for Environment Education.

12-10-2021||Indore||Four Muslim men arrested at Garba program in Indore released on bond||Four Muslim men, arrested after activists of the Bajrang Dal objected to their presence at a Garba dance event organized at a private college here, were released on Tuesday after they furnished bonds, an official said. Their family members questioned the rationale behind the arrests. Two of them were students of the same college and serving as volunteers during the event, family members said. Sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Parag Jain ordered the release of Adnan Shah, Mohammad Umar, Abdul Qadir and Syed Saqib after they furnished bonds of ₹50,000 each, a district official said. The four were arrested on Sunday under section 151 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (arrest to prevent the commission of cognizable offences) from the campus of a college located in Gandhi Nagar. Abdul Hamid Shah, Adnan's father, told PTI that his son was a student of second year B.Com. "He was serving there as a volunteer and was handling light and sound system during the program,” Shah said. Displaying the identity card issued by the college and invitation to the program, he asked, “On what basis my son was sent to jail under CrPC 151? We feel it was done under political pressure.” Abdul Aleem, Qadir's elder brother, too said he was handling garba arrangements as a volunteer. But additional superintendent of police Prashant Choube said these men had a dispute with some others during the program, so they were arrested as a precautionary measure under section 151. Eyewitnesses said that Bajrang Dal activists had created a ruckus objecting to the presence of members of the Muslim community at the event, following which police took four persons to the police station. Bajrang Dal's local coordinator Tarun Devda in a complaint filed with Gandhi Nagar police station alleged that the district administration had given permission to the organizers to invite only 800 persons, but they turned it into a commercial event by selling tickets, and between 2,000 to 3,000 people were in attendance. Devda also claimed that by inviting a large number of Muslim youths to a Garba program organized during the holy festival of Navratra, the college was encouraging them to take part in such events. On Devda's complaint, a case under IPC section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) was also registered against Akshay Tiwari, a member of the college management, police said. Elsewhere, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) on Monday put up posters in Ratlam `prohibiting' the entry of "non-Hindus" at Garba dance pandals to avoid the repeat of "controversial incidents" of the last year. It had put up such posters in 56 pandals with the consent of respective organizers, said an office-bearer of the right-wing outfit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/indore-news/four-muslim-men-arrested-at-garba-program-in-indore-released-on-bond-101634046331355.html

12-10-2021||Lucknow||‘It’s a great mix of fasting and feasting during Navratri’||Navratri and Durga Puja celebrations in the city are witnessing a big contrast in terms of consumption of food. While a large section of devotees observe fasts and abstain from non-vegetarian food for Bengalis this is the time to feast upon choices of delicacies with fish topping, the must-have list besides mutton and chicken dishes. Sonali Bhattacharya, a teacher, says, “Usually for four days we Bengalis only eat out. On Sashti (sixth day) womenfolk fast for their children and thereafter during daytime we savour the divine bhog at Pandals and then dinners of course with non-vegetarian delicacies. On 10th day after Sindoor Khela and visarjan people visit each other’s home where they are treated with payas (kheer) and fish.” At pandals it’s khichdi bhog that everyone looks forward to savour, says Shankar Bhowmik, bhog secretary of Bengali Club. Rakesh Pandey, general secretary of Utsav Jankipuram Sec-F Durga Puja, informed that due to Covid-19 protocols packed bhoj was distributed to devotees. However, at Ramakrishna Math bhog was given to one and all. President Swami Muktinathananda himself made an announcement that all devotees must have prasad before leaving the pandal. “Community feasting is an important aspect of Durga pujo and people eagerly wait for it,” he said. Chef Bhasker Mishra says at his Sassy Canteen he is getting a good mix of people coming for fasting thali and on the other hand Bengalis are driving the non-vegetarian business. “Those who are not fasting, but abstaining from non-vegetarian, are also trying for fast-wali-thaali for a change! It’s a great mix of fasting and feasting during Navratri. Personally, I don’t eat non-veg during Navratri. My mother is a Bengali so we prepare many varieties of sweets, different of khichdi and on Dussehra fish is a must. At my nani’s home on all days fish is savoured.” Restaurants too are banking on Bengali consumers to balance business for them. “Business during last Navratri was very poor but this time, though many are fasting or abstaining from non-veg food, the Bengalis drive up the sale. Interestingly, mutton is preferred over chicken delicacies,” says Arshi Jamal of Dastarkhwan. Youngster Souvik Mukherjee, who works in a private company, says, “During this period, I have bog during daytime, but dinner has to be a non-vegetarian delicacy. It’s a contrast that my friends are fasting or having satvik bhog, but I have promised them full-on non-veg treat on Dussehra.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/its-a-great-mix-of-fasting-and-feasting-during-navratri-101634044457735.html
12-10-2021||Lucknow||Akhilesh launches rath yatra from Kanpur, says BJP “crushed” farmers||KANPUR Launching his party’s Mission 2022 with a rath yatra, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday lashed out at the BJP, saying it had “crushed farmers,” and on return to power in Uttar Pradesh, would “crush the Constitution” as well.The composite culture (Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb) of UP was the identity of the people here and the Samajwadi Vijay Yatra was about saving this tehzeeb, said the former UP CM while kick-starting the Samajwadi Vijay Rath Yatra from Kanpur’s new Ganga bridge, which will cover all 403 Assembly segments ahead of the 2022 Assembly polls in the state.The SP chief will focus on farmers, youth and their problems during this journey, the first leg of which will end on October 13. The yatra will pass through Kanpur, Kanpur Dehat, Hamirpur and Jalaun in the first phase and promises to make people aware about the “corrupt, autocratic and suppressive” policies of the BJP government and establish “real democracy”.Buoyed by the enthusiasm of SP workers who rode boats in the Ganga, Akhilesh Yadav appeared on top of his motorized rath (a bus) with five-year-old Khazanchi, the child who was born in a queue outside a bank in Kanpur Dehat during demonetisation days. Waving the party flag, Khazanchi flagged off the Vijay Yatra, which halted at Hamirpur where a meeting was held.“The Samajwadi Vijay Rath will run from Ganga to Yamuna. We are starting this yatra with the blessings of Netaji (Mulayam Singh Yadav). We have come out to seek the cooperation and support of the public. The people of UP have been cheated by the BJP government…a change is inevitable,” he said.Attacking the ruling party, Yadav said: “The BJP has crushed farmers, and if they come back to power, they are all set to crush the Constitution. “Therefore, the Samajwadi Vijay Rath will go to people and throw the BJP out of power,” the former CM said in apparent reference to the mowing down of farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri last Sunday.Yadav said UP was the land of farmers, but they were being oppressed. “They were promised double income but their income has been taken away.The farmers are not being given the price of their standing paddy crop,” he said.Yadav said the state should be rebuilt and put on the path of development. “The BJP government is selling everything – from airports to ports. It won’t be a surprise, if in days to come, the government is outsourced,” he said.Speaking in Ghatampur, the former CM said the Samajwadi Party would not hesitate in giving free power and water to people, if voted to power. Rath yatras have been an important part of the Samajwadi Party’s campaign since 2001. Akhilesh Yadav led the yatra in 2012 and the party was voted to power. He was sworn in as the chief minister.Now, Yadav is travelling in a Mercedes bus, which has been turned into a ‘rath’ having his posters displayed on one side and that of party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav on the other, besides a picture of party leader Mohammad Azam Khan. The bus is also adorned with pictures of SP leader Ram Gopal Yadav, party state president Naresh Uttam Patel, and an embossed slogan ‘Bado Ka Hath Yuva Ka Sath’ (the older generation blesses the new).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/akhilesh-launches-rath-yatra-from-kanpur-says-bjp-crushed-farmers-101634044217488.html

Also read: India allows domestic flights to operate at full capacity amid demand surgeThe police have added Register-29 in all police stations to track addicts and offenders booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. “At present, there is no mechanism to maintain the exact data of offenders booked under the NDPS Act. The station house officer (SHO) of the police station concerned will have to maintain the register that will create a database for analyses and better prevention of drug trafficking,” says state police chief Sanjay Kundu. Highest number of drug cases in Shimla The rise in narcotic trade in the state can be gauged from the number of NDPS cases registered under different police stations. In 2016, 919 cases were registered under the Act, while the number has now risen to 1,078. The highest number of 173 cases has been registered in Shimla followed by 164 in Kullu, 146 in Mandi and 121 in Kangra. Solan district that borders Haryana and includes the industrial township of Baddi and Barotiwala has registered 125 cases. Drug trafficking is negligent in Lahaul and Spiti district, where only two cases have been registered. The prevalence of drug addiction and trafficking is more among those aged between 26 and 35 years, who comprise 37% of the total number of cases registered under the NDPS Act. Charas use higher than national average According to a survey of the National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, the prevalence of the use of charas and ganja is 1.2% in the country, while it’s higher than the national average at 3.2 % in Himachal Pradesh. Similarly, the use of opioids is 2.8% in Punjab, 2.5% in Haryana, 2% in Delhi and 1.7% in Himachal Pradesh against the national average of 0.7%. Himachal Pradesh’s drug problem includes illicit cultivation of cannabis and opium and the production of chemical narcotic drugs. Kullu is infamous for illicit cannabis cultivation. The high-quality charas produced in the valley is sought after in international and domestic tourist destinations. The increase in the use of chitta and other synthetic drugs has raised concerns for the government. Recently, the Himachal Pradesh Police helped Punjab Police to unearth the illegal supply of Tramadol tablets manufactured in two factories in Sirmour district. After inspection, police registered FIRs against the pharma companies suspected of diverting tablets, capsules listed in psychotropic substances through fake marketing companies. The state police have sought help from the CBI-Interpol branch to arrest traffickers hailing from west African countries supplying drugs in Himachal. In the past five years, 69 foreigners, including 34 Nigerians, have been arrested in the state under the NDPS Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-pradesh-police-devises-new-strategy-to-track-drug-traffickers-101634043257784.html

Similar weather has been predicted for coastal Karnataka regions as well, while “isolated heavy rainfall” is very likely over north interior Karnataka in the next 24 hours.According to the latest IMD bulletin, heavy rainfall in Bengaluru and other parts of Karnataka is being triggered by a cyclonic circulation that currently lies over the east-central Arabian Sea. “It is very likely to persist during [the] next two days,” the IMD bulletin read. The weather department has already forecast heavy rainfall with thunderstorms and lightning in Bengaluru for Tuesday, according to ANI.Bengaluru, the IT hub of India, has been witnessing heavy rain since Sunday afternoon, however, intensive rainfall on Monday night led to waterlogging outside the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) as well. Soon, videos and images of people reaching the airport on tractors went viral on social media.However, the chief operating officer of KIA Jayaraj Shanmugam told news agency ANI that there was “no tractor at the airport; it was outside at Begur junction.” “The amount of rainfall was unprecedented so waterlogging occurred.

But the sex workers do not get a chance to participate in the festival in public places. In Assam’s Silchar, an unregistered brothel exists where 450 sex workers, mostly victims of human trafficking, live together with their children. Since they are not allowed to attend any Durga Puja pandal or temple, they have started conducting a Puja inside the red-light area. They said that it is a symbol of welcoming the goddess at their home during the festival and celebration of womanhood. On the eve of Maha Shasthi, when the goddess is believed to arrive at her father’s home, the religious celebration officially begins. On Monday, the sex workers were seen preparing to welcome goddess Durga at their temple located inside the redlight area. It is comparatively a small puja where no idols made of earth are used. They offer the puja before a large portrait of goddess Durga. A senior sex worker who has spent 50 years of her life in the Silchar redlight area said, “We are rejected individuals from society, we cannot take part in common celebration. But, in the end, we are human beings, we cannot just pass these four days without celebration. So, we welcome goddess Durga to our home because she is our mother too. We follow the rituals which also include Lakshmi puja after 4 days of Dussehra. We celebrate Kali Puja on a larger scale. All of them are women and we celebrate womanhood by offering Puja to Maa Durga, Lakshmi and Kali.”She also informed that around 70 kids are residing with their mothers. “They sometimes want to be outside and we make arrangements for this,” she said. Another old lady said, “We are not even allowed to worship Maa Durga or Maa Kali during the festive season in public areas. So, we have made our area of worship. This area has idols and pictures of many gods and goddesses. We are believed to be one of maa Durga roops, so we worship her in our temple.”The red light area located near the Premtala area of Silchar town is called ‘Chouddo Nombor Galli’ (Lane Number 14) and is one of the largest active brothels in North East India. Local historians say that the brothel in Silchar was established during the second world war. There was some army movement in this part of India during the war and the brothel was initially made for them. Silchar town was very small during that period. Later, it became the second-most important urban area of Assam after Guwahati because of the trade possibilities. Prostitution is not legal in India but everyone knows that this area near Premtala point of Silchar is an undeclared brothel.There are several cases of trafficking against the brothel and so many times, young women were recovered by police and NGOs from this place. Two Delhi-based bar dancers were recovered in 2019 based on a complaint lodged by an NGO. There were many such cases in past when girls from several parts of India and other countries like Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh, were rescued from this brothel.The ladies who ended up being here are victims of trafficking and several other issues, so it is quite natural that they couldn’t keep their documents along. When the first draft of NRC was released in 2018, more than 200 sex workers of the Silchar redlight area could not find their names in the list. Many of them got names enlisted in the final draft after they went home, met the families to find the family trees.Unlike Silchar, brothel inmates in various parts of the country, including Sonagachi brothel in Kolkata, have been given voter identity cards and Aadhaar cards by the government. There are several unions of sex workers in West Bengal and other states which are fighting for their rights and protection. But in Silchar, there is no such union that can raise demand for these sex workers. There is anger among locals about this redlight area in the middle of the town. In the past, several attempts were made to remove it but somehow the attempts were not successful. Sometimes, the women, especially the young ones, try to escape but they end up getting caught.Social activist and advocate Tuhina Sharma is one of the strongest voices of these ladies. With the help of Lions Club Silchar Central and other NGOs, she distributes sanitary pads, sanitizers, condoms and contraceptives among these sex workers. She also helps the inmates get voter identity cards and other documents so that their names get mentioned in the administrative records.She said, “These women are mostly victims of violence and injustice, they are vulnerable for various reasons. First, we need to ensure that they have a registered identity. After that comes hygiene and safety. As per the records, we know, around 450 women from this place have voting rights. We have heard that some candidates have come here to ask for the voting process. Both the Congress and BJP in their manifestos have said that ladies will get some financial benefits. I want to ask both the parties if these sex workers will get the advantage?”During the lockdown, the area was shut for almost a year. Various NGOs and some officers from Cachar police extended their support to these ladies. Food, sanitizer, mask, clothes and medicines were sent to these sex workers. Some NGOs, with the help of the health department, conduct monthly HIV test drives. Now, Covid-19 tests are being conducted regularly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/for-silchar-s-sex-workers-durga-puja-is-celebration-of-womanhood-101634039898413.html

The intense rain on September 11 caused flooding in the arrival area in Terminal 3, as well as the area where aircraft are parked, even as more than 100 flights were delayed and five diverted. Officials said rainwater leaked into Terminal 3 from at least four spots on the roof. The Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL), the airport operator, attributed the waterlogging inside the terminal to “a steep gradient” between Terminal 3 and National Highway 48 adjoining it. The airport’s forecourt flooded in October 2019 as well after an intense spell of rain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/passengers-take-tractors-to-bengaluru-airport-official-says-they-didn-t-come-in-101634037005292.html

Lallu Singh, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Ayodhya, launched the project on Sunday. The Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) has entrusted this responsibility to Larsen and Toubro. This project will be carried out under the integrated power development scheme (IDPs) of the Centre. Another proposal for a ₹1200 crore project from the Ayodhya administration for removing overhead power cables from the remaining parts of the city for laying them underground has also been forwarded to the state government.According to Lallu Singh, the state government will approve the project soon and another phase of the project will start in the next two months. As part of the ongoing power project in Ayodhya, around 135 transformers have been laid underground. In the third phase, 30 more transformers will be laid underground. “Transforming Ayodhya into a world-class tourist destination is on the priority list of the state government. This power project is also a part of this plan,” said Ved Prakash Gupta, BJP MLA from Ayodhya (Sadar) constituency. The construction work of Ram Mandir has also been fast-tracked. The Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust has set a deadline of December 2023 to open the sanctum-sanctorum of the temple for devotees. After completing the foundation work of Ram Mandir, the Trust has started the second phase of construction of Ram Mandir. In this phase, the plinth of the temple is being constructed. According to the Trust, above the foundation, a one –and–half meter thick raft is being placed. Above this raft, the plinth is being constructed. For the construction of this plinth, Mirzapur stones granites are being used. “Placement work of stones for sanctum-sanctorum of Ram Mandir will start from January next year (2022),” said a member of the Trust. After the construction of the plinth, the placement work of stones for the sanctum-sanctorum of the Ram Mandir will start.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/govt-launches-mega-power-project-in-ayodhya-powerlines-to-go-underground-101634035276890.html
12-10-2021||Chandigarh||College campus buzzes back to life with vigour of youth||As I step on the podium, my hands itch to write the first words on the glossy surface of the blackboard. I turn around to face fresh and excited faces of youngsters for whom this day marks the beginning of a new chapter in their lives. After a hiatus of 18 months, the campus is now abuzz with the nervous first-year students look hither and thither for their classrooms and getting accustomed to the newly acquired time-table; the exuberant second year ones catching up with friends and loitering in the corridors to catch a whiff of the lost year; the complacent third year students with a notch higher experience thronging the cafeteria and other hotspots; the studious ones making a beeline for library counters; the adventurous jostling their way towards the offices of associations and clubs and the lovey-dovey ones looking for hideouts amid the bustling grounds. The cliché distance makes the heart grow fonder could not have sounded sweeter to my ears than now as my eyes fondly scan the faces of students whom I had previously seen only through the camera lens of the laptop. How lively and youthful these faces appear to me as compared to the forlorn ones seen during online classes! I’m amazed at my own reaction as I indulgently smile at the freshers clicking selfies at vantage points on the campus to post on their social media accounts with hashtags claiming ‘My First Day at College’ or ‘College Life is Fun’ or ‘Fun with Besties’. I remember prior to the lockdown, if ever I beheld such a scenario, I would frown upon their insolence and brazenness and at times would not hesitate to remind them that the place is an educational institute and not a tourist spot. The cackling laughter, the uneasy giggles, the boisterous guffaws, the screeching sounds of chairs being pulled in classrooms, the chatter of intellectual groups and the rustic hollering to mates are some of the sounds that infuse a youthful life force into the centurion structures of educational institutions and thus prevent them from crumbling under the external pressures of age and modernisation. It is the sap of youth rushing and gushing into the veins of ancient institutions that nourishes them and helps them sustain the vagaries of time and tide. I walk through the corridors and observe the youngsters, eager to learn and reach out to the skies and say a silent prayer for them. I pray for a safer and healthier future for them. May their future never again be marred by the ugly scars witnessed by the world amid the breakdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. May the world be wholesome again and may the college campus once again be blessed by the ebullience and exhilaration lent by the vigour of youth. sonrok15@gmail.com The writer is an Ambala-based college teacher||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/college-campus-buzzes-back-to-life-with-vigour-of-youth-101634033174739.html

The Delhi government has been raising concerns about shortage of coal at power plants, claiming that only a few days of supply has been left.Today, Jain pointed fingers at the Centre."There is no coal power plant in Delhi. We buy electricity from coal plants situated in other states. NTPC has capped production capacity of all its plants to half. There can be two reasons, first coal shortage or secondly Centre has told them to do it," said Jain."Blackout depends on them. Right now they are giving only half supply, if they stopped giving it then blackout might happen," the Delhi power minister added.Kejriwal had said on Monday that all efforts are being made to address the power crisis and his government does not want any "emergency situation"."The situation is very critical in the entire country. Several chief ministers have written to the Centre about it. All are trying together to improve the situation," Kejriwal said at a press conference.The chief ministers of Punjab and Chhnattisgarh have also flagged the power crisis that might arise in their respective states due to coal shortage in power generation plants.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar was another chief minister who raised concern about power crisis.On Tuesday, the Centre directed the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) and DVC to supply as much power as available to Delhi's power distribution companies (discoms) keeping in view their declared capacity."This will ensure that distribution companies of Delhi will get as much power as requisitioned by them as per their demand," a press release by the central government said.This comes a day after Union home minister Amit Shah chaired a meeting with coal minister Pralhad Joshi and power minister RK Singh and asked them to maintain proper supply of coal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/blackout-might-happen-in-delhi-satyendar-jain-points-fingers-at-centre-101634023536854.html
12-10-2021||Delhi||‘Red light on, gaadi off' initiative to begin from Oct 18: Arvind Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Tuesday that the 'Red light on, gaadi off' initiative will begin in the Capital from October 18 as he asked commuters to practice this on their own right away in another attempt at reducing air pollution levels, which spike in the winter months. The campaign was first launched last year to save fuel and reduce air pollution in the city and was part of the number of measures by the Delhi government to tackle the annual pollution, which begins with an onset of winters in the city. The air quality further plunges into hazardous levels with festivals like Diwali and Dussehra due to the burning of firecrackers.In a virtual press briefing, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader noted that the pollution in the city has started "increasing over the last three to four days" due to the stubble burning in the nearby states. "We had started the 'Red Light on, Gaadi off' initiative last year... As soon as you stop at a red signal, turn down the engines of your vehicle," Kejriwal said.The chief minister also asked commuters to "not take out their vehicle at least once a week" and suggested to travel via Metro, bus, or share a vehicle with others" instead. This way, "pollution can be brought down and fuel can be saved," Kejriwal also said quoting experts. He also asked the city’s residents to download the 'Green Delhi' app, which enables people to register complaints about violations of anti-pollution norms. "If you see pollution anywhere in Delhi—a truck causing air pollution, any industry that's causing pollution, waste being burnt—you can complain through the app. Our team will reach the spot and stop the source of pollution," Kejriwal said.The app was launched in 2020 to combat air pollution.Meanwhile, the Delhi government has imposed a complete ban on the burning of firecrackers. The government-led by the AAP has also prohibited effigy burning ahead of the Dussehra festival on October 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/red-light-on-gaadi-off-initiative-to-begin-from-oct-18-arvind-kejriwal-101634023631709.html

We feel sad that BJP is playing dirty politics over it. BJP has no concern for the lives of the people.Tiwari, former Delhi BJP chief, said, “It’s a festival of faith and should not be politicised. We are meeting all chhath organisations to find out about their preparations. The government’s decision to ban festivities is rather beyond one’s understanding.”Last week, Kejriwal said that the decision has been taken for the welfare and safety of the people, and slammed the BJP for doing ‘dirty politics’. “I have said this earlier also that we want people to celebrate all the festivals. But in Chhath puja, people have to step into the water. If even one Covid infected person enters the water, then the entire water will get infected. It can result in fast spread of the infection. Due to this reason, we have taken this step. I’m sure people will understand this. They will also understand that the opposition is doing dirty politics,” Kejriwal had said.Chhath Puja, a three-day festival, will be celebrated between November 8-10 this year. It is most popular in states such as Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and parts of Madhya Pradesh. There is a significant presence of the Purvanchal community in Delhi.In the past decade, the community has become politically significant as it plays a major role in deciding the election result in several constituencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-bjp-says-will-celebrate-chhath-but-with-covid-protocols-101634000177798.html
12-10-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The family of a labourer||Isn’t Rajesh a man’s name? Rajesh shrugs her shoulders. “My parents named me Rajesh, I don’t know why,” she says sombrely, admitting in a surprised tone that she never thought of asking them the reason.This afternoon Rajesh is assigned by her contractor for a repairing job on a central Delhi avenue. A labourer, she is helping renovate a damaged road divider. The lady always works with her husband in a two-member team. The stubbornly silent Mani Ram is carefully laying out the cement along the surface of the cracked divider, while Rajesh is bringing the cement to him from a pile kept on one side of the divider. She first fills the cement into a giant tray, pours a mug of water into it, and mixes the two into paste. Then she lifts the tray to her head, and walks towards the husband. The couple’s two children—Nandini and Kana—are standing idle near them. It’s afternoon and the sun is uncomfortably warm. The traffic is moderately busy.Rajesh waves towards a child sitting on a pavement across the road. “She’s Ruby, my other daughter.” There are six kids; the other three are in their UP village in Jhansi. “They live with my husband’s parents,” she says, as she hands over the cement tray to Mani Ram. He isn’t uttering a word.The couple lives under a flyover, nearby. They divide their year between Delhi and their village. “In Jhansi, each of us earns R200 daily for an assignment, and in Delhi it is ₹100 more for the same work.”Glancing towards son Kana, Rajesh shakes her head, saying that he hasn’t been enrolled in school yet. Same with Nandini and Ruby. Only her eldest child, a 10-year-old girl back home in the village, goes to school. “She has learnt to make rotis and helps her grandmother with the meals.”Meanwhile, little Nandini is trying to open a packet of biscuits.She blushes uncontrollably when asked about her favourite mithai, and offers the biscuits to her father. And now, a surprise. Mani Ram finally breaks his enigmatic silence, telling the girl, “it’s for you, beta.”The family is likely to stay at the road divider until the day’s end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-family-of-a-labourer-101633999530529.html
12-10-2021||Mumbai||Bandh evokes mixed response across Maharashtra||The Maharashtra bandh (shutdown) call by the Maha Vikas Aghadi government on Monday evoked mixed response with shops and establishments in many districts remaining shut and the local bus services operated by urban bodies remaining unavailable; though local train services in Mumbai Metropolitan Region ran uninterrupted.The Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party and the Congress jointly called for the shutdown to protest against the killing of farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh on October 3.Many trader associations in cities like Mumbai, Pune, Thane and Nashik announced their support to the bandh and retailers organisations such as the Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association in Mumbai, Federation of Trade Association of Pune also extended their support to the shutdown.State transport services remained uninterrupted in the morning, though there were fewer passengers on board, an official said.However, many of the city transport buses remained shut as their employees’ union supported the bandh.Shiv Sena workers blocked national and state highways at Kolhapur and Solapur in the morning, following which some were detained by the police.“This is not a bandh called by the government, but by the ruling parties under Maha Vikas Aghadi. Whether to operate railway or BEST buses has to be decided by their administrations. We expect the people to participate in this on their own as it is in support of farmers and against the rule of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the Centre,” NCP leader and state minister Nawab Malik said on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bandh-evokes-mixed-response-across-maharashtra-101633997893519.html

Mehbooba said that central agencies are after him because of his surname Khan. “It’s a travesty of justice that Muslims are targeted to satiate the sadistic wishes of the BJP’s core vote bank,” Mehbooba Mufti said. She is the first mainstream leader from J&K who has reacted on the arrest of Aryan Khan whose custody has been extended.Calls for united struggle to seek restoration of Article 370The PDP chief also called for a united struggle to seek the restoration of Article 370 and the resolution of the Kashmir issue to end the bloodshed in Jammu and Kashmir and said her voice is “weak” and she cannot do it alone. Mehbooba, who is on a five-day tour of the Chenab valley region, was addressing a party convention at Dak Banglow in Kishtwar, where she was accorded a warm welcome by the party activists and supporters. “I am confident that we will get back Article 370 with interest and also ensure the resolution of the Kashmir issue to end bloodshed in the region.

12-10-2021||Chandigarh||Organic farming attracts Himachal fruit growers||With chemical-free produce selling for as high as ₹100/kg, fruit growers in Himachal Pradesh are increasingly switching to natural farming.  The fruit growers say the switch to natural farming has also brought down their input costs, thereby increasing the profit margin. Theog-based Shakuntala Sharma says, “A trader who saw the ‘natural product’ label on my produce at the local market at Dhamandri instantly bought all my fruits for ₹100 per kilogramme, which is much higher than what was being offered to other growers who had used pesticides on their fruit. Now, buyers turn up at my door. Not only do I sell my fruit for a high price, I also save ₹50,000- 60,000 that was ordinarily spent on pesticides.” Sharma is among the farmers using the Subash Palekar Natural Farming (SPNF) technique, under which cow’s dung, herbs, and local resources are used to increase fertility and keep away pests. Ravinder Chauhan, who grows apples on eight bighas of land, says apples grown through the natural farming technique had fetched him a whooping ₹ 4,200-4,500 per box this year. “The up and downs in the market do not affect me as much as buyers pay me a fixed rate in advance,” he said. The chemical free, low cost and climate resilient SPNF technique is being promoted for agriculture and horticulture crops in Himachal Pradesh through the Prakritik Kheti Khushal Kisan Yojna (PK3Y), launched in 2018. So far, 1,33,056 farmers, including over 12,000 apple farmers, have been practising natural farming in the hill-state over approximately 7,609 hectares of land. Surender Mehta, a fruit grower from Lalpani Dochi village in the Chopal subdivision said traders from Jaipur and Delhi had lifted the product from his orchard and also paid him 10-15% higher than in the local market. His pears sold for ₹150 per kilogramme. PK3Y executive director Dr Rajeshwar Singh Chandel said the state project implementing unit (SPIU) was looking for farmers with innovative marketing models. “This will help us to converge these successful farmer-market linkages with our programme,” he said. As per a government study, the natural farming technique has reduced the cost of apple cultivation by about 56.5%, while the profits are up by 27%. The apple crop grown by natural farming has also fewer occurrences of diseases like scab and marssonina blotch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/organic-farming-attracts-himachal-fruit-growers-101633995310098.html
12-10-2021||Chandigarh||‘Worsening’ J&K security situation has mainstream leaders worried||J&K mainstream leaders have raised concern over the worsening security situation in J&K, especially in Kashmir, in the backdrop of series of civilian killings and other security related incidents.PDP president and former J&K CM Mehbooba Mufti said the situation in J&K has gone from bad to worse. “My fears are compounded by the fact that instead of course correction, the central government will continue its muscular policy to reap political dividends in elections. Case in point being the upcoming UP polls. Ironically, GOI spreads canards that Kashmiri Muslims don’t stand up for minorities here. Truth is that this vicious hateful propaganda suits the BJP’s electoral and prospects.” She said until yesterday, the security grid was completely immersed in organising picnic tours and horseback riding for visiting ministers. “Perhaps these attacks could have been averted if their sole focus wasn’t these ministerial visits and normalcy acrobatics. Everyone here is living in an atmosphere of suppression and fear,” she added. PAGD spokesperson and CPI(M) general secretary MY Tarigami said the current situation is the result of the failure of the policies of the government that have brought J&K to this point. “The responsibility to create a conducive security environment lies with the government of India,” he added. People’s Conference spokesperson Adnan Ashraf said the current environment was a grim reminder of the “changelessness on the security front despite tall claims of the government”. “These are deliberate attempts by the militant organisations to push Kashmir into another cycle of violence and create mistrust between the communities,” he said, adding that there was a dire need to engage the people and those who have successfully dealt with such situations in the past. NC provincial president and former minister Nasir Aslam Wani said that the current situation in Kashmir has got worse security-wise. “Tall claims have been made about the security situation improving in Kashmir or J&K. These claims are completely wrong... The ground reality is completely different in the UT and there is no sense of security among people,” he added. ‘Spike in violence due to Pakistan’s desperation’ Tej Krishan Bhat, general secretary of All State Kashmiri Pandit Conference, said, “Everyone knows the reason behind this spike in selective killings. There is Islamic Jihad, which is on. They don’t want any non-Muslim to settle in Kashmir. And then, development and peace being ensured by the Centre were indigestible to Pakistan. That is the reason soft targets are being killed to create a fear psychosis and do the same what they did to us in 1990.” He said that abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A was one of the reasons as well. President of the J&K Congress, Ghulam Ahmad Mir, said, “The BJP had said everything will be fine after the abrogation of Article 370. Now, when everything is in direct control of home minister Amit Shah, then why the situation is deteriorating?” Mir said that wrong policies, including abrogation of Article 370 and unilateral decisions, were the factors responsible for spike in violence. ‘This government stands fully exposed’Panthers Party leader and former minister Harsh Dev Singh said, “The situation has certainly worsened. We didn’t see such kind of situation in the past. Now civilians are being killed, selective killings are on the rise. Security personnel are being eliminated. This government stands fully exposed.” Shafiq Mir, chairperson of All J&K Panchayat Conference and chairperson, Bufliaz BDC in Poonch, said, “The spike in civilian killings and militant attacks on security forces in the areas which were earlier declared militancy free till 2019 show the true picture. These civilian killings are a matter of great concern and we are worried about the security of panchayat leaders, who have always been soft target for militants in the past.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/worsening-j-k-security-situation-has-mainstream-leaders-worried-101633995190004.html

The government is not ready to talk to the agitating farmers,” she added. Criticising the state government, Pratibha said the Mandi district had high hopes from Jai Ram as the chief minister. “State’s fiscal health is in doldrums. The double engine government has failed at all fronts that too despite the national BJP chief being from Himachal,” she said.

Gupta said chief minister Jai Ram Thakur had raised the issue with the Centre in April last year after which the drug controller had sought extensive data from the manufacturers.Even as one year has passed since the data was submitted, Gupta said, no steps have been taken to resolve the issues facing the pharma industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hp-drug-makers-write-to-pm-to-save-crisis-hit-pharma-industry-101633993929790.html

He said that Congress’ star campaigner in Himachal, Navjot Singh Sidhu, inflicted insult on leader Rahul Gandhi and the party. The situation of the Congress turned worse after he took over reins of the party in Punjab, Jai Ram said. Jai Ram paid tributes to former MP late Ramswaroop Sharma, former MLAs Narendra Bragta from Jubbal-Kotkhai, Sujan Singh Pathania from Fatehpur and Virbhadra Singh from Arki.“Virbhadra Singh was a senior leader of Himachal. He had reached this stage by discharging the responsibilities of a CM, leader of the Opposition, Union minister and others. Last time, he reached the assembly after winning from Arki. Today he is not with us. A lot of development work needs to be done in the Arki assembly constituency. After becoming MLA from here, Virbhadra probably got less time to come here. The way you people expected, he could not come between you due to health,” Jai Ram said. He also praised BJP candidate from Arki Ratan Singh Pal. “People of Arki voted for Virbhadra Singh thinking that he would become the chief minister again, but it did not happen,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hp-bypolls-jai-ram-takes-jibe-at-navjot-sidhu-101633992789649.html

Former Haryana chief minister and leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda and party’s state president Kumari Selja, along with many MLAs, were present in the meeting.The meeting was crucial because only MLAs and other leaders loyal to Hooda had attended his Vipaksh Aapke Smaksh rally in Karnal on Sunday, with leaders from other factions giving the event a miss. Bansal asked the party workers to focus on grassroot-level campaigns and reach out to every voter in the Ellenabad constituency.“The BJP government has failed on all fronts. Common man is facing inflation, unemployment and a rise in crime. Everything is on sale in this country,” he added.Haryana Congress state chief Selja said, “BJP union minister of state’s son and his aides crushed innocent farmers and a journalist in Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh. This BJP government wants to crusade every opposition voice. The Haryana government has failed to procure Bajra and paddy and farmers are paying huge prices for their policies. The youths are disgruntled due to paper leak cases,” she added.Leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the bypoll was necessitated due to Abhay Chautala’s resignation, that was only aimed at gaining political mileage.“We had brought a no-confidence motion against the BJP-JJP government in the state assembly. Instead of standing against the coalition government, Chautala resigned to help them. He had resigned to get political mileage and everyone knows INLD had always helped BJP,” Hooda added.Bharat Singh Beniwal did not attend meetingFormer Darba Kalan MLA Bharat Singh Beniwal, who is upset with the party leadership after the party went with BJP rebel Pawan Beniwal instead of him for the Ellenabad bypoll, did not attend the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-puts-up-united-face-ahead-of-ellenabad-bypolls-101633985348539.html
12-10-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana seeks one-third reduction in its NCR area||Haryana government is pushing for a one-third reduction in its area under the national capital region (NCR). The NCR includes 14 (out of 22) Haryana districts, spread over 25,327 square kilometres. The state has the largest area share of 45.98% in the NCR. In comparison, Uttar Pradesh has 26.92% (eight districts) area share and Rajasthan has 24.41% (two districts). The national capital territory of Delhi accounts for 2.69%. The state government has asked the national capital region planning board (NCRPB) to consider the proposed decrease in its area. The matter will be taken up by chief minister (CM) Manohar Lal Khattar during a meeting with the board, headed by Union minister of state, housing and urban affairs, Hardeep Puri on Tuesday. ‘Inclusion of hinterland not serving any purpose’ Officials said the proposal to reduce the state’s area was prepared keeping in view that the inclusion of areas extending to even far-flung districts like Bhiwani, Charkhi Dadri, Mahendergarh, Jind and Karnal, was not serving any purpose in terms of reducing the urbanisation pressure on the national capital. “Also, the state government feels that restrictions applicable to NCR were difficult to implement in the hinterland included in the NCR,” said an official. ‘Make pollution provisions district specific rather NCR’In fact, CM Khattar had, on September 23, requested Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav to allow implementation of pollution-control provisions as district specified rather than entire NCR-specified because of the difficulties being faced while implementing these provisions. The CM had said that 57% area of Haryana falls under the NCR. Therefore, such provisions should not be implemented for the entire NCR in Haryana. Instead, they should be implemented within the 10-kilometre radius of the national capital territory of Delhi or within the 10-km radius of cities having 10 lakh population or as per the district specified, Khattar had told the union minister. The area reduction proposal The state government’s move to seek a reduction in its area under NCR comes in wake of a draft report prepared by the national capital region planning board (NCRPB) regarding revised delineation of NCR. The Haryana government in July this year proposed a reduction and submitted a different option considering the situation and urbanisation in Haryana for revised delineation of the NCR for approval of the NCR Planning Board. “As per this proposal, the extent of Haryana sub region is likely to be 8,281.60 square kms against the current area of 25,327 square km, subject to verification from revenue record,” said a July 29 communication by director, town and country planning KM Pandurang to NCRPB. Govt outlined new parameters for revised delineation of NCRThe state government’s communication said that for revised delineation of the NCR, the entire area of the state falling within the 50-kilometre buffer from Centre of NCT Delhi as well as the area covered between Kundli-Manesar- Palwal expressway and NCT Delhi (where the KMP Expressway extends beyond this buffer) be covered under NCR. Secondly, the extent of NCR along national highway or expressways be considered with one-kilometre-wide buffer on both sides within the existing NCR along with extension along national highways 44 and 9 up to counter magnet areas of Hisar and Ambala respectively. “As per the proposed parameters, the extent of NCR in Haryana will cover 17 districts and 48 development plans,” said the communication on the proposed reduction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-seeks-one-third-reduction-in-its-ncr-area-101633984808233.html

12-10-2021||Chandigarh||Payment delay worries paddy farmers in Haryana||Having sold 207 quintals of paddy to the government at an MSP of ₹1,960 per quintal, Munish Kumar, a young farmer from Kurukshetra’s Gurhi village, is still unable to clear the dues of his labourers. Reason: He is yet to get the payment from the government.Munish says that he had sold his produce, worth over ₹4 lakh, to the government on October 4. Apart from clearing the labourers’ dues, Munish also need the money urgently for purchasing seeds and fertilisers for the next crop—potato and mustard – but the delay on the end of the government is spelling trouble for him.Jashmer Singh of Kheri Dabdalan village of Kurukshetra also has a similar complaint. He too had sold his produce about a week ago, but there is still no sign of payment.The delay has given farmers and commission agents yet another reason to slam the government’s direct payment method. “Earlier, we used to get money from the arhtiya soon after selling the produce. But the direct payment method has created a problem for us,” says Rishi Pal, a farmer from Karnal’s Indri block. According to government officials, the disbursement of payment is based on a process as it requires verification and matching of gate passes, J-Forms, I Forms, H-Forms, and lifting of the produce from mandis.They claimed that the disbursement has already started and many farmers have already got their payments, adding that it will take some time for the government to clear the dues of the rest as out of the 10.71 lakh MT of paddy procured from farmers till October 1, only 3.87 lakh MT has been lifted.Rajneesh Choudhary, president of the Karnal Arhtiya Association, said thousands of farmers in the district are awaiting their dues against a total of 2.64 lakh MT paddy procured. Asked about the reasons for delay in disbursement of payments, additional chief secretary to Haryana food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department Anurag Rastogi said paddy was brought in much before the purchase started and this created a pressure on the system. He said the process to clear the payments has already been started and it will speed up soon.Last year too, farmers had complained about the delay in payments, prompting chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar to intervene and issue strict directions to officials to ensure timely payment to farmers. He had also directed the headquarter-level officials to ensure that the generation of H-Form, J-Form, Gate Pass and I-Form should be made online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/payment-delay-worries-paddy-farmers-in-haryana-101633984269470.html

This was discussed in an emergency meeting of IMA Punjab held in Ludhiana on Sunday, which was attended by more than 300 doctors from different parts of the state. Accusing the state government and SBI General Insurance company of depriving the public of quality medical services by reserving 194 treatments only for government hospitals, the members warned of ‘mass quitting’ the scheme.The members alleged SBI General Insurance was harassing the private medical facilities through different means — by delaying claim settlements, conducting inspections by BAMS/BDS/BHMS and then issuing show-cause notices, deducting or rejecting claims on “flimsy” grounds. Association’s honorary secretary Dr Ashish Ohri said there should be transparency in the scheme and if the government wants to reserve certain treatments for government hospitals, then the information should be shared with the public. “People accuse private hospitals of not giving benefits to them under the scheme. The government should not reserve any package/treatment so that everyone can have access to medical facilities at private hospitals,” he said. Patron and former Punjab IMA president Dr Manoj Sobti meetings were held with the state government and former health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu in the past, but to no avail. “A delegation of IMA members is expected to have a meeting with deputy chief minister OP Soni on Tuesday and if the government fails to resolve the issues, we will be left with no other option but to go for quit the scheme en masse,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/alleging-harassment-ima-punjab-members-threaten-to-quit-health-insurance-scheme-101633983495856.html

12-10-2021||Chandigarh||Bajra procurement proving to be a double-edged sword for Haryana government||Encouraging farmers to cultivate Bajra, one of the crops at the heart of Haryana’s crop diversification drive, and procuring this kharif crop under the minimum support price (MSP) has started putting the Manohar Lal Khattar-led Bharatiya Janata Party-Jannayak Janta Party government in a catch-22 situation. Last year, Haryana government paid ₹2,150 MSP per quintal and procured 7.66 lakh metric tonne (MT) bajra, up from 3.10 lakh MT in 2019 and over 1.18 lakh MT in 2018. As a result of this push to promote bajra in the last four years, the area under cultivation of this millet has increased manifold in the state. For example, from over 4 lakh hectare under bajra cultivation in 2018, the area under this crop has increased to around 5.70 lakh hectare this season. Similarly, Haryana produced about 13.50 lakh MT bajra last year against 12 lakh MT in 2019 and nearly nine lakh MT in 2018, according to official data. Haryana prides itself as the only state in the country where the government procures bajra under MSP. In his budget speech, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had set the target of procuring 7 lakh MT bajra, at an MSP of ₹2,250 per quintal, during the current procurement season that began on October 1 and will continue till November 15. Asked if the state government has fixed any target to procure bajra, Anurag Rastogi, additional chief secretary (ACS, food, civil supplies and consumer affairs), said: “No target has been fixed, but the purchase (by the government) will take place for price stability.” Bajra is grown in southern rain-fed parts of Haryana, and it is considered a good alternative of paddy. Groundwater table of Haryana has been dipping to alarming levels and paddy cultivation, among other reasons, is largely blamed for this. In a bid to persuade farmers to switch over to alternative crops in place of water-guzzler paddy, Haryana government has linked cultivation of more varieties of pulses and cereals with the financial-incentive driven crop-diversification drive. High input, low yield for govt Government sources say the push for Bajra cultivation and its procurement under MSP is turning out to be a double-edged weapon for the government. While the shelf life of bajra is short and it is susceptible to pest attack, its demand and consumption is limited within the state. And to clear the stocks, government included bajra in the public distribution system (PDS). Sources say of a total 7.66 lakh MT bajra was procured in the 2020 kharif season, about 1.50 lakh MT was distributed through PDS. “The government auctioned the procured bajra at a rate ranging from ₹1,250 to ₹1,350 despite procuring it at ₹2,150 per quintal,” an official said. As per rough estimates of the agriculture department, the government had to bear a loss of nearly ₹850 crore last year on account of distress sale of bajra, which is also used as feed in poultry farms, officials involved in Bajra procurement said. They said the rise in bajra production and the government’s decision to give assured price is turning out to be a drain on the state resources. Yet another problem is that of bajra being cultivated in Punjab and Rajasthan where it is not procured under MSP. “Due to the yet-to-be fixed loopholes in Meri Fasal Mera Bayora portal and e-kharid system, private traders from other states manage to sell bajra on MSP in Haryana with the help of local farmers, ahrtiyas and mandi officials and the production last year crossed the targets of the government,” said a senior official of the agriculture department. Why crop is part of Bhavantar Bharpayee Yojana this timeIt is in this backdrop, sources say, that the state government opted to include bajra in the ‘Bhavantar Bharpayee Yojana’ from this kharif season. The decision has come in for a lot of flak from the farmers and opposition parties. The Congress has dubbed the move as an excuse to invite private players, while apprehensive farmers are keeping their fingers crossed due to a dip in the price in open market. “The government is shying away from procuring bajra and wants to deprive farmers from their right of MSP. The Bhavantar Bharpayee policy has already failed to benefit vegetable growers. It’s not going to help Bajra growers,” Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader said. As farmers are complaining about fall in the prices up to ₹1,300 per quintal, the government says it will pay farmers the difference in price up to ₹600 per quintal on average of the yield. But this difference in price (average market price and MSP) of bajra will be paid after verification of crops of registered farmers on the ‘Meri Fasal, Mera Byora’ portal. If the given details are found correct, farmers will be given ₹600 per quintal on the average yield. In kharif season 2021, 2.71 lakh farmers have registered on the ‘Meri Fasal, Mera Byora’ portal for bajra. “Everybody knows the market prices are around ₹1,200 to ₹1,300 against ₹2,250 MSP. How will ₹600 per quintal compensate the difference of ₹1,000. This is a conspiracy to end the MSP,” said Randeep Singh Surjewala, AICC general secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bajra-procurement-proving-to-be-a-double-edged-sword-for-haryana-government-101633983188102.html

On August 7, Middukhera was shot dead by two men while he was entering his SUV after visiting a property dealer in Sector 71. He had sustained 12 bullet injuries. The same day, the Davinder Bambiha gang had claimed responsibility for the murder through a Facebook post. On September 22, the police claimed to have identified the two assailants: Sajjan, alias Bholu, from Jhajjar, Haryana, and Anil Kumar from Dwarka in Delhi. They are among most-wanted gangsters in the region. Their involvement in the broad daylight murder was revealed by gangster Kaushal Chaudhary, who was brought on production warrants from the Karnal jail. According to police, Gaurav Patial, alias Lucky, who is running the Bambiha gang from Armenia, had conspired to kill Middukhera with the help of Chaudhary and Amit Dagar, who are both lodged in jails.Sajjan and Anil had orchestrated the crime on Dagar’s instructions, it was revealed.Senior superintendent of police (SSP), Mohali, Navjot Singh Mahal said: “We are on it and hopeful of arresting the accused soon.” Another senior police officer said that teams have been dispatched for their arrest, following which the motive behind Middukhera’s murder will be revealed.

A letter in this regard was handed over to a firm by mayor Amarjit Singh Sidhu on Monday. The mayor said various roundabouts in Mohali had already been allotted for maintenance to private companies, who in return get to place their advertisements. A set of rules had also been made in this regard. Sidhu said the condition of triangles in Mohali near traffic lights was deteriorating and there were some hurdles in their maintenance. Even contractors who take advertising contracts in Mohali do not maintain these locations. Similarly, due to the non-maintenance of centre verges, they have to be handed over to contractors at extra cost to the corporation. He said the company maintaining these centre verges and triangles would not be able to place advertisements larger than the prescribed size which would make uniform advertisements appear all over Mohali and would also enhance the beautification of the city. He said the municipal corporation was paying special attention to beautify the entry points to the city and the maintenance of the triangles and centre verges adjacent to the traffic lights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/private-firms-to-maintain-road-dividers-in-mohali-101633983013370.html

The department has approved all other agenda items passed in the House meeting on August 26 this year, but has not given its nod to the agenda pertaining to the hike, stating that it is a policy matter concerning all civic bodies.Constituency allowance is given to councillors in lieu of the amount spent by them on telephone and mobile bills, fuel and hospitality. The House had hiked the monthly allowance of the mayor from ₹30,000 to ₹48,000. For the senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor, the hike was from ₹24,000 to ₹40,000 and from ₹18,750 to ₹32,750, respectively. Councillors were to be paid ₹25,000 instead of ₹15,000.The mayor and his deputies are also paid an honorarium of ₹15,000 each, while councillors get ₹2,000 each. It is a voluntary payment given to a councillor for services delivered.Harjeet Singh, superintendent, local bodies department, who is dealing with the matter, said: “We cannot allow the hike for Mohali alone, as it is a policy matter. If it is taken up, it will be for entire Punjab.”While MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said that he has not received any communication in this regard from the local bodies department, mayor Amarjit Singh Sidhu said he will take up the matter with the authority concerned and push for the hike.“The decision was taken in the wake of price rise. It was a long-pending demand of councillors,” said the mayor, adding that the allowance had not been hiked since the MC was formed in 2010.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-mayor-councillors-allowance-hike-put-on-hold-101633983012326.html

On Monday, Mandeep made the supreme sacrifice fighting militants in Jammu and Kashmir’s Poonch district. It came as a rude shock to the family and the residents of his native Chatha Seerha village in Gurdaspur district where he was with them till recently. Mandeep was home to meet his newborn second son. The news of his death was devastating to his wife Mandeep Kaur, who is still on bed rest since the delivery of the son, as well as his widowed mother Manjit Kaur. “Though my son has left this world, I am proud of him for sacrificing his life fighting for the country. Of course, it is an irreparable loss to our family...we were waiting for his birthday…but this happened,” said the mother, trying her best to look composed. As the news spread, Mandeep’s house was burgeoning with mourners gathered from far and near. His cousin brothers Gurmukh Singh and Gurwinder Singh said, “Mandeep was very good in football and basketball before he joined the army around 10 years ago. Amid a big loss, his supreme sacrifice has filled us with pride. His brother Jagroop Singh is also serving in the army, and another one works in Qatar.” “A few days ago, he made a video call when he was climbing some mountain. He said there was no memorial after a martyr in the village and it should be there. We did not know that we will have to build one in his memory,” they added. The body will reach the village on Tuesday for the funeral.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/poonch-gunbattle-naik-mandeep-singh-left-to-join-duty-in-j-k-only-a-week-ago-after-vacation-101633982888029.html

Typically, heavy traffic jams are seen the city, especially in the main markets such as Model Town, Chaura Bazaar, Ghumar Mandi, Daresi, and Dugri market among other areas during the festive season. However, with Dussehra just round the corner, markets areas are already congested and the fairs across the city have added to the melee, especially at Daresi, and the Chandigarh Road. Punjab Road Safety Council member Rahul Verma said dealing with traffic was not just the duty of the traffic police, but also of the civic body and other developmental agencies. “So far, the GLADA and LIT have failed to step up. The sites were identified by the police and a drone survey was carried out for the purpose. However, now other departments need to make the facility functional. LIT chairman Raman Balasubramaniam said, “In-principle approval was given to the police department for using LIT’s vacant sites such as the complex on the Rani Jhansi Road and the parking space near Orient Cinema among others, for establishing temporary parking lots. The police department and administration is yet to take a decision regarding how to operate the lots and a decision will be taken in the coming days.”Verma said vacant sites had been identified in and around the busy markets in different parts of the city, including the vacant land of the Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (GLADA) opposite the mini secretariat, the BL Kapur Memorial hospital in Daresi, vacant GLADA land near Old Session Chowk, the site behind the civil hospital, vacant LIT land near Feroze Gandhi market, vacant land behind the bus stand, a vacant LIT complex on Rani Jhansi Road, the LIT parking near Orient Cinema, and vacant land near Mohini Resort on Chandigarh Road among others.Work to clear the land had also been initiated in mid-September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/expect-traffic-snarls-in-festive-season-as-plan-for-temporary-parkings-fails-to-take-off-in-ludhiana-101633982168196.html

The latest crisis has hit the industry at a time when the festive season, which is when most sales take place, is just around the corner. Industrialists say they will lose crores if the crisis worsens. Stakeholders say small industries, which had not quite recovered from the losses suffered during pandemic, will not be able to survive any more setbacks and may have to shut down for good. No lessons learnt from July: StakeholdersLambasting the Union and state governments, industrial representatives said the Union and state governments had failed to coordinate with each other and had learnt nothing from the power crisis witnessed in July. Federation of Punjab Small Industries Association (FOPSIA) president Badish Jindal said, “The Union government says there will be no shortage of coal supply, but the state government is unable to supply power. Unscheduled power cuts are already interrupting operations. Since the power cuts are unscheduled, the labourers sit idle and the factory owners have to pay them for their time.” “The steel and plastic units are worst affected as they need continuous power supply. We were hoping to recover losses during the festive season, but the crisis has hit us at an importunate time,” he said. The power supply had remained suspended for around 10 days due to the power crisis in July and the industry had to observe weekly offs. “The industry collectively suffers a daily loss of around ₹500 crore, if operations are suspended, but the government continues to adopt a lackadaisical approach towards the problems,” said Jindal, adding that if the power cuts continue the export business will be next to be hit. General Secretary of Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) Pankaj Sharma said the industry is already moving through a slump due to the pandemic, bandhs and shutdown calls given by various trade and non-trade groups along with disruptions in power supply. “Lack of government support in upgrading infrastructure and higher rates of bank interest has crippled the industry and around 25% of the MSME ( Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) industry has shutdown in the last two years.”Members of the Janta Nagar Small Scale Manufacturers Association led by president Jaswinder Thukral also met with Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) Ludhiana chief engineer Bhupinder Khosla on Monday and sought an immediate solution. Can’t run generators due to high price of diesel Ludhiana Woollen Manufacturers Association and Knitwear Club president Darshan Dawar said it was the peak season for the hosiery industry. “Last year, too, business had been affected due to Covid and now again an unprecedented crises looms over the industry. It is unviable for the industry to run its operations on generators due to skyrocketing prices of diesel,” said Dawar.United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA) general secretary Manjinder Sachdeva said there was a need to shift from thermal energy to hydro, nuclear or wind energy. “The state government also needs to step up and provide an uninterrupted power supply. They could also purchase power from other states.” Resolve power issue within 3 days: Beopar Mandal issues ultimatum Taking issue with unscheduled power cuts, traders affiliated with the Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal staged a protest against the PSPCL in the Chaura Bazar area on Monday and said they will gherao the homes of MPs and MLAs if the issue was not resolved within three days. State general secretary, Sunil Mehra criticised the state government for failing to inform the industry about the power crisis in advance. “It is anticipated that the industry and trade in the state will suffer a loss of around ₹50,000 crore on a daily basis due to the prolonged power cuts.” PSPCL, Ludhiana chief engineer Bhupinder Khosla said it is likely that the supply may remain affected for a few more days. “The Union and the state government are working to end the crisis. There is no problem with the distribution network, but the supply has reduced due to the nationwide crisis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-yet-another-setback-coal-crisis-saps-ludhiana-industry-s-energy-in-festive-season-101633981809363.html

Rajendra Shende, president, TERRE Policy Centre and Ravindrasinh Pardeshi, principal, Fergusson college were also present at the occasion.Fergusson college has already made changes to bring back copperware bottles and steel glasses for water. “We believe that if the administration makes the change, it won’t be long before the students follow. We will only allow students to bring their own water bottles that are re-usable; the same applies to plastic bags. We are in the process of training our staff and creating awareness about the problems associated with single-use plastic,” Pardeshi said.Frydenlund said, “We are here to draw inspiration because we need to see and be part of the local action against pollution which we can then follow. These guidelines about a campus free of single-use plastic will be followed at our Delhi embassy as well. Pollution due to plastic is increasing which is a threat to the environment and initiatives to reduce use of plastic are the need of the hour. A long-term strategy is necessary to take care of our oceans, for which Norway will work together with India to find solutions.”Solheim while addressing the students, said, “We need single-use plastic-free campuses to conserve nature for there is an ecological crisis on Earth.

12-10-2021||Dehradun||Our reply to BJP, says Uttarakhand Cong leader who piloted Yashpal Arya return||DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand’s leader of opposition Pritam Singh, who is being credited with playing a crucial role in persuading Yashpal Arya and son Sanjeev to return to the Congress, said it was important to respond to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which recently inducted three legislators including one from the Congress.Yashpal Arya, 69, who crossed over to the BJP with his son ahead of the 2017 elections, rejoined the Congress on Monday at an event in national capital Delhi. As he thanked the Congress leadership for letting him return, Arya, a prominent Dalit leader in Uttarakhand politics, called it his ‘ghar wapsi’, or ‘homecoming’.“It was important to give a reply to the BJP after it had started the defection game in last few days by facilitating the joining of three MLAs including one of Congress,” said Pritam Singh.“We don’t promote this defection politics but the BJP started it and was boasting about it, so it was important to reply to them,” Singh added.Congress leaders, however, insisted that the talks between Yashpal Arya and some Congress leaders including Pritam Singh had been on for the last few months.Arya, a six-time lawmaker who led the Uttarakhand Congress between 2007 and 2014, had also been in touch with Rahul Gandhi.A Congress leader said Yashpal Arya, who was feeling stifled and ignored in the BJP, was apprehensive about how senior party leader Harish Rawat, with whom he had differences in the past and contributed to his decision to quit the party in 2017, would take to his return. He was repeatedly reassured that this would not present a problem.At the public event in Delhi, Congress general secretary and former chief minister Rawat said they felt pain when Arya left the Congress for some reason in 2017. He is today joining back at a time when the party is fighting several challenges, he said.People familiar with the development said the timing of Yashpal Arya’s induction was decided by the central leadership. On Monday, Harish Rawat and state unit president Ganesh Godiyal took the first flight to Delhi for the induction event.Congress leaders said Pritam Singh had reached out to a third BJP legislator from Dehradun district also and he was expected to join the Congress on Monday. But BJP Rajya Sabha member and party national media in-charge Anil Baluni heard about it and was able to persuade him to stay put in the BJP.Political commentator SMA Kazmi said Singh’s success in getting Arya back in the party is set to help him raise his stature in the party. “Singh, who was considered to be in the faction of the deceased former leader of Opposition Indira Hridayesh, had become weak after her demise in front of Rawat against whom he had differences which are open to all,” Kazmi said.The BJP rejected suggestions that Arya had been sidelined in the party. “He was given all the respect in BJP...The evidence is the fact that he was made a cabinet minister in our government with several important departments. Even after that, if he had to leave, then the reason is only known to him,” said BJP Uttarakhand president Madan Kaushik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/our-reply-to-bjp-says-uttarakhand-cong-leader-who-piloted-yashpal-arya-return-101633981447858.html
12-10-2021||Chandigarh||6 years since Bargari sacrilege, SIT probe revolves around local dera followers, Ram Rahim yet to be grilled||Even as it has been six years since the Bargari sacrilege incident took place in Faridkot district, the probe of Punjab Police’s special investigation team (SIT) has remained limited to the local Dera Sacha Sauda followers, who allegedly carried out the desecration, and it is still to question Sirsa-based sect head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh. Torn pages of a bir (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib were found scattered at Bargari village on October 12, 2015. The accused men, who were purportedly in direct link with the sect headquarters for hatching the conspiracy, are either absconding or have died. An official privy to the investigation said that in the absence of evidence linking the “chain of command”, the questioning of the dera chief will not be really helpful as the go-between must be quizzed first to unravel the sequence of events. The three absconding members of the dera’s national committee —Pardeep Kler, Harsh Dhuri and Sandeep Breta— remain untraced after they were named as accused in 2018 in the Moga sacrilege case. The SIT claims that the instructions to execute sacrilege at Bargari, Moga and Gurusar were given by the three to the district dera committee members. On Monday (October 11), the SIT told the court that Kler, Dhuri and Breta have not been traced and no record of any property on their name was found. The main accused in the Bargari sacrilege case —Mohinder Pal Singh Bittu — was killed in the Nabha jail in 2019. The SIT probe claimed that Bittu was in a direct link with the dera headquarters and received instructions to carry out sacrilege from the sect. “But it will be difficult for the SIT to establish this link on the basis of his statements in the court after his death,” said a lawyer linked with the case. The then Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party (SAD-BJP) government had handed over the probe into the three sacrilege incidents to the CBI on October 26, 2015. In July 2019, the central agency filed a closure report in the three sacrilege cases but withdrew it later to reinvestigate the matter. The Congress government, led by Captain Amarinder Singh, however, challenged the CBI move and took back the cases and handed over the probe to the SIT-led by then inspector general of police (IGP) Ranbir Singh Khattra in April 2020. In July 2020, the Khatra-led SIT filed a chargesheet in the court naming dera head Ram Rahim Singh as an accused in a case of theft of a ‘bir’ from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village on June 1, 2015. The SIT claimed that Bittu in his statement confessed that the dera head had ordered execution of sacrilege. However, the proceedings were stayed by the Punjab and Haryana high court ordering the state government to appoint a new SIT head. The HC also directed the police to take into account evidence collected by the CBI and file a supplementary challan. IGP SPS Parmar was appointed the new chief of SIT in February this year. The Parmar-led SIT arrested six dera followers for Bargari sacrilege in May this year and filed a chargesheet against them, naming Kler, Dhuri and Breta, who have been declared proclaimed offenders, as conspirators. The SIT, which received documents from the CBI eight months ago, is yet to file a supplementary chargesheet in the bir theft case. Also, the chargesheets filed by by Parmar-led SIT says that the dera suggested carrying out of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib to avenge insult of the sect head. But the chargesheets filed in both the FIRs do not have any mention of the dera head’s role in the episode. Besides, the SIT has not visited the dera headquarters or questioned any top sect member yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/6-years-since-bargari-sacrilege-sit-probe-revolves-around-local-dera-followers-ram-rahim-yet-to-be-grilled-101633981207865.html

In her complaint to the police, Meena, a resident of Mauli Jagran, said she and her neighbours, Parbha and Raj Kumari, were on their way to Raipur Kalan to feed flour to ants on Sunday. As part of the belief, people feed flour to ants for the fulfilment of their wishes. She said they were on their way to Raipur Kalan when they saw two men sitting under a tree and chanting mantras. The men tricked the women into believing that they had special powers by making a person unconscious, which the women thought had died, and then bringing him back to life. The duo told the women that they would perform a ritual to rid them of their problems and at the same time, it would bring good luck to their families. The men told them to keep their jewellery and purse under the tree and handed them a paper with something scribbled on it and asked the women to throw the same in the nearby forest. When the women came back, they found the accused had fled with their money and jewellery. A case under Section 420 of the IPC has been registered at the Mauli Jagran police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/two-men-posing-as-sadhus-dupe-three-women-of-jewellery-cash-101633981027919.html
12-10-2021||Chandigarh||Cuts in coal inventory cost Punjab power utility ₹250 crore in just 10 days||In a bid to save money by cutting down its coal inventory, the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has burnt a big hole in its own pocket as it ended up spending a whopping ₹250 crore in the first 10 days of October to buy electricity from the national grid to meet rising power demand. The average per unit rate of power purchased is ₹9.5 per, which is almost double the annual purchase cost. The average cost of power purchase per unit is ₹4.14 for the present fiscal. With the state going to the polls early next year, the Punjab government has asked the corporation to ensure maximum supplies of electricity and bring down power cuts.On Monday, the PSPCL procured 1,500 megawatt (MW) power at ₹14.46 per unit to cater to demand of the agriculture sector as farmer unions have started protests against the corporation for its failure to supply electricity for irrigating late-sown paddy verities like basmati. In October so far, the state purchased nearly 25 crore units with the purchase bill already touching ₹250 crore due to the PSPCL management’s failure to ensure coal stocks as per the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) guidelines.In May this year, the management had decided not to maintain coal stocks as per the previous years’ trends and brought down reserves to 23 days against the usual 35 days or more. This was done to save ₹40-50 crore. The private plants maintain minimum stock so as to save money on coal inventory. PSPCL chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) A Venu Prasad said the coal stocks are still critical as only 12 rakes of fuel were received on Sunday against daily requirement of 22 rakes. “Presently, all private coal-based plants in the state have less than 2 days of stock while the state-owned plants have below 4 days of reserves. The plants are still operating at 50% capacity. We hope that power availability will improve in the next couple of days as an additional 400 MW power is likely to be received. One more unit of the Ropar plant will start generating power from Tuesday,” he said. Moreover, 50MW generation also started Monday at the Anandpur Sahib hydel project and it will be increased to 100 MW shortly, the CMD said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cuts-in-coal-inventory-cost-punjab-power-utility-rs-250-crore-in-just-10-days-101633980789083.html

In 2020-21 kharif season, Punjab had produced about 50 lakh quintals of raw cotton and Bathinda had led with 14 lakh quintals. With 11.79 lakh quintals, Mansa was the third cotton-producing district. But the official assessment hints at a highly disappointing season for farmers this year with a drastic fall of production mainly in the two districts.District authorities are compiling detailed reports for submission to the state government for its consideration of announcing compensation to affected cotton growers.Mansa deputy commissioner Mohinder Pal said according to crop loss assessment dispatched on Monday evening, 76-100% cotton was found damaged in all three subdivisions.“Our teams extensively examined the fields to assess crop loss. Impact of pink bollworm was found severe in the entire district,” he said.Chief agriculture office of Bathinda Manjit Singh more than 70% ready-to-harvest was found damaged in the district.Bathinda DC Arvind Pal Sandhu said it will take another two days to submit a report to the state government.DC of Fazilka, another major cotton producer of Punjab, Babita Kaler said no input of the pink bollworm attack was reported in the district till Monday.Some pockets of villages in Lambi and Gidderbaha in Muktsar and parts of Sangrur district were also spotted with the pest.Cotton is an economic lifeline of the semi-arid region of southern Punjab where it is a traditional kharif crop.Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ughrahan) is spearheading an agitation demanding a compensation of ₹60,000 per acre to cotton-growers and ₹30,000 to farm labourers as the pest attack has hit the rural economy of the cotton belt.Since October 5, they have been holding an indefinite dharna outside the residence of state finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal at Muktsar’s Badal village.Farm experts say other major cotton growing states, such as Karnataka and Maharashtra, have been reporting PBW over large areas since 2015, it is for the first time that Punjab faced a pest attack of this magnitude.Officials of the state agriculture department said PBW attack was first spotted in Bathinda’s Jodhpur Romana village in 2018. Owing to poor farm practices, the unchecked population of the pest expanded in Bathinda and the adjoining district of Mansa.Also, the pest attack is attributed to PBW infestation in the adjoining state of Haryana where 9 cotton-growing districts faced attack this season.SK Verma, head of Sirsa-based Central Institute for Cotton Research, said stakeholders need to join hands ahead of the next sowing season to tackle the issues related to cotton production in a holistic way.“Cotton growers should ensure that fields are cleared of the residue and up to 20 pheromone traps should be set up in an acre to detect a population of the deadly pest,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pink-bollworm-infestation-girdawri-indicates-70-100-crop-loss-in-bathinda-mansa-101633980787910.html

Also, a large number of farmers had burnt paddy straw in protest (against farm laws) last year,” he said.Though stubble burning has increased since October 6, the daily number is still low as compared to 2020, Sehgal added.The IARI scientist said the states recorded a gradual decrease in paddy straw burning from 2016 to 2019 and the spike last year can be attributed to farmers’ protest.“We don’t expect to do better than 2019, but we hope the number will be less than last year,” he added.Punjab had recorded 1.02 lakh incidents of stubble burning in 2016. The number decreased to 67,079 in 2017; 59,684 in 2018 and 50,738 in 2019 from October 1 to November 30. The state logged 79,093 such incidents last year, according to the IARI.Haryana saw 15,686 farm fires in 2016; 13,085 in 2017; 9,225 in 2018; 6,364 in 2019 and 5,678 in 2020.Punjab and Haryana attract attention during the paddy harvesting season in October and November.Farmers set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue before cultivating wheat and potato. It is one of the main reasons for the alarming spike in pollution in Delhi-NCR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/iari-data-shows-spike-in-farm-fires-post-monsoon-in-punjab-haryana-situation-better-than-last-year-101633980489073.html

12-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM Channi launches ‘Mera Ghar Mere Naam’ scheme to give proprietary rights to those living in ‘lal dora’||Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Monday announced the ‘Mera Ghar Mere Naam’ (my house in my name) scheme to give proprietary rights to people living in ‘lal dora’ of villages and towns for generations. The scheme, seen as populist as the state will go to the assembly elections in four months, is a rechristened version of the ‘Mission Lal Laqir’ , an extension of the central government’s Swamitav (Survey of villages and mapping with improvised technology in village areas) scheme. Earlier, dwellers inside the ‘lal dora’ did not have ownership rights and they could not sell these properties. The decision was taken in a cabinet meeting chaired by the CM. The scheme, an official said, will also be applicable to towns which were upgraded to notified area committees (nagar panchayats) and further to municipal councils, but still have the lal dora system. “We want to see results and have shortened the grievances redressal timeframe,” Channi told mediapersons after the meeting. Soon after taking charges as CM, Channi had ordered to include Ropar district, which includes his constituency Chamkaur Sahib, under the ‘Mission Lal Laqir’ scheme.Last year, the ‘Mission Lal Laqir’scheme was started in Gurdaspur district and is now will be extended to 5 more districts. So far, drone survey has been done in 350 villages of Gurdaspur and maps of 20 villages have been verified and sent to the Survey of India and the National Mapping Agency (NMA). The state revenue department has constituted a steering committee led by chief secretary with district-level monitoring panels headed by the deputy commissioners with sub-divisional magistrates as member for grievance redrassal. Other announcements The CM later announced that the government will soon bring a legislation in the Vidhan Sabha to protect properties owned by NRIs settled abroad.

He said arrears in the last bill received by the consumer would be waived. Channi said he had taken up the coal shortage issue with the Union ministry of coal so that there is no power crisis. “My government won’t let the state to plunge into darkness despite scarcity of coal. No intentional power cuts would be imposed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjabcm-channi-launches-mera-ghar-mere-naam-scheme-to-give-proprietary-rights-to-those-living-in-lal-dora-101633980431473.html

Although the panel was formed last year to chalk out the modalities, project implementation is still pending on campus.In May 2016, the Chandigarh administration had also issued a notification making the installation of rooftop solar power plants mandatory for residential and non-residential buildings in the city.Last year, a PU panel had resolved that the capital expenditure (CAPEX) model will be used in the buildings of the University Institute of Engineering (UIET) initially and then at the dental college on south campus.The panel had also recommended that for other solar power projects, the renewable energy service company (RESCO) model be used in the remaining buildings of PU campus through approved vendors by SECI. However, no further action was taken after this.As per the budget estimates of 2021-22, the expenditure on electricity and water charges at PU are pegged at ₹9.96 crore.A new committee was formed this year for the implementation of a solar power project at PU. As per the notice issued by the varsity, a meeting was again fixed in August this year but it was not held. The meeting notice stated that the implementation of the solar power project was “over delayed” and the recommendation made by the previous committee did not give any information on the tentative cost of the project on CAPEX model for UIET and dental institute.It also stated that there should not be any further delay in the implementation of the project. University officials, however, did not comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pu-solar-power-project-still-to-see-light-of-day-101633979947815.html

12-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh to see another year of low-key Dussehra||With Covid situation gradually improving, many organising committees are holding Ramlila this year. However, citing strict restrictions in place, a few organisations are either refraining from or holding a low-key Dussehra celebration.The Sector-46 Ramlila association has been using the mandi ground in Sector-46 for the celebrations every year. However, this year instead of holding any function, they will just put up a symbolic effigy of Ravana. General secretary of the association Sushil Kumar said, “We can’t restrict the total number of people to 300 here as per the administration’s instructions. Further, we were made to sign an undertaking to take responsibility in case of any breaches. Therefore, we won’t take any chance.”Members of the Panjab university Ramlila committee also cited the same problem and said they would not burn the effigies on Dussehra this time. One of the organisers of the committee, Deepak Kaushik, said, “The administration should be more flexible with restrictions when it comes to such celebrations. When it comes to political protests in the city, Covid norms are flouted.”Various Ramlila associations said due to the delay in getting permission for making effigies, now they were facing problems in finding artists. Ashok Choudhary, senior vice-president, Sector-20 Ramlila, said, “We’ve to pay artists more for designing effigies this year because of the delayed permission.”Tejinder Chauhan, an effigy maker from Barara, who had made the city’s tallest (221 ft) Ravana in 2019, will not come to the city this time.“It takes three to four months to design an effigy and the permission came late this time. I am making a small effigy in my hometown and hope to come to Chandigarh the next year after things improve,” he said.One of the artists, Hader Ali of Kalka, said they had taken only ₹1,000 in advance, but still were making effigies for the sake of the festival.The OCF Sanskritik Manch in Sector 29-C has not hired professional artists this time. Instead, four children from the locality have been making the effigies for them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-to-see-another-year-of-low-key-dussehra-101633979468031.html

12-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC elections: Parties begin shortlisting candidates||While waiting for the State Election Commission to notify the reserve wards, the political parties have started the process of identifying prospective candidates for the upcoming municipal corporation (MC) elections.While the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) claim to have shortlisted around 200 candidates for the 35 seats, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has started conducting surveys for the purpose.The MC elections are due in December, and election code of conduct is expected to be declared in mid-November. In the last MC elections, there were 26 wards, which have been increased to 35 owing to the addition of 13 new villages under the MC jurisdiction.Criticising the “delay” in the notification of the reserve wards, Congress city chief Subhash Chawla said, “The shortlisting of the candidates has been done after initial survey of the wards. Around 200 candidates have been shortlisted. But we can proceed with the final selection of candidates only when we know which wards are reserved for women and for candidates of the scheduled castes category.”The initial assessment of the candidates has been done by AAP too. Chander Mukhi Sharma, in-charge of the campaign committee, said, “For every seat we have five to six candidates shortlisted. But the final survey for the seat will commence only after the reserve wards are notified.”The BJP, though, is yet to prepare the list of candidates, the party surveys of wards have started. “The party will carry out surveys for the candidates at a later stage. But a survey of wards has started,” said Arun Sood, BJP state president.The suitable candidateLocked in a three-cornered fight for the MC House, parties realise the winning margins are likely to be narrower this time around, and the choice of candidate becomes even more crucial.Winnability, ideology, loyalty to party and past performance are some of the factors which all the parties are focusing on for selecting their candidates.For the ruling BJP party, the process of ticket allotment must go through several phases and levels. “Factors like popularity in the area, commitment to the party, and candidate’s character will be considered before the selection of candidates. The multiple surveys, conducted by local units and the national level on different aspects at the ground level, play a crucial role in the selection of the candidates,” said Sood.BJP has 20 councillors in the current MC House.Most of the current Congress councillors are likely to be retained. “In addition to the existing councillors, candidates who lost the last elections with narrow margins and have worked dedicatedly for the party are also frontrunners for getting the party ticket,” said Chawla.The Congress has five councilors in the current House of 26.“For around 15 seats we are planning to bring in fresh faces. These candidates can even be from outside the party. Army veterans, reputed people from other fields will also be considered for Congress ticket,” added Chawla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-elections-parties-begin-shortlisting-candidates-101633979047934.html

Last year, Ramlila Committee, Daresi ground, did not get permission to organise the same due to the outspread of Covid. Instead of burning the effigies of Khardushan, Kumbhkaran, Meghnath, and Ravana in chronological order on separate days, the committee had only set Ravana’s effigy on fire.This year, the residents will also get to see all four effigies burn on the designated days.“Ramlila has been held here in the same fashion for around hundreds of years. While three effigies are burnt together on the same day at other venues, we burn four of them in sequential order on separate days,” said Subhash Gupta, a member of Ramlila Committee, Daresi ground.He added that last year was a disappointment for the locals and the committee members as only Ravana’s effigy was burnt then.“As the pandemic is less dominant now, we have ordered the craftsmen to make the Ravana effigy of around 95-100 feet tall. Last time, we could only make a 30-feet tall effigy.

But misconception has been created regarding child marriage, then we will request the Governor to return the bill to the government,” said chief minister Ashok Gehlot.Addressing a state-level function on the occasion of International Girl Child Day, Gehlot said the controversy is going over the marriage registration bill passed in the state assembly. The Supreme Court stated that every marriage should be registered. In view of this, a law was passed in the assembly.“But controversy erupted that this law would encourage child marriage. We have decided that this is not a matter of prestige for us. We will get it examined again by the law department and urge the governor to resend the law passed,” he said.Recently, the Rajasthan assembly passed a Bill to amend the Rajasthan Compulsory Registration of Marriages Act, 2009, providing a mechanism for the registration of all marriages in the state, irrespective of the age of the bride and groom. The contentious amendment, which is yet to be notified, states that “if the bride is under 18 and the groom is under 21”, the parents or guardians must submit a memorandum for registration of marriage within 30 days from the date of marriage.Social activists and civil society members argued the new provision was retrograde because it effectively legalised child marriage.Commenting on the government’s decision, Kriti Bhati of Saarthi, an NGO working against child marriages in Rajasthan, said, “The CM had decided to recall the bill and I hope that the government will cancel it. This is a half victory for all those who have considered this Bill as a violation of the rights of children and women.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-govt-to-recall-marriage-registration-bill-and-reexamine-101633978328814.html

As college administrations have geared up for the reopening, it is expected that fewer students might show up due to the “fully vaccinated” criteria. Students without both doses of the Covid vaccine will not be allowed on campus. The state higher education department has not issued clear guidelines about the reopening so there is some confusion in the city. “We have not yet received any guidelines or instructions from the state higher education department about the opening up of college campuses and we are still waiting. Once we get it, then immediately we will issue our circular to all the affiliated colleges in Pune, Nashik and Ahmednagar districts. The colleges will open in phase-wise manner and cannot be started full-fledged, as there are certain limitations, safety-related issues and the criteria of two vaccination doses,” said Prof N S Umrani, SPPU pro-vice-chancellor. When asked about the reopening of hostels, he said, “Hostel admissions will happen once we receive clear guidelines about opening up of the hostels.” There are 1,200 colleges affiliated to SPPU in three districts and the admission process of the majority of the courses is completed.

These shops do not have a fire audit done. The certificate is mandatory for obtaining a trade licence in the PCB area. PCB fire officer Rohit Panpise said that the fire department officials have been visiting shops to ascertain safety norms. “Most fire incidents take place due to open wiring connections which cause short circuits. During the inspection, we focus on fire safety and suggest measures, if required. Fire audit is a very important document for obtaining a trading licence,” he said. Majority of shops in the Cantonment area are in decade-old buildings wherein electric supply circuits and lines have worn out. “We have asked the owners to change the old cables to prevent fire incidents due to short circuits “ Ranpise added. PCB officials are also focusing on details like whether the establishments have enough space for an emergency exit in case of any eventualities. Currently, 15 government authorised private fire safety agencies are carrying outthe fire safety audits. The Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) in April decided to ask all hotels, trade and business establishments, coaching institutes and industrial units under its jurisdiction to get their fire audit and NOCs.The PCB general body had passed a resolution in the wake of the recent fire incidents at Fashion Street and Shivaji market in Camp. CEO Amit Kumar said, “ We are doing the fire audit as we don’t want a repeat of what happened at Fashion Street and Shivaji market. The standard operating procedure is being developed to ensure that fire incidents don’t take place in the business establishments and we are ready to face any kind of eventuality once we know the pros and cons after the fire audit of all the shops.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pcb-begins-fire-audit-of-400-shops-in-camp-101633978207100.html

12-10-2021||Mumbai||UP violence: Maharashtra bandh gets mixed response from Mumbaiites||Monday’s Maharashtra bandh, called by the three ruling parties in the state, received a mixed response from Mumbaiites, with many criticising the coalition for inconveniencing the common citizens, while some lauding the allies for taking a stand against the Lakhimpur Kheri incident in which farmers were mowed down when they were returning from protests. Monday morning did not seem like the start of a usual busy work-week for office goers, as BEST (Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport) buses did not ply in the city, resulting in overcrowded trains that accommodated the commuters. Animesh Vora, a Dahisar resident who travels to work to Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) daily, said, “BEST buses were not available on Monday morning due to which I could sense that local trains had unusual crowding. Also, after getting down at Bandra station, there were no buses to reach BKC.”Vora added, “There were private buses plying, which were jam-packed. I had to walk 500 metres to Kalanagar, from where I got an autorickshaw. A bandh called by a ruling party is equal to the government calling it. How will the administration act if ruling parties call for a bandh? Also, for common citizens, it just increases hardships for commute.”Sharing a photograph of an overcrowded train compartment on Twitter, one Mumbaiite wrote, “Never seen the trains this crowded...”Another Twitter user, Deepak Kumar Batra, stated, “Request to all political parties not to call bandhs, instead protest at specific sites. Bandh causes problems to common citizens, economy, and above all emergency services get hit.” Some social media users also came out in support of the state-wide bandh. Nirmal Kumar tweeted, “So happy that Maharashtra is showing solidarity with farmers over the Lakhimpur Kheri violence.”While most shops across the city had downed their shutters on Monday, some chose to continue doing business. Jagdish Jain, a shopkeeper from Bandra’s Pali Naka, said, “We have kept our shop open as no one has forced to shut shops. We have full sympathy towards the issue of farmers but ultimately it all boils down to politics and the real issue takes the back seat.”Jain added, “Nonetheless, if there is a bandh called, it should be applicable for e-commerce websites too. Many have kept their shops shut but e-commerce websites are selling their goods. There should be same appeal for all.”Shops in Byculla were also open. A shopkeeper who did not wish to be identified, said, “We will not let our business get affected and have collectively decided to keep our shops open. Business was slow, but we did receive a few buyers throughout the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/up-violence-maharashtra-bandh-gets-mixed-response-from-mumbaiites-101633977967759.html
12-10-2021||Lucknow||Ensure uninterrupted power between 6pm and 7am, UP CM tells officials||LUCKNOW Amid the prevailing electricity crisis caused by coal shortage in thermal plants, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday directed energy department officials to ensure uninterrupted power supply in villages and cities between 6pm and 7am. “This is the festive period and it is necessary to provide uninterrupted power to people during night,” he said while holding a video conference with top energy department officials, divisional commissioners, DMs and ADGs here at his residence. The CM also directed the UPPCL chairman to intensively review the availability of coal in the thermal plants and act accordingly. Reviewing other related issues, Adityanath said though most consumers wanted to pay their electricity bills on time, incorrect bills often issued by the department caused harassment to them apart from adversely affecting revenue collection. “Act tough against private bill collection agencies and even lodge FIRs against them and forfeit their security deposit, if they are found to issue incorrect bills to consumers,” the CM told officials. Yogi Adityanath also directed UPPCL officials to bring a one-time settlement scheme (OTS) for consumers to pay their arrears in easy installments without having to pay interest on the principal amount. He said damaged transformers must be replaced within 48 hours in villages and 24 hours in cities. He also directed officials to act quickly on the issue of providing subsidy to farmers and tube connections, for which farmers had applied, must be released in a time-bound manner without any delay. Expressing concern over high line losses, the CM asked discom MDs to take appropriate steps to control losses to make distribution companies financially viable. He told them to fix feeder-wise accountability of the staff in this regard. He also asked the UPPC chairman to ensure daily review of line losses and power supply at his level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ensure-uninterrupted-power-between-6pm-and-7am-up-cm-tells-officials-101633977907967.html

Soon, UP would have 49 medical colleges, of which 16 had been built on the PPP model. “On completion of five years of the government, every district will have a medical college,” he added. With teamwork and sustained efforts, the state has emerged successful in fighting against diseases like Japanese Encephalitis and Covid-19. The government controlled the diseases with the launch of cleanliness, sanitization drives, supply of pure drinking water and hygiene.During the event, the CM handed over Ayushman health cards to 15 beneficiaries under the Mukhyamantri Jan Arogya Abhiyan in a symbolic manner and simultaneously, 1,00,000 beneficiaries received Ayushman cards across the state, through public representatives. Ayushman cards will be distributed to over 40.79 lakh Antyoday ration card holder families in various districts of the state. Under this, over 1.30 crore people will be provided a health cover of ₹5 lakh per family each year.Medical education minister Suresh Kumar Khanna, medical health and family welfare minister Jai Pratap Singh, member of NITI Aayog Dr Vinod Paul and minister of state for medical and health and family welfare Atul Garg were present in the programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-govt-worked-in-a-planned-way-to-improve-healthcare-system-cm-101633977428558.html
12-10-2021||Delhi||Two wanted for several cases of robbery, snatching held after encounter in Delhi||Two suspected criminals, allegedly wanted in several cases of robbery and snatching, were arrested from near Dwarka’s Sector 14 Metro station following an encounter with the police in which one of them suffered a gunshot wound to the leg on Sunday night.At least five bullets were exchanged between the police and the two men. The suspects fired one bullet in the air and two at the policemen, who survived the attack. One of the two bullets fired by the police hit 30-year-old suspect, Rahul Kumar, in the leg. The other suspect was identified as Sarvana Kumar alias Anna,25.A case of attempt to murder, obstructing public servant in discharge of duty and assault was registered against the two under the Indian Penal Code’s sections 307, 186 and 353 at the Dwarka North police station.Since no senior officer, who is authorised to speak to the media, was available for sharing information about the encounter, it was not immediately known how many robbery and snatching cases the arrested men were allegedly involved in or wanted for.As per the contents of the FIR registered in connection with the encounter, at least a dozen police personnel from the anti-auto theft squad (AATS) of Dwarka district were present near Kakrola drain police picket on Sunday night. Around 9pm, a police informer told them about two criminals who were expected to reach near Dwarka’s Sector 14 Metro station on a bike to commit a robbery.The police reached the place and waited for the suspects, who arrived around 10.30pm on an Apache bike. When they were signalled to surrender, they tried to speed away. However, two policemen caught hold of the bike and the men fell off the two-wheeler. The suspects then took out their firearms and started shooting at the policemen. It was Rahul Kumar, who first fired a shot in the air after threatening the policemen.When the police personnel did not move back, Anna asked Rahul to shoot and kill the policemen else they would be arrested. Rahul aimed at the two policemen and fired two shots but the bullets missed their targets. One of the policemen retaliated and fired two shots at Rahul’s legs. One bullet hit Rahul’s right leg after which he fell to the ground and was overpowered by the policemen. Anna was also caught by the other police personnel, the police said.The injured suspect was admitted to a nearby hospital for medical attention. Two firearms were seized from the encounter spot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-wanted-for-several-cases-of-robbery-snatching-held-after-encounter-indelhi-101633977427496.html
12-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s new curriculum helps seed business ideas in students||When Class 12 student Tulika Gupta learnt that several of her women relatives, including her mother, used cloth instead of sanitary napkins, she decided to build a career around the issue of menstrual hygiene. Gupta and seven of her classmates said it was a “dream come true” when they got an opportunity to develop a business model to provide low-cost sanitary napkins to women from marginalised communities.“We plan to source these napkins from a non-government organisation at lower rates and offer them to women from marginalised communities at minimal profit. The idea is to create awareness among women and young girls so that they switch to sanitary napkins and also learn how to use them,” said Gupta, who studies at Janki Devi Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya in Mayur Vihar Phase 1.Gupta’s business idea came after the Delhi government announced the Business Blasters programme last month under the entrepreneurship mindset curriculum (EMC). Under this, students of classes 11 and 12 are to receive seed money of ₹2,000 per student to develop a business idea for profit or to create social impact in their communities.Gupta, who is part of the team called “silence breakers”, also plans to hold street plays and rallies, and make posters to raise awareness on menstrual hygiene in low-income neighbourhoods such as Chilla Khadar in east Delhi.Her batchmate Palak plans to use her seed money to develop a no-profit educational camp to apprise students and their parents about the government welfare schemes.“Not everyone knows how to avail of these schemes. I like working with children and so I decided to set up educational camps for children and their parents which could work as a one-stop centre that imparts relevant information through games and competitions,” she said.Hundreds of students in classes 11 and 12 of Delhi government schools are currently engaged in developing such projects with the help of their EMC teachers and business coaches. These coaches can be students pursuing their business degrees, or even entrepreneurs/alumni who volunteer to help children with their ideas.Students are slated to receive the seed money by next week and will begin their market research in the coming days. All projects have to be completed by November 15.Students can also pool their money by collaborating on a project. Following a presentation on the project, the peer-review model allows their classmates to give their comments on the feasibility of the project.On Monday, several such student groups presented their ideas to classmates including Shivya Antwadia, another Class 12 student at the school, who is working on a business model to market “air purifying plants” ahead of the winter pollution in Delhi.“The product has been designed keeping in mind the environmental concerns of our times. We will recycle broken mugs and plastic bottles for plants and mount them on a circular discs with a rotating motor beneath them. We have also been working on a drip irrigation system so that our consumers would just have to flick a switch and not worry about taking care of plants. There is a huge market for such plants,” she said.When asked by fellow students why someone would buy plants from them instead of the market, Antwadia said, “The USP of our product would be the decorative features we will add. We also plan to use decorative lights so that people can put these pots in their living rooms.” The five-member group will invest 50% of their seed money initially and later expand the project based on responses from customers.Another group – Cookie Monsters – will be working on developing healthier alternatives to biscuits with their motto “health with taste.” Team leader Jayati Chaudhary said they would focus on preparing their biscuits with macronutrients after a thorough market study, conducted via various bakeries in their neighbourhood.“Along with fruit cookies, we will develop moulds of superhero and cartoon characters to cater to the younger consumers. Our mothers have also offered help us with our projects. However, my father was initially sceptical about involving ourselves in this project when our board examinations are only a month away,” said Chaudhary, who is set to appear for her pre-board exams later this month.Several students said their parents were concerned that the Delhi government announced the Business Blasters programme barely two months before their board examinations. This year, CBSE introduced a two-term board examination with a revised paper pattern for class 10 and 12 students slated to begin in November.Ajay Veer Yadav, general secretary of government school teachers’ association (GSTA), also criticised the decision to implement the project at the last minute.“Covid-19 has already affected classes. In addition to that, there are several initiatives including this Business Blasters programme which extend beyond the school. Teachers should be allowed to hold remedial classes and prepare students for the new pattern of board examination involving objective type questions instead of engaging in these initiatives,” he said.However, Ashok Tiwari, a mentor teacher engaged in EMC classes, said these classes allow students to de-stress. “There was no other slot in the academic cycle to implement this. But children are excited about the project as they don’t have to study all the time. This initiative would allow them to take a break from studies and all engagements with the project will come to an end by November 15.”EMC coordinator Nivedita Kohli, who teaches Science at the Mayur Vihar school to class 9 and 10 students, also said the EMC classes have been helping students connect with their peers. “Socio-emotional learning had been hit by the prolonged closure of schools. With these activities, students are getting excited and more focused, which help in their academics as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-new-curriculum-helps-seed-business-ideas-in-students-101633977307809.html
12-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: No takers for turning the Chandni Chowk town hall into a heritage hotel||North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s plan to lease out the Town Hall in Chandni Chowk for running a ‘heritage hotel’ has found no takers, a senior municipal official overseeing the process said.The official said the civic body invited expression of interests from hotel operators to lease out the 150-year-old building for a period of 33 years with a minimum reserved price of ₹1.92 crore per month. Tenders were issued in mid-June, almost three years after the proposal was cleared by the civic body, and the technical bids were initially expected to be opened in August.“We have not received response from interested parties for taking the lease of the hotel and it now seems unlikely that we can move ahead with the project before the municipal elections,” the north corporation official said.The imposing building that is located in the centre of Chandni Chowk, the Town Hall served as the headquarters of the erstwhile unified Municipal Corporation of Delhi. The construction of the Town hall started in 1860 and was completed in 1863. The building was initially known as ‘Lawrence Institute, and it housed Delhi College of Higher Studies, before it was bought by the then municipality for Rs1,35,457 in 1866.Besides government offices, the building also had a library and a European club. After the municipality shifted its headquarters to the high-rise Civic Centre on Jawaharlal Nehru Marg between 2011-12, the Town Hall has been lying vacant.The total area under the possession of North corporation is 13,735 sqm all of which has been on offer under this re-development project. “the complex can be divided under three sections--main building, courtyard and the press building. Since the Victorian era building uses the construction material like stones, lime plaster, burnt bricks and timber, it requires refurbishing,” official explained.The project document states that the objective of current redevelopment project will be to provide “a complete and wholesome family experience at Town Hall” and to develop it into an attractive tourist destination.“The complex may be used for hotel, museums, library, children’s activity rooms, auditoriums for cultural activities with historical significance, demonstration room, light and sound programme, fine dining areas, street food of India etc. It is proposed to launch it as a unique and complete family experience for citizens of Delhi and tourists so that they can become familiar with history and culture of Delhi at one place with multifarious activities. The hotel will be the most exciting experience for those who want to be part of the history and culture of Delhi as a living experience,” the document states.Jogi Ram Jain, the standing committee chairman of north civic body said the corporation was planning to generate revenue through this project, but due to Covid pandemic the financial conditions of the prospective bidders is also very bad. “No bids were received because the condition of market is very bad. Running a museum may not be financially viable. We will explore this project afresh,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhino-takers-for-turning-the-chandni-chowk-town-hall-into-a-heritage-hotel-101633977247857.html
12-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi court summons Vijender Gupta in defamation case by Kailash Gahlot||A Delhi court on Monday summoned BJP leader Vijender Gupta as accused in a criminal defamation case filed by city transport minister Kailash Gahlot for alleged remarks over the procurement of 1,000 low-floor buses by the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC).Additional chief metropolitan magistrate (ACMM) Ravindra Kumar Pandey said on the basis of the submissions and evidences, prima facie the offence has been committed by Gupta. In his complaint, Gahlot has alleged that Gupta “intentionally and for malafide purposes” defamed him and tarnished his reputation to gain political mileage by alleging irregularities in the procurement of buses for DTC.He said Gupta levelled “defamatory, scandalous, mischievous, false and scurrilous allegations” verbally as well as in writing. The complaint further alleged that Gupta posted defamatory statements and other materials against Gahlot on Twitter, Facebook and other social media sites.The court, while issuing summons to Gupta, gave him time till November 16 to respond to the suit.“The order of summoning me has been passed after the pre-summoning stage which is a very routine procedure. My side is yet to be heard,” Gupta said.Gahlot filed separate civil and criminal defamation suits against Gupta in August, seeking ₹5 crore in damages and sought removal of media posts by the BJP legislator regarding alleged irregularities in procurement of public buses. The Union government has recommended a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the purchase of 1,000 buses by the Delhi government, and a maintenance contract for them. On August 20, Gupta tweeted about the CBI inquiry. “CBI investigation started in DTC bus purchase scam. Dismiss transport minister Kailash Gahlot and arrest him. The Kejriwal government has tried its best to suppress the corruption of ₹5000 crore. Why did the Aam Aadmi Party leaders remain silent in the bus purchase scam?”, he tweeted. He posted the same on his Facebook account.On August 28, the Delhi high court declined to grant ex parte interim relief to Gahlot in his civil defamation plea. HT reported on July 11 that the LG-appointed panel gave a clean chit to the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) in the tendering and procurement of the buses, although it found some “procedural lapses” arising out of “a bona fide decision making”. On July 12, Gupta wrote to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal demanding a CBI probe into the alleged irregularities in procurement of buses. A three-member committee that probed the matter recommended scrapping the tender of the AMC (annual maintenance contract) of buses after finding various “lapses”, Gupta said. There has been “irrefutable evidence of irregularities and violations in the AMC bid”, he stated, while also alleging “criminal conspiracy and connivance” in the whole process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-court-summons-vijender-gupta-in-defamation-case-by-kailash-gahlot-101633977068618.html
12-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt says rejection of doorstep ration delivery scheme discriminatory||New Delhi: The Delhi government has asked the Centre to withdraw a letter dated October 8 in which the latter refused to approve the doorstep delivery of ration scheme in the national capital, and added that similar schemes have already been implemented by other state governments. Delhi food and civil supplies minister Imran Hussain on Monday wrote to the Union minister of consumer affairs, food and public distribution, Piyush Goyal. He said that Delhi government was being meted out “discriminatory treatment”.“I wonder why Delhi is being singled out for discriminatory treatment and objections are being raised to prevent the implementation of a scheme which is undeniably and irrefutably in public interest and will subserve the needs of the most downtrodden and marginalised sections of the society. Several other states such as Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana have already rolled out home delivery of ration. It has repeatedly been pointed out in our letters in the past and it is once again reiterated that the scheme is completely in accord with the relevant provisions of the NFSA (National Food Security Act),” Hussain said.In a letter to the Delhi government’s food and supply department on October 8, the Centre said, “The alleged proposal under consideration with the Delhi government for home delivery does not fulfil the norms of NFSA and therefore, is not permissible in its current form by the government of India.”Last week, the Delhi government sent the file on doorstep delivery of ration to the LG for approval once again. This came after the Delhi high court on September 27 allowed the government to curtail supplies to the Fixed Price Shops commensurate to number of customers who have opted for doorstep delivery of ration. Hussain said that it was unfortunate that the petitioner, Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers Sangh (DSRDS), was trying to overreach the court’s order, and doing so amounts to “committing contempt of court”. “We, therefore, request you to withdraw the letter under reply, lest an impression be created that the central government is party to the attempt of the petitioner to obstruct and overreach orders passed by the High Court,” Hussain said.The doorstep delivery of the ration scheme has been stalled due to differences between the Delhi government and the Centre. The scheme was to be launched on March 25. But the Union food and consumer affairs ministry wrote to the Delhi government on March 19 objecting to the use of the term “mukhyamantri (chief minister)” for the scheme involving the distribution of food grains allocated under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). The Centre also said that any change in the delivery mechanism requires an amendment in NSFA that can be done only by Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-says-rejection-of-doorstep-ration-delivery-scheme-discriminatory-101633977007548.html
12-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: SDMC bans cross-gender massages, no new centres in residential areas||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has banned cross-gender massage while also restricting the operation timings of spa/massage centres between 9 am and 9pm, as the civic body implemented new licence guidelines for such establishments.The official order for the policy, which has been in making from last two years, was issued by the municipal health officer of SDMC on Thursday October 7. The policy, which has been approved by the lieutenant governor, states that no new spa centres will be allowed in residential areas.Inderjeet Sehrawat, the leader of the house in the south corporation, said the new policy has been reviewed and approved by LG Anil Baijal. “The new provisions will be applicable on all the establishments. The basic intent behind the policy is to weed out the illegal activities taking place in the garb of massage parlours,” he added.Explaining the new policy, a senior public health department official said several new conditions have been added to the existing rules pertaining to hygiene and sanitation. “All these units will have to operate separate sections for men and women that should be clearly demarcated. The police verification of the owner/spa manager will also be mandatory. Similarly, the centre will have to maintain the record of IDs and phone numbers of all its customers in a register,” the official said.Before the onset of Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020, there were more than 300 spa/massage centres across SDMC areas such as Mohan Garden, Rajouri Garden, Dwarka Mor, Uttam Nagar, Dwarka. The office order states that new permissions will be granted only in commercial and mixed land use areas.“All establishments, which have more than 10 employees, will be required to constitute a sexual harassment complaints committee. There should be CCTV cameras in common areas, and there shall be no latchet or bolt inside the chambers,” the policy states.On August 2, the Delhi government also laid out strict guidelines to regulate the operations of spas and massage centres in the city, including mandatorily obtaining a police clearance for all employees and limiting operational hours from 9am to 9pm, to ensure security of clients and the employees, and also to prevent sexual abuse, trafficking, and cross-gender massage.Earlier, the east corporation had issued similar guidelines for spa/massage centres on September 22, 2021 and the north body is also expected to follow its counterparts soon.Spa owners, however, said the new regulations were “regressive”.Pooja Chaterjee, the president of Delhi Wellness Spa Association said that they oppose the regressive changes incorporated in the new policy. “We have already challenged the policy in the Delhi high court, and we have faith that court will grant us relief. These changes will completely destroy the trade. The policymakers are acting like children by banning cross-gender massage. Don’t we allow male and female doctors to work in hospitals?,” she asked.Chaterjee said that many provisions in the policy are completely impractical and unimplementable. “So many people will lose employment because many provision cannot be fulfilled. Who will modify the structures to make separate entries and sections?”Vikram Soni, the secretary of the DWSA who runs a spa centre in Patel Nagar, said the civic body should not have issued guidelines when the matter is already pending in court.“You can forcefully implement a policy. It violates the rights of thousands of employees in this trade. They are taking away the employment from the workers. We should have a pan-India uniform policy,” Soni said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhisdmc-bans-cross-gender-massages-no-new-centres-in-residential-areas-101633976828085.html
12-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s power crisis not over, plants left with coal only for 2-3 days: Minister||Despite assurances from the central government that fears of a power crisis in India are overblown as the country has sufficient coal reserves to produce electricity, Delhi power minister Satyendar Jain on Monday said the power situation in the national capital is yet to normalise and most coal-fired power plants are functioning at up to 55% of their capacity. He said most plants currently have coal stocks left only for 2-3 days more.Jain said even though the power distribution companies in Delhi are meeting the daily electricity demand, several areas in the city continued to face outages, some of which lasted up to four hours. According to the load shedding reports, seen by Hindustan Times, areas such as Sarita Vihar, Gautampuri, Rohini, Burari, Laxmi Nagar, Shakarpur, Malviya Nagar and GTB Nagar, among others, saw power cuts ranging from one to four hours. “The power demand is being met, but it is also being met through rotational load shedding,” a senior official from the state power department said, asking not to be named.Jain said ideally, no power plant should have a coal stock of less than 15 days. “But right now, most plants have stock for two or three days. This is after the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) reduced power generation at all its plants to 50-55% plant capacity to ensure optimal use and equitable distribution of whatever coal is available,” he said. “The central government should explain why the country is still facing a coal crunch,despite the reduction in overall generation capacity of plants,” Jain said. The Delhi minister explained that the power demand of the city is currently low, ranging between 3,300MW and 4,800MW. Delhi’s peak demand during the summer usually crosses 7,000MW, but that is mostly only on a few days. Delhi’s peak power demand on Monday was 4,745 MW and on Sunday, it was 4,562 MW.When asked how Delhi’s electricity demand is being met currently, Jain said the balance power (after NTPC supply) is being procured on the spot at higher costs of ₹17-20 per kW and also through gas-based power plants in Bawana and Pragati-I. The production at these plants has been ramped up with the Centre providing more APM gas (domestic gas supply) to these stations.“If the Central government is saying there is no power crisis, then why did Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also write a letter to the central government? It is obvious that the letter was written because the problem exists. The Delhi government has maximum power purchase agreements (PPAs) with NTPC, but they have cut power production at their plants by 50-55%,” Jain said. “According to the PPAs, for 85% of the year, NTPC has to provide full supply and the remaining 15%, it can be up to 55%. But this cannot be done for all plants at the same time. Usually, NTPC gives about 4,000MW electricity to Delhi, but as of today (Monday), it is not able to supply even half of that,” Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-power-crisis-not-over-plants-left-with-coal-only-for-2-3-days-satyendar-jain-101633976767579.html
12-10-2021||Delhi||29,000 apply under DU’s second cut-off list, amid over-admissions concerns||The Delhi University has received over 29,000 applications from aspirants under its second cutoff list, of which 2,103 aspirants have paid the fee and 2,593 approvals were accorded by principals by Monday evening, even as colleges remained concerned about over-admissions to several courses due to the DU’s policy of granting admissions to all students who meet the published cutoff percentage.Chandrachur Singh, who teaches political science at Hindu College, which admitted nearly twice its sanctioned strength of around 930 seats, said, “The university needs to come up with a system to create a level playing field for all students. Entrance examination will lead to another problem of only those with access to coaching centres getting admissions to DU. Premier institutions should put in place robust mechanisms to reward merit while taking into account the diversity quotient. The need is for a robust inclusive policy and, perhaps, an algorithm to best express the policy.”The political science course at his college – which announced 100% cutoff this year – has admitted over 140 students under the first cutoff list, of which 130 have got the perfect score and all but one are from the Kerala state board.Referring to high marks in Kerala boards controversy, one that erupted after a DU professor coined a communally sensitive and derogatory term -- “marks jihad” -- to contend that students from the southern state were being given higher marks in Class 12 so that they could systematically take over the country’s top higher education institutes, Singh said the students are not at fault and this has been the pattern for the past few years.“This has been happening for the past few years. Of the students admitted to my course last year, around 80% are from Kerala. In the current third-year batch, 60% of students are from that state. This only points towards the need for DU to bring in domain experts and revise its existing admission policies rewarding merit and promoting diversity,” he said.Most colleges with 100% cutoffs – including Hansraj College, Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC), Ramjas College, and Hindu College – have noted that they are receiving a large number of applications from Kerala state board graduates.For instance, at SRCC, of the 134 students admitted in BCom (Honours) – which had 100% cutoff – 55 are from Kerala state board and 63 are from Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). “This is still a big number because most of these students have scored 100%. Now when admissions have started under second cutoff, fewer students have taken admission from the Kerala state board. This means most students from the board are getting 100% which is a dangerous precedent. The curriculum in the state is also different and it becomes difficult to bring these students on a par with other students,” said a teacher from college, requesting anonymity. The teacher added that this pattern is now being emulated by other state boards as well.Several teachers and admissions conveners HT spoke to explained that a policy oversight has led to an increase in the number of students from the Kerala board this year.“Unlike CBSE which gave weightage to marks obtained in classes 10 to 12, while compiling the Class 12 results, the Kerala state board mark-sheets contain marks from classes 11 and 12. The DU policy dictates that Class 12 scores are to be taken into account for admission. Most students from Kerala state board scored in the range of 90% for their Class 11 whereas, in Class 12, most of them have scored 100%. This has led to a flood of applications from those who cleared the Kerala state board,” said an admissions convener, asking not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/29000-apply-under-du-s-second-cut-off-list-amid-over-admissions-concerns-101633976647664.html
12-10-2021||Delhi||Govt plans new housing complex for employees in south Delhi’s Ghitorni||The Centre is planning to develop a new residential and commercial complex with over 7,000 dwelling units in south Delhi’s Ghitorni for government employees, said a senior official of the ministry of housing and urban affairs (HUA). The central public works department (CPWD), the Union government’s construction arm, will construct the residential portion, while the commercial component will be developed and sold by the National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC India). Although the project has been in the pipeline for a long time, its details are now being finalised, said a senior CPWD official in the know of the developments. The CPWD is also working on a detailed traffic and road infrastructure improvement plan to streamline vehicular movement in and around the proposed complex. “The planning work is in the advanced stages. The project cost will be recovered from the sale of commercial space. Once the details are finalised, the proposal will be sent to the Union cabinet for approval,” said a senior HUA ministry official aware of the development, who asked not to be named. Spread over 240 acres, the complex will have Type II to Type V flats under the general pool residential accommodation (GPRA). A senior CPWD official said on condition of anonymity, “The land parcel was allotted to the CPWD in the 80s for a brick kiln, and it has been lying vacant for all these years. The project has been in the pipeline for some time. But now, we are almost ready with the plan.” This is the third GPRA project in Delhi where the cost of the project will be recovered from the sale of commercial space that will be developed as part of the project. East Kidwai Nagar, work on which started in 2014, was the first government residential colony where commercial units were developed for monetisation. In all, the government is currently redeveloping seven more government residential colonies in south Delhi — Sarojini Nagar, Srinivaspuri, Kasturba Nagar, Netaji Nagar, Mohammadpur, Thyagraj Nagar and Nauroji Nagar— and the cost of the project in Nauroji Nagar will be recovered from the sale of the state-of-the-art commercial hub planned at the complex. A senior NBCC India official said on condition of anonymity, “We will develop the commercial complex which will have space for offices, retail and recreation. The cost of the project will be recovered from the sale of commercial and office spaces.” Imbibing lessons from past experiences, the CPWD is working on a traffic circulation plan for the Ghitorni project to ensure that the new development doesn’t cause any congestion in the area.The East Kidwai Nagar redevelopment project had come under fire for no traffic assessment study being carried out before the construction work was undertaken. Later, in a report submitted to the Delhi high court on the matter, the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, had said the increased traffic load caused by the project could result in congestion on Ring Road and Aurobindo Road.In the case of the Ghitorni project, the proposed development will be connected to the Delhi Metro, officials said, as the project is located near the Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road, which is well connected to Delhi Metro’s Yellow Line (Samaypur Badli to Huda City Centre in Gurugram). The senior CPWD official quoted above said, “A detailed traffic plan with flyovers and underpasses is being worked out so that there is no congestion in the area once the project is complete.” To handle the increased vehicular traffic around the eight government group housing colonies, including the one at East Kidwai Nagar, the CPWD had to come up with a plan to construct a 14km long elevated corridor. The ₹5,000 crore corridor was approved by the apex traffic and transportation body in Delhi, UTTIPEC (Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning & Engineering) Centre), earlier this year. The CPWD has started work on preparing a detailed drawing of the proposed corridor, HT reported on September 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-plans-new-housing-complex-for-employees-in-south-delhi-s-ghitorni-101633976587598.html
12-10-2021||Delhi||Fewer stubble fires so far, but likely to flare up, say experts||Between September 1 and October 10, there were fewer cases of stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana than in the corresponding period last year, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) satellite data has shown. But experts say this may not be a good indicator of the things to come as the late withdrawal of the monsoon from northwest India may just have delayed the fires.NASA data shows that farm fires were spotted in Punjab around September 15, with around 10-15 showing up on satellite data. The numbers started picking up around September 27, when the count reached 40.Data also shows that while September largely saw inconsistent fires in some districts, there has been a steady rise in stubble fires since October 7, a day after the India Meteorological Department (IMD) officially announced the withdrawal of monsoon from Delhi and other parts of northwest India.Between October 7 and October 10, 80-170 fires have been reported daily.In Haryana, apart from one or two fires in September, stubble fires started from October 1. On October 8, 32 such fires were noticed in the state, which rose to around 80 on October 9 and 170 on October 10.“So far, fires are low in number as compared to last year. But this is not indicative of how the season is going to be. We will have to wait and assess,” said Pawan Gupta, a research scientist at the Goddard Earth Sciences Technology and Research (GESTAR), Universities Space Research Association, Washington DC.Every year, as winter sets in, Delhi’s air quality nosedives, with pollution levels deteriorating to emergency levels on certain days. The annual air emergency begins around mid-October, as farmers from the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana start setting their fields on fire to get rid of crop stubble and prepare their fields for the next crop season. The change in wind patterns after the withdrawal of monsoon facilitates plumes of thick smoke to travel into the capital from these agrarian states, impacting Delhi’s air.NASA’s data shows that last year in Punjab, stubble burning started by September 17. On September 25, around 180 fires were reported. Between October 1 and October 10, over 200 fires were being reported daily in different districts in Punjab. Haryana on the other hand, reported 30-70 daily stubble fires last year in the same period.Weather forecasters and environmentalists warned that the fires are likely to pick up in the coming week.“Monsoon withdrawal was later than usual this year. And another anomaly was that September was also unusually wet this time; farms cannot be set on fire when it’s wet. Fires are likely to pick up in the coming week and as temperatures in Delhi start falling, the impact of these fires will also be more visible in our AQI (air quality index),” said a senior IMD scientist.Experts also pointed out that apart from the late monsoon withdrawal, the delay in paddy procurement by the Centre could also have resulted in the delay in harvest. The food ministry had said on Thursday that the procurement of paddy in Punjab and Haryana was pushed back to October 11 due to heavy rain recently.“Many factors can delay the onset of burning. Key burning trigger, though, is harvest, and in 2021, I think, the harvest has been delayed due to MSP (minimum support price) procurement date shift from the end of September to October 11, two weeks or so later than 2020,” said Robert Berry, professor emeritus at Aston University, United Kingdom.The original procurement date of paddy at MSP for the 2021-2022 Kharif marketing season was October 1 in Punjab and September 25 in Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/fewer-stubble-fires-so-far-but-likely-to-flare-up-say-experts-101633976408087.html
12-10-2021||Delhi||Ensure that no illegal hawkers are allowed in CP: HC tells NDMC, Delhi Police||Taking strong exception to illegal squatters in the Connaught Place area, the Delhi high court on Monday directed the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and the city police to ensure that no unauthorized vendor is allowed there.The court also ordered the NDMC chairman and the area deputy commissioner of police to be present in the court on the next date of hearing on November 8.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said the municipal body is doing “mere paper exercise” as the situation on ground remains the same. The court said that the authorities are not actively pursuing the matter and not monitoring the unauthorised vendors.The court asked the police and the NDMC to file status reports, highlighting the steps taken to ensure that the vendors do not hawk illegally.The court’s order came on a plea by the New Delhi Traders Association (NDTA), alleging failure on the part of the NDMC to ensure that the Connaught place area remains a no-hawking, no-vending zone.Appearing for the association, senior advocate Sanjeev Ralli told the court that the civic body notified a scheme, Urban Street Vendors, according to which areas of Connaught Place and Connaught Circus are “no-Hawking/ no vending areas”. He argued that the scheme, that was brought in 2007 and approved by the Supreme Court, was not being enforced.He gave photographs to the court showing the existing state of affairs in the area to show the extent of illegal hawking and vending in as much as unauthorized hawkers and squatters who illegally encroach and squat on the spaces meant as pedestrians pathway by illegally operating in front of market shops and also from other prohibited areas of Connaught Place and Connaught Circus.Advocate Harsha Peechara, counsel for the civic body, said they keep removing the vendors, but they keep returning to the area. He said NDMC had written to the city police seeking their assistance because it is the question of enforcement while ensuring the court that regular drives are being conducted to remove the unauthorized vendors.He also said that around 70-80 vendors have been protected by earlier court orders.Appearing for the city police, advocate Rishikesh Kumar, told the court that they provide regular assistance and force to NDMC, as and when the civic body asks. He ensured the court that in future also, if NDMC seeks assistance, it would be provided.When the NDMC counsel said that the vendors come after 6.30pm, when the shift of the municipal employees is over, the court said that the authorities cannot raise their hand in the air and have to co-ordinate among themselves to see that the area is made a no-hawking zone.The bench also said that in case more force is required, it should be brought in to check on the unauthorized vending. The court also took note of the pictures given to it and said that hawking was highly unregulated in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ensure-that-no-illegal-hawkers-are-allowed-in-cp-hc-tells-ndmc-delhi-police-101633976107778.html
12-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Child rights body pushes for in-person classes for all||Ahead of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) meeting scheduled to take place after festive season to discuss phase-wise reopening of schools for junior classes, the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights on Monday asked Delhi’s lieutenant governor Anil Baijal to allow in-person classes for students from nursery to Class 8 at least twice a week.Last month, Baijal, who is the chairperson of DDMA, had said they will consider allowing schools in the city to resume in-person classes for students of classes 6 to 8 after the festive season.In a letter sent to Baijal on Friday, DCPCR chairperson Anurag Kundu said the authorities must reopen schools as it was causing learning loss among children; impacting their social, physical, and mental health; and adversely affecting the economy. Pointed out that nearly all sectors had opened up, including offices, cinema halls, malls, markets, and parks, Kundu, in his letter, advocated for reopening of classes nursery to 8 for at least twice a week in staggered form.“Clearly children not attending schools cannot keep them safe since the adults are moving about and returning home. As it is, children are visible everywhere in public places. There appears to be little evidence about how school closures can benefit the children when all the sectors are open,” Kundu said in his letter, adding that experts have said “it was highly unlikely that the third wave will predominantly or exclusively affect children.”The commission highlighted the learning loss faced by children due to the prolonged closure of schools during the Covid-19 pandemic.“Seventeen percent more Class 1 students could not read letters in 2020-21 compared to 2019-20 according to the Annual Status of Education report 2021 by Pratham Education Foundation… 80% of children aged 14-18 years report lower learning levels compared to when schools were open… A nation where children cannot read is doomed to fail, setting its children up for dropouts,” said the letter.The commission also highlighted that online classes, as an alternative to in-person sessions, was severely limiting. DCPCR also quoted a UNICEF study which claimed that nearly one-third parents reported deterioration of the social and emotional health of their children.“The World Bank states that this generation of students stand to lose an estimated 10 trillion dollars in earnings or almost 10% of the global GDP. This will drive the country further back in its pursuit of achieving reduction in poverty levels,” said the letter, adding that several states such as Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan had opened its schools.Kundu also argued for the reopening of anganwadis, claiming that if affected routine immunisation of children, posed a risk of increasing malnutrition in the city, and hampered the early childhood education to aid the cognitive development of children.“Anganwadis to open at least once a week for all children in staggered form and random testing of students/children and school/anganwadi staff to ensure the infection spread, if any, is immediately identified and contained,” said Kundu in his letter to Baijal.Spokespersons from the LG office did not comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-child-rights-body-pushes-for-in-person-classes-for-all-101633975569109.html
12-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi CM launches ‘Desh Ke Mentors’ programme||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday launched the ‘Desh Ke Mentors’ programme under which the nine lakh students of classes 9 to 12 in Delhi government schools will be connected with noteworthy citizens who will offer them career and general guidance. Actor Sonu Sood had been appointed as the brand ambassador for the programme on August 27.Kejriwal said that through this program, “children will get an elder brother, friend or sister with whom they can share everything”. “In our families we see elder brothers and sisters guide their younger siblings. If we replicate the same model on the national level, this whole country will become a big family. People will start seeing beyond the fault lines of caste and creed, they won’t see the religion of the person they are talking to. All these walls that have divided our society will completely fall down and unite the country,” he said during the launch of the event on Monday.The mentors will engage with students over the phone for 10-15 minutes daily to guide them on various aspects of life, the government said in a statement. Interested citizens from across the country can become mentors by registering on the Desh ke Mentors app.The app, which was developed by a team from Delhi Technological University (DTU), will connect students and mentors based on how their profile and interests align.“Under the ‘Desh Ke Mentor’ programme, nine lakh students studying in classes 9 to 12 will be able to search for a career. To help guide these students, the Delhi government aims to create a movement of youth volunteers who will act as guides for them,” the government said in a statement.The programme includes a two-month mandatory mentoring module and another optional four-month module. “Mentors from various professional and academic backgrounds, between the ages of 18-35, will guide and support 2-5 students studying in Delhi government schools. They will help the students in their overall development and personality development by sharing their knowledge, skills and expertise in various fields,” the statement added.The Delhi government said the programme would help in fulfilling the emotional needs of children as well as guide them on their career path from experienced citizens. Kejriwal said, “As a child grows up, they feel a variety of pressures from peers, family, siblings, and others. It is very difficult to deal with all of it as a child. This is why cases of depression and suicide are so high in the age group. We want these children to get a non-judgemental helping hand… Desh Ke Mentors will also be able to properly guide and counsel the children on their careers.”Kejriwal also urged people to join the initiative as it would be their contribution towards nation-building: “I appeal to all the people of the country, please join this initiative and help build this country...I am not asking anyone to help a group of children, just take the responsibility of one child and help them grow.”Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who holds the education portfolio, said the programme will address the problems faced by students of classes 9 to 12 while deciding their careers. “If someone wants to join the police force, someone should be there to guide them and let them know of the process and research for them as a mentor. If the parents are confused on how to help their child choose their career, there should be a mentor to guide and help the students into taking the right decision. It is usually problematic in Indian households where professions are chosen by generational patterns and it often restricts the child in following his/her interests. The mentor’s work is to provide help, guidance, and ideas, and the child’s responsibility is to do hard work, smart work, and putting in consistent efforts and talent,” he said.The CM also said that the number of students in Delhi government schools had increased from 16 lakh in previous years to 18.70 lakh this year. “..The way 2.70 lakh students left private education for government schools, it speaks lengths about the standard of education we offer,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cm-launches-desh-ke-mentors-programme-101633975509671.html
12-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC judgment on challenge to top cop Rakesh Asthana’s appointment today||The Delhi high court will on Tuesday pronounce judgment on a plea challenging the appointment of Rakesh Asthana as the city police commissioner, according to the list of matters posted by the court’s registry.On August 25, the Supreme Court asked the high court to decide within two weeks the plea pending before it against the appointment of the senior IPS officer Delhi’s top cop, and a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh reserved its order on September 27.A plea by lawyer Sadre Alam sought for quashing of the July 27 order issued by the Union home ministry appointing Asthana as the Delhi Police commissioner, and the order granting inter-cadre deputation and extension of service to him.The plea contended that a high-powered committee comprising the Chief Justice of India, Prime Minister, and the Leader of Opposition, in a meeting held on May 24, 2021, rejected the appointment of Asthana as CBI director due to procedural lapses, and that the same rules should apply in the appointment of Delhi Police commissioner.Apart from Alam, an intervention application by the NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), was also filed through advocate Prashant Bhushan, challenging the appointment. The petition was earlier filed in the apex court, which asked Bhushan to approach the high court.Bhushan, during the proceedings, contended that Alam’s petition was a “copy-paste” of his plea.Justifying Asthana’s appointment, the Centre told the court that most of the appropriate level of officers of AGMUT (cadre of IPS officers for Union territories) did not have the sufficient balance of experience and policing in for appointment as a top cop of the city.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Union home ministry, contended that filing Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has spawned into an industry of vested litigation. Asthana, in his affidavit, told the court that there was a sustained social media campaign against him, and the legal challenge to his appointment was an abuse of process of law arising from vendetta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-judgment-on-challenge-to-top-cop-rakesh-asthana-s-appointment-today-101633975447411.html

12-10-2021||Delhi||Gangster’s associate murdered in Rohini, cops suspect fallout of Gogi’s killing||A suspected accomplice of jailed gangster Sunil Maan alias Tillu Tajpuriya was shot dead allegedly by two unidentified men in outer Delhi’s Rohini Sector 15 on Monday night, prompting the police to suspect that the murder may be a fallout of the killing of Tillu’s arch-rival Jitender Maan aka Gogi during a shoot-out at Rohini court 17 days ago.The incident was captured in CCTV cameras installed around the crime scene. Apart from the two alleged killers at least one more suspect was present there, the police said. The deceased was identified as Deepak alias Radhey.Deepak had five criminal cases registered against him, including one of murder in 2013, police said.A case of murder was registered and several teams were formed to identify and nab the killers. Apart from the local police, teams of the special cell and crime branch have also launched their parallel operation to nab the killers, who could be the sympathisers of Gogi.Deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Pranav Tayal said murder took place around 8.30pm near the dividing road of Sector-15 and Sector-16, Rohini. Deepak was waiting for someone on the roadside and was seated on his bike.“Two men approached Deepak, and had a brief chat with him. Soon, they fired at Deepak, who suffered one bullet wound in his back and another in the thigh. The suspects ran away after the firing. The CCTV cameras captured the duo fleeing on a bike on which a third person was waiting for them some distance away from the crime spot,” said Tayal.Police said Deepak was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was declared brought dead. Their preliminary enquiry revealed that Deepak was previously arrested along with one of Tillu’s associates, Sandeep alias Dhillu in a case.“Since Deepak was associated with Tillu, we are not ruling out the possibility of the involvement of the members of Gogi gang, who have been looking for opportunities to take revenge,” said a police officer, who asked not to be named.On September 24, Gogi was produced in court number 207 in Rohini court complex from Tihar jail by a 10-member team from Delhi Police’s 3rd battalion for hearing in a 10-year-old attempt to murder case registered at Alipur police station. Nearly 15 personnel from the special cell were also present at the courtoom, when two men dressed as lawyers whipped out their firearms and rained bullets at Gogi, killing him on the spot. Three policemen responded and killed the two assailants on the spot. The judge was seated in the courtroom when the shooting happened.The next day, the special cell arrested two suspects, who had accompanied the two killers -- Rahul aka KK and Jagdeep alias Jagga -- to the court premises. Their interrogation revaled that the Gogi’s murder conspiracy was hatched by his rival, Tillu Tajpuriya, who despite lodged in Mandoli jail had been allegedly getting live updates through internet video calling from the court premises during the shootout.The police have arrested and interrogated Tillu and two other jailed gangsters, including his associate, Naveen Bali, in the case so far. They have not been able to recover the mobile phone that Tillu allegedly used in the jail to get the Live updates.Anticipating a fallout of Gogi’s killing, several teams have been tasked to gather information regarding the revenge planning of his gang members. Four members of Gogi gang were arrested within a week after his murder. They were planning to hit back on Tillu’s gang members, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gangsters-associate-murdered-in-rohini-cops-suspect-fallout-of-gogi-s-killing-101633975087609.html

According to police, Shyam was transferred to Sanjay Gandhi Hospital and was later declared brought dead. Police said they registered a case under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code, based on the statement of an eyewitness.During investigation, it was found that the suspect fled from the spot after attacking Shyam and seeing him bleeding.“The police team checked numerous CCTV footage of the area, developed local intelligence and questioned them to identify the culprit. Finally, the accused was arrested and was identified as Imran,” said deputy commissioner of police (outer) Parvinder Singh.During questioning, Imran allegedly said that he recently got addicted to drugs and on Wednesday night, he got down at Sultan Puri bus terminal and was passing through the spot where the incident took place when he fell over on the road after colliding with Shyam.He allegedly claimed that he hurled abuses at Shyam and another blind woman present near the spot.

12-10-2021||Delhi||Maneka Gandhi writes to Baijal, urges govt to arm, strengthen forest officials||Lok Sabha MP and animal rights activist Maneka Gandhi has written a letter to Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal urging him to equip the city’s forest department with arms and vehicles to help them discharge their duties. The letter comes in the wake of an attack on forest guards at south Delhi’s Asola Bhatti wildlife sanctuary by alleged liquor smugglers. In the letter date October 8, Gandhi referred to the September 23 attack and said that considering the city’s forest department officials have to face the dangers of illegal activities in forest areas regularly, they need to be ‘amply equipped and strengthened’ in order to discharge their duties. “There has been a gruesome and pre-planned attack on forest officials inside the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary in Delhi while discharging their duties. This issue is extremely serious and requires action at the highest levels to ensure that there is no loss of life,” Gandhi wrote. She added, “Since Delhi is known to for illegal wildlife smuggling activities, it is important that the forest department is strengthened and appropriate measures are taken for equipping them with necessary arms, vehicles and other such provisions for their safety and effective discharge of their duties.” HT reported how four forest officials were beaten up during night patrolling by suspected alcohol smugglers. The men carrying knives and rods beat up the officials and damaged their vehicles. The officials were admitted to the Batra Hospital. Senior forest officials said that the attack was in retaliation to the department’s crackdown against alcohol smugglers, who were using the forest routes to smuggle alcohol from Haryana to Delhi. This activity had intensified especially after the Covid-19 pandemic broke out last year and the supply of liquor was hit in Delhi for several months. While the LG on September 23, the same day when the officials were attacked, notified a uniform code for the forest department, it has only equipped forest officials with batons and lathis to face smugglers, encroachers and timber mafia. Gandhi said, “I request you to kindly give appropriate directions to the government of Delhi to take urgent steps in this regard.” Spokesperson from the LG office did not comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/maneka-gandhi-writes-to-delhi-l-g-urges-govt-to-arm-strengthen-forest-officials-101633974727383.html
12-10-2021||Lucknow||Kanpur realtor case: Two policemen sent to judicial custody||GORAKHPUR Two policemen, JN Singh and Akshay Mishra who were arrested in connection of Kanpur realtor Manish Gupta death case, were sent to judicial custody by a local court late on Sunday night, hours after quizzing by the Kanpur SIT, said police. “The arrested accused have been handed over to the SIT,” said SSP Vipin Tada. JN Singh, former SHO (Ramgarh Tal police station) and Akshay Mishra, chowki in charge of Phal Mandi post, were arrested from Gorakhpur when they were planning to surrender in court as several teams of Kanpur SIT and police tightened the noose around them. The duo was on the run since September 27 night, when Manish Gupta was allegedly murdered during midnight police checking at a hotel here. After their arrest, Singh and Mishra were quizzed by the SIT following which they were produced before the ACJM court, which sent them to judicial custody. During interrogation, the two accused reportedly denied charges of killing Manish and claimed that the realtor was drunk and died due to injuries caused after falling on the floor in an inebriated state. Meanwhile, the SIT continued to conduct raids at multiple locations in Lucknow, Prayagraj, Varanasi and Ghazipur to arrest the rest of the cops, including S-I Vijay Yadav, wanted in the Manish Gupta case. Security was tightened on the Indo-Nepal border to prevent the accused cops from fleeing to Nepal. Yadav was reportedly planning to surrender in court. On the intervening night of September 27 and 28, six policemen led by JN Singh and Akshay Mishra visited Hotel Krishna palace around 12.30 and checked room no 512, where Manish was staying with his two friends Hardeep Singh Chauhan and Pradeep Singh Chauhan, brothers from Gurgaon, and asked them to show their ID proofs as part of an ongoing checking drive against criminals and suspects. While the Chauhan brothers were quick to show their IDs, Manish objected to the midnight checking, leading to arguments which eventually made Singh and Mishra angry who then allegedly started beating him brutally. Chauhan brothers had told media that Manish was beaten up in the closed room after they were pushed out by cops. When the door opened, they saw the cops dragging Manish in an unconscious state. They said the policemen took Manish to a nearby private hospital from where he was referred to the BRD Medical College, where he was declared brought dead due to excessive bleeding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/kanpur-realtor-case-two-arrested-cops-sent-to-judicial-custody-101633969927048.html

12-10-2021||World||COP15: Xi Jinping announces $233 million biodiversity protection fund at UN meet||Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday pledged 1.5 billion yuan ($232.47 million) for a new fund to support biodiversity protection in developing countries. He made the announcement on the sidelines of the UN’s COP15 summit on biodiversity protection, in the city of Kunming.“China will take the lead and contribute 1.5 billion yuan to set up the Kunming Biodiversity Fund to support biodiversity development of developing countries,” Xi Jinping said, making the remarks while addressing the 15th meeting of the UN-led Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity - also known as COP15 - via video link from Beijing.The UN summit is being attended by scientists, conservationists as well as diplomats where the focus is on forging a global agreement to protect the world’s increasingly fragile biodiversity and prevent the extinction of plants and animals.“Developing countries need help and support and solidarity must be strengthened to allow developing countries to benefit in a fairer way,” Xi Jinping said.Experts say China’s efforts to conserve biodiversity at home have not been matched by efforts to clean up its global supply chains or embark on sustainable investments overseas.Li Shuo, senior climate adviser at Greenpeace China, said the new fund announced at the COP15 summit “should jump-start an urgently needed conversation on biodiversity finance”.“COP15 needs to see donor countries from the developed world contributing in this regard,” Li told Reuters.Other leaders who spoke at the UN conference on Tuesday included Russian President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.News agency Xinhua quoted Xi Jinping’s pledge to accelerate the development of solar power in China. “[We will] step up our efforts in the development of renewable energy, and accelerate the planning of large-scale photovoltaic and wind power projects in [our] deserts and nearby areas,” he said.“Phase one of these projects with a combined installed capacity of 100 million kilowatts will begin construction soon in an orderly manner,” the Chinese president added.Xi also announced a plan to consolidate a national parks system in China, the first batch of which would bring a land area of 230,000 sq km under protection.“This area is home to nearly 30% of the key terrestrial wildlife species found in the country,” Xi was quoted as saying.Xi Jinping’s pledges come in the backdrop of China’s worst energy shortages in recent years, following which the government, according to reports, ordered the country’s coal mines to boost output.Widespread power cuts since last month have forced many factories to cut production or stop operations completely. One reason for the power crisis, experts have said, is China’s carbon emission goals - peak emission by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.In his speech on Tuesday, Xi said that to achieve its carbon peak and neutrality targets, China will release implementation plans for peaking carbon dioxide emissions in key areas and sectors as well as a series of supporting measures.China will continue to readjust its industrial structure and energy mix and vigorously develop renewable energy, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cop15-xi-jinping-announces-233-million-biodiversity-protection-fund-at-un-meet-101634061080875.html
12-10-2021||World||Biden administration launches new initiative to counter climate crisis||The Biden administration is launching a new government initiative to deliver accessible and actionable information to individuals and communities that are being hit by flooding, drought, wildfires, extreme heat, coastal erosion, and other intensifying climate impacts, the White House said on Tuesday.According to the White House statement, administration officials announced a launch of a redesigned Climate.gov by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the accessibility of accurate and timely climate information.The other announcement includes the "release of two new reports delivered to the National Climate Task Force outlining the ways the federal government will improve access to climate tools and services," the statement said, adding "the initiation of a process by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to assess the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) standards to help communities align their construction and land-use practices with the latest understandings of flood risk reduction."The Biden administration also announced the new-and-improved Climate Website. NOAA's Climate Program Office launched a newly redesigned version of Climate.gov, NOAA's award-winning, flagship website that provides the public with clear, timely, and science-based information about climate.Climate.gov also provides access to commonly requested climate data and tools hosted by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.The administration further announced interagency reports on climate information services.President Joe Biden's Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, agencies have developed two reports to the National Climate Task Force on climate information services to help governments, communities, and businesses prepare for and adapt to climate impacts.The first report, titled "Opportunities for Expanding and Improving Climate Information and Services for the Public," charts a course for expanding accessibility and use of the federal government's climate information to support all communities, including those who have been historically underserved, on climate planning and resilience activities, the statement said.According to the statement, the report lays out priority opportunities to focus climate services on the challenges that pose the greatest risks and opportunities to society; Foster interagency coordination and strategic public-private partnerships to develop, deliver, and continually advance climate services; Enhance the usability, translation, and relevance of climate services to support use by all Americans; and Strengthen core science capabilities needed to expand and improve climate services.The second report, titled "Advancing the Nation's Geospatial Capabilities to Promote Federal, State, Local, and Tribal Climate Planning and Resilience," focuses on the role the federal government plays in providing geospatial data and mapping tools, and the potential for a collaborative federal mapping service to make climate data more accessible, the statement said.The report recommends: Building on the FGDC's existing GeoPlatform, which provides public access to federal geospatial data, by ensuring that all agencies register their climate-related datasets; Making this data more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable; and Exploring potential enhancements to the GeoPlatform model with new software, services, or tools to help agencies and public-private partnerships develop specialized climate information products, the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-launches-new-initiative-to-counter-climate-crisis-101634059984504.html
12-10-2021||World||European Union pledges 1-billion euros aid package for Afghanistan||The Taliban held their first face-to-face talks with a joint US-EU delegation Tuesday in Qatar as Brussels pledged one billion euros ($1.2 billion) in aid for Afghanistan.The hardline Islamists are seeking recognition, as well as assistance to avoid a humanitarian disaster, after they returned to power in August following the withdrawal of US troops.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the EU aid package, meant "to avert a major humanitarian and socio-economic collapse", at a virtual G20 summit hosted by Italy.She stressed the funds are "direct support" for Afghans and would be channelled to international organisations working on the ground, not to the Taliban's interim government which Brussels does not recognise."We have been clear about our conditions for any engagement with the Afghan authorities, including on the respect of human rights," she said.The Taliban badly need assistance as Afghanistan's economy is in a parlous state with most aid cut off even as winter nears, food prices rising and unemployment spiking.EU countries are wary at the prospect of a surge of Afghan asylum-seekers trying to enter the bloc, as happened in 2015 with Syrians fleeing their war.Brussels' calculation is that donating money to help stabilise Afghanistan and assist countries between it and Europe could stem any flow.Positive relationshipsThe direct talks held in Doha on Tuesday were facilitated by Qatar, which has long hosted a Taliban political office."I think engaging with them (the Taliban) is the most important now," said Mutlaq al-Qahtani, a special envoy to Qatar's foreign minister, who brushed aside the question of whether to recognise a Taliban government."A priority as we speak now is the humanitarian (situation), is education, is free passage" of people wishing to leave, he told the Global Security Forum conference in Doha.EU spokeswoman Nabila Massrali said the meeting would "allow the US and European side to address issues" including respect for women's rights and preventing Afghanistan becoming a haven for "terrorist" groups."This is an informal exchange at technical level. It does not constitute recognition of the 'interim government'," she said.Martin Longden, charge d'affaires at the now evacuated UK mission to Afghanistan, joined the talks Tuesday, saying his country had "pressed for action" on a number of issues."I stressed the UK's support for a safe and stable Afghanistan and our determination to continue our assistance to the Afghan people," he tweeted."The UK has significant concerns on counter-terrorism, freedom of movement, and human rights -- including girls' education -- on which we pressed for action."The Taliban regime is also facing a security threat from the Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) group, who have launched a series of deadly attacks."We want positive relationships with the whole world," the Taliban's acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said at an earlier event in Qatar."We believe such a balanced relationship can save Afghanistan from instability," said Muttaqi, who led the Taliban delegation Saturday for the first in-person talks with US officials since the American pullout.Broken promisesAfghanistan's boys were allowed to return to secondary schools three weeks ago, but girls have been told to stay at home along with women teachers in much of the country, though they can attend primary school.Asked about the exclusion of girls, Muttaqi said their schools had been closed because of Covid-19 -- a public health threat he said had lessened -- but didn't explain why boys' schools had opened.Muttaqi also insisted there was no discrimination against the Shiite community and claimed that IS-K was being tamed."Whatever preparations they had made have been neutralised 98 percent," he said without providing details.IS-K claimed a bombing of a Shiite mosque that killed more than 60 people on Friday, the deadliest attack since the US pullout.Underlining the shaky security situation, the US and Britain warned their citizens on Monday to avoid certain hotels in Kabul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-pledges-1-billion-euros-aid-package-for-afghanistan-101634059825386.html

The IMF projected the global economy to grow 5.9% in 2021, a downward revision from July 2021 update, and 4.9% in 2022. The international financial institution noted that although the global economic recovery is continuing, the fault lines opened up by coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic are looking “more persistent.” The rapid spread of the highly contagious Delta variant of coronavirus and the threat of new variants, it said, have increased the uncertainty about how “quickly the pandemic can be overcome.”IMF's chief economist Gita Gopinath said in a blog post that the downward revision reflects “more difficult near-term prospects” for the advanced economy group while the pandemic has considerably darkened the prospects of the low-income developing country group.“The dangerous divergence in economic prospects across countries remains a major concern,” she wrote.The table shows GDP growth forecasts in percentages (Change from the July WEO update in parentheses):||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-warns-pandemic-darkening-prospects-in-developing-countries-growth-forecasts-101634051735563.html

The rate at which debt accumulated in individual countries varied considerably.The World Bank report said that for Pakistan, the 8 per cent increase in external debt stocks reflected the inflow of budgetary support from official bilateral and multilateral creditors and rollover and new credit lines from commercial banks, The News International reported.Net inflows from other private creditors rose 15 per cent in 2020 to 14 billion dollars but were highly concentrated and also reflected rollovers and extension of new credits by commercial bank loans to Pakistan in the context of the IMF program.The FDI inflows to Pakistan fell moderately to 1.9 billion dollars, 5 per cent below the 2019 level, cushioned by continued investment in power generation and the telecom sector from British and Chinese investors.While, in South Asia, debt to China has risen, from 4.7 billion dollars in 2011 to 36.3 billion dollars in 2020, The News International reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-among-top-10-countries-in-list-of-largest-external-debt-stocks-101634049374682.html

Kuwait's deputy prime minister Sheikh Hamad Jaber Al-Ali Al-Sabah, who also serves as the minister of defence, announced the ministerial decision to open the registration for women to join the country's national military service.During the initial phase, the applicants will serve in the field of medical and military support."Kuwaiti women have proven their achievements in several fields, and accordingly the approval was given for women to enter the military corps along with men," he said.Kuwaiti women have been serving as police officers for the past two decades, which paved the way for women to join the army. Announcing the decision, the defence minister affirmed his full confidence in the ability of Kuwaiti women to bear the hardship of working in the army, according to news agencies.Kuwait has made significant progress in the last few years in assuring the rights of women to work in various fields dominated by men. In 2005, the gulf nation passed a bill to grant women the right to vote and run for elected office. The bill paved the way for four female candidates occupying parliamentary seats out of fifty available in a general election a few years later.The number of female judges has also risen to 15 after 7 new female judges were introduced in May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kuwait-allows-women-to-serve-in-army-report-101634044739361.html

His comments came on a day India, the US, Japan and Australia kicked off the second phase of this year’s Malabar naval drills in the Bay of Bengal, with the exercise seeking to build on the synergy and interoperability developed during the first phase held in August.“In future, that exercise could expand. It is for the partners inside the Quad to discuss that. But remember, there are many exercises that go on in the Indo-Pacific and globally which bring like-minded navies and partners together,” Gilday said, in response to a question on the possibility of more navies coming together under the Malabar banner. He is in India on a five-day official visit.The second phase of the Malabar exercise is being conducted from October 12 to 15. Gilday said the cyber domain is one area that the Quad navies would continue to refine in terms of working together as well as high-end operations in the air, on and under the sea.“We are committed to operationalizing our #USIndiaDefense partnership, including through enhanced information-sharing, regional security, and exercising at sea together,” he wrote on Twitter. The Quad navies conducted the first phase of the exercise off the Pacific Ocean island of Guam from August 26-29. It involved destroyers, frigates, corvettes, submarines, helicopters, long-range maritime patrol aircraft and elite special forces elements, including the US Navy SEALs and the Indian Navy’s marine commandos (MARCOS). The Indian Navy is taking part in the exercise’s second phase with INS Ranvijay, INS Satpura, P-8I long-range maritime patrol aircraft and a submarine. The US Navy is represented by the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson along with USS Lake Champlain and USS Stockdale while Japan is taking part with JS Kaga and JS Murasame. The Royal Australian Navy has sent HMAS Ballarat and HMAS Sirius for the drills. Malabar began as an annual bilateral naval exercise between India and the US in 1992. It has increased in scope and complexity over the years. It was in the 2005 edition of the drills that the aircraft carriers from the Indian and the US Navy operated together for the first time. In 2014, the Japanese Maritime Self Defence Force (JMSDF) became a permanent participant in the drills followed by Australia in 2020. The Quad navies earlier carried out complex naval drills under the Malabar banner in November 2020 in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. Wary of the Quad, China has been monitoring its activities closely. The Quad was revived in late 2017 by India, the US, Australia and Japan, increasing Beijing’s suspicions as the four countries upgraded the forum to the ministerial level in 2019. From carrying out naval drills with like-minded countries to reaching out to states in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), the Indian Navy is focusing on checking China’s rising ambitions in the region and sending out a strong message that Beijing’s power play in the South China Sea cannot be replicated in the Indian Ocean.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scope-of-malabar-drills-could-expand-in-future-us-admiral-101634046678558.html

12-10-2021||World||IMF cuts China growth forecast for 2021 and 2022||China's economy will grow slower than initially expected this year owing to a "stronger-than-anticipated" pullback in public spending, the International Monetary Fund forecast Tuesday while warning that a weakening property market could bring a further blow.The 8.0 percent prediction in the IMF's latest World Economic Outlook report is down 0.1 percentage points from its July estimate as analysts warn China is facing a painful fallout from real estate weakness and shocks from surging coal prices and shortages.But the figure is still China's strongest growth rate since 2011.The world's second-largest economy was the only major one to expand last year after the coronavirus pandemic forced governments across the globe to lock down.The IMF also lowered its outlook for next year to 5.6 percent.Concerns over China have intensified in recent weeks as government curbs on the property market piled pressure on overleveraged developers -- notably Evergrande.Measures by local governments to meet short-term climate targets also led to a power crunch.On Tuesday, the IMF said: "China's prospects for 2021 are marked down slightly due to stronger-than-anticipated scaling back of public investment."The downward adjustment is the IMF's second since April, when it pegged full-year growth at 8.4 percent.It also warned of risks that could threaten the resilience of the recovery."Large-scale disorderly corporate debt defaults or restructuring, for instance in China's property sector, could reverberate widely," it said.The travails of Evergrande, which is struggling with more than $300 billion in liabilities, have thrown a spotlight on China's property developers -- after Beijing introduced metrics to cap debt ratios last year.While analysts generally believe the firm's problems will not trigger a "Lehman moment", many warn they will worsen a slowdown in the property sector, which accounts for a massive part of the Chinese economy.The IMF added that an escalation of trade and technology tensions between the United States and China could "weigh on investment and productivity growth, raising additional roadblocks in the recovery path".Should the world's two biggest economies decouple in basic scientific research, there could also be "big negative effects" on global productivity, with an estimated decline of up to 0.8 percent to start, it said.And in the longer term, demographic challenges in China and other emerging markets make it more pressing to reverse a persistent decline in long-term growth and build a more buoyant post-pandemic global economy.Census results published in May this year showed China's population growing at the slowest pace in decades, fuelling concerns of a demographic slump in the ageing country.Meanwhile, the IMF expects monetary policy in China to be "moderately tight" in 2021, and for this trend to remain into next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-cuts-china-growth-forecast-for-2021-and-2022-101634044790695.html

Speaking at an event in Qatar, Amir Khan Muttaqi, the acting foreign minister of the Taliban government, said that the previous government failed to bring reforms in 20 years despite strong international support but the world now wants to bring in the reforms in two months, reported Tolo News."You should not seek your demands through putting pressure on us, ask us through cooperation," Muttaqi said at the event organised by the Center for Conflict and Humanitarian Studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies.The Taliban government is seeking recognition from the international community but most of the countries have opted for a wait-and-watch policy and demanded the Sunni Pashtun group to fulfil their promises of an inclusive government and respect for human rights, especially that of women and girls.On Sunday, the United States and the Taliban held talks in Doha for the first time after the final withdrawal of US troops in August. US state department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement that the talks revolved around the safe passage of Americans, other foreign nationals and Afghan partners. Price added that the Taliban will be “judged on its actions, not only its words.”Muttaqi said that "the full implementation of the Doha agreement signed between the US and Afghanistan can address any problem between the two countries," according to Tolo News.The Taliban’s months-long offensive against the Afghan defence forces that led to the ouster of Ashraf Ghani-led government disrupted the work at government offices and several schools were closed. But the group has defended the disruption saying the schools were already closed due to the coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19)."Schools for boys and girls were closed before us because of Covid. When Kabul fell to our hands, all schools were closed already. Schools in provinces were closed already. We have started reopening the schools," Tolo News quoted Muttaqi as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-want-world-to-seek-cooperation-not-make-demands-by-putting-pressure-101634028639386.html

Hasina joined the ceremony from Dhaka via video conference.India’s Hindustan Construction Company has bagged a $110 million contract for civil works at the Rooppur plant in a joint venture with Bangladesh’s MAX Group. The Indian company holds a 40% share in the joint venture.Indian firms are able to participate in construction work and supply of non-critical equipment for the project under a trilateral agreement signed by India, Russia, and Bangladesh in 2018.Hasina thanked Russia for its support for the Rooppur project. The installation of the reactor pressure vessel of the first unit of the nuclear plant confirms Bangladesh’s “strong presence in the nuclear world so far as peaceful use of nuclear technology is concerned”, she said.“After being convinced about safety and management of nuclear waste at the meeting with President [Vladimir] Putin in 2013, I decided to go for nuclear,” she said.“As this technology doesn’t have carbon emissions, hence it is eco-friendly and will help fight adverse effects of climate change. This power station will help us achieve SDG goals by 2030 in line with our development plan and facilitate graduation to a developed nation in 2041,” she added.Also Read: Temple located in no-man’s land between India and Bangladesh preps to celebrate Durga PujaWork for installing the reactor pressure vessel started on September 14. Over the course of two weeks, the reactor was moved inside the containment building. The 334-tonne structure was installed into its design position, and Likhachev said the development had brought Bangladesh closer to its goal of developing its nuclear power industry.“The high qualification of specialists and the thorough preparation ensured the performance of the works with pinpoint precision...The development of nuclear power industry will not only resolve the problem of energy supply in Bangladesh but will also contribute to the development of the region and enhance the living standards of the people,” Likhachev said.Following the ceremony, Likhachev and the prime minister discussed issues of strategic cooperation between Rosatom and Bangladesh.The Rooppur nuclear power plant is located on the bank of the Ganges river at a distance of 160 km from the capital Dhaka. The facility is designed and constructed by Rosatom. The plant will have two VVER-1200 reactors with an expected life cycle of 60 years, which can be extended for another 20 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-nuclear-reactor-pressure-vessel-installed-at-bangladesh-atomic-power-plant-101634030654305.html

The Quebec Order of Nurses (OIIQ) announced that those who were not yet vaccinated against Covid-19 would be suspended from practising on October 15. According to the OIIQ, as reported by the news outlet Global News, out of 80,000 nurses in Quebec, nearly 4,000 are not “properly vaccinated” against Covid-19 and the status of another 5,716 is unclear.In a Facebook post in French, the nurses’ union, Fédération interprofessionnelle de la santé du Québec (FIQ), threatened legal action if the decision to make Covid-19 vaccination mandatory caused “disproportionate harm to our members”.Similar developments are emerging across the country as Covid-19 vaccine mandates gradually come into effect. Layoffs at a hospital in Ontario have already been reported, even as the coronavirus pandemic is ongoing.A wider government mandate, announced by Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last week, will come into effect on October 30, and that is also being criticised and challenged by unions.The Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC), which represents 215,000 government employees, has said while the vast majority of its membership “is fully vaccinated” against Covid-19, it will “continue to represent unvaccinated members who have punitive action taken against them as a result of their vaccination status”.While it stated that it “fully supports a federal vaccination policy to protect the health and safety of our members and the Canadians they serve”, the union also affirmed that the “government rushed their vaccination policy without meaningful consultation with the unions representing federal public service workers”.The point of view was echoed by the union representing the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), which will also come under the Covid-19 vaccine mandate. Brian Sauvé, the National Police Federation’s (NPF) president, said it was “disappointed at the government’s engagement-by-notification approach to the policy’s release”.It added that the NPF will “continue to support [its] members’ access to vaccines, and their choice to be vaccinated or not”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canada-rolls-out-vaccine-mandates-draws-ire-sparks-tensions-101634022433724.html

A UPS worker, who was on the ground, was the second person to have been killed in the crash. Dr Sugata Das, who worked as an interventional cardiologist at the Yuma Regional Medical Center (YRMC) in Arizona, owned the small Cessna C340 plane, according to the centre. "We are deeply sad to hear news of a plane owned by local cardiologist Sugata Das, which crashed near Santee (California). As an outstanding cardiologist and dedicated family man, Das leaves a lasting legacy. We extend our prayers and support to his family, colleagues, and friends during this difficult time,” YRMC's chief medical officer Bharat Magu said in a statement.Das, who was born in a Bengali family and grew up in Pune, was a father to two boys and lived in San Diego. He was the owner of a twin-engine Cessna 340 and an instrument-rated pilot who flew between his home and Yuma. He was also the director of the Power of Love Foundation, a US non-profit organisation involved in helping women and children overseas infected or affected by AIDS and HIV, according to its website.The crash near Santana High School in Santee appeared to have sparked a fire that burned at least two homes, damaged five others and several vehicles, but responding firefighters were able to put out the blaze before it spread to other houses.UPS confirmed that one of its employees was killed during the plane crash. "We are heartbroken by the loss of our employee, and extend our deepest condolences to his family and friends. We also send our condolences for the other individuals who are involved in this incident, and their families and friends." KXTV, an ABC affiliate, reported, citing a statement issued by UPS.Authorities received reports of a plane down in a neighbourhood on Greencastle Street at around 12:30pm (local time), according to the KXTV report. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the plane was a twin-engine Cessna C340 and crashed at about 12:15pm. "We do not yet know how many people were on board,” it said.The Cessna C340, which is usually used for business and is pressurised, can seat six passengers, with two seats in the front and two in the back.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/puneborn-cardiologist-among-2-killed-in-california-plane-crash-101634019942801.html

They attended the G20 Trade and Investment Ministerial Meeting, and also held bilateral discussions on the margins of the event.Mary Ng tweeted that they discussed “working together towards economic recovery, which includes progressing bilateral trade, including the flow of agricultural products”. She also said they talked about reforms to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and “ambitious outcomes” ahead of its 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12) in Geneva, Switzerland later this year.Piyush Goyal tweeted about the meeting saying talks were on “for a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), with energy, new technologies, and manufactured goods and services being key areas for future cooperation”.Ajay Bisaria, India’s high commissioner to Canada, described the meeting between Piyush Goyal and Mary Ng on the sidelines of the G20 summit as “excellent” and added that the CEPA, if it is sealed, “will strengthen economic engagement”.After languishing for nearly four years, Indian and Canadian negotiators resumed discussions in June towards a possible trade pact between the two countries.The discussions, held virtually, were undertaken by officials of India’s commerce ministry and those from Canada’s international trade department. They had revisited the planned CEPA, which has been under consideration for a full decade after talks were initiated under then Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Stephen Harper, Canada’s PM at that time.The last round of negotiations was held in August 2017. While Canadian officials wanted to clinch a Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (FIPA) prior to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s visit to India in February 2018, New Delhi was more interested in sealing the CEPA first. However, with bilateral relations turning sour following that visit, fresh talks were not scheduled.In the backdrop of Piyush Goyal’s meeting with Mary Ng alongside the G20 summit in Italy, a senior Indian official said discussions are now on for a “CEPA-lite”, a streamlined version of the deal, which would take into account areas of convergence and interest to the two nations.The last ministerial-level dialogue on CEPA was held in September 2016 by two leaders who are now both finance ministers - Nirmala Sitharaman, then commerce minister, and Chrystia Freeland, minister of international trade at that time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g20-in-italy-piyush-goyal-holds-talks-with-canada-s-mary-ng-with-eye-on-cepa-101634017452671.html

The statement comes almost a week after Nato chief Jeans Stoltenberg said that the allies need to stay vigilant about the escalating situation in Afghanistan and "be ready to strike and monitor closely any attempts to reconstitute international terrorist groups in Afghanistan, aiming at us"."The Nato Secretary-General, for a while, may feel his pain and talk about their failures, but they should know that the time for attacks is over," said Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid in an interview with local media. "It was proven twenty years ago that these actions did not work and should be dealt with through diplomacy," Mujahid added.The Taliban officials also said that the group, designated as a terrorist organisation by the United States and now ruling over Afghanistan, will never allow the country to be used as a centre for proxy wars between the world powers.In the interview, Mujahid also spoke against the interference by other countries in the internal affairs of Afghanistan and it "will not accept it." "I have to say 100 per cent that we do not want anyone to interfere, including Pakistan," he said, adding, "We are an independent country. We do not accept these interventions. Pakistan is a separate country. We do not want to interfere in their affairs and they cannot interfere (in Afghanistan's affairs)."On the economic crisis, Mujahid said that talks are on with other regional countries including Uzbekistan for trade support. A promising deal was reached with Iran last week on exports of fuel and food as well as rail and border security, among other issues, the spokesperson also informed at the interview.Taliban took over Afghanistan in a military offensive in the aftermath of troop withdrawal from Afghanistan by the United States and its other Nato allies. The chaotic exit led to a major humanitarian crisis for Afghanistan as it brought the country back to 1991 when the group was ousted by the US troops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/time-for-attacks-is-over-engage-through-diplomacy-taliban-to-nato-101634008111536.html
12-10-2021||World||US 'root cause' of tensions, says North Korea's Kim Jong Un||The leader of nuclear-armed North Korea, Kim Jong Un, has blamed the United States for tensions on the peninsula, state media reported Tuesday.The US is the "root cause" of instability, he said in an opening speech at a defence exhibition, according to the official Korean Central News Agency.Pyongyang is under multiple international sanctions over its banned nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, which have made rapid progress under Kim.In 2017, it tested missiles that can reach the whole of the continental US and carried out by far its most powerful nuclear explosion to date, and Pyongyang says it needs its arsenal to protect itself against a US invasion.The Biden administration has repeatedly stated that it has no hostile intent towards the North, but Kim told the "Self-Defence 2021" exhibition: "I am very curious if there are people or countries who believe that.""There is no basis in their actions for believing that it is not hostile," he added, according to KCNA.Kim's address came after the North in recent weeks tested a long-range cruise missile, a train-launched weapon, and what it said was a hypersonic warhead.In 2018, Kim became the first North Korean leader ever to meet a sitting US president at the headline-grabbing Singapore summit.But the talks process has been largely at a standstill since a second meeting in Hanoi the following year collapsed over sanctions relief and what Pyongyang would be willing to give up in return.The Biden administration has said it is willing to meet North Korean officials at any time or place, without preconditions, in its efforts to seek denuclearisation.Washington and Seoul are security allies and Washington stations around 28,500 troops in the South to defend it against its neighbour, which invaded in 1950.The South and the United States held joint military exercises in August. The wargames always infuriate Pyongyang, which decries them as preparations for invasion.Seoul is itself on a multi-billion-dollar drive to step up its own military capabilities, successfully testing its first submarine-launched ballistic missile in September -- putting the South among an elite group of nations with proven SLBM technology -- and revealing a supersonic cruise missile.Last week, Pyongyang and Seoul reconnected their cross-border hotline in a sign of thawing ties, with only a few months left in office for the South's pro-engagement President Moon Jae-in.But Kim accused Seoul of "reckless ambition" and a "two-faced, illogical" attitude.Their "unrestricted and dangerous attempts to strengthen military power are destroying the military balance on the Korean peninsula and increasing military instability and danger", he added.Party timeThe exhibition is part of the commemorations for the anniversary of the foundation of the ruling Workers' Party, and included aerobatics flights and martial arts displays.Pyongyang closed its borders early last year to protect itself against the coronavirus pandemic that first emerged in neighbouring China, its key diplomatic ally and main provider of trade and aid.The North insists it has had no cases of the disease -- experts doubt the claim -- but the self-imposed blockade has isolated it more effectively than any sanctions regime and has hit its economy badly.Kim referred to the "grim situation" in a lengthy speech to mark the party anniversary, calling for discipline and loyalty.A United Nations expert panel said this month that the North had continued to pursue its weapons development despite its economic travails.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-root-cause-of-tensions-says-north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-101633999780011.html

12-10-2021||India||Affiliation of 100 schools with Sainik School Society approved||The Union Cabinet on Tuesday cleared the proposal of affiliation of 100 schools, including both private and public, with the Sainik School Society, an autonomous organisation under the ministry of defence. The decision was taken during the Union cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday. “In a paradigm shift to the existing pattern of Sainik Schools, the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in its meeting held today has approved the proposal for the launching of affiliated Sainik Schools under Sainik Schools Society, Ministry of Defence (MoD). These Schools function as an exclusive vertical which will be distinct and different from existing Sainik Schools of MoD. In the first phase, 100 affiliate partners are proposed to be drawn from States/NGOs/Private partners,” the government said in a statement. According to the government, the decision has been taken in line with the new National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 that advocates “value-based education, enabling children to develop pride in the rich culture and heritage of this nation, effective leadership with character, discipline, sense of national duty and patriotism.” Currently, there are 33 Sainik Schools in the country that account for a large number of candidates who join the armed forces. Until now, Sainik Schools were set up after receiving requests from state governments/union territories who have to provide infrastructures such as land and educational/ residential buildings. In March this year, the government informed the Parliament that it was working on a new scheme to set up more Sainik Schools in the country in partnership with non-governmental organisations, private schools and state governments. Before that, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in this year’s budget speech announced that India will set up 100 new Sainik schools in partnership with NGOs, private schools, and states. In its statement on Tuesday, the government said that around 5000 students will be enrolled in class 6th in these 100 schools from the next academic session i.e 2022-23.The government has invited proposals from government or private schools or NGOs to apply for affiliation. “The scheme will leverage Public/private partnership in the education sector, help tap into existing infrastructure available with reputed private and government Schools and open up new capacities to meet the growing aspirations of children desirous of receiving education in a Sainik School environment,” the statement added.Figures testify the role of Sainik Schools as feeder institutions for the armed forces. In 2018, the National Defence Academy, known as the cradle of military leadership inducted a total of 662 cadets of whom 147 (22.2%) were from Sainik Schools. The preceding year the number was even higher. In 2017, of the 644 cadets who joined NDA, 179 (27.8%) were from Sainik Schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/affiliation-of-100-schools-with-sainik-school-society-approved-101634063179799.html

It will be allowed to lapse because the government felt it needed a wider consultation which we will do in the next assembly session of the new assembly. We will have a new bill if required,” Goa’s legislative affairs minister Mauvin Godinho said on Tuesday.The Bhumiputra Bill proposed to consider anyone who has lived in Goa for at least 30 years as a bhumiputra (son of the soil) and allowed them to seek ownership rights to the small housing units in which they live. Chief minister Pramod Sawant, who fiercely defended the legislation on and off social media, had insisted that the legislation was aimed at helping people who live in houses smaller than 250sq metres built on government or community land.The legislation exposed Sawant to sharp criticism that accused the government of encouraging people who encroached public and community land.The legislation was sharply criticised by the opposition and activists, prompting the Pramod Sawant government to put it on hold and not send it to the governor for Raj Bhavan’s assent. Sawant announced in early August that the government will bring an amended version of the controversial law that will incorporate suggestions received from the public.The Goa Bhumiputra Adhikarini Bill, 2021, was tabled and hurriedly passed barely hours after it was introduced in the state assembly on Friday (July 29). According to the proposed law, any person who is a resident of Goa for more than 30 years qualifies as a ‘bhumiputra’ (son of the soil) and can apply for ownership of the house (up to a plinth area of 250 square metres) they have been living in even if the land on which it stands is owned by the government, a private person or commonly owned. Any structure built before April 1, 2019 qualified for ownership under this law. Sawant said applicants would have to produce water and electricity bills in their name as proof.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-govt-to-let-controversial-bhumiputra-bill-to-lapse-says-minister-101634061919094.html

Your untiring efforts have ushered in a new era of peace, and law and order in Jammu and Kashmir, and the northeast," justice (retd) Mishra said.Also read | At NHRC event, PM Modi warns against ‘selective interpretation’ of human rightsOn August 5, 2019, Shah had declared in Parliament the abrogation of articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution that gave Jammu & Kashmir a special status, and divided the state into two UTs -- J&K and Ladakh.When the Rajya Sabha had approved a resolution on abrogating Article 370 amid loud protests from some of the Opposition parties, Shah had said, "Article 370 is the biggest hurdle to normalcy in the state".Allaying the Opposition’s fears of a deteriorating law and order over the move, Shah had then said, “nothing will happen” and the region would not be allowed to turn into another battle-torn Kosovo.Also read | Terrorists gun down three civilians in separate attacks in SrinagarFollowing his announcement, curfew was imposed and internet services remained suspended for a long time, amid protests from several quarters, with a few human rights groups expressing apprehensions over the issue. A large number of mainstream politicians, including former chief minister Farooq Abdullah, his son Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, were detained and kept under hose arrest for months.The former apex court judge, who had taken charge as the new chairperson of the NHRC on June 2 this year, had earlier raised a controversy while praising the PM during his tenure as a judge of the Supreme Court. Speaking at the International Judicial Conference 2020, he had termed Modi as an "internationally acclaimed visionary" and a "versatile genius, who thinks globally and acts locally".Meanwhile, Shah, in his address, said the central government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had been relentlessly working for the welfare of poor, backwards and deprived sections of society, thus protecting their human rights.Modi, who was the chief guest on the occasion, warned against engaging in "selective interpretation" of human rights with an eye on political gains and loss, saying such conduct harms human rights as well as democracy.During the address, the NHRC chief also said India had emerged as a powerful entity on a global level, and it had earned recognition as a new power, and the credit went to "people of India, the country's constitutional system and the leadership".Later, senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member Jairam Ramesh alleged that the democratic space in India continued to "shrink"."The PM & HM have made a mockery of human rights since their Gujarat days. Now they are joined in the jugalbandi by Chairman of NHRC no less, a judge who sat in judgment on his own earlier order and claimed no conflict of interest.

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was dismissed this evening by the man he had sacked earlier in the day: Army chief General Pervaiz Musharraf.Shortly after Gen Musharraf’s dismissal was announced by the government this morning, troops took positions around Mr Sharif’s residence, the state-run Pakistan TV building, the main airports and all major government buildings.PTV recommenced its telecasts later in the evening to announce that the Pakistan Muslim League Government of Mr Sharif had been dismissed and Gen Musharraf would be addressing the nation “shortly”.The PTV announcement about the dismissal of the Sharif Government did not specify who had ordered his dismissal.Mr. Sharif and the man he chose to replace Gen Musharraf, Gen Ziauddin was house. Policemen guarding his official residence were disarmed and the PM was asked not to leave the building.In Washington, US government spokesman James Rubin said the Clinton Administration “naturally hoped” that the Constitution of Pakistan would be adhered to “in letter and spirit”.CNN’s Islamabad correspondent Imtiaz Gul reported that there were “spontaneous” show of public support shortly after it was clear that a coup had been staged and the democratically elected government had been unseated.Gen Musharraf, who returned from Colombo this afternoon, was reportedly given a ceremonial welcome by the Army at Karachi airport.An AP report said he was met at the airport by a large contingent of soldiers. He was seen leaving the airport accompanied by several jeeps filled with soldiers. He did not talk to reporters.Soldiers also have taken over the homes of several Sharif ministers, including information minister Mushaid Hussain, foreign minister Sartaj Aziz and accountability chief Saif-ur Rehman. In New Delhi, officials said troop along the border with Pakistan were on “full alert”. In Washington, senior Clinton Administration officials said messages had been sent to the Pakistan Army through diplomatic channels that the US does not support any military takeover anywhere, that the Constitution has to be respected and it would be not right to presume it would be business as usual after a democratically elected government is overthrown. Earlier in the day, the official APP news agency said Mr Sharif had “retired” Gen Musharraf “with immediate effect” and that Lt Gen Ziauddin, chief of the Inter Services Intelligence, had been promoted to full General and made the new Chief of the Army Staff. The sacking of the Army chief comes barely a fortnight after Mr Sharif publicly gave him a vote of confidence. The announcement on state television gave no reason for Gen Musharraf being “relieved” of his job, but the General has been at the centre of a political storm since late May when tension with India over Kashmir flared up. When asked what was going on at the PTV headquarters in downtown Islamabad, one of the Army officers surrounding the building told Reuters: “You will find out in a short while.” In 1998, Gen Musharraf’s predecessor Gen Jehangir Karamat was forced to resign after suggesting setting up of a national security council that would give the Army greater say in the running of the administration. Gen Musharraf’s removal by the PML government earlier in the day came in the wake of reports of growing differences between him and Mr Sharif and fears of another Army coup in Pakistan. This had even prompted the United States to issue a statement late last month that it would strongly oppose any extra-constitutional change in Islamabad. In an apparent conciliatory move towards the powerful Army, Mr Sharif, on September 29 had extended by one-and-a-half years till October 6 next year the additional charge of Gen Musharraf as JCSC. He was appointed as Army chief for three years last October after his predecessor, Gen Karamat resigned following differences with Mr Sharif. Pakistan’s Naval chief, Admiral Fasih Bukhari resigned on October 2, apparently for not being considered for the crucial JCSC’s post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-october-13-1999-sharif-overthrown-in-military-coup-101634058019008.html
12-10-2021||India||India cites rising terrorism in Africa, Afghan regime at UN debate on peacebuilding||India on Tuesday raised its concerns over the rising threat of terrorism in Africa, while also noting that nations that witnessing conflicts or emerging from them were facing multiple challenges in their path towards sustaining peace.Addressing the UN Security Council High Level Open Debate on ‘Peacebuilding and sustaining peace: Diversity, state building and the search for peace’, Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan also spoke about the change in leadership in Afghanistan that he said happened neither through negotiations nor was it inclusive, while calling for a broad-based and inclusive process that involved representation of all sections of its citizens.Muraleedharan said the expectations of the international community on the war-ravaged nation, including on combating terrorism, were set out clearly in the UN Security Council Resolution 2593, that was adopted under India’s Presidency of the 15-nation Council in August."It is important that commitments made in this regard are respected and adhered to,” he said.Also read | At G20 meet, PM Modi calls for unified response to deal with Afghanistan crisisThe UN Security Council resolution 2593 on Afghanistan mandated that Afghan territory be not used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or finance terrorist acts, and reiterated the importance of combating terrorism in Afghanistan, including those individuals and entities designated pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999), and noted the Taliban’s relevant commitments.Speaking about terrorism in Africa, the minister said extremist forces and groups were receiving encouragement from member-states which seek to divide communities by legitimising terrorist activities.“Terrorism is a clear manifestation of how forces inimical to unity and diversity can seek to destroy the social cohesion and democratic fabric of countries by, inter alia, fomenting disaffection, hatred and violence,” he said, adding that it the spread of terrorism in Africa was matter of serious concern.He said the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (GCTS) had clearly reinforced yet again that terrorism cannot be justified under any ground and that no country should provide an excuse for such activities. “It is equally important that UN organisations take GCTS as a template and not give any encouragement or excuse, even indirectly, to efforts of member states to justify terrorism in any way.”Muraleedharan told the open debate that “when we deal with countries coming out of conflict and going into peace building, putting in place strong legal framework as well as building credible institutions based on solid principles is critical.“This will also ensure that diversity is protected, and inclusivity is fostered. We need to encourage donor countries which are contributing generously to peace building in Africa and other regions to ensure that those countries coming out of conflict are able to put in place an enduring framework that withstands the test of time,” he said.Noting that the challenge will always be to make tradeoffs between the immediate and long-term, Muraleedharan said that “we believe the UN system as a whole should work closely with member states and regional organisations in line with their national requirement and needs and not advocate imposition of ideas of solutions from outside.”He emphasised that it is now the time to look at peacebuilding in the broader context and in a more focused manner, especially in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, which is threatening to erode the gains we made over the years.He told the debate that India had always played a constructive and significant role in the context of peacebuilding through its extensive development partnership with developing countries, particularly in Africa and Asia and it continued to assist nations bilaterally in post-conflict situations by providing substantial grants and soft loans.Muraleedharan further said there were several successful examples where countries had managed to overcome post-conflict challenges, including South Africa, the transition from apartheid to free and open society; Cote d’Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Rwanda and Burundi, each of which were examples of successful transition of post-conflict state building and South Sudan, where “we are witnessing the transition”."These societies are diverse and have managed to sustain peace through an inclusive approach, by setting examples for similar states to emulate. We also have several other examples, including in South Asia, where diversity has always been the hallmark of societies. The political leadership of respective countries respecting universal values of peace, truth and compassion have contributed immensely to state building," he said.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-cites-rising-terrorism-in-africa-afghan-regime-at-un-peacebuilding-debate-101634056724197.html

The decision comes amid the Covid-19 pandemic that brought the research work of PhD students to a standstill in the last one and a half years.“The UGC, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, has decided to extend the date of applicability of PhD as a mandatory qualification for direct recruitment of assistant professors in departments of universities from 01.07.2021 to 01.07.2023,” the commission said in a statement.In 2018, the UGC set the criteria for recruitments for entry-level posts at universities and colleges. It gave a three-year window to candidates to complete their PhDs and asked all universities and colleges to start applying the criteria for recruitment from the 2021-22 academic session.“The Commission made an amendment in the UGC (Minimum Qualifications for Appointment of Teachers and Other Academic Staff in Universities and Colleges and Measures for the Maintenance of Standards in Higher Education), Regulation, 2018 regarding clause 3.10 that stipulates that the PhD degree shall be a mandatory qualification for direct recruitment to the post of assistant professor in department of the universities w.e.f. 01.07.2023,” the statement added.Due to the pandemic, many candidates could not complete their PhDs and were appealing to the government to relax the eligibility this year since universities have been shut and research activities suffered due to the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/phd-will-be-mandatory-for-assistant-professor-jobs-from-2023ugc-101634056641556.html

The nine-day-long festival that accompanies a period of fasting incites happiness and rejoicing among everyone. This period of abstinence is aimed at renewing our spiritual energy. For many, Navratri fasting is the ideal way to detox. Observing a fast not onlyenhances the digestive capacity of one’s body but also ensures that the harmfultoxins are flushed. Although fasting can be a great way to shape up your body and lose some weight, if not properly executed, the gains made during such fasts can be lost within a very short period of time, much to our chagrin. “Instead of going into a calorie deficit for weight loss, some people increasetheir meal frequency in the name of fasting and they, in turn, increase theircalorie consumption,” says Dietitian Rajat Jain, Weight Loss Expert & Founder of Health Wealth Clinics Jaipur. Kuttu ki puri, singhade ka halwa, Sabudana Vada, sabudana khichdi are some of the favourite dishes loved in Navratri. And these fasting dishes are much more palatable and tempting and you might end up eating much more in your fasting days than you normally do.“The secret of losing weight is not changing the quantity but the quality of your intake. During Navratras when we aspire to come closer to the divine, the process becomes even simpler as we naturally are inclined to consume ‘Satvik’ food during these pious days. Sattvic diet has high fibre, low fat with a higher satiety factor,” says Aman Jaiswal, Chef Patron , La Marinate.Fresh fruits, fresh fruit juices, sprouts, nuts, taken during fasts provide high nutrition and also help to detoxify the system.“Stick with roti/ cheela made with flours that are ok to have during fasts like kuttu/ rajgira /singhara instead of deep fried dishes made from the same. Add roasted peanuts, curd and paneer to amp up your protein intake. Dry fruits are great way to spike up your energy levels with quick snacking. Makhanas, almonds, walnuts, raisins and pistachios should be your go to snack,” says Diksha Chhabra, Certified nutritionist and a fitness trainer.Nutritionist Harshita Dilawri, Know Your Nutrients suggests healthy recipes like potato with mint chutney, pumpkin halwa, potato lauki muthias (dumplings), carrot kheer, pineapple apple carrot smoothie, rajgira paneer paratha, green peas sundal (stir fried). “You can make your own healthy combos with the right combinations. Start your day with a cup of green tea and two dates. Opt for sabudana khichdi/ rajgira roti with lauki/ arbi sabzi and a glass of chach with rock salt. Another combination which works well is starting with vegetable soup, a bowl of salad with kuttu ka atta/rajgira roti and sabzi followed by low-fat lauki halwa or carrot halwa,” says Dilawri.For those fitness enthusiasts who have been relentlessly hitting the gym and feel the fast will be a spoiler for their customary fitness visits, Vikas Chawla, founder and director, Vedas Cure has a tip, “The pro tip is to stick on to the home-cooked meals and avoid packaged foods like salted chips, and keep the body moving as much as possible. Physical exercise and walking are not only energy boosters but help in burning the calories at a faster rate,” he says.Yash Vardhan Swami, health coach and fitness educator cautions all those fasting peeps, “Losing weight during Navratri fasting is actually possible. But remember, it’s just 9 days, so do not expect to lose a lot of kgs. All we need to do is to ensure that the Navratra food is not fried, we are moving enough and are having enough protein.”Happy Navratri, happy fasting!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navratri-fast-fasting-like-a-boss-and-losing-weight-too-101634055330841.html

He also called for an inclusive administration in Kabul to preserve the socio-economic gains of the past two decades.Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi hosted the special summit of the group of 20 major economies amid growing concerns about the excesses of the Taliban set up in Kabul and a worsening humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, including shortages of food, medicines and other essential goods.Since the Taliban took over after the fall of the Ashraf Ghani government on August 15, Afghanistan’s economy has virtually collapsed. A team led by acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi has been holding talks with US officials and European Union (EU) envoys in Qatar as part of the Taliban’s stepped up efforts to gain international recognition.Modi called on the international community to “forge a unified international response without which it would be difficult to bring about the desired change in Afghanistan’s situation”, the external affairs ministry said.He “underlined the need to ensure that Afghan territory does not become a source of radicalisation and terrorism, regionally or globally”, and called on the world community to enhance the “joint fight against the nexus of radicalisation, terrorism and the smuggling of drugs and arms in the region”.Modi also called for an “inclusive administration in Afghanistan, which includes women and minorities”, to preserve the socio-economic gains of the past 20 years and to restrict the spread of radical ideology.The prime minister backed the UN’s important role in Afghanistan and sought renewed support from the G20 for UN Security Council resolution 2593.Resolution 2593, adopted when India held the rotating presidency of the Security Council in August, demands that Afghan soil should not be used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists. It also calls for combating terror in Afghanistan, including UN-designated individuals and entities – a key demand of the Indian side, which has strong concerns about the presence of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) fighters on Afghan territory.The resolution also calls on all parties in Afghanistan to seek an inclusive and negotiated political settlement, with the full participation of women.The international community, Modi said, should ensure that Afghanistan has immediate and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance. Noting that the Afghan people have a “great feeling of friendship” for India, he said that “every Indian feels the pain of Afghan people facing hunger and malnutrition”.Modi also referred to the centuries-old people-to-people ties between India and Afghanistan and said that over the past two decades, India has promoted socio-economic development and capacity-building for Afghan youth and women. He recalled that India had implemented more than 500 development projects in Afghanistan.The summit was convened by Italy, which holds the rotating presidency of the G20. The meeting discussed a response to the humanitarian needs of Afghanistan, security and the fight against terrorism, and mobility and human rights.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen presented an Afghan support package worth one billion euros during the summit to prevent what she described as “humanitarian and socio-economic collapse”. She said while the EU has been clear about the conditions for any engagement with the setup in Kabul, the Afghan people “should not pay the price of the Taliban’s actions”.Chinese President Xi Jinping did not join the G20 summit and it wasn’t clear if Russian President Vladimir Putin would participate, reflecting the differing approaches to the situation in Afghanistan. While Western countries want to demand accountability from the Taliban, China and Russia have adopted a position of non-interference. In recent weeks, India has cautioned the world community not to rush into recognising the Taliban setup, pointing out that the change of power in Afghanistan was not inclusive and was done without negotiations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-g20-special-summit-on-afghanistan-pm-modi-calls-for-inclusive-administration-in-kabul-101634054539898.html

12-10-2021||India||Modi to launch Gati Shakti master plan tomorrow||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch the PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan for multi-modal connectivity at Pragati Maidan in New Delhi on Wednesday.Infrastructure creation in India had suffered for decades from multiple issues. There was lack of coordination between different departments, for example, once a road was constructed, other agencies dug up the constructed road again for activities like laying of underground cables, gas pipelines etc. “This not only caused great inconvenience but was also a wasteful expenditure. To address this, efforts were put in place to increase coordination so that all cables, pipelines etc. could be laid simultaneously. Steps have also been taken to address other issues like time-taking approval process, multiplicity of regulatory clearances etc. In the last seven years, the government has ensured unprecedented focus on infrastructure through a holistic outlook,” the Press Information Bureau said in a statement on Tuesday.PM GatiShakti will address the past issues through institutionalising holistic planning for stakeholders for major infrastructure projects. Instead of planning and designing separately in silos, the projects will be designed and executed with a common vision. It will incorporate the infrastructure schemes of various ministries and the state governments like Bharatmala, Sagarmala, inland waterways, dry/land ports, UDAN etc. Economic zones like textile clusters, pharmaceutical clusters, defence corridors, electronic parks, industrial corridors, fishing clusters, agri zones will be covered to improve connectivity and make Indian businesses more competitive. The Centre said it will also leverage technology extensively including spatial planning tools with ISRO imagery developed by BiSAG-N (Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geoinformatics).PM GatiShakti is based on six pillars:1. Comprehensiveness: It will include all the existing and planned initiatives of various ministries and departments with one centralised portal. Each and every department will now have visibility of each other’s activities providing critical data while planning and execution of projects in a comprehensive manner.2. Prioritisation: Through this, different Departments will be able to prioritize their projects through cross–sectoral interactions.3. Optimisation: The National Master Plan will assist different ministries in planning for projects after identification of critical gaps. For the transportation of the goods from one place to another, the plan will help in selecting the most optimum route in terms of time and cost.4. Synchronisation: Individual ministries and departments often work in silos. There is lack of coordination in planning and implementation of the project resulting in delays. PM GatiShakti will help in synchronising the activities of each department, as well as of different layers of governance, in a holistic manner by ensuring coordination of work between them.5. Analytical: The plan will provide the entire data at one place with GIS based spatial planning and analytical tools having 200+ layers, enabling better visibility to the executing agency.6. Dynamic: All ministries and departments will now be able to visualize, review and monitor the progress of cross-sectoral projects, through the GIS platform, as the satellite imagery will give on-ground progress periodically and progress of the projects will be updated on a regular basis on the portal. It will help in identifying the vital interventions for enhancing and updating the master plan.PM GatiShakti is the result of Prime Minister’s constant endeavour to build Next Generation Infrastructure which improves ‘Ease of Living’ as well as Ease of Doing Business. The multi-modal connectivity will provide integrated and seamless connectivity for movement of people, goods and services from one mode of transport to another. It will facilitate the last mile connectivity of infrastructure and also reduce travel time for people.PM GatiShakti will provide the public and business community information regarding the upcoming connectivity projects, other business hubs, industrial areas and surrounding environment. This will enable the investors to plan their businesses at suitable locations leading to enhanced synergies. It will create multiple employment opportunities and give a boost to the economy. It will improve the global competitiveness of local products by cutting down the logistics costs and improving the supply chains, and also ensure proper linkages for local industry and consumers.Prime Minister will also inaugurate the New Exhibition Complex (Exhibition Halls 2 to 5) at Pragati Maidan during the event. India Trade Promotion Organisation’s flagship event, India International Trade Fair (IITF) 2021 will also be held between November 14 and November 27, 2021, in these new exhibition halls.Union ministers for commerce, road transport and highways, railways, civil aviation, shipping, power, petroleum and natural gas will also be present on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-to-launch-gati-shakti-master-plan-tomorrow-101634047819206.html

Yadav used the opportunity to attack the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state, saying it has "crushed farmers", in an apparent reference to the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in which eight people, including four farmers, were mowed down allegedly by Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Mishra Teni’s son Ashish Mishra.The SP chief further remarked that if the BJP were to come back to power in Uttar Pradesh, it would "crush the Constitution" as well, reported news agency PTI. "Therefore, the Samajwadi Vijay Rath will go to people and throw the BJP out of power," the former CM said. "This rath will go on continuously for restoring the rights and honour of farmers," he added.Akhilesh launched the yatra after seeking the blessings of his father Mulayam Singh Yadav on Monday. He aims to cover all the 403 assembly segments in Uttar Pradesh for the state polls slated for 2022 in a Mercedes bus which has been transformed into the "rath”. The rath displays the photographs of Mulayam Singh Yadav, Dalit icon BR Ambedkar, Acharya Narendra Dev, Ram Manohar Lohia, Jayprakash Narayan, former president APJ Abdul Kalam, party veteran Janeshwar Mishra and jailed MP Mohammad Azam Khan.In the first phase, the yatra will pass through Kanpur, Kanpur Dehat, Hamirpur and Jalaun. The purpose of the yatra is to make people aware of the "corrupt, autocratic and suppressive" policies of the BJP government and establish "real democracy", reported PTI.On the importance of Kanpur, Akhilesh said his party worked for its development. "It is a big and industrial city. Today, business establishments here have closed down. This city can not only give employment to the youth but can also improve the economy of the country and our party will work for it," he said.Akhilesh Yadav exuded confidence that the people of Uttar Pradesh will support the SP and the party will be able to form a government with a majority. "I am confident that people will give their support and the SP government will be formed with a majority," he said.In 1988, a rath yatra was taken out from Kanpur by SP patron Mulayam Singh Yadav. In 2001 and 2011, it was undertaken by Akhilesh Yadav from Lucknow and now it was started from Kanpur ahead of the assembly polls scheduled to be held early next year. In the 2017 assembly polls, the BJP came back to power by winning 309 of the 403 seats. The Samajwadi Party could bag 49 seats while the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-crushed-farmers-will-crush-constitution-too-akhilesh-yadav-101634039393851.html
12-10-2021||India||Himanta Biswa Sarma reaches out to Barak Valley, visits region for Durga Puja||SILCHAR: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Tuesday travelled to Cachar district 300 km from state capital Dispur to celebrate Durga Puja festival in the Barak Valley. Sarma first announced his plan to join the puja celebrations in the Bengali-dominated region of Assam in September, underlining that the trip was designed “to strengthen the togetherness between the two valleys of Assam”.The Barak Valley in south Assam, which comprises three districts, Hailakandi, Karimganj and Cachar, is predominantly home to Bengali-speaking people in contrast to Assam’s Brahmaputra valley, mostly inhabited by Assamese speaking people.Himanta Biswa Sarma started his visit by offering puja in the century-old Shaktipeeth Kachakanti Temple at Udharbond constituency in Cachar district in the morning. Accompanied by forest and environment minister Parimal Suklabaidya and Silchar Lok Sabha member Rajdeep Roy, the chief minister later visited several temples and later, pandals. He also took part in an event organised in memory of a student of National Institute of Technology, Silchar campus who died recently.Sharma appealed to people to adhere to Covid-19 protocols and take adequate safety measures while celebrating.“After a hard fought battle with Covid-19 virus, we have finally come to a situation where puja can be celebrated. But the virus has not completely gone yet, we have to be careful and conscious, so that we do not lose control again. I appeal to all to maintain the covid protocol while celebrating the festival.”Himanta Biswa Sarma had last travelled to Barak valley for Durga Puja in 2019 when he was a minister in the Sarbananda Sonowal’s cabinet.Lawmaker Rajdeep Roy said Sarma’s visit was a “strong message”.“In 75 years of independence, no chief minister of Assam has ever spent Durga Puja in Barak Valley… People here are happy and they are very much excited the chief minister of state is celebrating Durga Puja with them,” he said, inviting the chief minister to visit the region for the puja with his family next time.Sarma’s focus on the Barak Valley is cited as a sharp contrast to the approach of the Tarun Gogoi-led Congress government. In his 15 years as chief minister, BJP leaders said Gogoi’s visits to Barak Valley were far and few between.But when the BJP came in power in 2016, chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal started talking about uniting the two valleys. His slogan “Barak-Bramhaputra Pahar-Bhoyam” (Barak Valley-Brahmaputra valley, Hills and Plains) remained part of almost every speech. Sarma steered clear of the slogan used by his predecessor but he has already made three visits to the Barak Valley.Himanta meets hundreds of people during his visit and analyses the issues where government intervention is required. There has always been allegations that Assam Government deprives Barak Valley when it comes to equal distribution, be it infrastructure development or providing government job. Himanta Biswa Sharma’s visit during Durga Puja will address many sections in Barak Valley.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/himanta-biswa-sarma-reaches-out-to-barak-valley-visits-region-for-durga-puja-101634049918193.html

Speaking at the Group of 20 (G20) Extraordinary Summit on Afghanistan earlier in the day, he also called for urgent and unhindered humanitarian assistance to citizens of the war-ravaged nation and an inclusive administration that would include women and minority communities.In a press release, the government said Modi, who virtually participated in the meeting at the invitation of Italy, which currently holds the G20 presidency, called on the international community to forge a unified response on Afghanistan and a joint fight against the nexus of radicalisation, terrorism and drugs smuggling.The meeting on Tuesday was chaired by Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi to discuss issues related to the humanitarian crisis that has unfolded in Afghanistan following its takeover by the Islamic militants in August this year as the West-backed government led by Ashraf Ghani collapsed.In his remarks, Modi welcomed the initiative of Italy in convening the meeting and spoke about the centuries-old people-to-people ties between India and Afghanistan. He said that over the last two decades, India had contributed immensely towards promotion of socio-economic development and capacity building of youth and women in Afghanistan, adding that over 500 development projects had been implemented by India in the neighbouring country.“The Prime Minister noted that the Afghan people have a great feeling of friendship for India.

Hence, it wants to evaluate the safety of the single-dose vaccine, Corbevax, in vaccinated people.At present, the indigenously developed Corbevax, an RBD protein sub-unit vaccine, is undergoing its second and third-phase trials for being administered to adults between 18 and 80 years and the results are expected to be declared in a few days.Also read | Biological E’s Corbevax may be launched in October: Niti Aayog’s VK PaulIn September, the DCGI had also granted permission to Biological E to conduct phase 2/3 clinical trials of the vaccine in children aged between 5 and 18 years with certain conditions.A PTI report said the Hyderabad-based firm has, meanwhile, put in an application seeking the approval of the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) to conduct the phase-three clinical study of Corbevax as a single booster dose in those fully inoculated with either Covishield or Covaxin."Currently there are several literatures indicating the decline in antibodies in the vaccinated individuals, and that several countries have begun or are in the process of administering booster dose to the people who have completed the primary vaccination," it said."In view of this, we are herewith submitting the application for grant of NOC to conduct a phase-3 clinical study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Corbevax when administered to COVID-19-negative adult volunteers primed with either Covishield or Covaxin," stated the application submitted to DGCI last week.The Subject Expert Committee (SEC) on Covid-19 of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) is likely to take up the matter in its next meeting.The government last week said the science relating to the use of booster doses of Covid-19 vaccines is still evolving and the developments are being closely watched.NITI Aayog Member (Health) Dr VK Paul had said there are several studies that are looking into the subject of booster doses. "This is an evolving science and a paradigm of information...that data is still emerging. We are watching this science very very carefully through our NTAGI system."We know that Covaxin has done a study on booster doses and those results can be available anytime...We also know that WHO has not given a clear-cut recommendation on the matter...we are watching science as it emanates and in India also, there are studies which are looking at this aspect," he had said.Biological E will supply 30 crore doses of Corbevax to the central government by December, as announced by the Union Health Ministry in June. The Union Health Ministry finalised arrangements with Hyderabad-based vaccine manufacturer to reserve 30 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses, an official statement had said.The Biological-E's Covid-19 vaccine candidate has been developed with support from the Department of Biotechnology and its PSU Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) from the preclinical stage to phase-3 studies.The Department of Biotechnology has provided financial assistance to Biological-E in terms of grant-in-aid of over ₹100 crore and also partnered with it to conduct all animal challenge and assay studies through its Research Institute Translational Health Science Technology Institute (THSTI), Faridabad, a health ministry statement earlier had stated.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/biological-e-seeks-dgci-nod-for-phase-3-trial-of-corbevax-as-booster-dose-101634047292607.html

Raut asserted that despite a shortage of coal in the state, the Maharashtra government has made sure that the supply of electricity is not disrupted.“Despite the coal crisis, we have tried to supply electricity to our citizens. Even after the deficiency of coal in the state, only four out of 27 power generation units are currently shut,” news agency ANI quoted Nitin Raut as saying. “As a minister, I can guarantee that there will be no load shedding due to the coal crisis,” he added.Also read: As concerns rise over coal shortage, Centre reassures with ‘fact-check’The minister's assurance came even as power cut warnings poured in from other states across the country. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said the power situation is "very critical" in the entire country. Delhi power minister Satyendar Jain alleged that the Centre has asked NTPC plants to run at 50-55 per cent capacity as their coal stocks were reduced to meet one-two days' need.Kerala electricity minister K Krishnankutty on Monday said the state government will announce a decision on imposing power cuts after October 19, adding that the state was facing a shortage of 100 MW of electricity. In neighbouring Karnataka, power cuts have already been announced in Bengaluru till October 14.Meanwhile, Maha Vikas Agadi (MVA) government's coalition partner Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Tuesday alleged that the Modi government was responsible for the current shortage of coal in the country, PTI reported.During the tenure of the erstwhile UPA government, the then prime minister Manmohan Singh came up with a coal policy keeping in mind the electricity requirements of the country in the future, NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said.But the BJP, then in the opposition, alleged a coal scam and the policy had to be rolled back, said Malik. Eventually, coal mines were given to some entities, but mining has not yet started there, he said, adding that despite the availability of coal, it is not being mined, the NCP leader said. "The Modi government is responsible for the shortage of coal," he further said.On Sunday, amid reports of coal shortage, the coal ministry assured that sufficient dry fuel is available in the country to meet the demand of electricity generating plants. The ministry also downplayed fear of disruption in the power supply, calling it “entirely misplaced”. On Monday, Union home minister Amit Shah convened a meeting with power minister RK Singh and coal minister Pralhad Joshi amid coal shortages in power plants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-coal-crisis-maharashtra-minister-says-there-will-no-load-shedding-in-state-101634042172855.html

The court reserved its order for Monday and said it will announce the quantum of punishment that day.Ram Rahim appeared for the sentencing virtually from Sunaria jail in Rohtak where he is serving a 20-year prison term after being convicted in August 2017 of raping two women disciples of his sect. He has also been sentenced to life for the murder of journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati in 2002.Ranjit Singh, who was also a disciple, was murdered because Ram Rahim suspected him of leaking an anonymous letter detailing the sexual exploitation of women disciples in the dera. A month before he was shot dead in Khanpur Kolian village, Singh was summoned to the dera and threatened with lethal consequences but he did not budge and refused to seek a pardon.Also Read: Convicted of murder, dera chief’s sentencing deferred till October 18The letter, which was purportedly written by a sadhvi, alleged sexual exploitation of women followers in the dera. The matter was probed by the CBI. The investigative agency was also probing the murder of Singh and Chhatrapati whose vernacular production ‘Poora Sach’ was highly critical of the exploits of the dera.The special CBI judge Sushil Kumar Garg also convicted Krishan Lal, Jasbir Singh, Avtar Singh and Sabdil for the murder of Singh, who was shot dead by assailants at his native village in Kurukshetra district on July 10, 2002. One more accused in the murder case died in 2012.Ranjit Singh’s son Jagseer Singh asked for the case to be transferred to another court in neighbouring states after levelling allegations against a CBI lawyer, but the Punjab and Haryana high court dismissed his plea, stating that his allegations were based on surmises and conjectures.The self-styled-godman was born in a Jat Sikh family of Gurusar Modiya village in Sriganganagar district of Rajasthan in August 1967 and succeeded his predecessor Shah Satnam Singh Maharaj as the dera chief at the age of 23. He enjoyed bipartisan patronage from politicians who were known to seek his ‘blessings’ and was also provided with a Z+ security cover by the erstwhile Congress government. In 2014, the controversial dera chief came out in support of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) during the assembly elections which the party won.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-jail-for-rapes-murder-gurmeet-ram-rahim-awaits-sentencing-in-another-case-101634041255726.html

Domestic airlines have been operating at 85% capacity since September 18 owing to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) measures.The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic had prompted the aviation ministry to limit the domestic flights to operate at 50% of their capacity between June 1 and July 5, which was relaxed to 65% up to August 12. The ministry further eased the limit to 72.5% between August 12 and September 18.In the latest order, the ministry stated that "it has been decided to restore the scheduled domestic air operation with effect from October 18, 2021, without any capacity restriction". The decision was taken after a “review of the current status of scheduled domestic operations viz-a-viz passenger demand for air travel", according to the order.The International Air Transport Association (IATA) recently highlighted in a report that India’s domestic traffic reversed the trend, “as demand fell 44.8% in August, improved from a 58.9% decline in July versus July 2019, owing to positive trends in new cases and vaccination.”A relatively lower number of daily new infections per capita has prompted the Central and state governments to ease restrictions in a bid to revive the economy. The massive nationwide vaccination drive has also helped to keep the fresh Covid-19 cases in check and let businesses reopen by following the standard operating procedures (SOPs) issued by the state governments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-allows-domestic-flights-to-operate-at-full-capacity-amid-demand-surge-101634038727674.html

India has also opposed initiatives under BRI such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) because a key stretch passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Jaishankar described terrorism as the “biggest enemy” of the common goal of peace and development for members of CICA, a multinational forum for cooperation to promote security and stability in Asia that was established under Kazakhstan’s leadership in 1999.“In this day and age, we cannot countenance its [terrorism’s] use by one state against another. Cross-border terrorism is not statecraft; it is simply another form of terrorism,” Jaishankar said in an apparent reference to Pakistan.“The international community must unite against this menace, as seriously as it does on issues like climate change and pandemics. Any calculation that extremism, radicalisation, violence, and bigotry can be used to advance interests is a very short-sighted one. Such forces will come back to haunt those who nurture them,” he said.Any lack of stability in the region will undermine collective efforts to bring Covid-19 under control, and the “situation in Afghanistan is, therefore, of grave concern”, he added.Also Watch: Jaishankar tears into Pak for cross-border terror at CICA meet; takes a dig at China's BRI betJaishankar also raised the situation in Afghanistan when the foreign ministers of CICA states collectively called on Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. He said on Twitter that he had underlined CICA’s relevance in addressing challenges such as terrorism, pandemics and protection of global commons, and highlighted that “Afghanistan developments have generated understandable concern”. CICA can be a positive factor in shaping a global response, he added.During his speech at the CICA foreign ministers’ meeting, Jaishankar also said Asia suffers from a “deficit of connectivity”, which is needed to promote economic and social activity.“As we build these modern arteries of commerce, it is absolutely essential that the most basic principles of international relations are observed. Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations rank foremost among them,” he said.“It is also important that connectivity building is a participative and consensual exercise, based on financial viability and local ownership. They must not serve other agendas,” he said, without naming China.India is among the countries that didn’t sign on for BRI, with Indian leaders saying the Chinese initiative doesn’t provide a level playing field and often leads to a “debt trap” for developing countries.Also Read: Suspected terrorist held in Delhi, AK-47 rifle seizedJaishankar said CICA could make a notable contribution to developing resilient and reliable supply chains and additional engines of economic growth in a post-pandemic world. Such efforts put a “premium on greater trust and transparency” in order to boost security and sustainable development in Asia, he said.India will continue to work with other countries to meet challenges and find solutions, as reflected by its decision to provide vaccines, medicines and medical supplies to more than 150 nations during the pandemic, he said. He highlighted the limitations of the multilateral response to Covid-19, saying the need for reformed multilateralism was becoming more urgent.Jaishankar also met his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov on the margins of the CICA meeting in Nur-Sultan and reviewed progress in bilateral cooperation and exchanged views on Afghanistan and the Indo-Pacific.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-returns-to-haunt-jaishankar-s-veiled-message-to-pakistan-101634031314586.html
12-10-2021||India||Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin gets emergency approval for kids aged 2-18 years||The national drugs regulator’s subject expert committee approved the use of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin’s in children between 2 and 18 years of age as a layer of protection against coronavirus or Covid-19 disease, people familiar with the matter said. An official claimed that Covaxin’s efficacy among children was found to be similar to that in adults but a decision on its inclusion in the national vaccination programme was yet to be taken. Covaxin is the second Covid-19 vaccine to be approved for emergency use among children in India after Zydus Healthcare’s ZyCoV-D, meant for children above 12 years of age.“As per the data that the company submitted, the vaccine has been found to be safe and efficacious in children. The experts were of the opinion that it should be allowed for use in children,” a senior official said on condition of anonymity.In May this year, drugs controller general of India Dr VG Somani permitted Bharat Biotech to conduct phase 3 clinical trials of its Covid vaccine on 525 child volunteers. After it ended in September, the trial data was submitted to the drugs regulator in the first week of October.“However, whether it will be introduced in the national Covid-19 immunisation programme, and if yes, then how soon, will be for the expert panel on immunisation to decide,” added the official.If introduced, the vaccination is likely to happen through pre-filled syringes for better dose accuracy, he added.According to the experts involved in the clinical trials, the safety and efficacy of Covaxin in the paediatric age group has been found to be almost similar to that in adults, which was 77.8%, as per the phase 3 clinical trials data on adults. “COVAXIN Clinical trials data of 2-18 years age group has been submitted to Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO). COVAXIN is the first Covid-19 vaccine to be tested in the 2-6 years age group. This was feasible due to the safety of the manufacturing platform and empirical evidence from phase I, II, III clinical trials in adults,” said India’s vaccine major in a statement.Also Read: Will the festive season trigger the third wave?Meanwhile, WHO (World Health Organisation) experts will meet this week to take the final decision on whether to grant emergency use listing to Covaxin-- an inactivated whole virion vaccine. The approval could greatly influence how other countries treat people vaccinated with Covaxin. Experts from WHO, and a group of independent experts, are going through the data, and are expected to carry out the risk-benefit assessment before arriving at a conclusion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-s-covaxin-approved-for-emergency-use-in-children-101634029754231.html

The Drug Controller General of India (DGCI) will give the final approval for the use of Covaxin on children and when that comes through it will become the second vaccine, after Zydus Cadila's DNA-based vaccine ZyCoV-D, to be approved for inoculating kids in the country.Bharat Biotech, the Hyderabad based biotechnology company, submitted data from its Covid-19 vaccine trial in children aged 2 to 18 years to the DCGI on October 6, after being granted approval for conducting trials in children back in May.Sanjay K Rai, a professor at Centre for Community Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), and the principal investigator of Covaxin’s trial on children told news agency ANI that the trial was carried out in three age groups. "Covaxin's trial was done on three age groups. The first group examined was between 12 -18 years, the second group was between 6- 12 years and the third age group was between 2-6 years," he said, claiming that the trial found safety and immunogenicity levels were the same in children as it was in adults.Besides Covaxin and Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D, Serum Institute of India (SII) has also been given permission to conduct phase II and III clinical trials of Novavax in children between 7 and 11 years of age.India is gearing up to vaccinate children as schools and educational institutions start reopening up across the country and experts continue to caution against a potential third wave being deadly for children. Many states have also ramped up paediatric facilities to help combat any rise in Covid-19 infection in children. The Union government has, however, repeatedly insisted that there is no need to panic about successive waves infecting children.m||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-gets-sec-emergency-use-nod-for-children-between-2-18-years-of-age-101634027070575.html

12-10-2021||India||Kejriwal’s 3-point formula for residents to help curb Delhi pollution||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday urged city residents to assist in reducing air pollution levels by turning engines of their vehicles off on red traffic signals, using public transport or car pools once a week and registering air pollution complaints using the Green Delhi app on their phones.“Air pollution has been slowly increasing for the last three-four days. One of the main reasons is that stubble burning has started in neighbouring states where governments have failed in helping farmers in this regard. We can get a clear picture of that through NASA images… Last week, we presented a 10-point action plan. Today, I seek your help in reducing air pollution in personal capacity,” said Kejriwal in a video press briefing on Tuesday.He further said that switching off vehicle engines while waiting at traffic signals should become a habit. “Even though we will launch a formal campaign this year again from October 18, I request you to start it in personal capacity from today. Studies have shown that by doing this we can collectively save around ₹250 crore a year and reduce pollution by up to 15%.”“Secondly, I request you to use public transport or carpool at least once a week, instead of using a personal vehicle. Doing it more than once a week would be even better. Third, I request you to download the Green Delhi app... for actively registering complaints regarding air pollution.... We have resolved more than 23,000 complaints received through the app so far,” said Kejriwal.Also Read: Impact of stubble fires in Delhi’s air to stay negligible this weekOn October 4, Kejriwal released a 10-point winter action plan for the national capital to combat air pollution during the winter season, which is caused by a number of factors, including stubble burning by farmers in nearby states. The action plan includes free distribution of a bio-decomposer to stop stubble burning in Delhi, anti-dust campaign, no burning of garbage, installation of smog towers, ban on firecrackers, round-the-clock monitoring of pollution hotspots, setting up green war rooms, creating an eco-waste park, launching the Green Delhi app and investing on efforts to reduce vehicular pollution in the capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kejriwals-3-point-formula-for-residents-to-help-curb-delhi-pollution-101634023753345.html

Also roughly 12% students including 12% boys and 13% girls use smokeless tobacco,” the GYTS-4 report said. The report also said that within the smokers’ group, home was the most preferred place to smoke for 37.4% students, followed by a friend’s house for 19.8% respondents who accepted they smoked. “13.5% of the respondents said they smoke at school, 10.8% at public places and 8.9% at social events while 9.7% students smoke at other random places,” said the factsheet from the report. GYTS-4 was conducted in 2019 and 3,501 students from 37 different schools, including 12 public and 25 private, participated in the survey. GYTS is a cross-sectional nationally representative, school-based survey of students in grades associated with ages 13 to 15 years, said Satish Tripathi of the State Tobacco Control Cell. It uses global standardised methodology with a probability proportional to enrolment size. The classes within the selected school are selected randomly. The survey questionnaire includes tobacco use, cessation, second-hand smoke and other aspects of tobacco usage. Also Read | Positive parent-child relationships reduce risk of youth vaping: Study“Tobacco addiction starts with peer pressure and students consume it for fun at the beginning, hiding their activity (smoking) from others. In later stages of life, these students become bold enough to smoke in front of others, hence, this habit has to be curbed even before the start,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary-general, Association of International Doctors. GYTS assists countries in fulfilling their obligations under the World Health Organisation (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control to generate comparable data within and across countries.

Addressing the ceremony virtually, he said that though “some people” see human rights violation in a particular incident, they ignore violation of such rights in other, similar cases.Also Read | PM Modi to address 28th NHRC foundation day programme today“There is an aspect of human rights that I want to discuss today. These days, we see that people have started interpreting human rights in a way that benefits them. However, these rights are grossly violated when these are looked at from a political lens. This selective behaviour is harmful for our democracy,” PM Modi warned.Such a mentality harms the very concept of human rights as well, he further said.Prime Minister Modi also drew an analogy between human rights and India's independence movement, saying that the respect for human rights in the country is largely due to the long freedom struggle that the nation went through. “We fought for our rights across centuries and, as a country and society, always protested against injustice and tyranny,” PM Modi remarked.India, he said, has always been “committed and sensitive” towards issues concerning human rights. About NHRCThe National Human Rights Commission was established on October 12, 1993, for the promotion and protection of human rights. The body, which is currently headed by retired judge of the Supreme Court, Justice Arun Mishra, takes cognisnance of any form of human rights violation, conducts enquiries and, if the violation is established, recommends various remedial and legal measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-nhrc-foundation-day-event-pm-modi-slams-selective-interpretation-of-human-rights-101634014143750.html

The drug haul, worth ₹21,000 crore as estimated by agencies, was the largest ever seizure by Indian agencies. A narco-terror link is being probed in the delivery as it was sent to India from Kandahar after the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan.The consignment was intercepted by the Directorate of Revenue and Intelligence (DRI) on September 14 and 15 on the basis of specific intelligence that high-quality heroin was being smuggled in two containers from Afghanistan to Gujarat’s Mundra port via Iran’s Bandar Abbas port. The two containers had 1,999.58 kg and 988.64 kg heroin packed, layered between the talc to avoid detection by security and customs officials. HT exclusively reported the seizure on September 20.At least eight people, including Chennai couple Govindaraju Durga Purna Vaishali and Machavaram Sudhakar, who allegedly imported the heroin concealed in the semi-processed talc stones through their Vijaywada registered firm (Aashi Trading Company) from a Kandahar based company, four Afghan nationals, an Uzbek woman have been arrested by the DRI so far.The ministry of home affairs transferred the case to NIA last week to probe the Taliban-Pakistan angle.Officials cited above said among those being raided on Tuesday are some individuals having Afghan links.Vaishali and Sudhakar are said to be small players as they got only ₹10 lakh to ₹12 lakh commission for allegedly allowing to use their talc stones containers for smuggling heroin. A larger network of Afghan nationals is suspected to be behind the consignment, said an officer.Investigators have so far found that Vaishali and Sudhakar were taking instructions from some persons based in Afghanistan and Iran. “Their role in smuggling drugs previously in the garb of imports is being investigated,” said a second officer.Also Read: NIA raids on TRF in Jammu and Kashmir amid spate of civilian killingsAccording to a UN estimate, there are 800 to 900 mid and high-level drugs traffickers/syndicates in Afghanistan.

12-10-2021||India||Will Quad stand-up to dragon breathing fire from Indo-Pacific to Ladakh?||The condescending statement issued by PLA's Western Theatre Command spokesperson after the unproductive 13th round of senior military commanders meeting on Sunday to de-escalate situation in East Ladakh is reflective of the overall Chinese belligerence towards its perceived adversaries with dragon breathing fire from Indo-Pacific to Ladakh.The PLA statement called Indian proposals for de-escalation as “unreasonable and unrealistic” and preached to Indian Army that they should be satisfied with what has been achieved till now without getting more militarily ambitious. Essentially, it means that the PLA is in no mood to normalise the situation along the 1597-km Ladakh LAC as it asks the Indian Army to honour the same bilateral border agreements that the Chinese army itself forgot by unilaterally executing the May 2020 transgressions in Galwan, Pangong Tso, Gogra and Hot Springs.The PLA statement is in line with its Central Military Commission Chairman Xi Jinping’s aggressive statements to take over democratic Taiwan in the name of reunification. From Chinese national day on October 1 to Taiwan national day on October 10, the PLA air force tested Taipei’s beleaguered defence by flying more than 56 fighters and nuclear capable bombers on a single day to brow-beat the democratic tiny Island nation.Although Chinese belligerence is often a combined function of its domestic and international situation, the unusual aggression from Beijing comes after AUKUS pact on September 15 which allows Australia to get nuclear submarines from US and UK, the Quad summit on September 24 and the high intensity naval exercises between Quad partners and between US-UK navies in the Indo-Pacific. Add to this the failing Chinese real estate giant and energy crisis, we get a very potent mixture. The PLA aggression on Ladakh in May 2020 also came after Beijing was hit globally for keeping the deadly coronavirus, which has origins in Wuhan, under wraps in cahoots with the WHO leadership. Two years after the pandemic broke in Wuhan, nearly five million have died and the world has lost trillions of dollars in economic disruption. This is without even counting the societal impact and mental trauma the world had to go through and is still going through without any accountability from China. Any country who so much as raises the accountability issue faces retaliation from Beijing.With US military power coming under question after Pakistani ISI backed Sunni terrorist force, the Taliban, militarily seized Kabul on August 15, the Chinese aggression now matches of an unbridled superpower who is not willing to yield an inch that it perceives its own. Beijing’s information warfare also matches its self-declared superpower status with political fires being lit in backyard of democracies opposing Chinese Communist Party’s belligerence through media and news aggregators. Combine this with the military psy-ops belted out routinely by Chinese propaganda media, the global perception of Beijing is several notches above than its actual capabilities.Given that the Chinese cyber and automatic intelligence capabilities, even by recent admission of ex-Pentagon’s software specialist, exceed the US abilities, India must be prepared for more belligerence from Beijing as the latter will not let up in pressure. It is time that the Indian armed forces understood that the future wars will be won in cyberspace accompanied with stand-off weapons rather than intricate land maneuvers by tanks or infantry. The air wars will be fought with swam drones and armed unmanned platforms, which the PLA has in large numbers, rather than manned fighters which will be chased by Chinese acquired S-400 fired surface to air missiles. The sea will be ruled by nuclear submarines and unmanned sea drones mapping the oceans rather than goliath aircraft carriers which can be targeted by Chinese ballistic ship killer missiles. With US leading the way, India needs to garner its massive software talent to build up offensive and defensive cyber defence capabilities or the battle will be over even before it starts.In fact, the Indian geographical situation is such that no country can avoid its relevance and salience when it comes to China or to Af-Pak terrorism. While it has deep strategic ties with US, India also has a very close relationship with Russia and France. It is a voice of credibility in Saudi Arabia and UAE, two of its closest allies in Middle East. It is India that can bridge the current gap between France and US over Australia preferring American nuclear submarines by cancelling the order of French built diesel attack platforms and cement over the division within democracies.While Beijing prescribes an independent foreign policy (read anti-US) for India, it is the PLA which is pushing India towards a corner by its aggression and military infrastructure development along the 3488 km LAC. Even the so-called strategists talk about India staying away from US as the right path to pacify China. Quad, in fact, is the only counter to Chinese numero uno plans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-quad-stand-up-to-dragon-breathing-fire-from-indo-pacific-to-ladakh-101634011355860.html

The government’s decision, the high court said, was contrary to principles laid down by previous Supreme Court judgements, taken in haste without application of mind and violative of the government’s own rules for admission to post graduate courses which specifically mention that admission to post graduate courses was to be strictly on merit except for a relaxation in marks afforded to those belonging to disadvantaged backgrounds. Disposing a petition filed by a group of more than 100 doctors and medical students, the high court ruled that a failure “to take into account vital and relevant considerations which the decision-maker was bound to” rendered the decision to impose the reservations from this year onwards “unreasonable and arbitrary.”“Such a serious decision to reserve 41% of the State quota seats to PG courses at GMC ought to have been preceded by application of mind to a host of relevant considerations referred to in a plethora of decisions of the Supreme Court on the subject as well as the considerations flagged by the dean of GMC. For all these reasons as well, the impugned decision is vitiated and liable to be struck down,” the high court bench of Justices M S Sonak and M S Jawalkar ruled. In a notification issued in May last year, the Goa government sought to implement reservations to the postgraduate courses at the Goa Medical College (GMC) to the extent of 41% in favour of STs (12%); SCs (2%) and OBCs (27%) from 2021-2022 academic year.The government argued that it was in tune with its orders of 2007, when it introduced a 12% reservation for STs in all government-run and aided educational institutions and a similar sounding notification in the year 2014, when it enhanced an already existing reservation for the OBCs from 19.5% to 27%. The government claimed in the court that there had been a “failure/lapse” by not applying reservations for the post graduate medical courses when the quota provisions had been notified back in 2007. The court was, however, unwilling to buy the argument. “The attempt, it appears, is to downplay this long period of over 14 years and to suggest that there was no conscious decision against the implementation or application of reservation policy to PG courses at GMC and GDC. Having regard to this length of time, a cogent explanation was due, but the same is not forthcoming either from the notings in the file or the affidavit of the State government,” the court observed. Also Read | Aryan Khan bail plea: Special NDPS court to hear matter on October 13The court also ruled that in case of a conflict between two sets of executive instructions -- the government’s general administrative instructions that reservations will apply to all educational institutions, and the rules that specifically deal with admissions to postgraduate courses in the Goa Medical and Dental Colleges -- it was the latter that would have precedence. The high court also struck down two recommendations made by the Goa Commission for SC/ST and the Goa State Commission for OBC for implementing reservations noting that they were made without the government specifying how the notification could impact them, without hearing the State government or more particularly, the deans of GMC and GDC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-nixes-goa-s-bid-to-introduce-reservations-in-pg-medical-courses-101634005691242.html

12-10-2021||India||Mumbai police summons former cop Param Bir Singh for questioning in extortion case||Former police commissioner Param Bir Singh is summoned by the Mumbai police to appear before the cops on Tuesday, for questioning in connection with an extortion case. The notice was sent on October 9 amid reports claiming that Singh has left the country.The former cop is facing at least five criminal cases in Maharashtra.The crime branch of Mumbai Police is probing an extortion case registered against Singh on the basis of a complaint by a city hotelier and civic contractor. Besides Singh, dismissed police officer Sachin Waze, Sumit Singh alias Chintu, Alpesh Patel, Vinay Singh alias Babloo and Riyaz Bhati are named as accused in the FIR.On October 9, a police team went to Singh's flat in the Nilima building in the Malabar Hill area and pasted a notice outside, asking him to appear before police for questioning. The notice was pasted outside the house as he was not present at the residence.On October 5, news agency ANI had reported that Singh may have left the country before the Lookout Circular (LOC) was issued against him. It is also possible that he fled India with a forged passport, it reported quoting officials of investigating agencies.A person is not allowed to cross immigration at any airport if they have a lookout notice against them. The LoC was issued against Singh in July.Recently, Maharashtra home minister Dilip Walse Patil said that the investigative agencies are unaware of Singh's whereabouts. "I've heard something like that but as a government officer, he can't go abroad without government clearance,” Patil said on speculation that Singh might have escaped the country.Param Bir Singh was shunted out as Mumbai police chief and transferred to the Home Guard after Waze's arrest in the case of an SUV with explosives found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's south Mumbai residence.In the later course of the investigation, Singh also accused then state home minister Anil Deshmukh of asking Waze to collect ₹100 crore from hotels and bars in Mumbai every month, a charge which Deshmukh denies.Subsequently, while Deshmukh resigned, police registered four cases of alleged extortion against Singh in Mumbai and Thane. A case under the SC-ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act is also pending against Singh.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-police-summons-former-cop-param-bir-singh-for-questioning-in-extortion-case-101633999927523.html

"The 'Samajwadi Vijay Yatra' aims to make people aware about the corrupt, autocratic and suppressive policies of the BJP government and to establish real democracy," the party said in a statement ahead of the yatra. The programme is an effort by the SP to galvanise support ahead of state polls.Yadav will travel in a Mercedes bus, which has been turned into a 'rath' having his posters displayed on one side and that of party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav on the other. The bus will also carry a picture of party leader Mohammad Azam Khan, according to SP.A day before the yatra, the party released a 17-second video in which Akhilesh Yadav is seen talking to his father Mulayam Singh Yadav and touching his feet to get blessings.The Samajwadi Party said that the yatra will start from Kanpur and in the first two days - on October 12 and 13 - it will cover Kanpur Dehat, Jalaun and Hamirpur. "The yatra aims to provide justice to farmers, youths, dalits, the deprived, the backward, minorities and all sections and rid the state of autocratic and suppressive government," party spokesperson Rajendra Chowdhury said, according to news agency PTI.

Tomorrow, the 'antim ardaas' of the martyrs of Lakhimpur Kheri massacre will take place in Tikunia at Sahebjada Inter College. Preparations are being made for the same and tens of thousands of farmers are expected to join this prayer meeting,” said SKM, an umbrella body of about 40 farmer organisations.It has appealed to farmer organisations and progressive groups across the nation to mark the occasion by organising prayer and homage meetings all over the country, followed by candle light vigils in the evening. It has urged people to light five candles outside their houses at 8pm on Tuesday.The farmers' body expressed its dismay at no action being taken against Union minister and BJP MP Ajay Mishra, whose vehicle allegedly ran over the farmers at Lakhimpur Kheri. “It is shameful on the part of the Modi government that Ajay Mishra Teni has not been sacked yet. It was his vehicles that were in the convoy that killed innocent people,” the SKM said.Thousands of farmers from across the nation have been camping at Delhi borders since November last year, demanding repeal of the three farm laws that they claim would do away with the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations. Multiple rounds of talks with the government have failed to break the deadlock between the two sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-farmers-to-observe-shaheed-kisan-diwas-today-101633996713597.html

The two-day visit comes months ahead of assembly elections in the state, where AAP is showcasing its 'Delhi model' to emerge on top.Party leader Raghav Chadha said that Kejriwal will land at Amritsar airport at about 3pm and visit Jalandhar's famous Devi Talab temple to offer prayers at 6pm."During the Navratras, Arvind Kejriwal will pray for peace, love, mutual brotherhood and a prosperous Punjab," Chadha said on Monday.No other programme has been officially announced by the party.AAP, which is already the main opposition party in Punjab after winning 20 seats in 2017 is trying to take advantage of the flux in state's ruling party, the Congress. It is also highlighting the issues in the Akalis' 10-year-long rule to emerge on top in assembly elections this time.And AAP has the power crisis issue too at hand, for which it is blaming the Centre and the state government."It is the responsibility of the Union government to supply coal to the public and private thermal plants in Punjab, but the Modi government has been reluctant to supply coal under a conspiracy. Coal is not being supplied to thermal plants in states, including Punjab and Delhi, which has led to the threat of thermal plant shutdowns and power outages," said AAP MLA Aman Arora.During his previous visits, Kerjiwal already made a populist pitch by "guaranteeing" 300 units of free power for residential consumers, waiver of pending bills and round-the-clock supply if his party comes to power in the state.In September, when Kejriwal visited Ludiana, he offered six promises in Punjab - AAP's "health guarantee" - if the party comes to power in the state. Among his offers were free health benefits at public hospitals across the state, treatment at which he promised would be on par with private healthcare. He also said that similar to Delhi, all medicines, tests, treatments, and operations would be free of cost if his party came to power in the state.For now, the biggest question in front of the AAP convenor is to name a chief ministerial candidate for Punjab, which he has promised will be named in due time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-to-begin-his-two-day-punjab-visit-today-101633997081073.html

12-10-2021||India||PM Narendra Modi to inaugurate 7 defence firms carved out of OFB on October 15||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on October 15 formally launch seven new defence companies carved out of the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB), four months after Union Cabinet cleared the board’s corporatisation to boost its efficiency and competitiveness in a long-awaited reform in the country’s defence manufacturing sector, officials familiar with the development said on Monday.The new companies will be formally launched through video conference on the occasion of Vijayadashami, also known as Dussehra. The government issued an order last month, dissolving OFB with effect from October 1.The OFB, which earlier controlled 41 ordnance factories, has been split into seven government-owned entities that will produce ammunition and explosives, vehicles, weapons and equipment, troop comfort items, opto-electronics gear, parachutes and ancillary products.These new companies have been named Advanced Weapons and Equipment India Limited, Troop Comforts Limited, India Optel Limited, Munitions India Limited, Avani Armoured Vehicles, Gliders India Limited and Yantra India Limited.“All the indents previously placed on the OFBs by various services, CAPFs and state police have been converted into deemed contracts. These deemed contracts numbering 66 have a cumulative value of more than ₹65,000 crore,” said one of the officials cited above.“This process has been smoothly concluded following months of extensive consultations with all the stakeholders prior to the unveiling of the new defence companies,” he added.A total of 60% of the annual price of the indents will be paid by the services to the new defence public sector undertakings as mobilisation advance, said another official. “Mobilisation advance worth over ₹7,100 crore for the financial year 2021-22 has been paid to the DPSUs by the respective indentors,” he added.Ordnance factories were engaged in the production of tanks, armoured personnel carriers, mine protected vehicles, bombs, rockets, artillery guns, anti-aircraft guns, parachutes, small arms, clothing and leather equipment for soldiers.The government expects the seven new professionally managed entities to increase their share in the domestic market through better capacity utilisation and also tap new export opportunities.During the last two decades, various high-level committees underlined the need to improve the functioning of OFB and making its factories vehicles of self-reliance for the country’s defence preparedness.The Comptroller and Auditor General also raised questions about the quality of products supplied by OFB and its overall performance in several past reports.The factories controlled by the board employed at least 70,000 people who have been against the move to corporatise it.The All-India Defence Employees Federation is among the four workers’ associations that have decided to boycott the official inauguration of the new companies on October 15, even though the government said there would be no change in the service conditions of the OFB employees and it was committed to safeguarding their interests.All OFB employees (Group A, B and C) from different production units have been transferred to the corporate entities on deemed deputation for an initial period of two years without changing their service conditions as government employees.In 2017, the government took action against 13 senior defence ministry bureaucrats from the Indian Ordnance Factories Service for the repeated failures of the ordnance factories to meet the shortfall in ammunition and poor quality of products.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-to-inaugurate-7-defence-firms-carved-out-of-ofb-on-october-15-101633979653710.html

Let the police show evidence of his involvement, and the PM’s office will then take a call on the issue,” said a senior party functionary.The opposition has been demanding that the union government to remove Mishra. Congress leaders led by party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra sat on a silent protest demanding the dismissal of the minister. The CPI-M has also demanded the minister’s removal. The CPI-M’s Sitaram Yechury said justice will not be served with Mishra’s continuation as minister.In response to a question on whether the issue will affect the BJP’s performance in the upcoming state assembly elections, a second leader said, “So far there is no indication to suggest that it will affect the party’s performance. But how the issue is handled by the government can have an impact.”The BJP’s core group on Uttar Pradesh met in the Capital on Monday to discuss election related issues. The meeting was attended by party president JP Nadda, union minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who is the election in-charge of the state, former union minister and state in-charge Radhamohan Singh, BJP state president Swatantrata Dev Singh, general secretary Organization BL Santhosh and state general secretary Sunil Bansal.According to a third leader, the party will draw up a plan to focus on 100 critical constituencies of the total 403 where it will need to redouble it’s efforts. These are constituencies where the party has either not won in the previous election and where it has not been able to consolidate its position. In 2017, the BJP swept to power, winning 324 of the 403.The party has also planned 100 public events spread over 100 days. The party will reach out to the beneficiaries of the central and state sponsored schemes and hold interaction with various social groups said the third leader. The BJP’s successful return to power in the 2019 national elections was built around a similar strategy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/final-call-on-mishra-s-dismissal-after-evidence-against-son-in-lakhimpur-violencebjp-101633979167088.html

12-10-2021||India||Kumaraswamy slams Karnataka govt for ‘sidelining’ Kannada for Hindi||Former Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy on Monday lashed out at the Basavaraj Bommai-led government for sidelining Kannada in favour of Hindi.In a six-part post on Twitter, the Janata Dal (Secular) leader accused the state government of neglecting Kannada as a standard practice and continued to impress the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led union government that has been charged with imposing Hindi on non-Hindi speaking states.Referring to the stage set up at the 25th convocation of National Institute of Mental Health and Neuroscience (NIMHANS) held on Sunday, Kumaraswamy said, “Hindi gets the first place in the 25th Convocation of National Institute of Mental Health and Neuroscience (NIMHANS). English gets the second place and Kannada gets the third place. There is no better instance of showing that Kannada is caught in the hands of butchers.” The statements come at a time when Bommai has been accused of sidelining Kannada at major events in the state, especially in the presence of national leaders and ministers.“The high-handedness of national parties is increasing day-by-day. The attack on our land and language is worse than those by foreign invaders. What has happened to the tongues of people who don’t say Kannada first and instead say country first,” Kumaraswamy said in another post.In August this year, pro-Kannada organisations and the political opposition tore into Bommai for putting up boards in Hindi and English only at the flagging-off of the Metro rail services between Nayandahalli and Kengeri.The Kannada and Culture department had also issued a notice to Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) over allegations that the latter sidelined the regional language during the inauguration of the new stretch of the Metro.“Day before yesterday, the government took notice of sidelining Kananda during the event to inaugurate the Metro rail towards Kengeri. Despite Kannada being declared as the official language, some officials have been derelict and this will not be tolerated under any circumstances,” Kumaraswamy said on September 1.Dinesh Gundu Rao, the former state Congress president and AICC incharge of Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Goa was the first to raise the issue in which he accused the state BJP of neglecting Kannada “to please the centre”.“It is a shame for Karnataka to ignore Kannada in our Metro inauguration programme on the Kengeri Purple route. It is impossible to tolerate the sidelining of Kannada in a government programme. Our Metro project is a central and state partnership project. So why should Kannada not be a priority?” Rao had said in a post on Twitter.The issue of language strikes an emotional chord in Karnataka and other non-Hindi speaking states which nurse a feeling of neglect of their native tongue under the Modi government. There have been long struggles in places like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra among several other states across the country that have fought over language rights, which even though has limited political capital, has rich dividends in mobilising support.The Metro had become the platform of choice for pro-Kannada politics to play out during the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government between 2013-2018 which had supported the cause as a tool to further criticise the union government for imposition of Hindi.The Congress and several other regional outfits have accused the union government of pursuing ‘one-nation, one-language’ policy as a way to make Hindi a common tongue as part of its larger Hindutva agenda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kumaraswamy-slams-karnataka-govt-for-sidelining-kannada-for-hindi-101633979051331.html
12-10-2021||India||Siddaramaiah urges Rahul Gandhi to take over as Cong chief||Adding to the growing calls seeking Rahul Gandhi’s return as Congress president ahead of crucial elections in several states, senior Congress party leader Siddaramaiah on Monday echoed similar views saying that the Gandhi scion should lead the party.“I have been saying from (a) long time that Rahul Gandhi should lead (the) Congress party. I urge him to take charge at the earliest,” Siddaramaiah, the leader of the opposition and former chief minister said in Bengaluru on Monday.“It is not that Sonia ji is incapable of discharging her duties of the president. Sonia ji is not keeping good health. That is why I suggested Rahul ji to take over as early as possible,” he added.The statements come at a time when several Congress leaders have asked that Rahul Gandhi take charge of the party. The Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting is scheduled to be held on October 16 to deliberate on multiple issues that the party has to do as well as discussing strategies to face the upcoming elections, especially in states like Uttar Pradesh.Rahul Gandhi resigned in 2019 after he took responsibility for the routing of the Congress at the hands of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Sonia Gandhi was made the interim president of the party that has continued to rely on the “Gandhi’s” for leadership and keep the party from breaking up into factions.The Congress is trying to mobilise support against the BJP over issues like price rise of petrol, diesel, cooking gas and other essential commodities as a result, the contentious farm laws and muzzling of free speech among several other issues to gain back some lost ground across the country.After the crisis in Rajasthan and then Punjab, the Congress is now trying to douse the fire in Karnataka by trying to lure Siddaramaiah to head to Delhi and be part of national politics.Siddaramaiah has refused to leave Karnataka and has aired his disapproval of any suggestions to move to Delhi.The Congress is also fighting the October 30 bypolls on the platform of price rise. “Prices of petrol, diesel and LPG are constantly increasing. Additional ₹3,000 crore is collected as tax between April and September compared to last year. (MK) Stalin’s government has reduced the tax by ₹3. Our state govt should reduce by at least ₹10 – only then prices of essential commodities can be controlled. Central govt should reduce excise duty and about ₹23 lakh cr is collected as excise duty in last 7 years. ₹1.2 lakh Cr is collected from Karnataka alone. Let BJP reduce the tax and provide relief to poor people,” Siddaramaiah said.He added that the Modi government has increased the excise duty of diesel from ₹3.45 to ₹31.84 and excise duty of petrol from ₹9.21 to ₹32.98. “Let him reduce excise duty by 50%. This is what I call criminal loot,” Siddaramaiah said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/siddaramaiah-urges-rahul-gandhi-to-take-over-as-cong-chief-101633979050165.html
12-10-2021||India||Remarks taken out of context: K’taka minister||Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar on Monday clarified his statement on modern women opting to be single and surrogacy, which came under sharp criticism from various quarters for being sexist and bracketing women as just objects to reproduce.Sudhakar said that he was trying to make a point on the support.“It is unfortunate that a small part of my address out of the nineteen and a half minutes long speech during the World Mental Health Day programme at NIMHANS on Sunday is taken out of context and thereby losing out on the larger point I was trying to make at the prestigious National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences,” he said.The minister said that it was widely established through studies and research that families are a source of valuable mental support that is helpful in managing stressful situations. He said that the traditional Indian joint family has always been a good source of mental support.“Unlike western society that puts the focus on individualism, Indian society is collective in that it promotes interdependence and cooperation with the family being the focal point of the societal structure,” he said in his clarification on Monday. Similarly, CT Ravi, the national general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and legislator from Karnataka, on Monday said that western influence and micro families are changing the mindset of women and it is an issue that needs some serious thought.“All women are not like this. Some are well-read, doing jobs in IT/BT and their mindset has changed. All women are not like this. This is something to think about and we have to do it. This is happening because of more western influence and micro families,” Ravi said on Monday.The minister’s comment on Sunday had attracted sharp criticism. The state Congress president, DK Shivakumar said that the comments reflected a regressive mindset.“They make big promises about women empowerment, while this is what the actual mindset is. Regressive, bashing women for their choices. All masks eventually come off,” Shivakumar said in a post on Twitter.Speaking at the World Mental Health Day at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurological Sciences (NIMHANS) in Bengaluru on Sunday, Sudhakar had said, “Today I am sorry to say this. A lot of modern women in India want to stay single. Even if they get married, they don’t want to give birth they want surrogacy. So, there is a paradigm shift in our thinking which is not good,” the minister said at an event for mental health in Bengaluru on Sunday.“Unfortunately, we are going in a western way. We don’t want our parents to live with us. forget about grandparents being with us and today,” Sudhakar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/remarks-taken-out-of-context-k-taka-minister-101633979049054.html
12-10-2021||India||75 years of independence: Congress events to focus on farmers, Dalits||Congress has drawn up an elaborate, yearlong plan to celebrate 75 years of India’s Independence. The party will have its own celebrations, parallel to the Union government’s Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav programmes, but even in that, it will focus on farmers and Dalits.The celebrations that have begun on August 15 and will last until August 15 next year will highlight the Congress’ history and its contribution to the Freedom Struggle in an attempt to counter the Bharatiya Janata Party’s narrative on nationalism. The party will pick historic dates, including the birth and death anniversaries of icons such as Mahatma Gandhi, BR Ambedkar and Sardar Patel as well as defining events of the All India Congress Committee plenary sessions that are related to Freedom Struggle, said BK Hariprasad, co-convener of a special committee set up by Congress president Sonia Gandhi to celebrate the historic milestone. This panel is being helmed by former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh and has 11 members.“We are selecting the dates and places of important events such as Champaran (satyagraha) or Belgaum (the only Congress session with Gandhi as president) during our Freedom Struggle. The state units of the Congress have been asked to organise programmes at those places to commemorate the events,” Hariprasad told HT.In the list is a programme to commemorate the Patharughat Uprising of farmers in Assam on January 28 in 1894, a quarter-century before the Jallianwalla Bagh massacre. “Similarly, the 1924 AICC session in Belgaum, where Mahatma Gandhi presided over the plenary session and said non-violent non-cooperation will be a means to attain political freedom, will also be celebrated,” Hariprasad said.The focus on farmers coincides with the ongoing farmer protests in the country and the party’s outreach, especially in Lakhimpur Kheri, where a car mowed down protesting farmers. “We also have to remember that when Gandhi ji started the Satyagraha agitation, he had realised that participation of the elites won’t be helpful unless the farmers and the Dalits also join the movement,” said Hariprasad.The Congress also plans to highlight its foundation day (December 28, 1885) this year as part of its 75-year celebrations.The Union government’s official celebrations, however, will be more expansive, covering a larger sphere of the society. All government programmes, various ongoing and future projects and major constructions such as the redevelopment of the Central Vista and the new Parliament building are all linked to the official celebrations..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/75-years-of-independence-congress-events-to-focus-on-farmers-dalits-101633978991975.html

These are Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Dadra And Nagar Haveli, Goa, Telangana, Puducherry and Haryana. Haryana is the latest state to achieve the target ahead of schedule.Although the mission’s deadline is over two years away, some large states have been able to cover less than a quarter of total rural households, the data show.Among them is Uttar Pradesh, which has covered only 12.74% of its 26.4 million rural households so far.The state has drawn up a largescale engineering project to extend tap water connections in Bundelkhand, one of the driest parts of the country.In terms of overall households covered, Uttar Pradesh has been the slowest in implementing the programme.The state is key to improving India’s overall health parameters, especially among children, because it is the country’s most populous state.The Bundelkhand leg of the Jal Jeevan Mission comprises 467 piped drinking water schemes under 32 projects. Of these, 43 are surface water-based schemes and 424 are ground water-based.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/83-million-rural-houses-getting-piped-water-under-centre-scheme-data-101633978434255.html
12-10-2021||India||Veteran actor Nedumudi Venu dies at 73||Noted Malayalam actor Nedumudi Venu, who acted in more than 500 south Indian films and won three national awards, died in a private hospital in Thiruvananthapuram on Monday. Suffering from multiple ailments, Venu’s condition deteriorated due to post-Covid complications. He was 73 and survived by his wife TR Susheela, and two sons. Known for his versatile roles, the thespian started his acting career in drama and later switched to the cinema, becoming a colossus in the Malayalam tinsel world for more than five decades. An actor for all seasons, Venu’s instant wit and depth in folk songs and musical instruments were well known. A close disciple of late theatre personality Kavalam Naryana Panicker, he acted in many classical dance dramas. Personalities from the Malayalam film industry, Kerala governor Arif Mohammad Khan and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan were among the first to pay rich tributes to Venu. “He is one of the finest actors in Malayalam/Indian cinema. His profound knowledge of traditional art forms and Indian style of acting reflected in his unique performances,” the governor said in his condolence message.“We have lost a versatile personality, and it is a big loss to the cinema world in particular,” Vijayan said. “Farewell Venu uncle! Your body of work and your expertise over the craft will forever be research material for generations to come! Rest in peace legend! #NedumudiVenu,” actor Prithviraj Sukumaran wrote on Twitter.“He was first to break the handsome and tall hero concept in Malayalam movie. He floored reigning heroes with his acting prowess,” said director and lyricist Sreekumaran Thampi. “Not just an actor, he is a complete artist,” said Kamal Hassan, adding that he lost a good friend. Actors Mamooty, Mohanlal, Jayaram, Dulquar Salman, Tovino Thomas and Manju Warrier also poured in their condolences to the family of the veteran actor. Hailing from Nedumudi, a small village in Kuttanad (central Kerala), Venu’s chance encounter with famous director Bharathan to interview for a local film magazine in the late 70s opened doors for his film entry. The director was moved by his peculiar mannerism and instant wit and promised him a role in his next film. However, his debut happened in 1978 when he featured in national-award-winning director G Aravindan’s film Thampu. Bharathan’s Aaravam (1979) cemented his place in Mollywood. Besides Malayalam, Venu also acted in Tamil movies. His role in the 2005 movie ‘Anniyan’ and 2019 movie ‘Sarvam Thaala Mayam’ were critically acclaimed. In 2007, he also acted in an English movie Chaurahen. The release of his last film Marakkar, directed by Priyadarshan, was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In 1990, Venu got the national award for supporting actor for his role in the Malayalam movie High Highness Abdullah, special jury award for Margam in 2003 and best feature film narration award in Minukku in 2006. He got the Kerala State Film Award six times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/veteran-south-indian-actor-nedumudi-venu-dies-at-73-101633978688354.html

They said the attendance of students in August was 73 per cent, while it was 82 per cent in September and 85 per cent in October and added that it was 91 per cent at present.The chief minister said, “The main objective of the ‘Amma Vodi’ scheme is to increase the enrollment of students in schools and added that there is a condition that the children must have a minimum of 75 per cent of attendance to get eligibility for the scheme.”He added, “Attendance criterion was exempted due to the Covid-19 situation and directed the officials to link attendance to the Amma Vodi scheme from 2022.

12-10-2021||India||HC rejects plea on Kerala students’ admissions in DU||The Delhi high court Monday dismissed a petition which alleged a “disproportionate” number of admissions of students from Kerala state board in Delhi University, saying fixing of cut-offs was a matter of the university’s admission policy.Justice Prateek Jalan said that matters of academic policy were best left to the university and the court would be slow in interfering with the same. The court was hearing a petition by a DU-aspirant seeking a “scaling mechanism” for marks scored by students from different boards in order to provide a level playing field.“To me, it is entirely a matter of policy. How do we say what should be fixed as a cut-off? How do we say so-and-so board marks have been higher and so-and-so have been lower?... I don’t think a court can get into this based on this kind is reverse engineering,” the judge said. “We are of the view that the grievance of the petitioner is incapable of adjudication and is best left to the policy decision of the university,” the court said.The petitioner argued that in spite of securing over 98 per cent in Class 12, she was unable to score admission in her preferred course and college. “Take the cookie as it crumbles. We have to accept that. There is no reason to feel disheartened... You will get admission. There are great colleges and universities all over India,” the judge told the petitioner Gunisha Aggarwal who was present during the hearing conducted through video conferencing.Lawyers Vipul Ganda and Annirudh Sharma, representing the petitioner, claimed that 49 per cent of students who got admission in the first cut-off list belonged to the Kerala state board as opposed to 13.6 per cent and 14.80 per cent from CBSE and ISC, respectively. The counsel added that 27 per cent of successful candidates in the first cut-off were from the Rajasthan state board. For the Kerala board, both class 11 and class 12 marks are being considered which is leading to a disproportionate number of admissions from there, counsel for the petitioner stated.”It has come to the knowledge of the petitioner that the maximum number of 100 per cent marks have been awarded by the Kerala State Examination Board and a total of 6000 students from the Kerala State Board have scored 100 per cent marks. Similarly, other state Boards have adopted their own mechanism to award marks to students,” the petition said. “I am at the disadvantage as I am from CBSE... Suddenly this year the students of other boards have become brighter,” the counsel submitted.The court noted that not only was the scheme of marking for CBSE approved by the Supreme Court earlier this year on account of the pandemic, the petitioner filed the petition after participating in the admission process. “The fact that certain state boards may have evolved a different manner of assessment leading to some variation in the average marks does not (make the admission process) manifestly arbitrary so as to require interference,” the court said. “The judgements of the Supreme Court make it clear that in matters of academic policy, a writ court is slow to interfere,” it clarified.Delhi university counsel M Rupal stated that that the university cannot assess “which board has been liberal” as part of its admission process. “If more students (of a certain board) score more marks, being a central university, we can’t deprive them,” he added. In her petition, the petitioner prayed for a direction to quash DU’s policy of treating marks awarded by all different boards at par, saying that the present regime does not provide a “level playing field”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-rejects-plea-on-kerala-students-admissions-in-du-101633978570306.html
12-10-2021||India||Naidu on a mission to revive TDP’s fortunes||After the Telugu Desam Party’s poor show in the recent local body elections, party president and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu will go on a three-day tour to his assembly constituency Kuppam in Andhra Pradesh’s Chittoor district from Tuesday to restore what analysts say the sagging morale of the party cadre and revive his own image.According to P Manohar, personal assistant of Naidu and in-charge of the constituency, the former CM would reach Kuppam at 1.30 pm on Tuesday and address a public meeting besides holding a meeting with party leaders in the evening.On Wednesday, the TDP chief would visit Santhipuram and Ramakuppam mandals and participate in roadshows besides meeting party leaders. On October 14, Naidu would visit Gudupalli mandal and participate in a roadshow before leaving for Hyderabad via Bengaluru, Manohar said.The former chief minister’s visit to Kuppam assumes significance in the wake of the recent debacle in all the local body elections in the constituency held recently. The TDP could win only three out of 65 mandal parishad (block parishad) territorial constituencies (MPTCs) and lost all the four zilla parishad territorial constituencies (ZPTCs) to ruling YSR Congress party in the elections held in April, results of which were declared on September 19.In the gram panchayat elections held in February this year, too, YSRC had won 75 out of 89 gram panchayats and the TDP had to remain content with just 14 gram panchayats.Though the YSRC won nearly 90 per cent of the local bodies in the state, the poor show by the TDP in Kuppam in particular was a sort of personal humiliation to Naidu as the constituency is considered to be his bastion.Naidu had earlier represented Chandragiri assembly constituency when he was in the Congress, but after he defected to the TDP established by his father-in-law and matinee idol N T Rama Rao in 1982, he moved to Kuppam in 1989 assembly elections. Since then, he has been representing Kuppam and never faced a defeat.But after the establishment of YSRCP by his arch rival Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy in 2011, Naidu has been gradually losing ground in Kuppam. Earlier, his victory margin had always been around 42-45 per cent in all the previous elections, but in 2014, his victory margin fell sharply to 28.81 per cent, though he became the chief minister of AP. In 2019, it declined further to 16.93 per cent.Ever since he came to power in May 2019, Jagan has been laying special focus on Kuppam with a perspective plan to defeat Naidu in the 2024 assembly elections at any cost. In the last elections, Jagan successfully ensured the defeat of Naidu’s son Nara Lokesh from Mangalagiri constituency.If Jagan can defeat Naidu in Kuppam in the next elections, it would be the end of the road for the TDP. “That is precisely why Jagan laid special focus on the local body elections in Kuppam and ensured that the YSRC dismantled Naidu’s citadel to a large extent,” political analyst Suresh Dharur said.Naidu’s visit to Kuppam from Tuesday is being viewed against this backdrop. “He has realised that Kuppam is no more his stronghold and he cannot take the people of his constituency granted. If he cannot concentrate on his own seat, he may have to face the defeat in the next assembly elections,” Dharur said.In fact, the mood of the people in Kuppam was evident during the gram panchayat elections held in February. Though these elections were held on non-party basis, the party affiliation of the local candidates was glaringly evident.But Naidu did not take these elections seriously, thinking that the local factors might have played a role in the gram panchayats and moreover, the ruling party would always have an advantage. However, the recent mandal parishad and zilla parishad elections were an eye-opener for him, analysts say.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naidu-on-a-mission-to-revive-tdp-s-fortunes-101633978569219.html
12-10-2021||India||Minister’s son sent to 3-day police custody over UP clash||A local court on Monday sent Ashish Mishra, son of junior home minister Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’, to police custody for three days in connection with the violence in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri district last week.Eight people were killed in the incident on October 3, which included four farmers, two workers of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a driver and a local journalist.Police wanted Ashish Mishra’s custody for 14 days, but chief judicial magistrate Chinta Ram allowed only three, senior prosecution officer SP Yadav said.“As per the Supreme Court guidelines, the court instructed not to adopt any coercion or torture of the accused. Also, a lawyer of Mishra’s choice may remain present during his interrogation at a distance without causing any interference,” Yadav said.The hearing on the remand application began around 2pm. Mishra was produced remotely via video-conferencing, as he is lodged in Lakhimpur Kheri district jail.Defence counsels Awdhesh Dubey, Awdhesh Singh, Shailendra Gaur and others opposed the application for custody. They argued police had already questioned Ashish Mishra for 12 hours, and no further questioning was required.Ashish Mishra was arrested on October 9, five days after he was booked in a murder case lodged in Tikunia police station following allegations that he was in one of the vehicles that ran over four farmers when they were returning from a demonstration on October 3. A local court remanded him in judicial custody for 14 days.Minister Mishra and his son have denied the allegation. They say that local protesters pelted the vehicles with stones, causing the driver to lose control. They also allege that farmers killed two BJP workers and the driver.The Supreme Court had taken cognisance of the incident and asked the Uttar Pradesh government to take action against “whoever is involved.” The court was exceptionally harsh while commenting on the police’s lenient handling of Ashish Mishra, although it didn’t name him.Farm groups say a Mahindra Thar owned by Ajay Mishra mowed down protesters from behind while they were returning from a demonstration in Tikunia village. A video clip that is yet to be authenticated forensically shows the same.Police issued the first notice to Ashish Mishra on October 7, asking him to appear before them on October 8. He didn’t show up. After a second notice, he came in for questioning on October 9. Police said that he could not explain several points about his whereabouts during the incident and was arrested.Police had applied for custody immediately after his arrest, but the magistrate had postponed the hearing till Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ministers-son-sent-to-3-day-police-custody-over-up-clash-101633978270945.html
12-10-2021||India||Sweet display: Kerala artist makes 24-foot long Theyyam mascot with biscuits||The practice of making favourite artefacts is usually the norm across the country during the festive season but this one in Kerala is set apart from the rest. An artist in north Kerala’s Kannur built a 24-foot-long mascot of Theyyam, a ritual dance form of Malabar, on Saturday using biscuits, sweets and other bakery products, officials said.Artist Suresh PK, better known as Davinci Suresh, toiled away tirelessly for sixteen long hours to create the 24-foot long art piece. The mascot is built of 25,000 biscuits, sweets, bread, buns, dry fruits and other bakery products. “We heard Suresh is planning 100 different mediums to install different artefacts. So, we invited him and provided all arrangements,” said the main organiser of the event Rasheed Mohammad, a chef consultant and social worker. He said Theyyam was selected because it is the mascot of north Kerala and ritual dance season is fast approaching. He said the art was arranged at the Bharat auditorium in Kannur after laying enough cloth-wrapped tables. It attracted hordes of visitors.“Initially I thought of using different biscuits only. Later, we had to use other products for more visual appeal. Bakery items are my 79th medium. Later, we donated all products used in the art to a veterinary farm,” the artist said in his Facebook post.Earlier, he attempted a portrait of former President late APJ Abdul Kalam in gold, social reformer Sree Narayana Guru’s portrait in flowers and Bollywood megastar Amitab Bachchan’s in cloth masks. The Thrissur-based artist said it took about 16 hours to complete the work. North Malabar has a glorious tradition in baking and cake-making. It is often said that in 1883, the first cake was baked in south India by one Mambally Bapu in Thalassery. Mambally Bakery, situated in the town, is still continuing the tradition. The town is famous for its three Cs - cricket, circus and cake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sweet-display-kerala-artist-makes-24-foot-long-theyyam-mascot-with-biscuits-101633977727661.html

Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen sees the climate crisis as the top agenda for her government, and believes that economic growth and climate change mitigation can happen together. Ahead of Glasgow climate change conference (COP 26), she is on a three-day visit to India from October 9 to 11 to review the Green Strategic Partnership with India and discuss climate change mitigation. Frederiksen told to HT in an interview that Denmark hopes to set a good example by delivering more than its share of climate finance to support developing economies in mitigating the climate crisis. Edited excerpts:What are your expectations from COP 26?I think it is crucial that we use COP 26 to move forward and to show that we are willing to deliver on the Paris Agreement. Therefore, the G20 meeting just before the leaders’ meeting in Glasgow is very important because we need some of the big countries with the highest numbers of emissions to deliver more. And when you look at the IPCC report, it stands very clear that we all have to do more than we are already doing. So, no matter how high ambitions we have, we need to do more because the consequences of climate change are worse than we thought.Also Read| Danish PM visits Taj Mahal, calls it beautifulDo you think it is possible to achieve net zero emissions and what is the way forward to achieve net zero emissions by mid-century?Let me put it this way, net zero has to be possible. Renewables are an important part of this. If you have green electricity, then you can use all the electricity that you want to. I really think it’s good that your Prime Minister has set some ambitious goals when it comes to renewables. Yes, I think it is possible, and has to be possible. Renewables are a big part. Carbon capture is the next part and ensuring we are able to use green electricity in areas where we are not able to use it today. Because in flying from Denmark to India, we would still like to do that but one day hopefully we would like to travel green.Do you think it’s fair to ask developing countries to commit to similar emissions targets as developed nations? Now there is pressure on developing countries to commit to a net zero target.Yes and no. I feel a bit embarrassed by talking about climate changes and the Paris Agreement while coming from a country which had such a good starting point compared to many other countries and India. We need to be aware of the different starting points, and at the same time, ensuring together that economic growth and green decision is combined because I would never dare to ask India to withdraw from your wanting of economic growth. It’s totally necessary to make sure that living standards are lifted globally especially for the most vulnerable people. It would never be a way of asking you to slow down your development. Never ever. I am a social democrat; I believe in development, and I know India is still facing many problems in other areas. I think what is necessary is that you are not making the same mistakes we did, and I think it is possible to jump over some of those mistakes if we do it strategically. For example, when it comes to renewables.You have spoken several times about how climate finance needs to be delivered—the USD 100 billion commitment from developed countries. How will you ensure that other developed countries deliver on climate finance? Of course, Denmark has committed that they will deliver their share.Hopefully by showing a good example. Now we have said that we will take more than our share. We do it because we believe in it, and because we are totally aware that this is not possible if we are not securing some investments especially from Europe but also other partners. If Denmark is able to do more than what we are supposed to do, then you know I can push our neighbouring countries to do the same. It will be good with some competition in this area you know.Also Read| PM Modi meets Danish counterpart, sign MoUs to boost ‘green strategic partnership’You have said once that you want to be the PM for children and that the climate crisis is a children’s issue. How would you take it to the level of advocacy for children? And for women?I think there are different things I would like to say to this question. First of all, if we are not able to deliver on the demands of children and young people worldwide because we have to be honest that it is the next generation that have pushed my generation, and also the older generation, to move forward on fighting climate change. They were on the streets everywhere globally, pushing this agenda. If we want them to trust us and believe in democracy; we have to show them that we are as aware of this challenge as they are and we are able to give the answers. So, for me, this is also a democratic question in securing that the next generation believes in democracy. Secondly, I only have 40 years left but the small ones have 80 or 90 years in front of them. This is the strange part of pollution and climate change that we know that we are giving a life for our own children and grandchildren that will become not better than what we received from our parents. That’s wrong. Every generation should have the idea of giving not only a country but a world to our children with clean air and clean drinking water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-is-crucial-we-use-cop-26-to-show-we-are-willing-to-deliver-on-paris-agreement-danish-pm-mette-frederiksen-101633977308911.html
12-10-2021||India||India not among 11 countries allowed quarantine-free travel to Singapore||Singapore will be reopening its border to vaccinated visitors from 11 countries from October 19, however, India has not been included in the list of countries allowed quarantine-free entry under the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) for now, the country said. Travellers have to be vaccinated with a World Health Organization (WHO) approved jab, its guidelines said.The Singapore government’s VTL scheme covers seven European countries - Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom, Germany - along with United States and Canada. The only Asian country in the list is Brunei. China, India, and Indonesia have not been included so far. In addition to this, vaccinated travellers from South Korea will also be allowed to enter the country from November 15, reported news agency ANI.To avail the VTL scheme travellers have to fly to Singapore in a VTL-designated flight flown by Singapore Airlines or Lufthansa. The government will be adding other carriers to the list over time. Singapore Airlines is expanding VTL flight services to 14 cities, with more points on special designated services to be announced in coming weeks, the carrier said in a statement.Meanwhile, a senior Indian government official said, “The appropriate ministries will work on resolving whatever the concerns are but there is nothing to be said formally at the moment on the matter.”Travellers will also need to carry proof of their vaccination and undergo RT-PCR test not more than 48 hours before their departure and also on their arrival at Singapore’s Changi airport. Previously, travellers had to take four such tests to gain entry.This announcement comes days after Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s push to live with Covid-19 without being paralysed by fear. During a televised address on Saturday, Loong said that the delta variant has shown that Covid-19 is not going away anywhere. However, with vaccinations, social distancing measures and careful monitoring, it will be possible to live with the “new normal”. “It will take us at least three months, and perhaps as long as six months, to get there,” he cautioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-not-among-11-countries-allowed-quarantine-free-travel-to-singapore-101633976829338.html
12-10-2021||India||India set to ink key trade deals by next year||India is set to conclude three major trade agreements with the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and Australia by 2022, and is close to signing early harvesttrade deals separately with the three nations, three people aware of the development said. The government has set aggressive timelines for the agreements as part of its ambitious target of $500 billion exports by the financial year to March 2023 – formalisation of a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with the UAE by early 2022, a free trade agreement (FTA) with the UK by next year, and an interim trade deal with Australia by December. These will be followed a year later by a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA), the people said, requesting anonymity. The negotiations with the UAE are on a fast track. The first round of talks was held on September 23-24 in New Delhi during the visit of UAE minister of state for trade Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi. “The aim is to sign a formal CEPA in March 2022,” one person said. “Both sides are serious about negotiating and concluding CEPA in line with the determination of the leadership of both countries,” a second person added. “Both sides are closely connected and working to achieve this agreement, which will complement the India-UAE strategic partnership.” The agreement is expected to raise bilateral trade in goods to $100 billion and in services to $15 billion in five years. The UAE was India’s third largest trading partner with about $59.1 billion of bilateral trade in 2019-20, a largely non-Covid period. India’s major exports to the UAE include refined petroleum products, minerals, cereals, sugar, fruits, vegetables, tea, meat, seafood, textiles, engineering, machinery products, and chemicals. It imports petroleum and petroleum products, precious metals, stones, jewellery, minerals, chemicals and wood products. “India and the UK plan to launch negotiations on an FTA from next month in two stages – low-hanging fruits (early trade deal) by March 2022 on priority, followed by a comprehensive agreement,” a third person said. The tentative timeline for the FTA and other trade matters was chalked out during discussions between commerce minister Piyush Goyal and UK trade secretary Liz Truss last month. The two countries also agreed to quickly finalise terms of reference so that negotiations can be launched in November, he said, adding rapid progress has been seen after an “Enhanced Trade Partnership” was announced by the prime ministers of both nations in May. India has also revived CECA negotiations with Australia, which has tremendous potential, said the first person cited earlier. “It is expected that the long-pending FTA negotiations with Australia may conclude by 2022 and an agreement could be signed thereafter,” he said. Australia and India launched negotiations for a CECA in May 2011, but talks were suspended in September 2015 after nine rounds because of differences on some multilateral issues. Negotiations by the two countries were “relaunched in June last year and an aggressive timeline” was agreed at the India-Australia joint ministerial commission meeting between Goyal and his Australian counterpart Dan Tehan on September 30, he said. Tehan said the aim is to have an interim agreement covering goods, services, investments, rules of origin, phyto-sanitary measures for fruits and vegetables, and mutual recognition of qualifications in place by December this year, to be followed by a final agreement in December 2022. He said the two sides are expected to make market access offers by the end of October. “It’s going to be a challenge. These things are not easy,” Tehan said, acknowledging Indian concerns in areas such as dairy and agriculture. The market access offers will be a “difficult” aspect requiring hard work by both sides, he said. Though both sides will have to make compromises, Australia can offer investments and technology to boost food and agricultural processing in India, Tehan said. Australia is also open to equitably handling the issue of domestic subsidies in agriculture, he added. India has set an ambitious of exports target of $450-$500 billion by the next financial year and early harvest deals, along with full FTAs, will play a major role in realising this goal, the first person said. Besides the three most prospective FTAs, New Delhi is negotiating trade deals with other countries and blocs. They include Oman, Canada, the European Union, Russia, and the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), which comprises Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland. Speaking at a midterm review meeting of export promotion councils (EPCs) on Saturday, Goyal asked the bodies to raise trade-related concerns faced in these countries so that the government can address them while negotiating individual FTAs. He said such issues were mostly related to market access rather than tariffs. Goyal said India is on the right track as its exports touched $197 billion in the first half of the current financial year. “Our exporters have made all of us Indians proud today,” he said in a statement, adding “if we can aim to scale $450-$500 billion exports next year”.Nilaya Varma, co-founder and CEO of consultancy firm Primus Partners, said: “UAE, UK, and Australia are three key economies, and India’s old allies. Trade negotiations with them in both goods and services have progressed very well and signs of early harvest deals are visible, which will finally culminate into comprehensive FTAs. It’s a win-win for both India and its partners.”Meanwhile, commerce minister Goyal met ministers of at least 15 countries on Monday on the sidelines of the G20 Trade Ministers Meeting in Sorrento, Italy, a government spokesperson said. He clarified India’s trade position and engaged in bilateral and multilateral negotiations with the ministers of the US, the UK, the EU, Brazil, China, Australia, South Africa, Indonesia, Canada, South Korea and Mexico, among others, the official said.At the meetings, Goyal also asserted India’s position for the forthcoming Twelfth Ministerial Conference (MC12) of World Trade Organization (WTO) to be held in November at Geneva in Switzerland. Goyal said the multilateral trade deal must be “just and equitable” and “historical wrongs against developing countries must be corrected” rather than being carried over, the official cited above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-set-to-ink-key-trade-deals-by-next-year-101633976408612.html
12-10-2021||India||71 loans given in Rana Kapoor’s tenure turned bad: ED||At least 71 loans worth over ₹31,855 crore approved by Yes Bank during the tenure of former chief executive and managing director Rana Kapoor have turned bad, according to a recent charge sheet by the Enforcement Directorate.The charge sheet by the central agency that investigates financial crimes was filed on October 1 in a Delhi court in connection with irregularities in a loan worth ₹514.27 crore granted to the Avantha Group by Yes Bank in 2018. HT has reviewed a copy.The directorate has accused Kapoor and Gautam Thapar, promoter of the Avantha Group, of colluding to fraudulently obtain a credit facility by creating sham agreements, causing a loss of public money worth ₹466.51 crore. Out of ₹514.27 crore, ₹14.11 crore was in processing fees, which was paid by Oyster Buildwell Pvt. Ltd, an Avantha Group company. And of the total, only ₹47.75 crore was recovered by the bank.Several officers of Yes Bank were paid huge salaries, much higher than market rates, and were given perks, promotions and prestigious titles by Kapoor to deter them from raising red flags in the dubious decisions, the charge sheet said.When these officers were interrogated, they held Kapoor responsible, but the agency alleged that they were hand-in-glove with him in taking these decisions.The new management of Yes Bank found Ashish Agarwal, senior group president and chief risk officer, accountable for 71 bad loans worth ₹31,855 crore, and imposed a penalty of ₹50 lakh on him for dereliction of duty, ED said in the charge sheet.“It is important to mention here that all these (71) loans had been sanctioned under the chairmanship of Rana Kapoor, including the one given to Avantha Group,” according to the charge sheet.In most of these 71 loans, investigations are either ongoing or the loans have been declared as fraud.Agarwal was paid a salary of ₹5 crore every year during Kapoor’s tenure. The new management has reduced it to ₹2 crore.Other Yes Bank executives, including Amit Kumar (president), Harsh Gupta (former president), Vinod Bahety (group president), Amit Mamtani (president), Pawan Kumar Aggarwal (senior president) and others, who were paid high salaries by Kapoor-led management, have faced financial penalties or salary reduction after the irregularities were revealed.ED has named them as accused in the charge sheet.Avantha Group’s Thapar and Kapoor are also being investigated in other cases, including a probe pertaining to sale of a 1.2-acre bungalow at 40, Amrita Sher-Gil Marg in New Delhi, allegedly at half its market price, in lieu of a loan worth around ₹1,900 crore granted by Yes Bank to Thapar’s group company. It is alleged that a bribe of ₹307 crore changed hands during the sale of the bungalow.Kapoor is lodged in a Mumbai jail. Gautam Thapar was arrested in August this year and is lodged in a jail in Delhi.Yes Bank did not respond to detailed queries. Kapoor’s team was not available for comment while Thapar’s legal team didn’t respond to HT’s calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/71-loans-given-in-kapoor-s-tenure-turned-bad-ed-101633976406867.html
12-10-2021||India||CBI raids at premises of former Maharashtra minister Anil Deshmukh||The Central Bureau of India (CBI) on Monday conducted searches at the premises of former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh at multiple locations in connection with the leak of confidential documents related to the preliminary enquiry against him on allegations of corruption, officials said Monday.A team of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officials reached the residence of Deshmukh in Nagpur and Mumbai this morning with necessary warrants, they said.The investigating agency on September 2 arrested Deshmukh’s lawyer Anand Daga and its own sub-inspector Abhishek Tiwari for allegedly leaking confidential documents related to the preliminary enquiry against Deshmukh, they said.The agency had started a PE on the orders of the Bombay High Court which had issued the directions while hearing a public interest litigation on allegations of corruption against Deshmukh.The PE findings showed the Deputy SP probing the matter had purportedly opined that no cognisable offence was made out against Deshmukh but it was later converted into an FIR based on a contrasting opinion of the Deputy SP.The opinion mentioned in the FIR said that cognisable offence is made out against Deshmukh.The findings giving clean chit to Deshmukh got leaked to the media causing an embarrassment to the CBI after opposition parties accused the agency of conducting a motivated probe against the then minister.Soon after the leak, the CBI booked Tiwari and Daga on the allegations of leaking documents.It has been reliably learnt that Sub-Inspector Tiwari came in contact with Nagpur-based advocate Daga during the course of the inquiry, the FIR alleged.It said that Tiwari had been in regular contact with him, it alleged.The FIR alleged that Daga handed an IPhone 12 pro as illegal gratification to Tiwari for passing details of the enquiry and investigation pertaining to corruption allegations against Deshmukh.The agency also alleged that Tiwari had been receiving illegal gratification from Daga at regular intervals.

12-10-2021||India||Air quality slips to ‘poor’ zone at some stations in the Capital||Air quality in Delhi has started deteriorating, as seven localities out of 36in the national capital fell to the ‘poor’ category, Central Pollution Control Board data show. Although air pollution is likely to remain in the ‘moderate’ category because of reasonably strong winds, a rise in is expected in the coming weeks, a scientist at the India Meteorological Department said. The air quality index (AQI) for the city as a whole was 166 on Monday, but it was worse in Shadipur (211), Lodhi Road (231), Jahangirpuri (218), Wazirpur (223), Mundka (256), Anand Vihar (281) and Chandni Chowk (236). A value between 201 and 300 is considered poor, affecting the elderly, children and people with heart and lung problems. A value between 101 and 200 is termed moderate. The last time the city’s AQI rose above 200 was on July 2.The impact of farm fires in Punjab and Haryana is still negligible because the winds changed from easterly to northeasterly from October 6, when the southwest monsoon withdrew from the region, explained the Met scientist. “This is likely to remain the case through this week, and because of this the AQI is also expected to remain in the moderate zone,” the weather scientist said, requesting anonymity. The burning of farm residue, which sends up clouds of smoke into the atmosphere that then descends over the capital, is one of the reasons for the annual bad air crisis that marks autumn in Delhi. The transition to winter also weakens winds, which means local pollutants are not blown away as they usually do during other times of the year.The predominant pollutant in Delhi’s air on Monday was PM 10, which is particulate matter less than 10 micrometres thick, or dust, according to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the air quality monitoring system run by the Union ministry of earth science. “Delhi’s AQI is in the moderate category with PM10 as the main pollutant. Due to very dry conditions, local dust gets re-suspended, leading to high PM10,” Safar’s air quality assessment said. “This condition is leading to moderate AQI in Delhi, and will keep so for next three days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-quality-slips-to-poor-zone-at-some-stations-in-the-capital-101633976286839.html

It seems she is desperate to please her friends in the BJP,” he was quoted as saying by PTI.Citing the examples of Rhea Chakraborty being “hounded” in the Sushant Singh Rajput case, the Congress leader further claimed that the arrest of Aryan was a conspiracy hatched to “defame” Shah Rukh and his family as the actor didn’t bow before the BJP.Besides Chowdhury, several politicians have spoken about Aryan Khan’s matter. The spokesperson of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) Nawab Malik has recently said that the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) initially detained as many as 11 people in the case, but let go of three people, including the brother-in-law of a BJP leader.Meanwhile, Union minister Narayan Rane’s son and BJP leader Nitesh Rane hit out at Malik, saying if the latter is sympathising with Aryan “because it’s a Khan.”Aryan, who was arrested on October 3, is currently in judicial custody and lodged at Mumbai’s Arthur Road prison. His bail plea will next be heard on Wednesday by a special Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congs-adhir-chowdhury-says-mamata-silent-on-aryan-khan-s-case-to-please-bjp-101633975392575.html

Those levelling allegations against me of ₹120 crore or ₹130 crore should know where the material quantity will be kept. Those who have done the scam should be probed.”ED’s money laundering probe is based on an investigation carried out by the customs department and the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence in 2009 in the export of muriate of potash or MOP worth ₹57 lakh in 12 consignments the same year. MOP is a restricted commodity for export under the foreign trade policy.The customs department’s investigation report, reviewed by HT, states that Agrasain Gehlot’s company – M/s Anupam Krishi – allegedly played a key role in the irregularities. It is suspected that the MOP was exported to companies in Malaysia and Singapore.The customs probe report states that Agrasain Gehlot “knowingly opted to become part of the syndicate in the entire chain of conspiracy by facilitating the said consortium (of private companies) by supplying subsidized MOP, which was meant for sale to farmers only and forged documents for which he admittedly gained certain amount as his commission”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-quizzes-rajasthan-cm-gehlot-s-brother-in-fertiliser-export-case-101633975867471.html
12-10-2021||India||Four arrested over ‘forced conversions’ in Karnataka||Four people have been arrested in Karnataka’s Udupi district after a complaint was registered against them for allegedly converting people into Christianity, police said on Monday. “There was a complaint that four people were converting people from lower castes into Christianity,” a police officer of Kota precinct in Kundapura taluk of Udupi district. “We went there, and based on our preliminary investigation, an FIR (first information report) has been filed.” The incident reportedly took place on Sunday night. The four accused — Prakash, Jyothi, Ravichandra and Manohar — have been named in the FIR, the officer said, declining to be named. A court on Monday sent them to judicial custody for 15 days. The southern state has been seeing a surge in allegations of forced religious conversions, moral policing and hate crimes in recent times. On Sunday night, members of a right-wing Hindu organisation barged into the home of the accused who are all said to be part of the same household and confronted them in front of police personnel, people aware of the Kundapura incident said on condition of anonymity. A purported video of the incident was widely circulated on social media, in which one of the accused in the case, Jyothi, is seen arguing with the group that entered their home forcibly. HT cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video.Last month, Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said his government was considering a law to ban forced religious conversions. “Such things (conversions) are happening here and there. A couple of days ago, I gave appropriate directions to district administrations not to allow any religious conversion through inducement or by force, as it is illegal,” Bommai said on September 28. Bommai’s statement came days after the issue was raised by Goolihatti D Shekar, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator from Hosadurga, in the monsoon session of the state assembly in September. Shekar said there has been heightened activity around conversions and his own mother has been converted after she was “brainwashed”. On Sunday evening, at least four families from a community classified as an extremely backward caste, who had converted to Christianity, embraced Hinduism at Hosadurga taluka in Chitradurga district. “Four families came to a temple and said they will continue in our religion, follow our culture and traditions,” Shekar said on Sunday. “They are from Maruthi Nagar and from Sudugadu Sidda community.” Several BJP-ruled states like Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh have enacted laws to prevent forcible religious conversions. In recent times, several right-wing Hindu outfits have accused Christian missionaries of luring people from backward classes to convert into Christianity, a claim denied by churches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-arrested-over-forced-conversions-in-karnataka-101633975687364.html
12-10-2021||India||PM Modi launches India’s first private space association||New Delhi: India will soon have policies on space communication and remote sensing, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday while launching the Indian Space Association, a group formed to promote space technology. The draft policies, which are being finalised, are expected to enable commercialisation of space technology and facilitate private investments in India’s space sector. “The government’s approach to space reforms is based on four pillars,” the Prime Minister said. “First, the freedom of innovation in the private sector. Second, the role of the government as an enabler. Third, preparing the youth for the future. And fourth, to see the space sector as a resource for the progress of the common man.”The new association counts private companies such as Bharti Airtel, Larsen & Toubro, Tata Group’s Nelco, OneWeb, MapmyIndia, Walchandnagar Industries and Alpha Design Technologies as members, besides the state-owned Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro). “The space sector is a major medium for the progress of 130 crore countrymen. For India, the space sector means better mapping, imaging and connectivity facilities for the common people,” Modi said. “Also, the space sector means better speed from shipment to delivery for entrepreneurs. It also means better security and income for fishermen and better forecasts of natural calamities.”The opening up of the space sector is in sync with the government’s overall reforms policy, Modi said. “While opening a host of sectors, the government has built a regulatory environment in which priority has been given to national interest as well as the interests of different stakeholders. Space sector was once synonymous with the government sector, but the government has worked to change this mindset,” he said. “Now is not a time for linear innovations for the country, but for exponential innovation, and this will be made possible when the government plays the role of an enabler and not handler. That is why it has been sharing expertise in sectors ranging from defence to space.” Modi said his vision of a self-reliant India is a strategy to make the country a global manufacturing and innovations powerhouse by enhancing the capabilities of local entrepreneurs and youth. It will play a big role in global development, enhancing the prestige of India’s human resources talent, the Prime Minister said.In the past seven years, space technology has been converted into a tool of last-mile delivery and leakage-free, transparent governance, Modi said, providing examples of the use of geo-tagging in houses for the poor, roads and infrastructure projects.“Development projects are being monitored by satellite imaging. Space technology is being used in settlement of Fasal Bima Yojna (crop insurance scheme) claims, NavIC system is helping fishermen, disaster management planning is also being carried out through this technology,” Modi said. NavIC is an independent regional navigation satellite system developed by Isro. Several countries are turning their attention to space technologies, especially since 2020 when SpaceX became the first private agency to fly humans into space. The company also has the Starlink project -- a constellation of satellites meant to deliver internet connectivity, as does its upstart rival, Blue Origin and its project Kuiper. Earlier this month, SpaceX announced it intends to offer Starlink broadband services in India starting December 2022.According to estimates of the space industry, 95% of the $366 billion earned in the sector was from what is called the space-for-earth economy. This include goods or services produced in space for use on earth, such as telecommunications and internet infrastructure, earth observation capabilities, and national security satellites. The announcement by Modi on Monday about the policies in work could serve as a crucial signal for potential investors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-launches-india-s-first-private-space-association-101633975628122.html

The summit has been convened by Italy, which holds the rotating presidency of the grouping of 20 of the world’s major economies. Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi has discussed Afghanistan with world leaders such as Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping as part of efforts to organise the special meeting to forge strategies to confront the crisis. The agenda of the meeting will include a discussion on the response to the humanitarian needs of Afghanistan and access to basic services and livelihood, security and the fight against terrorism, and also mobility, migration and human rights, the external affairs ministry said. Earlier, Modi participated in a virtual format in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)- Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) outreach summit on Afghanistan on September 17, when he cautioned the international community against rushing to recognise the Taliban setup in Kabul as the change of power in Afghanistan was not inclusive and was done without negotiations. External affairs minister S Jaishankar participated in a meeting of G20 foreign ministers on Afghanistan on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York last month.

They agreed on the need for a coordinated international approach to engagement with the Taliban, emphasising the importance of upholding human rights in the country,” a 10 Downing Street spokesperson said.The external affairs ministry said the leaders “agreed on the need to develop a common international perspective on issues regarding extremism and terrorism, as well as human rights and rights of women and minorities”. Modi also tweeted about the meeting. “Was a pleasure to speak to Prime Minister @BorisJohnson. We reviewed progress on the India-UK Agenda 2030, exchanged views on climate action in the context of the forthcoming COP-26 in Glasgow, and shared our assessments on regional issues including Afghanistan,” he said.Johnson and Modi further discussed the shared fight against coronavirus disease and the importance of cautiously opening up international travel. “They agreed the UK’s recognition of Indian vaccine certification is a welcome development to that end,” the readout said.A Taliban delegation led by acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi is currently in Qatar for talks with several countries, including the US, aimed at getting international recognition for the setup in Kabul and to seek the lifting of a freeze on assets worth around $10 billion.The US state department said an interagency delegation that held talks with the Taliban representatives in Doha during October 9-10 “focused on security and terrorism concerns”, safe passage for US citizens, foreign nationals and Afghan partners and human rights. The US said it would continue to provide humanitarian aid directly to the Afghan people, and the American delegation reiterated that the Taliban “will be judged on its actions, not only its words”.India has asked the world community not to be in a rush to recognise the Taliban setup as it is not inclusive and was formed without negotiations.During their phone conversation, Modi and Johnson discussed the overall India-UK relationship and “welcomed the progress made on the 2030 Roadmap since it was agreed...in May”, according to the readout from Downing Street. This included progress in areas such as trade and defence.They also reviewed progress in the “enhanced trade partnership”, which is aimed at concluding a free trade agreement by next year. The leaders also looked forward to the upcoming visit of the UK carrier strike group led by the HMS Queen Elizabeth to India and the deepening of the bilateral strategic partnership.They had an extensive discussion on issues related to climate change in the context of the COP26 Summit in Glasgow in November. Modi conveyed India’s commitment to climate action, as reflected in New Delhi’s ambitious target for expanding renewable energy and the new National Hydrogen Mission. Johnson “underlined the importance of making concrete progress on climate change ahead of and at the upcoming COP26 Summit”, and noted that India already leads the world in renewable technology. Johnson also expressed his hope that India “will commit to a more ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution and to achieving Net Zero emissions”, the readout said.The UK announced last week that it will begin accepting India’s vaccine certificates from October 11, ending a travel row that resulted in British nationals facing a 10-day mandatory quarantine on arrival even if they are fully vaccinated.British high commissioner Alex Ellis has said there will be “no quarantine” for Indian travellers who were fully vaccinated with Covishield or any other UK-approved vaccine||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-modi-johnson-phone-call-india-uk-back-global-approach-to-engaging-taliban-101633946105450.html
12-10-2021||India||Five soldiers killed in J&K encounter with terrorists||Five soldiers, including a junior commissioned officer (JCO), were killed in an exchange of fire with heavily armed terrorists in a forested area at Surankote in Jammu and Kashmir’s (J&K) Poonch district on Monday amid a spike in violence in the region.Three other gunfights were reported on Monday in Kashmir — while two terrorists were killed and a policeman was injured in encounters in Anantnag and Bandipora, a gun battle was on till late on Monday in Shopian. The latest casualties are the worst security forces have suffered in anti-insurgency operations in J&K this year.The exchange of fire in Poonch was triggered during a cordon and search operation that was launched early on Monday morning following intelligence inputs about the presence of around four to five terrorists in the forested area near the Line of Control (LoC), or the de facto border between India and Pakistan, in J&K.“In ensuing firefight during the ongoing encounter with terrorists, a JCO and four soldiers of Indian Army suffered critical injuries. The critically injured were evacuated to the nearest medical facility but they succumbed to their injuries,” said army spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand. He added that additional reinforcements have been rushed to the area.October, just before the onset of winter, usually sees an increase in infiltration attempts with handlers of the terrorists in Pakistan trying to get more of them into India before traversing the already inhospitable terrain becomes almost impossible.Those killed in the incident were identified as Jaswinder Singh, Mandeep Singh, Gajjan Singh, Saraj Singh and Vaisakh H, the army said.The last time security forces suffered significant casualties was in May 2020 when five of their personnel, including a Colonel and a Major, were killed in an 18-hour anti-insurgency operation in the Handwara area of Kashmir valley.Earlier in the day, security forces launched a cordon and search operation at Khagund in Anantnag district’s Verinag area following intelligence inputs, an official said. The search operation turned into an encounter after the terrorists opened fire on the security forces, who retaliated, he said. One terrorist was killed in the gunfight and a policeman was injured.In another gun battle, which broke out at Gundjahangir in Bandipora district’s Hajin area, a Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist was killed. “Killed terrorist has been identified as Imtiyaz Ahmad Dar affiliated with proscribed terror outfit LeT (TRF). He was involved in recent civilian killing at Shahgund Bandipora,” inspector general of police, Kashmir, Vijay Kumar tweeted.TRF, or The Resistance Front, is an offshoot of LeT that has claimed responsibility for multiple attacks on civilians and minorities in the state in recent days.Late on Monday, an encounter broke out in the Tulran area of Shopian district of Jammu and Kashmir between terrorists and security forces. The gunfight was on till late on Monday and a video clip showed army jawans asking the terrorists to surrender through an announcement system.The fresh casualties come after a series of targeted attacks left seven civilians dead in the Valley this month.Four terrorists associated with the Lashkar-e-Taiba were arrested for the killing of Mohammad Shafi Lone in Kashmir’s Bandipora district, officials said Sunday. At least 500 people have been detained in connection with the string of civilian killings in the Valley, the officials said.Kashmir has been restive after the murders of seven people, in separate incidents, since October 3. Lone, the president of a taxi drivers’ union in Bandipora, was shot dead on October 5. The Centre has sent Intelligence Bureau’s counter-terror chief Tapan Deka to the Valley to oversee the operations.Security forces have had exchanges of fire with terrorists in adjoining Rajouri district’s Daddal, Pangai, and Karyote this year after a brief lull in violence amid a decline in infiltration from across the LoC.J&K Police chief Dilbag Singh said in August that infiltration resumed after a brief lull following a renewed truce deal between the India and Pakistani directors general of military operations (DGMOs) in February. He added that terror camps across the border remained intact.The DGMOs on February 25 announced the two countries agreed to strictly observe the ceasefire along the LoC.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-army-s-jco-4-soldiers-killed-in-encounter-with-terrorists-in-jammu-101633940473121.html
12-10-2021||India||Next phase of Quad’s naval drills to kick off in Bay of Bengal today||India, the United States, Japan and Australia will kick off the second phase of this year’s Malabar naval drills in the Bay of Bengal on Tuesday, with the exercise seeking to build on the synergy, coordination and interoperability developed during the first phase held in August, the Indian Navy said in a statement. The second phase, to be held from October 12-15, will focus on advanced surface and anti-submarine warfare exercises, seamanship evolution and weapon firings, it said. The navies of the Quad nations conducted the first phase of the drills near the Pacific Ocean island of Guam from August 26 to 29. It involved destroyers, frigates, corvettes, submarines, helicopters, long-range maritime patrol aircraft and elite special forces elements, including US Navy SEALs and Indian Navy’s marine commandos, also know as MARCOS. The Indian Navy will participate in the second phase with INS Ranvijay, INS Satpura, P-8I long-range maritime patrol aircraft and a submarine, the statement said. The US Navy will be represented by aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, and two destroyers, USS Lake Champlain and USS Stockdale. Japan will be represented by JS Kaga and JS Murasame, while the Royal Australian Navy will be represented by HMAS Ballarat and HMAS Sirius. India is also preparing to conduct its first tri-service exercise with the United Kingdom in the Arabian Sea in October, as previously reported by Hindustan Times. The Royal Navy will send a carrier strike group, led by HMS Queen Elizabeth, for the drills that will be conducted from October 21 to 27. So far, India has conducted tri-service drills with two other countries – the US and Russia. Earlier, the Quad navies carried out drills in November 2020 in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. China has been monitoring the activities of the Quad countries. Beijing has been wary of the Quadrilateral security dialogue that was revived in late 2017 by India, the US, Australia and Japan. These suspicions have increased since the four countries upgraded the forum to the ministerial level in 2019. From carrying out naval drills with like-minded countries to reaching out to states in the Indian Ocean region, the Indian Navy is focusing on checking China’s rising ambitions in the region and sending out a strong message that Beijing’s power play in the South China Sea cannot be replicated in the Indian Ocean. Last November, navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh said a “great power competition” was playing out in the Indian Ocean region, where the Indian Navy has stepped up surveillance to check China’s ambitions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quad-navies-set-to-kick-off-2nd-phase-of-malabar-drills-101633935786044.html
12-10-2021||India||Breakdown in talks as China refuses to budge||The 13th round of military talks between India and China to cool tensions in eastern Ladakh reached an impasse on Sunday, with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) not agreeing to suggestions made by the Indian Army.“During the meeting, the Indian side made constructive suggestions for resolving the remaining areas, but the Chinese side was not agreeable and also could not provide any forward-looking proposals. The meeting thus did not result in resolution of the remaining areas (friction points),” the Indian Army said in a statement on Monday.China, meanwhile, accused India of “unreasonable and unrealistic demands” in an unusually aggressive statement.Also Read| On LAC, China’s intent is clearThe Chinese statement issued on Monday quoted Western Theatre Command spokesperson Colonel Long Shaohua as saying that China made “…great efforts to promote the easing and cooling of the border situation and fully demonstrated its sincerity in order to maintain the overall situation of the relations between the two militaries”, but “India still insisted on the unreasonable and unrealistic demands, which made the negotiations more difficult”.The statements of the two armies are among the strongest since talks began, and may well indicate that there is a stalemate.The focus of the ongoing talks is to cool tensions at Hot Springs and Depsang, as reported by Hindustan Times. Disengagement of soldiers deployed at Hot Springs was on the agenda for the 13th round of talks.The outcome of the latest round of talks is disappointing as PP-15 (Hot Springs) appeared relatively easier to resolve and would have shown some move forward to break the deadlock, former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd) said.“Unfortunately, the tenor of statements, particularly from the Chinese side, indicates that there is a hardening of position. Perhaps with the infrastructure developments and capability build-up on their side, PLA feels it can hold on to its current positions and has, therefore, adopted a stronger negotiating stance,” Hooda said. “This will obviously lead to an extended period of tension along the LAC (Line of Actual Control).”The two sides, however, agreed to maintain communications and ensure stability on the ground. “It is our expectation that the Chinese side will take into account the overall perspective of bilateral relations and will work towards early resolution of the remaining issues while fully abiding by bilateral agreements and protocols,” the Indian statement said.The two armies on Sunday held talks to resolve problems at frictions points on the contested LAC in eastern Ladakh where India and China have been locked in a border standoff for over 17 months.The meeting between India’s Ladakh Corps Commander and Chinese South Xinjiang military district commander took place on Sunday on the Chinese side of the Moldo-Chushul border meeting point.India has repeatedly and consistently rejected China’s allegations that Indian troops crossed over to the Chinese side of the LAC in eastern Ladakh, asserting that New Delhi has always taken a responsible approach towards border management and maintaining peace and tranquillity along the border.The talks came against the backdrop of massive military buildup and infrastructure development by PLA across LAC, where the Indian Army has matched the Chinese moves.At the 13th round of talks between corps commanders, the Indian side told PLA that the situation along the LAC was caused by the latter’s unilateral attempts to alter the status quo in violation of bilateral agreements. The Chinese were also told to take appropriate steps at the remaining friction points to restore peace and tranquillity along LAC in the western sector.“This would also be in accord with the guidance provided by the two foreign ministers in their recent meeting in Dushanbe, where they had agreed that the two sides should resolve the remaining issues at the earliest. The Indian side emphasised such resolution of the remaining areas would facilitate progress in the bilateral relations,” said the statement by the Indian Army. Its reference was to the September 16meeting between Indian foreign minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi.The military dialogue took place more than two months after the last round of talks that led to disengagement of forward deployed troops from Gogra, or Patrol Point-17A, one of the flashpoints on the LAC, in early August.Also Read| LAC and the India-China stalemateIn February, the two armies pulled back troops and weaponry from Pangong Tso. Despite two rounds of disengagement at friction points this year, they still have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each and advanced weaponry in eastern Ladakh.If the Chinese army is to stay in Ladakh, so is the Indian Army, army chief General Naravane said on Saturday, flagging India’s concern about the continuing Chinese buildup in the theatre.The 13th round of talks followed a face-off between Indian and Chinese soldiers along the border in north-east India’s Arunachal Pradesh’s Tawang around a fortnight ago, and another incursion by the Chinese in Uttarakhand in northern India on August 30.China’s resolve to safeguard national sovereignty is firm, said Long, the Chinese colonel.India should cherish the hard-won situation in the China-India border areas and abide by relevant agreements and consensus between the two countries and the two militaries, he said in the statement cited earlier.Long said China hopes “India will show sincerity, take actions and work with China to jointly safeguard peace and stability in the border areas”.Ahead of Sunday’s talks, Chinese official media and social media handles had renewed their shrill propaganda, blaming India for the border tension.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pla-rejects-indian-proposals-to-cool-lac-tensions-no-breakthrough-in-talks-101633927564376.html

12-10-2021||Today's||Gati Shakti: A major leap in governance||The launch of the Gati Shakti master plan is a momentous occasion for an Atmanirbhar Bharat in the making. The project is yet another leaf from Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s inclusive development repertoire, which has brought about paradigm shifts in governance and age-old frameworks across the spectrum. Right from reforms such as “One Nation One Market” to “One Sun, One World, One Grid” to “One Nation, One Ration Card”, in one scheme after another, PM Modi has sought to bind fragmented systems together with a unified, all-encompassing approach. The Gati Shakti vision will do just as its name suggests, ie, lend more power and speed to projects under the $1.5-trillion National Infrastructure Pipeline by sharing resources and developing synergies towards building a more harmonised infrastructure. It will ensure last-mile connectivity to economic zones in a definite timeframe. The aim is to ultimately improve India’s productive capacity and global competitiveness with regard to manufacturing in India. Here’s why its timing matters. The pandemic has dealt a body blow to targets across ministries, putting a spanner in our future growth plans. Given that our ambitious mission of a $5-trillion economy stands undeterred, it is fitting for India to not just build new supply-side capacities that can set the wheels of growth in motion, but also build them in the most optimal manner. To have all utility and infrastructure planning under an umbrella framework is an unprecedented and complex task. For a long time, India’s infrastructure sector was marred by interministerial delays, multiple layers of stakeholders, and the culture of working in silos. This often led to confounded decision-making, time and cost overruns, and thus, a staggered pace for infrastructure-led growth.For example, in the execution of airport projects, especially those in the hilly areas, coordinated planning is quintessential since several factors have to be taken into consideration — hundreds of crossings across power lines, pipelines and water bodies. Naturally, an initiative to consolidate infrastructure projects in specific corridors will help various ministries plan projects side by side without getting entangled in cumbersome approval processes.In the same vein, the geographic information system (GIS)-enabled digital platform under Gati Shakti will prove to be a useful treasure trove of information — including a region’s topography, satellite images, physical features, maps of existing facilities and so on — for ministries, thus, helping them save on funds and time for approvals.With Gati Shakti, India will also get its foot in the door to build an integrated, harmonised transportation and logistics grid. Currently, logistics and supply chain costs account for 12% to 13% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), compared to the global average of 8%. An excessive dependence on transportation by road and the under-utilisation of waterways, air and rail networks has also ballooned costs for the supply chain industry. Supply chain inefficiencies add to product costs, and thus, run the risk of making our exports uncompetitive vis-à-vis other international export players.A multimodal transportation network will not only provide manufacturers faster access to domestic and international markets, but will have a multiplier effect on the economy too. It will ensure that infrastructure investments flowing into the country are better utilised by our economic hubs, and open the doors for new future economic zones. Thus, the eventual pay-off of a ₹100-lakh crore Gati Shakti project will be inestimably large, kicking in a virtuous cycle of investments, large employment opportunities, aggregate demand, and thus economic growth. Besides, the concerted approach will also help increase India’s air freight share, which has seen a one-of-a-kind upswing since last year. India’s share in the international cargo business was worth ₹1,686 crore in 2019-20, which rose to ₹2,644 crore in 2020-21 (a 57% increase).However, we have only touched the tip of the iceberg. A large part of our freight comprises bulk material which could be more economically served by air. Many centres such as Dubai are making use of concepts like sea-air, where cargo is initially transported by sea freight, and later by air freight. This combination is proven to have led to significant savings in transit time and costs. Thus, Gati Shakti could pave the way for a culture of multimodality, where sea, road, rail and air transport modes do not compete with each other, but rather, complement each other.The first steps in the direction of a vision as ambitious as this one are always challenging. Clearly, the government’s ability to take quick action exhibited by the roll out of a master plan for the project in less than two months of its announcement on August 15, underscores the seriousness of its intent to undertake reforms. It is due to these very reforms, undertaken under the stewardship of PM Modi, that India has risen to become a favoured destination for investments. The Gati Shakti vision is yet another important step that will form the basis of the PM’s vision of “Amrut Kaal”— the 25-year period till India celebrates 100 years of its Independence — a period that will see India return to its golden age.
