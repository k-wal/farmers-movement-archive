14-10-2021||Lucknow||‘AIMIM to hold rallies in west UP after Dussehra’||The All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul- Muslimeen (AIMIM) led by Asaduddin Owaisi has planned to organise a series of rallies in the west Uttar Pradesh after Dussehra.Party’s state unit president Shaukat Ali said, “Party chief Asaduddin Owaisi will address a ‘vanchit-shoshit samaj’ (deprived and victimised communities) conference in Ghaziabad on October 17, Meerut on October 23, Muzaffarnagar October 27 and in Saharanpur on October 31.”To strengthen its support base, the AIMIM has organised the rallies in the districts of central and eastern UP, including Bahraich, Barabanki, Sultanpur, Balrampur, Azamagarh, Kanpur and Prayagraj, too.On September 22, Owaisi addressed a rally at Sambhal. There was a heated exchange of words between the BJP and AIMIM leaders after Owaisi called Sambhal the land of the “Ghazis”.An AIMIM leader said the party had decided to field its candidates on 100 seats in the 2022 UP assembly election. “Along with galvanising the party cadre for the polls, Owaisi is also assessing the support base of the party by organising “vanchit, shoshit samaj” conference in various districts. The party has focused on the Muslim dominated areas of the state to strengthen its base,” he added.The AIMIM has mobilised its resources and cadre for the success of the rallies in west UP that has become the centre of farmers’ agitation led by Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU).Addressing a rally in Baghpat recently, BKU leader Rakesh Tikait attacked Owaisi calling him “chacha jaan” (uncle) of the BJP. Owaisi countered Tikait’s allegation stating that Tikait supported the BJP in the 2017 UP assembly election. During the Muzaffarnagar riots in 2013, Tikait remained a mute spectator to the atrocities committed on Muslim community, he alleged.Owaisi said he will take the fight for the justice and empowerment of the Muslim community to west UP by organising rallies there. The AIMIM plans to challenge the might of the political parties like the BJP, the SP, the BSP and thew RLD that have strong presence in the assembly seats located in west UP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/aimim-to-hold-rallies-in-west-up-after-dussehra-101634235892108.html
14-10-2021||Lucknow||Bail plea of ex-IPS officer Amitabh Thakur rejected||The court of additional district judge (ADJ) on Thursday rejected bail application of former IPS officer Amitabh Thakur who was arrested in August this year after a rape victim died by suicide after accusing him of allegedly protecting the accused BSP MP from Ghosi Atul Rai.Rejecting the bail application, PM Tripathi, additional district judge, observed: “The allegations against the accused are serious and the investigation is still going. In such circumstances, he is not entitled to bail at this stage.” The Lucknow police had lodged an FIR in this connection at the Hazratganj police station. The rape victim had on May 1, 2019 lodged an FIR at the Lanka police station, Varanasi, against Atul Rai. Later, several cases were lodged against the rape victim in retaliation. The rape victim had also sent an application to SSP, Varanasi, on November 20, 2020, alleging that Amitabh Thakur was creating false evidence in the case to save Atul Rai. The victim and her male friend had conducted a Facebook live session before the Supreme Court, New Delhi, on August 16. In this session, she had accused Amitabh Thakur and others of helping Atul Rai. Thereafter, both of them immolated themselves. They were rushed to RML hospital. The woman’s male friend died on August 21 while she succumbed to burn injuries on August 24.The Facebook live was considered as the victim’s dying declaration. Amit Thakur was given compulsory retirement by the Union home ministry on March 23 this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bail-plea-of-ex-ips-officer-amitabh-thakur-rejected-101634235051862.html
14-10-2021||Mumbai||Active Covid cases in Maharashtra dip below 30,000; minor students can take trains||In an indication of decline in the Covid-19 cases, the active infections in Maharashtra have now dipped to below 30,000. As schools and colleges reopened in the state, the government on Thursday allowed children to travel on trains. The notification is significant as the state had permitted only fully-vaccinated commuters to travel by trains and so far, vaccination is allowed only for those above 18 years of age.The state on Thursday recorded 29,560 active cases. The active cases started to decline below the 30,000-mark from Wednesday, when 29,555 active cases were recorded, as compared to 30,525 active infections registered on Tuesday. State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said the decline in the active cases indicated a drop in Covid-19 cases. “The reduction in active cases indicates that we have been able to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. We have been able to bring down the numbers due ramping of tests, quick isolation of patients as well as timely medication,” said Dr Awate.Currently the state has 29,560 active patients, of which Pune tops the list with 8,296 active infections, followed by Mumbai (6,212), Thane (3,744), Ahmednagar (3,148) and Satara (1,424).Pune has been leading in the number of active cases, followed by Thane, for months together. The third position has been alternated by Mumbai, Ahmednagar or Satara. However, in recent days, owing to a surge in the cases, Mumbai has now overtaken Thane and has the second-highest number of active cases.The number of active cases in the peak season had reached 600,000 this year.Dr Wiqar Shaikh, professor of medicine, Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Hospital, said “We are seeing the thick tail of the second wave which was prolonged for a very long time. The history of the pandemic shows that we will be getting multiple waves but the severity will all depend on the behaviour of the citizens as well as the government.” “While citizens have to adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour, the government has to ramp up all the medical infrastructure in anticipation of the future waves,” said Dr Shaikh.On Thursday, Maharashtra recorded 2,384 Covid-19 new cases and 35 deaths. Mumbai recorded 558 cases and five deaths.The total number of Covid-19 patients since the outbreak in March last year has now reached 6,586,280.The state conducted 136,952 tests on Thursday and clocked 2,343 recoveries.The toll reached 139,705, with Pune recording the highest fatalities – 19,529 – followed by Mumbai (16,172) and Thane (11,398).Meanwhile, the state government relaxed some more restrictions on Thursday. Till now, the government regulations for closed halls only allowed for 50% of the seating capacity or maximum 200 attendees, whichever more. The new notification has removed the 200-limit and has allowed 50% of attendees of capacity in closed halls. This will be beneficial for bigger establishments as they will get to accommodate more people which was not possible owing to the 200-people cap. The rule will be applicable for public/private, ticketed or any event. The government, however, has made it mandatory for all organisers, attendees as well as the staff to be fully vaccinated. They have also decided to fine the organisers as well as facility managers ₹50,000 for any violation of rules.The state has also relaxed rules for railway travel as currently only those who have taken both the doses of vaccine 14 days before their travel are allowed. With schools and colleges reopening, students below 18 years have also been permitted to travel on train. In addition, even those who are not allowed to take a vaccine due to their medical condition, will be allowed, provided they have a certificate on their condition from a recognised doctor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/active-covid-cases-in-maharashtra-dip-below-30-000-minor-students-can-take-trains-101634234992327.html
14-10-2021||Mumbai||79 civic schools in Mumbai yet to start teaching sessions on campus for classes 8-10||Ten days after schools in Mumbai reopened for students from classes 8 to 12, 79 civic schools are yet to commence teaching sessions on the school premises, data from Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has revealed. Out of a total of 867 municipal schools in Mumbai for classes 8 to 10, 788 have reopened their campuses for students. The remaining schools have not been able to do so either because they house a vaccination or Covid-19 quarantine centre on their premises, or because the major structural repairs to municipal school buildings that the administration undertook during the lockdown months have still not been completed.Out of the total 71,783 students enrolled in classes 8, 9 and 10 in the 867 municipal schools, 24,023 students attended classes on the school premises on Thursday, while others opted for online classes, data has shown. A senior civic official from BMC’s education department said, “The attendance of students varies. Some students attend schools a few days a week and chose to attend lectures online on other days. We have also given schools the option of conducting lectures on alternate days for different classes. So only class 9 and 10 students may attend on one day, while class 8 students go to school on another, to ensure social distancing.”Assistant commissioners of the respective wards with jurisdiction over schools where Covid-19 quarantine or vaccination centres are operational have been looking for alternate feasible locations to shift the centres, so that schools can restart. A deputy municipal commissioner said, “In my zone, we have a large number of slums where schools had vaccination centres on their premises. It is not easy to find alternate locations within the slums. In such cases, we have located open spaces, and are putting up temporary structures there to shift these centres.”While schools which had vaccination or quarantine centres within their premises may be able to restart lectures by early next week, others – where building maintenance and repair work are ongoing – may take longer to reopen. The official from the education department, quoted above, said, “We have to think of the safety of students first. We have shortlisted some buildings where lectures can start in adjoining classrooms, while repair work goes on in a neighbouring wing, or alternate floor. But some other schools may remain closed for the rest of the month until the repair work is over.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/79-civic-schools-in-mumbai-yet-to-start-teaching-sessions-on-campus-for-classes-810-101634234932030.html
14-10-2021||Mumbai||What do medical experts from Mumbai say on ‘long-Covid’ definition given by WHO?||The World Health Organization (WHO) last week defined ‘post-Covid’ or what is commonly known as ‘long-Covid’, a term used for Covid-19 patients who suffer from prolonged after-effects of the infection. The health agency used Delphi methodology – a structured exercise to arrive at a group opinion or decision by surveying a panel of experts. Five groups of stakeholders, including patients, patient-researchers, external experts, WHO staff and others were involved in formulating the definition. What does the definition state? The WHO definition of long-Covid states: “Post-Covid-19 condition occurs in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19) infection, usually three months from the onset of Covid-19 with symptoms and that last for at least two months and can’t be explained by an alternative diagnosis. Common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, cognitive dysfunction but also others and generally have an impact on everyday functioning. Symptoms may be new: onset following initial recovery from an acute Covid-19 episode or persist from the initial illness. Symptoms may also fluctuate or relapse over time.” It has also clarified that a separate definition may be applicable for children. Was such categorisation important? The absence of both a single terminology and a clinical case definition have been repeatedly signalled as drawbacks to advance on research and management of these patients, according to WHO. Experts say categorisation is also important for patients to accept their condition. “When there is a certain categorisation, patients learn to group themselves and come forward to seek help,” said Dr Nitin Karnik, head of medicine at the civic-run Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital in Sion. “In the absence of categorisation, patients often get lost in follow-ups. Starting of post-Covid out-patient departments (OPDs) has, therefore, been a crucial step taken by most hospitals, where patients with lingering issues can seek help,” he said. Critical care specialist Dr Kedar Toraskar from Wockhardt Hospital said that the definition is helpful, but doctors should not haphazardly label symptoms as post-Covid. “Patients may have health issues due to some underlying conditions that may not be Covid-related. Thus, a thorough diagnosis is a must before labelling the symptoms as post-Covid,” he said. Commonly, effects lingering on for more than eight weeks were identified as post-Covid by doctors. Some patients, who suffered from the after effect beyond three to six months, were identified as long-haulers. What is the estimated number of long-Covid? Estimates on long-Covid vary a lot. About 5% of Covid-19 patients suffer from the severe form of infection requiring a longer hospital stay, oxygen support and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. Patients who have moderate to severe forms of infection are more likely to have residual health issues say doctors. However, some patients with mild Covid-19 have long term lingering after-effects too. “Conservatively, I would say about 10 % patients have long-Covid, requiring follow-ups for physical and mental rehabilitation,” said Dr Toraskar, who is also a member of the Covid-19 task force of Maharashtra. While fatigue, myalgia (muscle pain), hair loss, body ache, poor appetite, muscle wastage are some of the common long-term impacts, patients also have frequent episodes of low-grade fever and effort intolerance wherein minutest efforts to walk from one room to another are not tolerated by the body. “When patients suddenly find themselves struggling to do their daily chores, they panic,” said Dr Karnik. “They need a lot of reassurance that their body will recover gradually with good diet and physiotherapy. The worst impacted are families where all members got Covid-19 and all the adults developed long-Covid. In such cases, we have seen patients struggling as there are no caregivers,” he said. Dr Karnik estimates that nearly 30% of patients suffer from long-Covid. “The long-term sequelae clear out in most patients gradually,” he said. A study published in the medical journal JAMA Network Open on Wednesday has estimated that more than half of the patients diagnosed with Covid-19 globally will experience post-Covid or long-Covid symptoms, up to six months after recovering. The study was carried out by researchers from the Penn State College of Medicine. The team conducted a systematic review of 57 reports that included data from 250,351 unvaccinated adults and children who were diagnosed with Covid-19 from December 2019 through March this year. The researchers identified many long-term health issues involving general well-being, mobility, neurological conditions, mental health disorders, lung abnormalities, cardiovascular issues, skin conditions and digestive issues among the survivors. “Our results indicate that clinical management of persistent post-acute sequelae of Covid-19 (PASC) will require a whole-patient perspective, including management tools like virtual rehabilitation platforms and chronic care for post-acute Covid-19 symptoms in conjunction with the management of pre-existing or new comorbidities,” the researchers stated in the study, further recommending one-stop multidisciplinary clinics to avoid multiple referrals to different specialists and encourage comprehensive care.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/what-do-medical-experts-from-mumbai-say-on-long-covid-definition-given-by-who-101634234872062.html
14-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body cancels vaccination drive at public centres for Friday||There will be no vaccination drive at public vaccination centres in Mumbai on Friday, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said in a statement on Thursday. However, the civic body said that the drive has not been cancelled owing to shortage of vaccines and that it has sufficient vaccine stock. A senior civic official said, “We have halted the vaccination drive at public vaccination centres only for one day on Friday. This is not because of shortage of vaccine doses. The drive will continue on Saturday.”The festival of Dussehra will be celebrated on Friday.The drive will resume in the city on Saturday. There are over 300 BMC vaccine centres in Mumbai, and 20 state or Central government-operated vaccination centres. There are 145 private vaccination centres.Until Thursday, out of the target population of 9,236,500 citizens, 8,578,685 (92%) had received their first dose, while 4,780,983 citizens (51%) were fully vaccinated.On Thursday, a total of 46,540 beneficiaries were vaccinated in the city across 309 municipal vaccination centres, 20 state centres and 145 private vaccination facilities, operating a total of 509 vaccination sessions of one hour each.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-cancels-vaccination-drive-at-public-centres-for-friday-101634234811958.html
14-10-2021||Lucknow||Apna Dal (S) gives political twist to deputy speaker’s election||The BJP government may have made up its mind to get Nitin Agarwal elected as the deputy speaker of the legislative assembly, its alliance partner Apna Dal (S), however, appears to have thrown a spanner in the party’s works giving a political twist to the exercise demanding that the deputy speaker should be elected from among the MLAs of Dalit or OBC community in Uttar Pradesh.“No Dalit or OBC member occupies the post of speaker of legislative assembly or chairman of legislative council in the state. Under such circumstances, a member of Dalit or OBC community should be elected as the deputy speaker. This will be a good message from the government,” said Ashish Patel, an MLC and Apna Dal (S) national working president.“We have raised our demand to the government on the issue. The government has numbers and will take a call on the issue,” said Patel, who is also the husband of Union minister of state Anupriya Patel.UP minister for finance and parliamentary affairs Suresh Khanna, while speaking to Hindustan Times here on Wednesday, confirmed that Nitin Agarwal will be his party’s choice for the post of deputy speaker of UP assembly.A Samajwadi Party MLA, Nitin Agarwal along with his father former MP Naresh Agarwal had joined the BJP in 2018. The Samajwadi Party’s petition seeking Nitin Agarwal’s disqualification was recently rejected. A divided opposition has also not worked out any joint strategy to counter the BJP’s decision for election to the post. The Samajwadi Party apparently is not happy with the BJP government’s move and may consider fielding party MLA Narendra Verma for the post.When contacted, Verma said he was not aware of any such move. Samajwadi Party spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary said SP national president Akhilesh Yadav would take a call on the issue. BSP legislature party leader Shah Alam alias Guddu Jamali said he would seek directives from BSP chief Mayawati on the issue. Congress Legislative Party leader Aradhna Mishra ‘Mona’ has already said her party would take a call once the assembly’s agenda was finalised.Meanwhile, a meeting of the business advisory committee has been convened on October 17 (Sunday) to decide the state assembly’s agenda. State assembly speaker Hriday Narayan Dikshit has already fixed October 18 (Monday) as the date of election of deputy speaker’s post. The nomination papers may be deposited in the office of principal secretary, state assembly, Pradeep Dubey on October 17.Nitin Agarwal, if elected as the deputy speaker in the legislative assembly of Uttar Pradesh, may not have the shortest ever term. The seventeenth assembly was constituted on March 14, 2017 and end of its term would mark end of term of the deputy speaker.A list of 17 deputy speakers posted on the state assembly’s website shows that deputy speakers have worked for less than four months to less than 10 months in the past. While Waqar Ahmad Shah held the deputy speaker’s post from November 14, 2003 to July 26, 2004 while Ammar Rizvi was in office from September 28, 2001 to January 20, 2002.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/apna-dal-s-gives-political-twist-to-deputy-speaker-s-election-101634234391612.html
14-10-2021||Delhi||Finding hostel room will prove a challenge for new DU students||With admissions to Delhi University colleges currently underway, finding a place in the college hostels is likely to become more difficult and financially challenging as several colleges are considering converting their rooms into single occupancy in order to adhere with Covid-19 protocols.Currently, the university is only holding in-person practical classes for final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students, with no clarity on when or how classes will begin for first-year undergraduate and postgraduate students once the admissions are over next month.Of the around 280,000 applicants to DU this year, only 40% aspirants (115,000) are from Delhi-NCR areas and the remaining are from across India. Of the 20 DU colleges offering hostel facilities (till 2019), six offer both male and female hostels, while 12 colleges offer only female hostels and the rest offer only male hostels. Apart from these, the university also has a hostel for undergraduate students on the north campus.While the university hasn’t provided any data on the number of seats available in these hostels in the past two admission cycles due to the pandemic, in 2019, a total of 3,752 seats were available in these hostels – far fewer than the number of outstation students (146,955) that year.This year, several colleges with hostels for its undergraduate students such as Hansraj College, Kirori Mal College, Indraprastha College, Lady Shri Ram College, and Miranda House said there have been deliberations on converting hostel rooms to single occupancy which would reduce the capacity of hostels. However, a final call will be taken once they receive guidelines for reopening from the university, the officials said.Vibha Chauhan, principal of Kirori Mal College, which has nearly 200 seats in its male hostel, said this will be reduced when rooms are converted to single occupancy to ensure safety of students. “Since hostel admissions happen on merit, we will wait for the admission cycle to be over [to initiate the process]. However, since the double occupancy rooms have to be converted to single occupancy to ensure physical distancing, the capacity will be halved. Some of our rooms are still locked as many third-year students still have their luggage there,” she said.Colleges such as Kirori Mal and Miranda House have had a handful of students on their campus, including foreign students, who couldn’t go back home owing to various reasons, including travel restrictions.Babli Moitra Saraf, principal of Indraprastha College for Women, which accommodated around 450 students in its hostels before Covid, can now accommodate only 225 – of which half are already enrolled students further reducing the intake of the first-year batch.“We are facing a dilemma because it is inherently discriminatory to open to only Delhi-based students when we have a large group of outstation students. With the Covid protocol reducing intake by half in our case, there are significant financial implications for hostel aspirants as well as for the college. Colleges have to organise housekeeping, catering and all other services regularly. We also have to have mechanisms to ensure protocols are observed with regards to Covid-appropriate behaviour, contact tracing, and other safety protocols,” she said, adding that parents too were being cautious and the college wasn’t receiving many queries about hostel facilities.Registrar Vikas Gupta said while the university administration had advised colleges that outstation final-year students returning to hostels after September 15 could be allowed to stay in single occupancy rooms, the decision pertaining to other students will be taken later.“Once outstation students have isolated themselves for a week in the hostel, they could stay with other students while reducing physical interactions; colleges may take a call on that. Authorities will take the final decision [on room occupancy] once more students start coming in. Factors such as the prevailing Covid situation, vaccination status, and a negative Covid test report will also be taken into account,” he said. Many applicants, especially female students, often rely on college hostel facilities during admissions due to their affordability and safety. Assam’s Jorhat district resident Namrata Kalita, 18, who will be studying political science at Indraprastha College for Women, said college hostels are “safest” for women.“I need a hostel admission because it is better than rented accommodations where we have to manage food, cleaning, and other chores. For a young woman moving out of her home to Delhi for the first time, safety and security are of paramount concern. College hostels are always safest. Getting a hostel seat has always been difficult and with Covid, it becomes more important for colleges to devise ways to help outstation students,” she said.Manoj Khanna, principal of Ramjas College, said they are waiting for university guidelines on the matter. “We can only plan [how to reopen hostels] once we receive guidelines from the university on which students will be called to campus and then calculate the number of seats available for each year-wise batch. While single occupancy rooms are safer, it will halve the strength. We also have to plan how other facilities, such as mess, will work. If the mess is overcrowded, there will be a safety risk. We have to decide if we can have a schedule for meals or arrange room service,” he said.Vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh told Hindustan Times that the university will reopen gradually due to the concerns over a third wave of Covid. “The previous two waves have been during March. So we have to be careful before taking any decision as our priority is the health and safety of students. A decision will be taken only after considering all aspects,” he said.Several candidates who have taken admission in undergraduate courses have expressed concerns over finding accommodation in the capital. This is the second admission cycle wherein college and university hostels will remain out of bounds to new students.Bengaluru resident Tisha Mondal, who has taken admission in BCom (Honours) in Kamala Nehru College under the second cutoff, said she plans to stay at a rented accommodation. “For outstation students, it has always been difficult to verify the safety of rented accommodations or the facilities being offered by landlords. Parents would need to personally check these when they come for admission. Covid has disrupted that. Since there is an impending risk of a third wave, I will be opting for online classes till at least the year-end even if colleges reopen. We are hoping that the university will allow blended mode of learning,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/finding-hostel-room-will-prove-a-challenge-for-new-du-students-101634234152842.html
14-10-2021||Lucknow||Time for eco-friendly idol immersion after Durga Puja||LUCKNOW The immersion of idols to mark the end of Durga Puja festivities will be carried out in a traditional, but eco-friendly way this year too. The Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) has set up mega ponds on the banks of river Gomti to facilitate green immersions and Durga Puja samitis have also given their thumbs-up to the arrangements, assuring full cooperation for the cause. Piyush Mordia, joint commissioner of police (law and order) said the committees have been allowed to carry out idol immersion in an eco-friendly way at the existing points on the banks of river Gomti. “We have established mega ponds at several places, including Jhulelal Vatika, Lakshman Mela ground, Kudiya Ghat and other points on the banks of Gomti,” said Ajay Kumar Diwedi, municipal commissioner, who is taking care of the arrangements for idol immersion on the riverbank. LMC officials said these mega ponds roughly measure around 30 x 18 ft, 20 x 15 ft, 50 x 20 ft and 30 x 20 ft that are enough to meet out the requirements of devotees. This is the third consecutive year when artificial ponds have been established for idol immersion instead of allowing immersion into the river. Durga Puja samitis have assured they will follow government guidelines and also ensure Covid protocols are strictly followed during the immersion ceremony. “We will ensure that the immersion is carried out in an eco-friendly manner and Covid protocols are followed strictly. But, the government is yet to inform us how many people will be allowed in the immersion ceremony. Last year, only five people were allowed,” said Sushanto Ghosh, secretary, Bondhu Mahal. Other Durga Puja committees have also assured to carry out the idol immersion in an eco-friendly manner. Of the others, two samitis would be carrying out idol immersion at their respective places. “We have decided to carry out idol immersion ceremony on our own premises at Shivaji Marg. This is perhaps the second consecutive year when we will be carrying out the immersion on our premises. We have made elaborate arrangements to ensure that social distancing and other Covid protocols are followed strictly,” said Arun Kumar Banerjee, president, Bengali Club, which is more than 100 years old. Similar arrangements have been made by the Ramakrishna Math where idol immersion ceremony would be held at their own pond on the outskirts of Lucknow. “In view of the government restriction regarding idol immersion into the Gomti, the math has decided to organize immersion ceremony on our private pond.

They are offered delicacies and given gifts. Yogi, who is also the chief priest of the Gorakhnath temple, washed the feet of the girls, performed “Aarti” and offered them delicacies along with the gifts amid the chanting of mantras. Later speaking to media persons, the CM stressed on the need of inculcating the same feeling of faith and devotion for sisters and daughters as people have for Goddess Durga. “If we all have a feeling of sanctity and see them (girls and women) as manifestations of goddess, many frequent incidents happening against sisters and daughters can be curbed,” he said in apparent reference to crime against women.The CM further said people will have to jointly work for the cause of women education, their health and self-dependence. Yogi, who will lead a customary grand victory procession on the occasion of Dussehra (Vijay Dashami) from Gorakhnath temple on Friday, also praised PM Narendra Modi for launching “Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao” flagship scheme which paved the way for women empowerment by promoting education among women and protected the future of girl child by curbing practice of abortion.Moreover, Yogi said several schemes of the state government, including Kanya Sumangala Yojana, were working for women empowerment in Uttar Pradesh. He said under the “Mukhya Mantri Samuhik Vivah Yojana”, the state government had so far solemnised marriage of over 1.75 lakh poor women.Later, the chief minister extended Dussehra greetings to people saying the festival reminded us of the victory of Lord Rama over demon king Ravana and thus inspired us to walk on the path of truth and justice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/feeling-of-faith-sanctity-can-curb-crime-against-women-yogi-101634233911829.html

The authority has divided the city into eight zones for all the stakeholders to better implement the rules, and appointed a nodal officer who will seek reports from all zonal heads on a daily basis and inform top officials to take timely action against the violators.Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer of Greater Noida authority, has directed all zonal officials to act immediately if they come across any violation of rules. The authority has also released numbers: 01202336046, 47, 48 and 49 where people can call and inform about violations of rules. Apart from this, the authority has also released WhatsApp number: 8800882124 where people can send pictures of unattended construction material or waste anywhere in the city.“A resident can call at these phone numbers to file a complaint about violations of construction guidelines or a complaint about dumping waste at undesignated sites. Similarly, zonal officials concerned will address the WhatsApp complaints. If the zonal officials do not act on these, the nodal officer will take action,” said AK Arora, general manager of Greater Noida authority.Greater Noida is spread over around 38,000 hectares comprising 124 villages. Nearly 600 construction sites of developers and other individual construction projects are located at different areas of the city. According to the ministry of environment, forest and climate change, guidelines on construction material should not be left uncovered, sand should not be ferried without covering it with sheet, construction site should be covered with green sheet, and green belt should be developed around large size construction sites to make sure that dust is not mixed with the air, causing pollution.“We have directed all developers having construction sites of area more than 20,000-square-metre to have anti-smog guns to reduce the air pollution levels. If the developers fail to do so, action will be taken against them,” said Bhooshan.Under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) to tackle air pollution in Delhi-NCR from October 15, authorities will annually ban diesel-run electricity generators, specific instructions for washing of roads, and increased patrolling of known hotspots among other measures. Grap is a set of curbs triggered in phases as the air quality deteriorates, which is typical during October-November. Farm fires in neighbouring states and cooling weather typically combine at this time of the year to blanket the region in smoke.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-authority-sets-up-control-room-to-mitigate-air-pollution-in-city-101634232952302.html
14-10-2021||Pune||Autorickshaw fares to increase in Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad from November 8||Rising CNG and fuel prices have a ripple effect: the minimum fare for Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad’s autorickshaws will be ₹20 instead of ₹18 for the first 1.5 km and thereafter ₹13 for every kilometre, according to the revised rates approved by the Regional Transport Authority (RTA) of Pune division. The revised fares for three-seater autorickshaws will come into effect from November 8 onwards in Baramati as well besides Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, according to RTA. The decision by RTA was taken on the recommendations given by the Khatua committee report as auto unions were also demanding fare hike following the rise of ₹4 per kg of CNG in the past few days, including the latest hike of ₹2 per kg on Thursday. The existing autorickshaw fares are ₹18 for first 1.5 km and ₹12 for every kilometre thereafter. A review meeting of the Pune RTA was held at Pune district collector office on October 12, in which discussions over the recommendations given by the Khatua committee report were made. As per the information given by the Pune Regional Transport Office (RTO), staring November 8, in Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Baramati jurisdictions, the revised rates of 25 per cent additional charges will be applicable for fares between midnight and 5am. Apart from these three jurisdictions, additional 40 per cent charges will be applicable during night hours for the rest of the district. “While for the passengers traveling along with luggage will have to pay ₹3 per luggage bag of 60 by 40 centimetre. At the same time, auto drivers have been given additional period between November 8 and December 31, 2021 for meter calibration for the revised auto fares. And most importantly, only those auto drivers will be allowed to take the revised fares from the passengers who will have their meter calibrated for revised fares,” said Pune regional transport officer and RTA member secretary Ajit Shinde. According to Shinde, if the auto drivers do not make the necessary changes in the fare meter even after the deadline, action such as suspension of license or fine will be charged. Autorickshaw unions from the city have welcomed the decision of fare hike. Bappu Bhave, president of Pune auto-rickshaw federation said, “It was much needed for auto drivers in Pune district. Due to the pandemic, already we are suffering from financial crisis although the fare hike will somewhat help us to earn more in the coming days. We would look after the meter calibration work of all our union members to be completed in the given deadline.” The residents, however, have expressed disappointment to the fare increase. Atul Namekar, secretary of Sinhgad Road - Warje residents association said, “Already the auto fares are pretty high and compared to it most of the auto drivers deny to come to nearby places, or charge double or triple from new people coming to city. At least the distance of first 1.5 km for ₹20 should not have been increased by the RTO.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/autorickshaw-fares-to-increase-in-pune-pimpri-chinchwad-from-november-8-101634232951061.html

Raut made the bombastic claim on his visit to Pimpri-Chinchwad on Wednesday. Speaking to Sena workers in the industrial twin townships, Raut said, “As municipal elections are scheduled, the next mayor of Pune, and of Pimpri- Chinchwad, will be from the Shiv Sena.” The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), currently in power in the Pune municipal corporation (PMC) were quick to remind the Shiv Sena about its numbers in the civic body. Current mayor Muralidhar Mohol said, “The Shiv Sena has 10 elected members in the 165-member Pune municipal corporation. To become mayor, any political party will require the magic number of 85. There is nothing wrong with big ambition, but there is a need to check the ground reality. Shiv Sena must introspect whether achieving the number of 85 in Pune is in their capacity?” With the civic elections early next year, the confrontations between the two parties is only likely to escalate. Recent agitations have seen workers of each party stage protests in front of the other party offices, in particular a first for the BJP in Pune when it comes to taking on the Sena.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sanjay-raut-targets-next-pune-mayor-from-shiv-sena-bjp-says-numbers-don-t-add-up-101634232110844.html

The rate for the allotment would be decided later, an official said.Khattar also directed DTCP and the panchayat department to complete all the necessary works and to expedite the work on the issues related to farmers, concerning this project.A spokesperson for the state government said that Khattar also met a delegation of farmers from Majra village and gave in-principle approval for their main demand, seeking ₹40 lakh per acre and development of commercial complex along with AIIMS.Rewari deputy commissioner Yashendra Singh said that the registration process for setting up a cooperative society of farmers, whose land is being acquired, has been started in the village and as per the directions of the government, an official from the registrar of cooperative society has been assigned. “The members of the society will decide the other works related to their second demand with mutual consent,” he said.Gurugram member of Parliament Rao Inderjit Singh, who attended the meeting, said, “AIIMS in Rewari will give a boost to the health infrastructure and help people of entire south Haryana,” he said.State cooperative minister Banwari Lal and other senior officials also attended the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/expedite-land-acquisition-for-aiims-in-rewari-manohar-lal-khattar-to-agencies-101634231634727.html
14-10-2021||Gurugram||Police to crack down on modified vehicles, curb road races||The traffic police will launch a drive to crack down on modified vehicles from next week as part of a safety measure to reduce accidents and fatalities on city roads, officials said on Thursday.According to the police, teams will keep a check at identified speeding spots as part of the drive, as the modifications, generally made to facilitate higher speeds, are undertaken by motorists for road races.“We have observed that the engine, body parts and exteriors of a large number of vehicles in the city are, at times, completely modified. Often, such vehicles are found to be speeding. We will be stopping such vehicles to check their registration papers for model type and accordingly, issue fines against violators,” Ravinder Singh Tomar, the deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Gurugram police, said.According to the traffic police, around 900 such modified vehicles were found to be plying across the city last year and so far this year, they have found around 110 such vehicles.“We are in the process of constituting teams to check for motorcycle and car racing on Gurugram roads during the weekend. We have observed that on stretches such as Golf Course Road and parts of the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, vehicles race one other, especially, on the weekends. We will be keeping a close check on these stretches,” a senior traffic police official said.Tomar said that the decision to concentrate on modified vehicles is part of the traffic police’s long-term measure to reduce accidents and road fatalities across the city.According to the Gurugram traffic police officials, there were 236 road fatalities recorded from January 1 to August 31 this year. For the same period last year, 227 road fatalities were recorded.Tomar said that since mid-August, traffic police have started extensively using around 250 red-light violation detection (RLVD) cameras at various signals across the city to keep a check on traffic violations to bring down the number of accidents.“We have started extensively using RLVD cameras since mid-August to keep a round-the-clock surveillance on traffic violations across 30 major points in the city. As soon as a commuter commits a violation, an e-challan is generated. Commuters have started becoming wary at these points, which, in return, have started reducing accidents,” Tomar said.According to Tomar, Gurugram traffic police used to issue around 100 fines per day but since the installation of RLVD cameras, the number has increased to around 1,000 per day.Fines for signal jumping, seat-belt violation and incorrect registration plates are issued through such cameras, he said. “The issue with enforcement is that it cannot have long-term success unless it remains continuous. For road fatalities and accidents to come down, engineering changes are the only main solution. Traffic police should divert most of its resources towards this, while simultaneously, continuing with its enforcement measures,” Sarika Panda Bhatt, road safety expert, Nagarro, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/police-to-crack-down-on-modified-vehicles-curb-road-races-101634231633558.html

The weapon of offence will also be recovered. Preliminary investigation has revealed that there was a tussle between the two over a girl student, which led to the crime.”He said that the role of three others is being verified and they would also be arrested based on subsequent investigation and ascertaining their roles in the crime.The suspect, 21-year old Punkit Kumar alias Lucky, is a law student in the university. He is alleged to have shot 24-year-old Vineet Kumar, a fourth-year student of BAMS (bachelor of ayurvedic medicine and surgery) course in the same university, in the abdomen in an argument, following which Kumar died at SGT Hospital.Three associates of Lucky, identified as Nitesh, Rahul and Himani, all students of the same university, were also booked for murder in a case registered at the Rajendra Park police station.A senior police official said that Lucky has had a brush with the law as a juvenile, when he was allegedly involved in a murder in Mundka village of Delhi in 2016, in an incident of road rage. A case of murder was registered against him under sections 302 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Arms Act at Mundka police station in Delhi, the police official said. The case is still under processSangwan said that they are still probing whether the crime was planned and if the three associates were involved in it. “The accused was given shelter by his associates and was hiding from the police to evade arrest,” he said.According to details shared by the police, Vineet Kumar was allegedly shot in the abdomen by Lucky, while Nitesh held him from behind on the campus of SGT University on October 8.Kumar, who was along with his friends at the time of the shooting, was taken to the SGT Hospital but he succumbed to his injuries.

Each team has specific instructions and they will be submitting daily reports and weekly reports on all measures executed for further perusal,” Gill said.Grap was drafted by the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority (Epca) and enforced on October 15 every year since 2017, amid the stubble burning season across the National Capital Region (NCR).Officials of the Gurugram agencies said that even as pre-emptive Grap measures were under consideration for implementation, they will enforce all measures listed by the CPCB on Tuesday.“Grap is already there and to implement the same, a subcommittee has already been formed. However, whether any modified Grap unlike what used to be in earlier years will be there, is still under consideration,” a senior official of the ministry of environment, forests and climate change, who did not want to be named, said.Kuldeep Singh, regional officer of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), said, “All Grap measures as listed by the CPCB [Central Pollution Control Board] in its meeting on Tuesday will be implemented in the city from Friday onwards. Besides this, the CBCP had also asked brick kilns to be closed in the city. However, this latest direction will have little impact in Gurugram district.”In a meeting chaired by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) with the government agencies in Delhi-NCR on Tuesday, the pollution monitoring body recommended Grap measures listed under the poor category and some measures under the very poor category should kick in pre-emptively from October 15.A CAQM member, requesting anonymity, said, “We are considering if it’s (pre-emptive Grap measures) feasible and we do want to take strong action.”“All conventional Grap measures will be followed as per norms, unless directions are issued otherwise,” Gill said.According to MCG officials, measures such as extensive use of mechanised road sweeping and sprinkling of water have already been initiated since Monday. “Since we already had the necessary machinery for sprinkling water and road sweeping, it was decided to initiate it as soon as the air quality started deteriorating,” an MCG official privy to the matter said.From Friday, the MCG will take action against hotels and eateries found burning coal and wood, besides curbing open waste burning.Gill said officials will have the responsibility of identifying pollution hotspots, carrying out night patrolling to check Grap enforcement, ensure scientific disposal of construction and demolition (C&D) waste, identify stretches with high dust accumulation, and ensure environmental rules are followed by MCG contractors in the construction of roads, stormwater drains and sewerage line projects.Officials of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) said that their role in controlling pollution will start next week. “Tenders have been issued for procurement of water sprinkling machines as well as for hiring outsourced staff to initiate Grap measures in the city. We are expecting to start on-ground operations from next week,” a senior official with the GMDA’s environment wing, requesting anonymity, said.The GMDA official said that 71 wind augmentation purifying units (Wayu), which were installed last year, will be individually assessed to check if they are operating properly and 48 more machines will be added.Wayu machines are primarily located at pollution hotspots that witness heavy traffic congestion. The machine filters primary pollutants, such as particulate matter (PM 2.5 and PM 10), and convert them into carbon dioxide, or carbon monoxide.GMDA officials said that these machines can help reduce PM 2.5 levels by around 35% and PM 10 by around 65% in a 500 square-metre zone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/grap-to-be-enforced-in-gurugram-to-check-pollution-air-quality-101634231630727.html

14-10-2021||Noida||With ‘zero waste wards’, Ghaziabad plans further reduction in solid waste output||In order to reduce the generation of daily solid waste, the Ghaziabad municipal corporation will soon be initiating the concept of ‘zero waste wards’ which will include 10 residential wards on a pilot basis. Officials of the corporation said that the generated waste from the wards will be fully processed at a pre-identified location in the ward. “Teams from NGOs will help us segregate the daily waste into dry and wet waste. This activity will be done in a pre-identified area in each of the wards. We are in the process of selecting the 10 residential wards to initiate the pilot project. We expect this concept to likely start in another 7-10 days,” city health officer Mithilesh Kumar said. The corporation is also getting an app developed, which will be able to track the corporation’s door-to-door solid waste collection vehicles as they pass houses, commercial establishments and shops. The move comes after residents complained that the door-to-door collection vehicles do not follow a regular routine and do not pick up waste on daily basis. “The app is being developed and can be downloaded through the Play Store. The door-to-door collection vehicles will be fitted with devices to track their movements once they pass a street or house in different wards. We will be able to check if the daily waste collection activity in each ward has taken place,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner. He added that the corporation will also be starting a capacity-building exercise soon. It will scale up the number of solid waste collection vehicles from 200 to 500. “We will rope in a private agency for the purpose. Most of the vehicles will be e-vehicles or CNG-based vehicles. The pilot project for this will be initiated soon from the Vasundhara zone,” Tanwar added. The corporation has five zones, city zone, Kavi Nagar, Vijay Nagar, Mohan Nagar and Vasundhara, under its jurisdiction and each zone comprises 100 residential wards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/with-zero-waste-wards-ghaziabad-plans-further-reduction-in-solid-waste-output-101634231330919.html

On Thursday, Ghaziabad recorded an AQI reading of 22--in the ‘poor’ category.UPPCB officials said that the decision was taken in a video conference meeting held by the Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas on October 12, adding that the implementation of Grap in the district will include different measures, except for the ban on diesel generator (DG) sets. They added that as part of Grap measures, the Ghaziabad municipal corporation chalked out a comprehensive plan for mechanised road sweeping and water sprinkling, which will be implemented at all the major roads in the city every day.The road stretch network identified for the two activities measures about 526km.“We will also implement other Grap measures listed under the ‘very poor’ air quality category, except for the ban on diesel generator sets. We have also asked development agencies such as the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) and UP Awas Vikas to ensure projects in their jurisdiction comply with construction site norms,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB.In 2016, the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority had conducted meetings with state government representatives and experts, and come up with a plan, Grap, that listed different measures to be taken when air quality deteriorated.Officials said that they initially will focus on dust reduction and prevention of garbage and crop residue burning incidents.“We asked UP Awas Vikas to specifically check vacant plots where unauthorised occupants often burn garbage. We also asked GDA and the corporation to ensure proper lifting of garbage else we will not hesitate to impose penalties. Both UP Awas Vikas and GDA will conduct fortnightly inspections at construction sites and upload their data on the dust control audit portal,” Sharma added.Officials of the corporation confirmed they will start with intensive road sweeping and dust control measures.“The entire plan has been chalked out and we will be working in close coordination with the UPPCB to ensure that air pollution remains low this winter season. The responsibilities given to us as part of the ‘winter action plan’ will also be taken up throughout the season,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner.According to official statistics of the pollution board, Ghaziabad in 2019-20 recorded an annual average PM10 concentration level of 218 micrograms per cubic metre (mpcm), which reduced by 14.5% to 186mpcm in 2020-21.Likewise, the officials said that Ghaziabad recorded an annual average PM2.5 concentration level of 53.04mpcm from April 2021 to September 2021, and an average of 64.20mpcm during the same period in 2020.The standard limit for PM10 and PM2.5 is 100mpcm and 60mpcm, respectively.

Whereas, PM10, particles in the air with a diametre of less than 10 micrometres, was at 76 on Thursday.Dr BS Murthy, director of Safar and scientist at IITM said that as the temperature lowers, there is a chance of rise in pollution.“Overall AQI on Thursday was 76 which is satisfactory. In winter, as the air settles the pollution tends to rise. And hence, we see air quality worsens during winter. As of now, Pune city will have good to satisfactory air quality in the next few days,” said Murthy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/good-to-satisfactory-air-quality-till-october-17-safar-forecast-101634231031116.html

CNG users are the most disappointed with the price hikes as what was once the “affordable fuel” refuge has now begin to walk the fossil-fuel path of regular price hikes.After staying stable for a period of time, thee price of a a kg of CNG first increased on August 2, to hit ₹57.50. On October 4, CNG prices increased again by ₹2 to reach ₹59.50 per kg. Now, effective from Thursday midnight, CNG prices have been further hiked by ₹2.6. According to officials from the Maharashtra Natural Gas Limited (MNGL), the hike in CNG prices is caused by an increase in the prices of natural gas. The incessant hike in petrol and diesel prices is likely to impact transportation rates. Transport associations have asked the central government to fix the same transportation rates for the entire country. “There is a provision in the Motor vehicles act which allows for this. We have sent a proposal to the centre and our apex association has been conducting meetings with officials. Increasing fuel prices has made it difficult for transport business operators to survive,” said Baba Shinde, director, All India Motor Transport Congress (Maharashtra). Rickshaw unions have claimed that the hike in CNG prices impacts profits of rickshaw drivers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/petrol-crosses-110-litre-mark-diesel-at-99-36-litre-and-cng-hiked-by-2-6-kg-in-pune-101634230851295.html

However, the tree may have saved several lives by breaking the bus’s fall.The private chartered bus was ferrying six employees of a Noida company to Ghaziabad. One person was killed and four passengers injured when the driver of the bus hit a two-wheeler and lost control of the vehicle. The bus then careened off the flyover, the police said.“One person died, while four were injured. One of the injured is still on ventilator support. We have lodged an FIR on the basis of a complaint filed by the deceased person’s brother. The driver of the bus also sustained severe injuries and is under treatment,” said Nipun Agarwal, superintendent of police (city).“It seems that the driver lost control of the bus after hitting a two-wheeler. The bus broke through the central verge as well as the crash barriers on the other side of the flyover before falling off the structure. It hit the tree first, which broke its fall to the ground,” he said.The bus fell from a height of about 15-20 feet, witnesses said.Residents of the Daulatpura locality nearby said that had the tree not broken the bus’s fall, there may have been more casualties. “It was around 9.10pm on Wednesday. I was at my shop when I heard a thunder-like sound that lasted for a couple of minutes. Then I saw a bus crash into the pipal tree and fall to the ground. Had the tree not been there, the bus would have hit our shops and nearby houses. This tree was damaged, but it saved a lot of lives,” said Dheeraj Soni, the owner of a jewellery shop near the incident site.He said the tree is estimated to be about 15-20 years old, and has been growing through the retaining wall of the flyover.Sanjay Chaudhary, who owns a medical store, said that the area was crowded at the time of the incident. “We are thankful for the tree that prevented further damage,” he added.“As soon as the bus fell, locals came running and broke the windowpanes of the bus to pull out passengers,” he said.Ghaziabad district magistrate RK Singh has ordered an inquiry into the incident. “The inquiry will be headed by the city magistrate, and will highlight reasons behind the incident as well as suggest measures to prevent such incidents,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-flyover-accident-tree-broke-bus-s-fall-saved-lives-locals-say-101634230130670.html

Holding placards in their hands, the leaders termed the move to change the name a political vendetta.BJP leader Vineet Pal Singh Monga said the Atal Apartments scheme was launched in 2011 and the foundation stone was laid by the then local bodies minister Tikshan Sood. The scheme has been dropped twice by the department in the last 10 years and now it has been relaunched by changing the name.“We are not against naming any place in the name of Sahir Ludhianvi, but the name of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee should not be removed. If LIT Apartments in B block, SBS Nagar, can be named after former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, then why not the apartments in Karnail Singh Nagar be named after Atal Bihari Vajpayee,” said Monga. He said they had also written to deputy commission Varinder Sharma and local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra and they would be forced to start an agitation if the apartments were not named after Vajpayee.Despite attempts, LIT chairman Raman Balasubramaniam could not be reached for comments. However, he had earlier said the name had been changed to pay tribute to legendary poet Sahir Ludhianvi and there was no political vendetta behind the move. He said the Atal Apartments scheme had been dropped and the design of the apartment had also been changed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-bjp-protests-changing-atal-scheme-s-name-101634229350297.html

How can he submit a proposal without following a proper channel? Even the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the ruling party, approved the project within few minutes.”“We are not opposing the project, but there should have been proper discussion and debate, and experts should have been involved,” he said.BJP’s senior leader Ujwal Keskar said, “The Mula-Mutha riverfront development project is a megaproject. Ideally, in such cases, it is expected that there should be consultations with elected members, experts in the field, citizens and media.”“I am surprised how the municipal commissioner brought the proposal at the eleventh hour. If it came on the docket, elected members would get time at least to read and study it. It will even create awareness among the citizens,” he said.Congress leader Arvind Shinde said, “These are the side effects of massive majority in the PMC. BJP got a huge majority, and now they are considering that they know everything. Without any consultation, a project got approved.”Shinde said, “The project will impact the city in the long term. Pune has many experts, and they can give suggestions to improve it. We oppose how the project was bought in at the eleventh hour and approved without proper discussion. Ideally, the municipal administration should send brief to all elected members.”Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “The general body had given nod for the project in 2017 and submitted it to state government when I was standing committee chairman. The state government has given approval for forming Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for it. Now we need to start execution. The proposal came in front of standing for starting work on ground. How many days we should wait?”Pune municipal commissioner was not immediately available for comments.Many elected members within BJP alleged that they were not aware of the project. But only a few leaders are making decisions.Many senior leaders raised questions about the municipal commissioner’s role. Elected members from across parties said that it is understood that the ruling BJP had a clear majority, but why commissioner coming under their pressure. Ideally, for any proposal, the municipal commissioner submits it a few days before. It will then appear in the agenda and the meeting subjects will be announced to all party members and the general public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mulamutha-riverfront-development-project-approved-without-discussion-101634229230331.html

The committed expenditure, meant for wages, pension, the interest of the loans, repayments of the loans will however be released cent per cent of the outlay. “In first two quarters, we had released only 30% of the outlay for development works. It has been increased to 50% by the end of the third quarter due to the improvement in the revenue receipts in the second quarter ended in September. If the receipts improve further, we may take the expenditure to 70 to 75% by the end of the year. We are in a better position this year, as last year the funds of the development works were released only for the inevitable heads like district development funds, expenditure related to public health and schools etc. We had to borrow heavily for committed expenditure and it led to the fiscal deficit of around ₹46,000 crore in 2020-21,” said an official from the health department. The revenue receipts of the state by end of September were merely 35% or ₹1.29 lakh crore against the annual estimates of ₹3.69 lakh crore. All the major sectors including excise, stamp duty and registration, taxes on vehicles and GST have received beating due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “We cannot cut short the expenditure on the committed expenditure on salary, pensions and other establishment cost, interests and repayment of borrowings, which is collectively more than 60% of the revenue receipts of ₹3.69 lakh crore. Result of it, the development works get hampered,” another official said. Meanwhile, the state government also increased the local area development fund for legislators to ₹4 crore a year from the existing ₹3 crore a year. The rise was announced in a budgetary speech by finance and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. This has been the consecutive rise of ₹1 crore each for the past two years as it was rose to ₹3 crore in 2020-21 from ₹2 crore existed since 2011-12. The decision announced on Friday will burden the state exchequer by ₹350 crore more. Around 288 MLAs and 62 MLCs will get ₹1,400 crore in the ongoing financial year. “This is the compliance of his assurance given during the budget session. The rise in the local area development fund will help to boost the development works at the local level,” reads the statement issued by the office of Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/40-cut-to-development-outlay-in-maharashtra-lawmakers-get-whopping-rise-in-local-development-fund-101634227369745.html
14-10-2021||Kolkata||Kolkata’s ‘Burj Khalifa’ pandal sealed, trains cancelled to control crowd||Kolkata Police on Thursday stopped the entry of visitors to the ‘Burj Khalifa’ pandal in Salt Lake, which was drawing thousands of visitors every day, even as the Eastern Railway had to cancel a few trains to prevent pandal hoppers from arriving in the city from adjoining areas. “As the crowd was swelling every day, a decision was jointly taken by the police and the puja committee to stop pandal hoppers from visiting the pandal to avoid any kind of accidents. We have facilities to showcase it virtually. That would continue,” said Sujit Bose, state fire minister. Patronised by Bose, the Sreebhumi Sporting Club puja pandal was built resembling the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai and had become a major crowd puller this year. Earlier on Monday, the laser show of the pandal had to be called off after at least three pilots complained to the air traffic control (ATC) tower at the NSCBI airport that they were having difficulties while landing. The airport is located close to the venue of the popular puja. “Nothing is more important than human lives. A joint decision was taken with the puja committee to ban visitors from going near the pandal. This will continue for the next few days. Only local residents will be allowed,” said a senior officer of Bidhannagar Police. Even though the Calcutta high court had banned the entry of visitors inside pandals and had ordered organisers to put up barricades, thousands of people were gathering outside the barricades of the ‘Burj Khalifa’ pandal and other pandals in the city to have a glimpse of the idols and decorations. The Eastern Railway had to cancel some special trains to stop people from the districts arriving in Kolkata and Salt Lake. The weeklong-Durga Puja is the biggest festival in West Bengal. “Though local trains are not running yet, some special trains were running for railway employees and health workers. But people, mostly pandal hoppers, were boarding them to come to Kolkata. Around 13 pairs of such trains in Sealdah and Howrah division had to be cancelled to check the flow of people. Health experts have warned that a third wave of Covid-19 may hit,” said a senior railway official. In 2020, there was a major spike in the daily count of Covid-19 cases after the festive season. Health experts had blamed it on the movement of people without adhering to safety norms like wearing masks. On Wednesday, the daily count of Covid-19 cases in Kolkata had shot up to more than 200 after a gap of almost four months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/kolkatas-burj-khalifa-pandal-sealed-trains-cancelled-to-control-crowd-101634226109176.html

Three of them were caught by local people and thrashed. One of them died later, people aware of the matter said.One person, Shambhu Choudhary, who sustained injuries when he tried to intervene, was in the initial shooting, has been admitted to a local hospital and is said to be out of danger.According to people who were out on a morning walk, the four suspects drove down to the temple located in the Darbhanga Raj Fort complex, popularly known as Ram Bagh campus, in a blue car, and walked right in.It was 4am, and the priest was inside. Rajiv Kumar Jha spent the night at the temple because the puja for the Navratra festivities had continued well past midnight.Witnesses outside heard multiple gunshots. Rajiv Kumar Jha, the priest said to be in his late forties, was their target, a police officer said.Passers-by and devotees reacted immediately and caught hold of three of them; the fourth escaped.The young man who died in the mob lynching was identified by the police as Pulkit Singh, son of a clerk at the LN Mithila University. The other two are being treated at Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital.Darbhanga senior superintendent of police Babu Ram said a special team has been set up to carry out the probe and track down the fourth man involved in the shooting. “The assailants were not career criminals, contract killers or involved in robberies,” he said.The SSP said the shooting appeared to be linked to an altercation on Wednesday night.Two of the four suspects were sitting by the pond near the temple. “Due to some reason, the two had an altercation with the priest, his family and some others.”The two left the complex but were back six hours later with two more accomplices when they allegedly gunned down the priest.A pistol and six spent cartridges have been seized from the spot.“Instructions have been given to conduct raids at places where anti-social elements gather in the evening”, the SSP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/darbhanga-priest-gunned-down-inside-kankali-temple-public-lynch-1-suspect-101634225868991.html
14-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi's pollution control campaign to start on October 18, car fumes top agenda||Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Thursday said 2,500 civil defence volunteers will be deployed under the city government's 'Red Light On, Gadi Off' campaign starting October 18 for curbing vehicular pollution. The drive will be prominently carried out at 100 traffic intersections spread across 13 police districts in the city, he said, adding that a mock drill of the campaign will be conducted on Sunday.Rai said that the decision was taken after a joint meeting with the Delhi Police, civil defence officials, environment department officials and SDMs on Thursday."In the meeting, it was decided that this campaign to check pollution will be carried out on 100 crossings in 13 police districts. At 90 crossings, batches of 10 civil defence volunteers each will be deployed. At the remaining 10 major intersections, batches of 20 civil defence volunteers each will be engaged," Rai said.Major crossings where 20 volunteers each will be deployed include ITO, Bhagwandas crossing on Tilak Marg, Tolstoy crossing on Barakhamba Road, Chandgi Ram Akhara crossing, near Moti Bagh Metro, Peeragarhi Chowk, Prithviraj Road crossing, Rajesh Pilot Marg, Madhuban Chowk, Pitampura metro crossing and Karkari Mor. He said these civil defence volunteers will work as 'Paryavaran Marshals' and also hand out pamphlets carrying information regarding Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's three appeals to the public. To help fight pollution in Delhi, Kejriwal had on Tuesday appealed people to actively participate in 'Red Light On, Gadi Off' campaign and also avoid using their car at least for one day in a week. He had also appealed to Delhiites to report any case of violation of pollution norms on the Green Delhi App. The minister further said that the main aim of this campaign is to cut down on vehicular pollution. He said the campaign will continue for a month till November 18. The civil defence volunteers will be deployed in two shifts of 8 am to 2 pm and 2 pm to 8 pm. He said that Delhi government will do whatever it can to keep the levels of pollution considerably low in the city."As per a PCRA (Petroleum Conservation Research Association) report, switching off engines on red lights can reduce pollution by about 13-20 per cent and can save around ₹2,500 crore annually. Last year this campaign was a success so we appeal the public to make it a success again this year," Rai said. Later in a statement, the government said that by switching off cars at red lights, ₹250 crore can be saved annually.He said that to make this campaign successful, RWAs, market associations, clubs and NGOs are also being reached out so that they can spread awareness about the campaign through their platforms. Rai said that Delhi has to bear two kinds of pollution -- one, that comes from within, and the second, that comes from other states. "Our responsibility is to reduce the pollution that we internally create to keep ourselves healthy. We are in dialogue with other states and the Centre as well, and have appealed to them to reduce stubble burning pollution, but we do not know when they will hear us," Rai said. He said that the government was making all-out efforts and if the people of Delhi work together to implement 'Red Light On, Gadi Off' initiative, then it will be successful in reducing pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-pollution-control-campaign-to-start-on-october-18-car-fumes-top-agenda-101634224045725.html

14-10-2021||Lucknow||CISH helps Rataul mangoes get GI tag||Lucknow : The famous Rataul mango, cultivated in Baghpat district of Uttar Pradesh was awarded the Geographical Indication (GI) certificate by the Geographical Indication Registry, Chennai in a programme held in Varanasi on Tuesday. The mango got its name Rataul from the village where it originated. Popular for its special aroma and taste, the mango is also claimed by Pakistan as its native produce. The claim is contested by Rataul Mango Producers’ Association which had been making efforts to get the Geographical Indicator (GI) tag for the mango variety for over a decade. . Its GI certification process was accelerated by the Central Institute of Subtropical Horticulture (CISH), Lucknow as a facilitator since 2020. Director of CISH Shailendra Rajan said, “A GI tag provides a true identity to a produce that ensures that people of the region from where the produce originated profit from it. The Malihabadi Dussehri mangoes are among the first varieties to get a GI tag.” Counted among the excellent mangoes of north India, Rataul is known to only limited people in western UP despite its origins from the same region. The variety was taken by Pakistan and is grown as Anwar Ratoul and exported to West Asian countries. Although the variety originated in India, its export market had been exploited by the neighbouring country. “CISH submitted applications for registration of Chausa of UP and Gaurjit from eastern up. Registration of these two varieties is also in progress. The registration process for Banarasi Langra is on and in the near future the certificate may be given to these renowned mangoes of India,” said Rajan. The mango varieties from UP are significant in terms of intellectual property rights, as they are grown in Pakistan which exports cargoes to several nations. GI protection can help in the establishment of markets internationally for Indian products because of the country of origin. “With the GI certification, the demand for this mango will increase in foreign countries as well in the domestic market and the farmers who produce it will benefit from it,” said Rajan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/cish-helps-rataul-mangoes-get-gi-tag-101634225568932.html

14-10-2021||Mumbai||Sena chief to sound bugle for civic polls in Dussehra rally||Shiv Sena chief and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is expected to sound the bugle for the Mumbai civic polls at the party’s annual Dussehra rally on Friday. For a second year in a row, the traditional Dussehra rally of the party would be held indoors. The Sena has organised the gathering at Shanmukhananda Hall in Sion, where key party leaders, ministers, key functionaries, Mumbai Mayor, among others, will remain present. For Sena workers, the rally will be broadcast online. With the BMC elections around four months away, the rally will be a platform for Thackeray to launch the party’s campaign for the civic body election. Traditionally in the Dussehra rally, the Sena chief gives directions to the party cadre on its programme for next year. Mumbai, Thane and other key local body polls will be held early next year. Sena insiders said a presentation will also be made, showcasing various developmental work undertaken by the Sena-controlled civic body in Mumbai over the past five years.A party functionary said, “Over the past five years, the BMC has taken up several projects, including civic infrastructure roads and bridges, sanitation, the coastal road project, and started municipal schools with ICSE curriculum, among other things. A detailed presentation of all the various development work carried out by us will be made in the gathering.”Thackeray’s speech on Friday evening will also be the first time where he will address a gathering as the party chief after a gap of few months. He is expected to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the BJP-led central government over the alleged use of central agencies against Sena ministers and key party functionaries.Senior Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that Thackeray will give a befitting reply to political opponents who were engaged in a “campaign” against the Shiv Sena leader in the past few months. “In the last two years, some people did not have any other work and had started a campaign [to defame Shiv Sena]. A befitting reply will be given to this [by Thackeray]... Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray will speak on national politics and about Maharashtra. Besides that, he will also speak about developments in the State,” said Raut, who is also the chief spokesperson of the party. In an apparent attack on the Centre over the rising fuel prices, Raut said that the Dussehra rally will mark the beginning of the end for the government. He said, “We have to burn the Ravana of the rising fuel prices in 2024. We will start this from tomorrow’s ‘Ravana dahana’ (the ritual of burning effigies of demon king Ravana).”Shivaji Park lit upShivaji Park has been completely illuminated with the use of MLC funds of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.

14-10-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena versus BJP in Maharashtra: Pune, Thane and Nashik civic polls will see tough battle||Not just the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Pune, Thane and Nashik local body polls too are likely to see an intense battle between the Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the two parties that have better influence over the state’s urban population compared to the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). The civic polls in these cities are significant in the context of the next assembly elections, as these cities together have 40 Assembly constituencies and cash-rich civic bodies. The NCP and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) are also likely to be key players in these cities. Although retaining power in the Mumbai civic body will be Sena’s top priority, the Uddhav Thackeray-led party is also planning to wrest power in civic bodies of Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Nashik, which are controlled by the BJP. It will also try to ensure it retains power in the Thane civic body. For the BJP, the challenge is to retain power in Pune, Nashik and Pimpri-Chinchwad, especially if the Shiv Sena and NCP join hands to contest polls in these cities. The NCP has a strong presence in Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and sizeable presence in Nashik. Next year, over 190 municipal councils, 11 municipal corporations and over 20 zilla parishads will go to polls, which are being touted as mini-assembly elections. The battle for Pune Pune district has two civic bodies – Pune and its neighbouring city, Pimpri-Chinchwad. In 2017, the BJP won both the civic bodies. For the Sena, the victory in civic polls will be needed to expand its foothold in Pune, where it has no legislators. Over the past few months, senior Sena leaders have been visiting Pune city and holding meetings with party functionaries. In September last week, Sena scion and minister Aaditya Thackeray visited Pimpri and Pune cities. He also chaired a review meeting with Sena’s corporators of Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad civic bodies. Sena leader Sanjay Raut also toured Pune earlier this week and held meetings with office-bearers, indicating the party has Pune on its priority list. This was Raut’s third visit there in the past two months. Sena insiders said senior party leaders will hold talks with NCP leaders and Congress over alliance for local body polls. The Sena has already held meetings with local functionaries to gauge the mood among the cadre on the issue of alliance. In Pune city, the Sena currently has 10 corporators, while the BJP has 99 in the 164-member body. The NCP, meanwhile, is stronger in the city with 42 seats. In the 128-member Pimpri-Chinchwad civic body, the Sena has nine seats, while the NCP and BJP have 36 and 77 seats, respectively. Internal discussions between Sena leaders and local functionaries suggested the Sena is unlikely to go above 15 to 18 seats in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, given its limited presence in assembly constituencies. “We will try [for an alliance] so that there is no division of votes. The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi will try to remain together [for local body polls]. I have said this earlier as well that the next mayor in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad will be ours (Sena’s). Puneiites also wish that the saffron flag of Shiv Sena should fly atop the municipal corporation,” Raut said during his visit to Pune earlier this week. Traditionally, a large chunk of seats from Pune district went to the BJP in Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, when the two parties were in an alliance. The constituencies there have more Brahmin voters than any other cities in the state. With major seats in their side, coupled with caste equations, the BJP was successful in gaining control of the Pune civic body in 2017 from NCP, which held sway in the region. The Sena was not able to expand electorally in Pune despite a good presence at the grassroots. Not just the BJP, it also faced tough competition from the NCP over the years. Currently, the Shiv Sena does not have a single MLA from any of the 21 assembly seats in the Pune district. Thus, gaining control of local bodies, including rural and urban bodies, is crucial for the party, Sena insiders said. “For several years we have been working in Pune. [Sena Supremo] Balasaheb [Thackeray] too spent a lot of time in Pune. But we were never able to have our mayor in Pune, and we regret it. We feel that this time we can fulfil our dream to install a Shiv Sena mayor,” Raut added. In a bid to fulfil this “dream”, the party has carried out organisational changes in September. It appointed two key people in Pune to coordinate with the workers in Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and the party leadership. According to party insiders, Aaditya Thackeray handpicked Sachin Ahir as Sampark Pramukh for Pune district, as well as Aditya Shirodkar, who quit MNS’s student wing to join the Sena in July, as deputy Sampark Pramukh. Meanwhile, the BJP is confident of keeping control of local bodies in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. Jagdish Mulik, a former legislator from Vadegaon Sheri in Pune, and in charge of the BJP unit in Pune said, “Traditionally, the Shiv Sena never had any hold in Pune. People will vote us back to power. Sena has about nine of 10 corporators, which will come down to four or five.” A BJP functionary from Pimpri-Chinchwad, who did not wish to be named said, “The challenge before the BJP here will be the NCP and not Shiv Sena. The NCP has been strong in the region. They (NCP and Shiv Sena) have an advantage of being in power, but we are prepared for the challenge.” Raj Thackeray’s MNS could be a player in Pune and is likely to be part of BJP’s strategy. Nashik Nashik is controlled by the BJP with 66 seats in the 122-member body. The Sena has 35 seats while the NCP and Congress have six seats each and MNS has five seats. Raut, who is in charge of the Nashik district, has visited Nashik and engaged with Sena workers to mobilise them ahead of the crucial civic polls. In Nashik, the tussle between the Sena and NCP was in the open in the last few weeks with Sena MLA Suhas Kande engaging in a war of words with NCP minister and Nashik guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal over the allotment of development funds. Kande, who defeated Bhujbal’s son Pankaj in the 2019 assembly polls in Nandgaon, even moved the court over seeking the removal of the senior NCP leaders as the guardian minister. Bhau Chaudhari, Sena Sampark Pramukh of Nashik district, said the party is focusing on strengthening itself at the organisational level. The MNS was in power in Nashik civic body before it was won by the BJP in 2017 polls. The MNS is hoping to regain the only civic body it had control on but it will fight a crowded battle with the BJP on one side and probably a Shiv Sena-NCP alliance on the other. MNS chief Raj Thackeray has started tours of Pune and Nashik. Thackeray’s son Amit too has been touring the two cities. Raj has held meetings with party brass in Pune and Nashik. MNS held the Nashik municipal corporation in 2012, but it lost to BJP in 2017. The BJP is undecided on alliance with MNS here. Thane In Thane, the Shiv Sena controls the civic body. Like Mumbai, control over Thane civic body is a matter of prestige for the party. The Sena has 67 seats in the 131-member body. The NCP is the second largest with 34 seats, followed by the BJP with 23 seats. The Congress has three seats. A Sena functionary said, “The TMC has traditionally been our bastion and we will regain control of it.” BJP gameplan According to party insiders, the BJP is gearing up for next year’s mini-assembly polls in a major way. Party campaign will be spearheaded by former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. “Fadnavis has a good reputation in these cities due to the infrastructure work undertaken by him during his tenure as chief minister. Besides, Prime Minister Modi has huge following among urban voters which will help us more than the 2017 civic polls,” said a key party leader. The party is putting together massive election machinery and unleash a campaign which will be much bigger than its rivals’. Besides, the party is considering a tacit understanding with MNS to dent Shiv Sena’s numbers, as the voter base is largely the same for the two parties. MVA front a non-starter The MVA allies have not formally decided to forge an alliance in any of the civic or district bodies that are scheduled to go to polls early next year, but the Sena and NCP are considering joining hands in Thane, Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Nashik, according to MVA insiders. Leaders said they would assess the situation and the mood of the functionaries and decide. The recent bypolls to district councils have given a boost to the MVA but they are yet not clear on how they will fight the elections. An alliance between the MVA partners could help them keep control of these important civic bodies, and more importantly, keep BJP out of power. The recent move by the MVA government to reintroduce the multi-member ward in the municipal corporation and municipal council areas will help them force an alliance. In municipal corporation areas, a three-member ward panel has been adopted, which could ease out alliance issues for the Sena, NCP and Congress. In the new system, voters will elect a three-member panel in each of the wards in municipal corporation areas. “It can prove to be helpful to iron out alliance if it is decided on. We can accommodate alliance partners in a 2:1 ratio depending on each party’s strength in that area,” the leader added. NCP state president Jayant Patil said they would try and work out an alliance with MVA partners wherever possible for local body polls. “We will try and come together for the municipal corporation, municipal council elections. I am confident that wherever possible, there we will have an alliance. It may not happen for all [elections] but largely we can try to have,” he said. He added that despite no alliance in the Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samiti bypolls the three parties could keep BJP away from growing. Political analyst Hemant Desai said that the Sena and NCP has the advantage of being in power while going into the civic elections. Desai however dismissed Sena’s claim to install its mayor in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. “It was a childish statement, given the fact it it only has nine or 10 corporators. However, the MVA allies can join hands in Pune district. In Nashik, it will be a contest between BJP and Shiv Sena. The Sena will be able to regain Thane on the back of work done by the civic body and the mass popularity of Eknath Shinde. BJP will, however, get central ministers like Narayan Rane, Kapil Patil to campaign to use PM Modi’s popularity. Overall, the ties between Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar is good so ironing out issues over alliance will not be an issue.”Madhav Bhandari, vice president of Maharashtra BJP, said that the party will retain ground in Pune and Nashik civic bodies. He added that BJP will take control of the Thane municipal corporation as the people of the city are tired of the corruption and hooliganism of Shiv Sena. “Shiv Sena has negligible presence in Pune, whereas NCP has some strengthen in local bodies. We have done good work in the last five years and especially in the Covid period. We are sure of getting the mandate of the people. We are organisationally strong in Pune and Nashik right down to booth level, while the MVA will use its power unabashedly. The people of Thane are fed up of the corruption and hooliganism of the Shiv Sena for years now, and they will not be able to keep this bastion of theirs,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-versus-bjp-in-maharashtra-pune-thane-and-nashik-civic-polls-will-see-tough-battle-101634224429209.html
14-10-2021||Mumbai||Oil tanker overturns in Thane; major traffic jam averted with quick police action||A major traffic jam that could have stretched into most of the day was averted in a coordinated operation between the Thane, Navi Mumbai, Mira Bhayander Vasai Virar police in the early hours of Thursday.According to the Thane Traffic Police, a tanker carrying furnace oil lost control while negotiating the Gaimukh turn at high speed and overturned on the Ghodbunder-bound lane of the road at around 2.30am on Thursday. At the same time, a truck travelling in the opposite lane developed problems with its booster and broke down.“The oil from the tanker spilled out on the road, rendering it unfit for driving, while the broken down truck on the other lane also brought traffic to a standstill,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic), Balasaheb Patil, Thane Police said.Several teams of policemen from the Traffic Police as well as the Kasarvadavli police station, along with a fire brigade team were rushed to the spot. Officials said that the incident was all the more urgent because it happened during the time that heavy vehicles are allowed to pass through Thane. As per the existing rules, heavy vehicles can ply between 11pm and 5am in Thane city limits.“We contacted the Traffic Police officials in Navi Mumbai, Mira Bhayander Vasai Virar commissionerates, and asked them to not allow any more heavy vehicles towards Thane till the issue was resolved. Meanwhile, the fire brigade used pressure pumps to hose the road with water in order to wash the furnace oil away. Next, the road was covered with a layer of sand,” Patil said.He added that the entire process took close to three hours, and traffic started moving at around 5.15am on Thursday. The backlog that had accumulated over the night took over an hour to clear with a bottleneck being created at the Fountain Hotel. However, by the time peak commuting hours began, the traffic had resumed to its normal movement, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/oil-tanker-overturns-in-thane-major-traffic-jam-averted-with-quick-police-action-101634224128825.html
14-10-2021||Lucknow||Mystery shrouds bulb holder box fitted with SIM cards, 5 detained||PRAYAGRAJ: The Kaushambi police have detained five people for questioning in connection with the bulb and holder boxes allegedly fitted with circuit boards, SIM cards, transmitters etc. Although, police are still clueless about the suspected device that was distributed in different areas of Kaushambi, the suspects are being thoroughly questioned by ATS, STF and intelligence agencies. Police officials said that the device had been sent to Bengaluru and Lucknow to be examined by experts to establish if it was being used for some illegal purpose. After investigations, police traced and detained the workers of the company which distributed the bulbs and holder box in different areas of Kaushambi in the past one month. On the basis of questioning, police prepared a list of people with whom the workers were in contact. It is believed that all people connected with the distribution of the suspected device will be traced and probed. Police officials said investigations till now had revealed that the LED bulb and holder boxes were being distributed by a Hyderabad-based company under Gramin Ujjwala Yojna, the objective behind which was to save electricity. However, the workers of the company offered the bulb and holder box to only selected people. The company officials claimed that the device read the carbon emitted by LED bulbs. However, the officials did not comment on why the consumers were not informed about the details of the device that was given to them. Police called the experts for examining the holder box but none of them could establish the motive behind the SIM card, circuit board, SD card etc found in the device. STF, ATS and officials of other agencies also examined the device for several hours after which ADG zone Prem Prakash issued instructions to send the device to Bengaluru and Lucknow for detailed examination. The report from these laboratories will reveal the exact objective of the device and whether or not it was capable of recording and transferring data. DSP STF, Navendu Kumar said prima facie it did not appear that the device could be used for ulterior motives. However, a conclusion would be drawn only after proper examination of the device by experts at Bengaluru and Lucknow. The workers and employees of the company were being questioned further in this connection, he added. Meanwhile, the intelligence wing of Kaushambi police recovered at least 80 holder boxes and 200 LED bulbs from the workers who were traced and detained on Wednesday night. The detained youths informed police that they used to work for JSN Company. The workers are based in Prayagraj but used to supply the holder box to consumers in Kaushambi and other districts. On the basis of questioning, raids are also being carried out in Prayagraj, Gorakhpur, Varanasi, Mirzapur and other districts. To note, a team of youths approached people in market places in Kaushambi area around a month back and offered 12-watt bulb along with a holder box for only ₹10. The youths claimed that the original price of the bulb was ₹175 but it was given to selected people as an offer. A trader Brajesh Kesarwani of Nayi Bazar was also approached by two youths with the same offer. Brajesh took the holder box and bulb and started using it. However, the holder became defunct two days back. On Tuesday, Brajesh took the holder to an electrician who opened it for repair but was shocked to find a circuit board inside with a SIM card of a big telecom company. Moreover, the electrician claimed that an aerial, SD card and transmitter device was fitted in the holder along with three chips and some other devices. He claimed that device was capable of storing and transmitting audio and video recordings to another device. Brajesh Kesarwani then informed the police about the holder box, suspecting that the device was being used for surveillance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mystery-shrouds-bulb-holder-box-fitted-with-sim-cards-5-detained-101634223948653.html
14-10-2021||Mumbai||Fisherfolk mount protest as BMC starts work on coastal road-sea link interchange||Roughly 200 fishing boats from Worli koliwada on Thursday morning gheraoed a temporary jetty built by the civic body at its coastal road construction site in Worli, to protest against ongoing work to build an interchange bridge between the coastal road and the Bandra-Worli sea link. In the wee hours of Thursday morning, the Hindustan Construction Company (HCC) anchored three buoys in the fishing waters, just off Worli Koliwada to facilitate the movement of barges and tugboats in the area, which fisherfolk say will damage their nets and severely hamper their work. Nitesh Patil, a representative of the Worli Koliwada Nakhwa Vyavsay Cooperative Society, said the anchors were dropped with no prior warning to the fishermen. “On October 8 we had a meeting with BMC at their site office near Worli Dairy. We were told they need to create some facilities to allow for the movement of barges and tugboats in our fishing waters, and that a thorough survey will be done in the next 10 days so that it doesn’t cause us any inconvenience. Despite this assurance, they have dropped their anchors in the same area where we cast our nets. Movement of large tugboat in our waters will cause a lot of disturbance. The anchors have already damaged three nets.” Starting 6.30am Thursday, fishing boats from four different bunders in Worli Koliwada began to surround the jetty and refused to vacate until the anchors were removed. The anchors were later shifted to an appropriate location in the evening, but not before officials from BMC and local police converged on the jetty to negotiate with fisherfolk. A second meeting between fisherfolk and BMC officials has been scheduled on October 28. Hindustan Times spoke to two BMC officials privy to the matter, who requested anonymity while commenting. “There seems to have been some miscommunication between Hindustan Construction Company, which dropped the anchors, and the fisherfolk. I wouldn’t call the event a protest, but yes, there seem to be genuine complaints. We have agreed to shift the anchors for the time being and will meet with community members to understand their demands. Besides, we have already appointed the Tata Institute of Social Sciences to conduct a survey and determine the compensation amount which can be given to fisherfolk. That will take some time,” said one of the officials. Another confirmed that the ongoing work — against which fisherfolk protested Thursday — is being carried out for the purpose of building a connecting bridge between the Coastal Road and the Bandra-Worli Sea Link. “The anchors are there to support barges that will carry construction materials and machinery from our jetty to the construction site. We are just about to start digging the foundations of the bridge.” Shweta Wagh, an architect and researcher who has been closely tracking the impact of the Coastal Road on fishing communities, said, “The livelihoods of fisherfolk have suffered due to the Coastal Road, but they are clear that they want to continue practicing fishing despite this. The BMC has not shown any regard for their requests, imposed barriers in their fishing zone, and keeps diverting the issue by talking about compensation. The BMC has not shown any regard for their requests, imposed barriers in their fishing zone, and keeps diverting the issue by talking about compensation. The Coastal Road-Sea Link interchange threatens to cut off Cleveland Bunder from the sea entirely, and despite several requests to authorities for a redesign the BMC has not responded with any willingness to hear them out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fisherfolk-mount-protest-as-bmc-starts-work-on-coastal-road-sea-link-interchange-101634223228779.html
14-10-2021||Mumbai||‘Neglecting maintenance of vehicles leads to frequent breakdowns, traffic jams in Thane’||The Central Government’s repeated extensions granted to the validity of vehicle fitness certificates have had a cascading effect on the traffic situation in Thane. With no compulsion on checking the fitness, motorists have been found to be neglecting maintenance of their vehicles, leading to frequent breakdowns and consequently daily traffic jams.The Thane City has several important roads passing through it including the Eastern Express Highway, the Mumbai Nashik Highway and the Ghodbunder Road, all of which witness a collective traffic of lakhs of vehicles every day. Even a single vehicle breaking down can cause a traffic backlog and the bigger the vehicle, the longer the traffic jam.In the early hours of October 8, a truck carrying 17 tonnes of apples from Kashmir lost control and overturned on the Manpada stretch of the Ghodbunder Road. This is the time when heavy vehicles going to and from Gujarat carrying all kinds of cargo take this road. At such a crucial time, the accident caused a traffic jam that lasted for four hours. A subsequent investigation into the incident by the police revealed that the truck’s steering had developed a fault; something that could have been avoided had the truck’s fitness been checked on time as per the earlier rules.The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has set certain time limits for validity of vehicle fitness, which are different for private vehicles and commercial ones. On September 30 this year, the Central Government, owing to the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic, extended the validity of all vehicles till October 30. Prior to that, on June 30, the validity was extended to September 30 for the same reason. “According to the data collected from our control room, 10 to 15 vehicles have been breaking down in Thane City jurisdiction on a daily basis, leading to traffic jams all over. The situation becomes particularly bad when it is a heavy vehicle like a truck, and even worse when such a vehicle overturns and spills its cargo on the road. We have been attending to daily calls of vehicle breakdowns and resultant traffic jams for the last six to seven months,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic), Balasaheb Patil, Thane Police, said. He added that in majority of such cases, the fitness of the vehicles has not been checked for over a year or in some cases since the pandemic began. Since the extension of the fitness is a Central Government decision, local transport authorities or police cannot enforce a policy different than the Centre’s. “We have held repeated meetings with around 25 transport unions based in Thane, urging them to ask their union members to check their vehicle fitness even though getting a fresh certificate is not mandatory. We also send timely reminders to all of them through WhatsApp and other platforms. However, the daily instances of vehicle breakdowns continue and so do the traffic jams,” Patil said.When contacted, Ravi Gaikwad, Regional Transport Officer, Thane, declined to comment saying he would have to consult the latest data on the issue first.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/neglecting-maintenance-of-vehicles-leads-to-frequent-breakdowns-traffic-jams-in-thane-101634222871283.html

Rasayani, Khopoli and Neral were the most frequented places by the accused.“It was easy for them to access these places on bike via the old highway and hence they used to visit Raigad for house breaks,” police inspector, Dayanand Gawade from LCB, said.A total of four accused worked as a team.

14-10-2021||Mumbai||Bombay high court grants pre-arrest bail to NCP leader Eknath Khadse’s wife||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday granted interim anticipatory bail to Mandakini Khadse, wife of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Eknath Khadse, in connection with the Pune land deal, being investigated by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The court has asked ED to file a reply to her anticipatory bail application and posted a hearing of the anticipatory bail application on December 7. The single-judge bench of justice Nitin Sambre, while hearing the anticipatory bail application was informed by senior advocate Raja Thakare that the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court had issued a non-bailable warrant against Mandakini on Tuesday after she failed to appear before it in connection with the charge sheet filed by ED. The ED has in its charge sheet named Khadse, Mandakini and son-in-law Girish Chaudhari and two others as accused in a money-laundering case. The ED has alleged that in 2016 when Khadse was the revenue minister in the then Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, he had misused his position in the Bhosari land deal to benefit his family. While Chaudhari is in custody, another co-accused Ravindra Muley was granted bail last week Thakare informed the bench that the special court had earlier rejected the anticipatory bail application of his client in the first week of October after she had received summons from the ED. The special court had held that the application was not maintainable before it. Thereafter, on Tuesday, a non-bailable warrant was issued against her. In its warrant, the special court had noted that despite giving an undertaking that she would appear, Mandakini was “wilfully avoiding” appearance before the court. It held that the medical ground given for her exemption from appearance on Tuesday was not satisfactory and issued the warrant against her. When the bench asked as to why she was not appearing before the special court, Thakare assured that she would do so on October 21 and was also willing to cooperate with the ED. The bench then directed her to appear before ED on every Tuesday and Friday from October 17 till further orders. However, advocate Sandesh Patil for ED objected to the maintainability of the pre-arrest bail plea but the bench noted that it had not gone into the details or the merits of the plea and kept ED’s contentions open to argue further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-grants-pre-arrest-bail-to-ncp-leader-eknath-khadse-s-wife-101634220467872.html
14-10-2021||Mumbai||Bombay high court rejects Anandrao Adsul’s plea against ED proceedings||In a setback for Shiv Sena leader and former Member of Parliament (MP) Anandrao Adsul, the Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday rejected his petition challenging an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) registered against him by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with banking fraud.Adsul has been named as a suspect in the alleged ₹980-crore fraud at City Co-operative Bank. The HC, however, granted liberty to Adsul to move an anticipatory bail application for protection against coercive action and arrest and directed the court which would hear the application to decide it without being influenced by the HC ruling.The division bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice Sarang Kotwal, while hearing Adsul’s petition, was informed by advocate Dr Abhinav Chandrachud that he sought quashing of the proceedings arising out of the ECIR and also challenged the summons issued to his client. Dr Chandrachud argued that the action by the agency was arbitrary and smacked of political vendetta and selective approach by the ED at the behest of Navneet Kaur Rana, an independent MP from Amravati as the HC had cancelled and confiscated her caste certificate in June after he challenged it. The petition further stated that Kaur-Rana’s husband Ravi Rana and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kirit Somaiya had prompted the ED to take up the case in which he had himself filed a first information report (FIR) against fraudulent loans.Adsul who was the former chairman of the bank had filed a case with the economic offences wing of the Mumbai Police alleging misappropriation of funds by bank officials. The complaint had claimed that loans were doled out to entities and individuals with very low or no collateral.The ED is now also probing the role of Adsul and his son Abhijeet who is a director in the board of the bank, as they have allegedly found that Adsul had been the beneficiary of some of the loans given by the bank.Apart from seeking quashing of the proceedings arising out of the ECIR, Adsul sought a copy of the ECIR, pending hearing of his petition in HC and he be granted interim protection from coercive action.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh for ED submitted that the ECIR had no connection with the political rivalry and elections and was based on the case of the fraudulent loans. Singh added that though Adsul may have been a complainant, the ED has to trace where the proceeds of crime had gone and hence had summoned Adsul for questioning. He added that providing a copy of the ECIR was the prerogative of the agency and the petitioner could not claim it as a right. In light of these submissions, Singh sought dismissal of the petition. After hearing the submissions, the court held that as the ECIR was an internal document of the ED, it could not quash it and hence rejected Adsul’s petition with liberty for him to file an anticipatory bail application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-rejects-anandrao-adsul-s-plea-against-ed-proceedings-101634219989142.html

14-10-2021||Other||Half of the children with special needs out of school: UP tells centre||Almost half of the total number of children with special needs (CwSN) do not go to schools in Uttar Pradesh (UP), as per a report sent by UP to the union education ministry. As per the report, 2,63,984 CwSN in the 3-18 years age group are out of school in the state. Against total estimated number of 5,32,040 CwSN, only 2,68,055 (amounting to 49.62%) are currently enrolled in government-run and aided schools of UP. These findings were discussed during the last meeting of the Project Approval Board (PAB) of Samgara Shiksha Abhiyan held in New Delhi. Minutes of that meeting have been confirmed just recently. As per report, inclusive education for Divyang (specially abled) children was being ensured through ‘Samarth’ program. More than 3.15 lakh such students were identified, enrolled and tracked on ‘Samarth’ tech system. “Aids/appliances have also been distributed to CwSN children through camps and 2.2k special educators are regularly tracking the learning outcomes and attendance of students till Class 8 through more than 1.3 lakh nodal teachers,” said senior education department officials aware of the contents of the report. Individual Education Plans (IEP) were made by nodal teachers and special educators for each child and being tracked online, the report states. Accessible worksheets and training videos have specially been designed for Divyang children of Classes 1 to 8 even as home-based learning too has been designed for severely disabled students, the report states. For the 2021-22 academic session, a provision of ₹5.13 crore has been made for the construction of toilets in 540 government-run primary and upper primary schools of the state. Centre’s Suggestions After going through UP government’s report, the centre has suggested that state government should ensure that learning content is accessible to the needs of all CwSN. “In areas with low internet connectivity, the UP government should deliver the content through radio and TV to reach the remotest location,” is among the suggestions made by the centre. The centre has said that mother tongue/local language may be used where possible and the state government may tie up with telecom services to increase access by improving connectivity, lowering costs and increasing coverage to mitigate access inequities. Stressing on assessment of each identified CwSN, the centre has asked that a team should be set up at the block/cluster level for the purpose. “The assessment team will ascertain the extent and type of disability, the child’s ability to develop, nature of support services required, assistive devices required and identifying special training apt for the child,” as per the details of the PAB meeting, a copy of which is with HT. The UP government has been asked to ensure that no child, including CwSN, should be left behind in terms of textbooks, enrolment, learning resources and learning guidance. ACADEMICIAN SPEAK Noted academician and former vice-chancellor of Uttar Pradesh Rajarshi Tandon Open University (UPRTOU) Prof MP Dube said that more efforts were required to ensure that children with disabilities get education. “There is a shortage of special educators and special schools in UP as schools like State Deaf and Dumb School (Sanket) running in Lucknow, Agra, Bareilly, Farrukhabad and Gorakhpur or Government School for Visually Impaired girls/ boys (Sparsh) in Lucknow, Gorakhpur, Banda, Saharanpur and Meerut or State School for Mentally Challenged boys/girls (Mamta) in Lucknow and Prayagraj along with State School for physically disabled children (Prayas) in Lucknow and Pratapgarh are limited both in terms of their numbers and capacity,” he said. He suggested budgetary push for education to CWsN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/half-of-the-children-with-special-needs-out-of-school-up-tells-centre-101634217828383.html
14-10-2021||Chandigarh||The devil in the detail can be seriously funny||The cavalier and corona go hand in hand. Or that is what health organisations had us believe, and with good reasons. Let go of your guard only at the risk of getting cornered by the viral storm. Amid the paranoia of masks, physical distancing and sanitisers, it was the age-old ritual of handwashing that took the tussle between the perfunctory and thorough to a new high. Social media was flooded with infographics on the foolproof way to wash hands. For proper cleaning, handwashers were advised to sing the happy birthday song twice. Trendier lyrics soon flooded the internet. Covid-19, it appeared, was here to teach us lessons on anti-anthropocentrism, universalism, transcendentalism and…detail. I learnt about precious detail while editing articles for an academic journal. While originality, structure and scholarship played their part in every essay, the NOC was finally issued by the comma, semicolon, apostrophe and the other little devils of the gang. A small miscreant invariably showed up, or went missing, like a naughty elf, after you had scanned every sentence under the microscope. As with handwashing, so with editing – one is never really done. Though there is no denying that success has an awful lot to do with thoroughness, in personal interactions, detail can sometimes entail serious comedy. A few summers ago, our daughter and son were home for vacations from their boarding schools. In addition to friends, it was only the movies that allured the home-birds out of their pigeonholes. So, we planned an evening around a movie show that would begin at 6pm. Taking into account the travelling time, we decided to move out a little before. One shout out and we huddled into the car at the fixed time, except my son. After a few minutes of hopeful patience, we called him to discover that he was still tying his ‘pagg’. Parents with young turbanators at home must have guessed that our movie plan was running into rough weather. The vibe in the car was fast turning restive. When was the last time you heard of a teenager missing out on a chance to irk a sibling? Not before long my daughter stretched out her arm to press(urise) the horn, and for how long. I prayed the neighbours took the honking for an electrical glitch. In a last-ditch effort, I was assigned the onerous task of running up to his room to escort him down. I reached to find him caressing the last pleat of his turban, tucking it in with utmost care and pinching the folds around the forehead for linearity. “How is it, Ma?” he asked. “Perfect,” I was quick to reply. The hurry in my voice betrayed me. “You didn’t even look properly,” he said, drawing closer to the mirror as he arranged the folds with the ‘baaj’. Alas, they fell short of the high bespoke standards. And, before I could stop him, he lifted the well-engineered ensemble from his head. There we were, back to the ‘pooni’ – tying the turban length to the door handle, rolling in the side-folds, stretching it till feet slipped, folding it zig-zag, and further on. Now, the episode is a comic page in the family chronicles; then, we sat in the car, clenching our teeth, cursing the devil in the detail. manindersidhu7@gmail.com The writer teaches English at Government College for Girls, Chandigarh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/the-devil-in-the-detail-can-be-seriously-funny-101634217587390.html

The trio was brutally thrashed by the locals, as a result of which, one of them – identified as Pulkit Singh – died, while the other two were arrested by the police, the officer said."Preliminary investigation suggests that the deceased assailant had some dispute over a mobile phone with the priest's son," he said, adding further investigation is underway.Locals, however, claimed that the slain priest had lodged a police complaint against the lynched man a few days ago but no further action was taken against him. Police, though, remained tight-lipped over the charge.

14-10-2021||Lucknow||SCDRC penalises pvt airline for forcing passenger off plane||The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRC) has imposed a fine of ₹85.5 lakh on IndiGo Airlines. The penalty was imposed by SCDRC member Rajendra Singh on the complaint of poor services and misbehavior made by Vinay Shankar Tewari, a contractor and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLA from Chillupar assembly constituency of Gorakhpur.Of the total fine, ₹35 lakh was awarded as compensation, ₹50 lakh for causing mental agony and ₹50,000 as expenses of the case along with interest. Tewari, had booked a ticket from Lucknow to New Delhi on IndiGo flight number 6 E -141 on April 15, 2013, from an online air ticket booking portal. Tewari’s flight from Amausi airport in Lucknow was scheduled at 10.50am. He reached the airport and boarded the flight but just before the takeoff, the cabin crew reportedly informed Tewari that his ticket had been cancelled. In his complaint Tewari said he was forcibly removed from his allotted seat 5A. Tewari was told by the online booking portal that his ticket was valid even though IndiGo authorities informed him that that his ticket was cancelled by one Shailendra at around 7.38am, hours before the scheduled take off. During proceedings of the case, the SCDRC held that even if the ticket was presumed to be cancelled then why did the airlines allow Tewari to board the flight. The Commission also asked why the airlines failed to share screenshot of the message with Tewari conveying cancellation of the ticket and pointed out that the airlines also failed to submit the mobile number before the court from which the ticket was allegedly cancelled. In its order, the SCDRC held that the airlines indulged in unfair trade practice, caused mental agony and financial loss to Tewari, who is a contractor and was going to New Delhi for a meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/scdrc-penalises-pvt-airline-for-forcing-passenger-off-plane-101634216567294.html
14-10-2021||Mumbai||Southwest monsoon withdraws over Mumbai, expect rise in temperatures||The southwest monsoon on Thursday withdrew over Mumbai, six days after its official date of withdrawal on October 8, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has confirmed. The withdrawal has taken place across the state, having begun on October 12. The withdrawal line as of Thursday afternoon continued to persist over Vengurla in the southernmost part of the Konkan coast and is expected to withdraw entirely within the next day. “With the monsoon having now exited Mumbai completely, citizens can expect clear skies and rising temperatures over the remaining period of October. The maximum temperature has been between 33 and 34 degrees Celsius over the past three days, but it will quickly climb now. It may touch 35 degrees Celsius or more by the end of the week,” said a meteorologist with the IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai. They also added that there may be a slight chance of unseasonal rains toward late October. Monsoon withdrawal in Maharashtra first began from the easternmost tip of the Vidarbha region between October 9 and 11, subsequently progressing over parts of Marathwada and then Madhya Maharashtra. Withdrawal over the Konkan region began on October 12. Last year, the monsoon’s withdrawal over Mumbai had taken place on October 28, nearly three weeks after the official date, making it the season’s most delayed retreat since 1975. In 2019, the withdrawal was recorded on October 14. The 2021 monsoon season also marks the third consecutive year in which Mumbai received over 3,000mm of rain, and follows 2020’s seasonal total of 3,759.7mm (which was just 70mm short of being the wettest September on record), as per the met department’s monitoring station in Santacruz. This year, the city saw three ‘extremely heavy’ rainfall days (one in June and two in July), receiving over 204.5mm in 24-hours. The first of these events occurred on June 10 (231.3mm), coinciding with the arrival of the southwest monsoon two days prior to the official onset date of June 11. The highest amount of rain — 1,222mm — was received in July. The month also saw two consecutive, atypical thunderstorms which dumped more than 500mm of rain over the city, resulting in the second and third ‘extremely heavy rainfall’ events of the season. A convective thunderstorm, described by meteorologists as “monstrous”, deposited a whopping 235mm rain between 12am and 4am on July 18, less than 48 hours after a similar high rainfall event resulted in the season’s highest daily rainfall on July 16 at 253mm. July rains saw a 48% departure from the monthly normal of 822mm. Meanwhile, the maximum temperature on Thursday rose to 34.8 degrees Celsius at the IMD’s monitoring station at Santacruz. This was up from 33.7 degrees Celsius the day prior, and is expected to rise consistently over the rest of the month. The highest temperature recorded in Mumbai this year touched 35.8 degrees Celsius on October 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/southwest-monsoon-withdraws-over-mumbai-expect-rise-in-temperatures-101634216507591.html
14-10-2021||Mumbai||No road widening proposed in Aarey, clarifies BMC||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Wednesday clarified that the tender it floated earlier this month for proposed road work at Aarey will not include any road widening, and only road upgradation of the carriageway from a tar road to a concrete one will be carried out. While environmentalists have expressed relief, they remained sceptical of the BMC’s clarification as the tender calls for construction of a nine-metre wide road, as opposed to the existing seven-metre wide carriageway. They also highlighted that BMC intends to lay concrete pipes on either side of the road, which seems unnecessary in an area with sufficient natural drainage. Zoru Bhatena, environmentalist with the Save Aarey movement, who had filed a detailed complaint in the matter with authorities, said, “Grateful that BMC has clarified that no trees will be touched in Aarey. But, it doesn’t answer the question as to why they want to add concrete drains in a natural area, or why they want to create facilities to increase traffic in the forest. Nor does it answer why they are doing such work without statutory forest and eco-sensitive zone clearances as is mandatory in notified forest areas.” BMC for its part has now said that there will be “no proposal of widening of existing asphalt road” and that “due care will be taken to protect existing trees and the adjoining Aarey forest.” “Necessary mitigation measures will be taken care of as per the direction of chief conservator of forest,” BMC added. Sanjiv Valsan, another Save Aarey campaigner, said, “It is a relief to know they aren’t going to widen Aarey road but converting a tar road into concrete isn’t going to solve the real and current problem of Aarey road, that of unacceptably high vehicular congestion in an eco-sensitive zone. There needs to be a heavy toll on private vehicles entering Aarey, as was the case a few years ago.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-road-widening-proposed-in-aarey-clarifies-bmc-101634216387511.html

14-10-2021||Mumbai||47% of people above 60 years in Navi Mumbai yet to get first vaccination against Covid||Even as the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has vaccinated 98% of its eligible population, as per the statistics, around 47% of the people above the age of 60 years are yet to get even their first jab.NMMC commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, claimed that a door-to-door survey would be conducted to check how many beneficiaries were remaining while a call centre would also be set up to check with families to ensure no senior citizen is left out.Currently, 11.07 lakh population of Navi Mumbai is estimated to be eligible for the vaccination, of which 1.76 lakh is estimated to be above the age of 60 years. Till now, only 92,894 people above the age group of 60 years have got their first jab, which is 53% of the total estimated population of this age group. Around 34,445 people under the category of Health Care Workers were also jabbed with the first dose.“Currently, we do not differentiate the beneficiaries as per the health care workers and front line workers, and each person is reported under their respective age group. Hence, when the vaccination had started for the health care workers, many medical professionals who were above 60 years got their vaccination under that category,” a medical officer from the corporation said.Meanwhile, Bangar said that the data of estimated target is notional and not the exact number. Hence, it is important to get the exact numbers of the people above the age group of 60 in the city to conclude if there is anyone remaining.“Even when there was low supply of vaccination, we have always had at least one slot for the first dose of 60 years-plus. So, this age group was never neglected and was always given priority. There is no reason why anyone from 60 years and above would be left out. There was never any reluctance from this age group and they were always eager to get the vaccination done. Accessibility, too, is not the reason as the drive for them was always available. In fact the queue for the first dose is declining slowly and even after we reach 100% target, the first dose drive will continue for those with no proof of being a resident of Navi Mumbai,” Bangar said.He said that the target statistics is a notional figure and to get the exact figure, a door-to-door survey would be done, and simultaneously will have call centres verifying the exact number of 60 years and above existing in the city.“Through various drives and initiatives, we have collected the data of the families in Navi Mumbai and their family members. The call centre staff will be asked to call up the families and check if the senior citizens at their residences have been vaccinated. Besides, we also have around 3,500 housing societies registered with us who are also connected via WhatsApp. The housing societies, too, would be asked to provide the information.”In many cases, the elderly were shifted to their hometowns when the pandemic started and while some might have still not come back, some others might have returned after getting their vaccination done, due to which their record is not registered with the NMMC.According to the corporation, the target given by the State to Navi Mumbai is to vaccinate 11.07 lakh population, of which 10.95 lakh have been vaccinated with the first dose and 12,000 are pending. In the age group of 45 years to 59 years, the target given to the corporation is to vaccinate 2,49,600 beneficiaries, of which 2,25,510 (89%) have been vaccinated with the first dose and 11% are remaining. Meanwhile, for the age group of 18 years to 44 years, the target is to vaccinate 6,81,300 beneficiaries while the corporation has vaccinated more than that with 7,12,087 getting their first dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/47-of-people-above-60-years-in-navi-mumbai-yet-to-get-first-vaccination-against-covid-101634213086812.html

Also read: ‘Captain is with BJP’: Punjab minister alleges Amarinder behind govt’s BSF moveHe ordered that property cards (sanads) for 5 marla plots be given to the homeless under the state’s Basera scheme and proprietary rights to slumdwellers occupying government land on Diwali on November 4. This was earlier scheduled for November 15. Punjab goes to the polls by February next year and the Channi government wants the administration to focus on people-centric works. During the meeting with the district chiefs in Chandigarh, the CM asked for starting the process to waive arrears of electricity bills of up to 2-kilowatt load. To speed up ongoing development works and welfare schemes, Channi told the DCs to meet the MLAs concerned and redress concerns related to their constituencies. CM wants panel of revenue officers for reforms He suggested amendments in the law to protect ownership rights of people’s property that have become obsolete and ensure timely clearance of driving licences, birth and death certificates and disability certificates. He said this initiative would streamline the existing procedure of girdawari, mutation, jamabandi and land division to save people from fraudulent practices to divest them of their rights. Channi directed chief secretary Anirudh Tewari to constitute a committee of revenue officers to suggest reforms and make a proposal to abolish the girdawari system to ensure ownership rights only vests with the legitimate owners. Hussan Lal, the principal secretary to the CM and special principal secretaries to the CM, Rahul Tewari and Kamal Kishor Yadav, also attended the meeting. Calls to end corruption in registry offices Channi asked DCs to be punctual and not to function from camp offices. He asked them to clamp down on corruption in registry offices. He asked the DCs not to allow tehsildars to undertake property registration after office hours and unnecessarily cause delay on frivolous grounds. He suggested DCs conduct surprise checks in offices to ensure punctuality and any employee found absent be suspended. The CM instructed the CS to direct all heads of departments, too, in this regard. “Ensure that none from the public is forced to give bribe for getting their work done whether it’s approval for building plans or driving and arms licences,” Channi said. He asked them to keep a vigil on drug trafficking and illegal mining. He called for protection of NRI properties and ensuring timely payment to farmers during paddy procurement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/eye-on-elections-punjab-cm-wants-pensions-dues-cleared-101634212726699.html
14-10-2021||Kolkata||Political row erupts in Bengal over move to extend BSF jurisdiction||A political row erupted in West Bengal after the Centre decided to extend the area under the jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF) in three state’s - West Bengal, Punjab and Assam. While the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) in the state hit out at the Centre on Thursday alleging that it is an infringement on the state land through back doors, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders welcomed the move saying that BSF should be given more powers. The Congress echoed TMC’s stance. “This is a condemnable decision. This is infringing upon the state’s land through the back door. The party is seriously looking into this,” said Kunal Ghosh, TMC spokesperson and the party’s state general secretary. On Monday, the Union government amended the BSF Act to authorise the force to undertake search, seizure and arrest within a larger 50 km stretch, instead of the existing 15 km, from the International Border (IB) in Punjab, West Bengal and Assam. Among all states, West Bengal has the longest and one of the most porous international borders. The state shares a 2216-km-long international border with Bangladesh. It also shares around a 100-km border with Nepal and a 183 km border with Bhutan. “The expansion of #BSF area of jurisdiction up to 50 km from border of some states amounts to brazen infringement upon the territory of states. @HMOIndia, you should not indulge any ‘Chherkhani’ else will face the consequences,” tweeted Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, leader of the Congress party in the Lok Sabha. The Indo-Bangladesh border, particularly in West Bengal, is also one of the most porous borders. Data placed by the Union ministry of home affairs before the parliament in March 2020 shows that in 2017, 2018 and 2019, security agencies arrested 1175, 1118 and 1351 people along the entire stretch of the Indo-Bangla border in India. “We welcome this decision. But just giving more jurisdictions to the BSF won’t help. The BSF cannot arrest anyone independently. Whenever a smuggler, trafficker or terrorist is held, they need to be handed over to the local police. The BSF should be given more teeth so that they can work independently and also should be given more manpower,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson in West Bengal. In Gujarat, which shares a border with Pakistan, the same limit was reduced from 80 km to 50 km, and in Rajasthan, it was kept unchanged at 50 km. “This is simply infringing upon the sovereign rights of the state. There are allegations of links between BSF and smugglers. To let them increase their area of operation would be suicidal. The state should oppose this,” said Saugata Roy, TMC MP. In Bengal, some BSF officers are under the scanner of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in a 2020 transborder cattle smuggling case. Senior BSF officials refused to comment on the developments and the political row that followed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/political-row-erupts-in-bengal-over-move-to-extend-bsf-jurisdiction-101634210747998.html
14-10-2021||Mumbai||In seeking bail for Aryan Khan, his lawyer praises NCB||Aryan Khan's lawyer on Thursday put in a word of praise for the officials of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) as he sought bail for the eldest son of Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan, who was arrested after a raid on a cruise ship by the central agency on October 2. Senior counsel Amit Desai was responding to the NCB lawyer’s arguments in the special court under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. The special NDPS court on Wednesday adjourned the hearing for a day on bail applications of Aryan Khan, Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha, who were arrested along with Aryan Khan.“There can be no doubt on the importance of a statute on the nation. There is no doubt that the world is fighting the drug menace. We got our freedom, we must protect it, and ensure the development of society,” senior counsel Amit Desai said in the court, according to Bar and Bench. "I don't think there is any debate or doubt that the entire world is fighting drug menace… Kudos to the NCB for doing this job and just hope that they continue the investigation in a legal manner. I am appreciating that the officers are risking their lives for protecting their country,” Desai said.Also read | Many countries have legalised these drugs: 5 things Aryan Khan's lawyer saidHe said Aryan Khan can still be granted bail without affecting the ongoing investigation into the cruise ship drugs bust case. “As bail doesn't take away their right to continue their investigation,” he said. He also alleged that the NCB may have crossed a legal line in an endeavour to convince the court to oppose Aryan Khan’s bail application.“By no stretch of the imagination, the boy is involved in illicit drug trafficking or international drug trafficking. These allegations are fake. He has nothing to do with illicit drug trafficking,” he continued.Also read | Aryan Khan regular consumer of drugs, says NCB; compares with Rhea-Showik caseOn Wednesday, Desai called the NCB's contention "inherently absurd" and argued that when there was no recovery of drugs from him, then he should not be penalised at the stage of granting bail. Desai also told the court that the accused in the case are young adults and not drug peddlers, traffickers or racketeers. "In many countries, these substances (drugs) are legal. Let us not penalise them at this stage when bail is sought. Let us not make it worse for them (accused). They have suffered enough and they have learnt their lesson, if at all," he said.The central agency in its reply filed in the special court said that its investigation has revealed Aryan Khan's role in illicit procurement and distribution of contraband. The NCB said that Aryan Khan used to procure drugs from Arbaz Khan. "It is also revealed in the investigation that accused number 1 (Aryan Khan) used to procure drugs from accused number 2 (Arbaz Khan) and people connected to Arbaz. Six gm of charas was removed from the accused number 2 from his shoes during the raid by NCB," the NCB said in its reply.Also read | Aryan Khan chatted about drugs in bulk quantity with a foreigner: NCB"Accused numbers 1 and 2 are associated and worked in close collaborations so the offences are attracted against them especially section 29 of the NDPS Act ( Criminal Conspiracy to commit an offence)," the agency added in its reply.Aryan Khan was arrested on October 3 following the NCB raid on the cruise ship and is currently in judicial custody. He is lodged at the Arthur Road prison in Mumbai. He approached the special court seeking bail after a magistrate's court rejected his plea last week. As many as 20 people, including two Nigerian nationals, have been arrested so far in the case related to the seizure of drugs following a raid at a party on the Cordelia cruise ship off the Mumbai coast on October 2.￼||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/in-seeking-bail-for-aryan-khan-his-lawyer-praises-ncb-101634209321987.html

14-10-2021||Mumbai||Raigad district administration gives nod to reopen Elephanta Caves for tourists||The residents of Elephanta Island have now heaved a sigh of relief as the Raigad district administration reopened its ancient caves for the tourists earlier this week.The caves were shut for tourists since April 1, when the government announced the second lockdown. Last year too, they were shut for almost eight months (from March 19 to November 6) during the first lockdown.Mahendra Kalyankar, collector of Raigad district, said, “As the scenario of Covid is better now, we have given consent to reopen the caves on the island.”Elephanta Island or Gharapuri is a popular tourist spot 10km off the city of Mumbai. The island houses three villages – Rajbunder, Shetbunder and Morabunder – and its population collectively is around 1,200. Due to lack of other sources of income on the island, its residents are heavily dependent on the tourism industry.Kailash Shinde, conservation assistant of Archeological Survey of India (ASI), said, “With the reopening of the caves, the tourists have started visiting the island, but their number is very less. Every year, a huge number of tourists from across the world visit the island during the Christmas vacation and the weeks after that. We hope this year, too, we will receive the same response.”According to the local gram panchayat officials, 7 lakh to 8 lakh tourists would visit the island every year to see its ancient caves before the pandemic. Around 30% of the tourists were foreigners.Sunil Padte, 60, a shopkeeper from the island, said, “I had no income ever since the caves were shut for tourists. So, my household was entirely dependent on my son’s income who works as a boat contractor. Others, who had no such options, went out of the island to take up jobs of security guards, salesmen among others. They have now started coming back.”Baliram Thakur, sarpanch of the island, said, “We have some farming land on the island and the residents would cultivate on them till mid-2000s. However, monkeys started spoiling our crops and hence everyone stopped doing it. The number of monkeys has increased manifold on the island over the past two decades. The monkeys cannot be relocated as it is violating the Animals Act.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/raigad-district-administration-gives-nod-to-reopen-elephanta-caves-for-tourists-101634208528025.html
14-10-2021||Pune||Taste of Life: World War 2 air raid shoots Pune street food into public acclaim||Food traditions are often messy, complicated, and mostly a confluence of other varied traditions. There is usually little by way of purity or simplicity. In April 1942, Pune was preparing itself to face an aerial attack. When war seemed inevitable and it was realized that aerial attack would be the greatest threat posed by any coming conflict, the British government established a volunteer organization – Air Raid Precautions or ARP – that would stand at the centre of the wartime civil defence. Members of the ARP in Britain distributed gas masks to the population and policed the blackout. After the war started in September 1939, they played a vital role in shepherding people to shelter, reporting on damage, and rescuing people from wrecked buildings. In India, ARP Law came into force in 1939. Each city had multiple ARP wardens, and they had a troop of volunteers to help them with their wartime activities. Regular drills were carried out by the ARP wardens in conjunction with the police, local hospitals, and the fire department. There was a provision to arrest people who did not cooperate with the ARP volunteers. When Vishakhapatnam, Kakinada, and Colombo were bombed in the first week of April 1942, Pune panicked. A black-out was enforced, and the Municipal Corporation supplied each house with jute sandbags. Several practice drills were held, and air-raid sirens would wail at ungodly hours. The local populace was supposed to rush into air-raid shelters upon hearing the sirens. But since there were only a handful of them in Pune, and almost none for the common public, it was expected that people would rush into their homes instead. One such drill was held in Sadashiv peth on April 10, 1942. Though it was supposed to be a routine affair, there was an unusual commotion on the streets that day because a gentleman refused to obey. His name was Mr Gopal Thakur, and he sold “Bhel” in an open cart. According to a report published in “Jnanaprakash” on April 11, 1942, when the ARP volunteers requested Thakur to move his cart immediately to a “safe” location, he not only refused to listen to them, but also manhandled the volunteers, and later, the police. The next day, he was ordered to spend a day in jail, and pay a fine of ₹50. Thakur refused to pay the fine, and as a result, had to be imprisoned for a month. It is unclear why Thakur did not obey the ARP volunteers. Maybe he did not want to go home and lose his earnings. Or he did not want to obey the volunteers who were helping the British. “Jnanaprakash”, a month later, reported that a small crowd had gathered outside the jail to welcome him when he stepped out. It seems that Thakur was known for his “Bhel” because the newspaper referred to him as “Bhelwale Thakur” in all the reports. The last one about his release also mentions something very interesting. One Mr Narhari Shintre was released from jail 4 days prior. He too was imprisoned for not obeying the ARP law. Shintre sold “Santosh Wada” near SP College. The report mentions that his regular customers crowded at his roadside cart once he was back. I wouldn’t have been able to find out what “Santosh Wada” was, had Mrs Lakshmibai Vaidya not written the recipe in her cookbook “Paakasiddhi”. Vaidya’s cookbook, first published in 1969, has a recipe for “Breadcha Wada” where a chutney sandwich is coated with a seasoned gram flour batter and deep-fried. There’s another version where the sandwich is stuffed with a savory potato filling. She mentions that bread could be replaced with pao, provided the crusts are cut. “Santosh Wada” is a slight modification of the recipe where the gram flour batter also has soaked bread. Vaidya states that the gram flour batter could be replaced by a mixture of eggs, milk with salt, and pepper. “Santosh Wada” and “Breadcha Wada” seem to be inspired by various versions of the French toast. There are several savory versions of the same in the UK, of which “Gypsy Toast” is a close relative of “Santosh Wada”. It is unclear when “Breadcha Wada”, and “Santosh Wada” lost their identity to “Bread Pattice”, the now popular snack in Maharashtra, which is also known as “Bread Pakoda” in the north of India. Though called ‘pattice’, this dish has nothing to do with, perhaps, the more popular Indian chicken and mutton “pattice”. The “Chicken / Mutton Pattice” made famous by Irani bakeries and cafes are a version of French puff pastries. Their resemblance to Cornish Pasties is striking. The humble “Bread Pattice” is not a pocket pie. It is not baked, but deep-fried in oil. The word “pattice” comes from “patties”. During World War II, after the rationing of food grains, sugar, and kerosene came into effect, many men resorted to eating out while their wives were working in offices. Dishes like Misal, Samosa, and “Bread Pattice”, which were never cooked at home, gained popularity. The opening of bakeries operated by Hindus also played a role. Vaidya has included these in her cookbook. “I wonder who came up with the name “Santosh Wada”. Was it cooked in a restaurant named “Santosh”? The famous eatery in Pune, “Santosh Bhuvan”, did not serve the dish in 1942. Mr Ratnakar Soman, who ran “Maharashtra Bhuvan” in Budhwar Peth told me in 2014 that their restaurant served “Breadcha Wada” in 1950. He had never heard the name“Santosh Wada”. Where exactly did the dish originate? Did Shintre himself come up with the name, and the recipe? Did he use sliced bread or pao? Which chutney did he smear the bread slices with? And did he use potatoes? Were there others who sold the same dish around that time? I wish I knew. No dish is ever “authentic”. The origin is always obscure. Within a few years, at the most decades, culinary origins become blurred, and are lost in the mists of time.May be because of our motley heritage, there is a tendency to fixate and obsess over foods that have a more clear lineage. It would help if we understand that the history of food is the history of invention in times of necessity and inheritance from diverse cultures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/taste-of-life-world-war-2-air-raid-shoots-pune-street-food-into-public-acclaim-101634208286712.html
14-10-2021||Chandigarh||Paddy stubble burning picks up in Punjab’s border areas||Stubble burning has picked up pace in Punjab’s border belt of Majha, including Amritsar, Gurdaspur and Tarn Taran districts, where the harvest of paddy is on in full swing. This year, crop residue burning is delayed as paddy harvest was behind schedule due to the late withdrawal of the monsoon. Also watch: MHA expands BSF’s powers in border States & why Punjab CM wants move rolled backOn October 13, a total of 132 events were captured by the satellite in Punjab. On the same day in 2019, 117 active fire events were captured, while there were 240 active fire events in the state on October 13, 2020. According to the cumulative figure from September 15 to October 13, a total of 1,057 incidents took place this year, while 3,123 fields on fire were recorded during the corresponding period in 2020. Of the 132 fire events recorded on Wednesday, Tarn Taran recorded 37 incidents, while Amritsar witnessed 26 farm fires. Officials dither to act against farmers in protest mode “Don’t expect that number of fire incidents to come down. It’s now an annual phenomenon, as in-situ utilisation of paddy straw is expensive, while there are only few takers for paddy straw bales in ex-situ management of the straw. Amid the ongoing farmers’ protest against the new farm laws, no official dare act against farmers. Officials are at the receiving end both from farmers and the government,” said a senior official of Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), requesting anonymity. PPCB experts said that the maximum number of fire incidents are expected from the last week of October till Diwali. The Punjab Government has so far appointed 8,000 nodal officers in Punjab to check stubble burning. “There is no viable solution for the management of paddy straw. If the government wants farmers to adopt in-situ or ex-situ management of paddy straw, it must pay ₹200 as incentive per quintal of paddy,” said Thakur Mann, a farmer of Patiala. He said that farmer unions will oppose any punitive move by the government. PPCB begins penalising defaulters In Punjab, setting fire to a field of less than two acres attracts a fine of ₹2,500, while a penalty of ₹5,000 is imposed if the field is between two and five acres. If the field on fire is over five acres, then the fine shoots up to ₹15,000. “The PPCB has started the process to identify farms where stubble burning has been identified by satellite and fines have been imposed,” said PPCB secretary Krunesh Garg. Air quality in moderate range in Amritsar Despite the farm fires, the air quality index (AQI) in the state is better than it was during the corresponding period in 2020. The AQI of Amritsar and Tarn Taran, where farm fires have started, is 150, which is in the moderate range. The AQI measures particulate matter and four harmful gases that pollute the air and converts the measured pollutant concentrations in the air to a number on a scale of 0 to 500. 0-50 is good air quality with minimal impact on health; the 51-100 range is satisfactory but may cause minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people; 101-200 AQI is the moderate range that may cause breathing discomfort to people with lung and heart disease; 201-300 is poor quality air that causes breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. The 301-400 range is very poor AQI range that can cause respiratory illness on prolonged exposure; and 401-500 is the severe range that affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/paddy-stubble-burning-picks-up-in-punjab-s-border-areas-101634206786354.html
14-10-2021||Delhi||Doctors assaulted at Delhi hospital by family as newborn dies, case registered||Three doctors were allegedly assaulted by the family members of a woman after her baby died during a caesarean procedure at Kuber Hospital in northwest Delhi's Pitampura on Wednesday, police said on Thursday. The family claimed “negligence” on part of the doctors. They were later detained by the police for misbehaviour.Sakshi Sharma, a 26-year-old resident of Rani Bagh, was admitted to the hospital on Tuesday. However, the doctors performed a caesarean or C-section on her to deliver the baby due to complications. The baby was stillborn, however, a senior police officer said.According to the police, some of her family members had an argument with the doctors, hurled abuses and manhandled them, blaming them for the child’s death. One of the doctors lodged a police complaint against the patient's family members. “A written complaint was given by the Dr Kanti Shamsukha alleging that some persons belonging to the family and relation of the patient misbehaved, beat the doctors and also tried to cause damage to the hospital,” deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Usha Rangnani said.Based on the complaint, a case has been registered against the family members under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).The accused were also booked under the Delhi Medicare Service Personnel and Medicare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage of Property) Act, 2008. They have been detained and the matter is being investigated, the police said.The body of the baby has been shifted to Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital for a post-mortem examination, they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/doctors-assaulted-at-delhi-hospital-by-family-as-newborn-dies-case-registered-101634201020329.html
14-10-2021||Mumbai||Southwest monsoon withdraws over Mumbai, 6 days after official date||The southwest monsoon on Thursday withdrew over Mumbai, six days after its official date of withdrawal on October 8, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has confirmed. The withdrawal has taken place across the state, having begun on October 12. The withdrawal line, as of Thursday afternoon, continued to persist over Vengurla in the southernmost part of the Konkan coast, and is expected to withdraw entirely within the next day.“With the monsoon having now exited Mumbai completely, citizens can expect clear skies and rising temperatures over the remaining period of October. The maximum temperature has been between 33 and 34 degrees Celsius over the last three days, but it will quickly climb now. It may touch 35 degrees Celsius or more by the end of the week,” said a meteorologist with the IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai. They also added that there may be a slight chance of unseasonal rains toward late October.Monsoon withdrawal in Maharashtra first began from the easternmost tip of the Vidarbha region between October 9 and 11, subsequently progressing over parts of Marathwada and then Madhya Maharashtra. Withdrawal over the Konkan region began on October 12. Last year, the monsoon’s withdrawal over Mumbai had taken place on October 28, nearly three weeks after the official date, making it the season’s most delayed retreat since 1975. In 2019, the withdrawal was recorded on October 14.The 2021 monsoon season also marks the third consecutive year in which Mumbai received over 3000mm of rain, and follows 2020’s seasonal total of 3,759.7mm (which was just 70mm short of being the wettest September on record), as per the weather department’s monitoring station in Santacruz.This year, the city saw three ‘extremely heavy’ rainfall days (one in June and two in July), receiving over 204.5mm in 24-hours. The first of these events occurred on June 10 (231.3mm), coinciding with the arrival of the south-west monsoon two days prior to the official onset date of June 11.The highest amount of rain, 1222mm, was received in July. The month also saw two consecutive, atypical thunderstorms which dumped more than 500mm rain over the city, resulting in the second and third ‘extremely heavy rainfall’ events of the season. A convective thunderstorm, described by meteorologists as “monstrous”, deposited a whopping 235mm rain between 12am and 4am on July 18, less than 48 hours after a similar high rainfall event resulted in the season’s highest daily rainfall on July 16 at 253mm. July rains saw a 48% departure from the monthly normal of 822mm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/southwest-monsoon-withdraws-over-mumbai-101634206488160.html

14-10-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC rejects HDIL promoter Rakesh Wadhawan’s plea for bail on health grounds||The Bombay high court on Thursday rejected the application by the Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL) promoter Rakesh Wadhawan, who was arrested in the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank Ltd multi-crore fraud case, seeking bail on medical grounds. The court was informed that the dual-chamber pacemaker implantation had been successfully carried out on him at state-run KEM Hospital. The HC has, however, granted him liberty to approach it for further relief if the facilities required for post-surgery recovery were not available at the hospital. The single-judge bench of justice Nitin Sambre, which had been hearing the application for bail on medical grounds, was informed that the doctors at the KEM hospital, as well as a private cardiologist consultant, had confirmed that Wadhawan required dual pacemaker implantation due to fluctuations in his heart rate. After KEM hospital had informed that it did not have the facility to carry out the dual-chamber pacemaker implantation, the court sought to know from the state whether any government hospital had the facility and, if not, whether the state would consider allowing Wadhawan to undergo the same at some private hospital at his own cost. After the state informed the bench that Sir J J Hospital had the facility for the implantation, Wadhawan’s counsel based on the recommendation of the private consultant for multidisciplinary approach for patient’s recovery had sought shifting Wadhawan to a private hospital for recovery. On Wednesday additional public prosecutor Prajakta Shinde informed the bench that arrangements were being made to set up a cardiac ICU in KEM Hospital. Shinde further submitted that the claim that the applicent was immunocompromised as he was being treated in a government hospital were unfounded as his situation had become such due to the severe Corona infection which he had suffered. Shinde had also submitted that already regular I.C.U. was operational at KEM Hospital where applicant could be treated in case of emergency and a Cardiac I.C.U. would be ready in all respects within a period of one week. She further claimed that application should be rejected as applicant was provided the best of the treatment by expert doctors. After hearing the submissions the court observed in its order, “What is noticed is, best possible treatment at well-known Government/Corporation Hospital is made available to the applicant. There is nothing on record to infer that the applicant is not treated for his ailment. As regards comorbidities are concerned, this court expects that KEM Hospital authorities shall be taking appropriate precaution for the same.” In light of this observation the court held that the claim put-forth by the applicant that he is immediately required to be released on temporary bail on medical ground is not justified and as his application lacks merit, it is rejected. The court however permitted Wadhawan to approach the court afresh in case of an emergency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-rejects-hdil-promoter-rakesh-wadhawan-s-plea-for-bail-on-health-grounds-101634202526851.html

He added they are moving court against the agency, the harassment meted out to them, and for quashing the case.Malik alleged the NCB showed 200 kg herbal tobacco as ganja and produced photographs of seizures taken at its office. He added the NCB found nothing in the raids conducted at Khan’s office. Malik said wrong information of seizure of 200-kg ganja was given to the media. He accused NCB of selectively leaking information involving big names for cheap publicity.Malik said he has been getting threatening calls since he exposed NCB’s raid on a cruise in Mumbai. He added his security has been beefed up and he will file a complaint about the threats.In its detailed bail order, a special court on Wednesday ruled there was no case of illicit drug trafficking and conspiracy against Khan. The bail was granted last month.“The court order clearly says the wrong sections... were applied against the accused.

14-10-2021||Pune||Petrol crosses ₹110 mark in Pune; diesel at ₹99.36||After a break of two days, fuel prices have gone up once again in the city with diesel prices just a step away from ₹100 mark. Petrol price has breached the mark of ₹110. Just in a manner of 10 days, CNG prices have also been hiked again in the city by more than ₹2.6. On Thursday, the petrol price in Pune stood at ₹110.25 per litre. The diesel cost ₹99.36 per litre and CNG now cost ₹62.10 per kg in Pune. The CNG users have also been disappointed as the CNG prices have soared again. After remaining stable for a long period of time, the CNG price was hiked on August 2 to cost ₹57.50 per kg. On October 4, CNG prices rose again by ₹2 and to cost ₹59.50 per kg. Effective from Thursday midnight, CNG prices have been hiked by ₹2.6. The incessant hike in petrol and diesel prices is likely to impact the transportation rates. Last Saturday, all transport associations in the state held a meeting in Pune to discuss various issues. The point of increasing the rate of goods and passenger transportation was also discussed. However, the associations refrained from increasing the rates. Many from the transportation business said that the continuous hike in diesel prices would leave no option but increase the transportation rates. Hike in CNG prices may also make rickshaw rides costlier for the passengers. In the city, most of the rickshaws run on CNG and riskha unions are considering increasing the fare..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/petrol-crosses-rs-110-mark-in-pune-diesel-at-rs-9936-101634199466659.html
14-10-2021||Delhi||Kejriwal urges Baijal to allow Chhath Puja celebrations in Delhi||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday wrote to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal urging him to allow Chhat Puja celebrations in Delhi with adherence to Covid-19 protocols. “People of Delhi celebrate Chhath Puja every year with a lot of devotion with a strong belief that it would bring good health and prosperity. In Delhi, the Covid-19 situation has been under control for the past few months. In my opinion, people should be allowed to celebrate Chhath Puja with the necessary regulations. Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, and other neighbouring states have allowed it with necessary protocols. I request you convene a meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) and consider allowing Chhath Puja in Delhi too,” said Kejriwal in his letter to Baijal. He shared a copy of the letter on Twitter.Baijal is the DDMA chairperson and Kejriwal vice-chairperson.On September 30, the DDMA issued an order prohibiting the celebration of Chhath Puja at riverbanks, near water bodies, open grounds, in temples, and other public spaces. Limited restrictions were imposed on other festivals such as Durga Puja and Dussehra.Chhath Puja in public spaces was prohibited last year too because of the pandemic. This year, it will be celebrated on November 10. The festival involves collective dips in water bodies and worshipping the Sun. It is a major festival for people from Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh, who have a sizeable presence in Delhi.The Bharatiya Janata Party has protested against restrictions on Chhath Puja celebrations.

14-10-2021||Other||‘Naga issue not monopoly of any group or politicians’: Committee||A committee of seven Nagaland political groups has said the Naga issue is not a monopoly of any group or political leaders. “Political solution cannot be designed to appease, quench and inflate the pride, ego, and ambition of any leader,” said N Kitovi Zhimomi, the panel’s convener, in a statement.This comes as Nagaland’s top politicians are in Delhi for a series of meetings and consultations related to peace talks. The talks were stalled in October 2019 over differences on issues related to the 2015 Framework Agreement, and a separate Naga flag and constitution.Zhimomi said the problem with today’s leaders is that many have developed a sense of personal ownership of the issue at the cost of the Naga people. He said that “overindulgence in self-glorification and self-crowning exercises with relentless media hype” since 1997 have not helped the Nagas. He said they have avoided “this deadly trap”. “We chose to be practical and transparent with the Naga tribes and with the Gol (government of India). We changed the concept of Naga political talks from secrecy mode to transparent and inclusive mode.”Zhimomi said they have made it clear to the Centre the significance of a separate flag and constitution. The rival Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim has remained unyielding to date about the two issues.“On the Naga Flag, the Gol has been clearly told there is a historical, cultural, and spiritual side to it which is too dear to the Naga people. The Gol has assured that the Naga Flag would be given the appropriate respect and position it deserves. The Naga flag’s unrestrained political usage would be pursued post solution democratically. Gol will not object to the use of the Naga flag for cultural purposes and in customary institutions,” Zhimomi said.He maintained there should be no claim for “championship prize” on this. “As for the Naga Constitution, the precise shape, form, and source of authority will come from the Naga tribes. Each Naga tribe has conventions that govern the conduct of individuals and villages as miniature republics.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/naga-issue-not-monopoly-of-any-group-or-politicians-committee-101634196106931.html

14-10-2021||Bangalore||Rain lashes Bengaluru, several areas flooded as Madiwala lake overflow||The Madiwala lake in Karnataka's Bengaluru on Thursday overflowed as heavy rainfall lashed the city, leading to flood-like situations in several areas including BTM Layout, HSR Layout, Anugraha Layout and Madiwala. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places over Karnataka for the next three days.On Wednesday, a four-storey building in Bengaluru's Mahalakshmi Layout limits was demolished by the civic authorities after it started tilting following the heavy rain. This is the fourth building collapse incident in Bengaluru in a little over two weeks. Residents of the building were evacuated to safety and the municipality was alerted on Tuesday night when it started tilting.According to experts, the rapid and unplanned expansion of Bengaluru has led to encroachment of lakes and stormwater drains (SWD) that lead to flooding in these parts. Residents have also raised complaints regarding the constant digging roads, saying it makes it difficult even to commute.Meanwhile, Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Tuesday said 21 people have died due to rains since early this month. Bommai said that the local administration has been directed to provide compensation to the rain-hit families. About 2,500 houses have also been partially damaged, he also informed, adding, further assessment is on.About 2,300 electricity poles have been damaged but the chief minister promised he will ensure there are no power cuts. Roads, bridges and school buildings have also been damaged in the rain.After taking stock of the situation, the chief minister also informed that the state recorded 30-50 per cent excess rain in October so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/rain-lashes-bengaluru-several-areas-flooded-as-madiwala-lake-overflow-101634190701912.html

14-10-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A room of his own, his dream||He is 23. He has a dream. “I want to live in a house that has more than one room,” says Muhammed Anas. A bangle seller, he has spent all his years, so far, in a single-room house in Old Delhi’s Pahari Rajaan. This slow afternoon, while waiting for customers at his shop near Khajoor Wali Masjid (the khajoor tree vanished long ago), Mr Anas tells of his present house, as well as about the dream home in which he wishes to spend the rest of his life.On his present house:“It’s not really a room but a large hall on the ground floor, with a kitchen and a bathroom. We live across the lane from a meat shop. My late father bought the house some 30 years ago. Six of us are living in it—my mother, my sister, and we four brothers. The house has two beds, one small dining table, a fridge, a LED TV, and a window AC. In case of a power failure, there is ghup andhera (pitch darkness) inside even at midday—because there is no window! I feel no air, no oxygen in our home. I’m lucky to be able to spend the entire day in the shop. Sometimes, while at home, I pass the time looking at the walls, which are covered with photos of our family trips to various dargahs in Delhi and in other cities. Once we went to Haji Ali’s shrine in Mumbai. We also have many pictures of our trip to Kashmir.”On his “khwabgah,” his dream home:“It has to be within our Old Delhi, because we are proper Purani Dilli wale and will never leave this area. I’ll prefer Daryaganj’s Lal Wali Gali, which is a very spacious street. There one easily sees the sky, unlike in Pahari Rajaan where I live. Ours will be a top floor flat and will have five rooms, one for each brother, and one for our mother (our sister will hopefully be married by then). Every room will be fitted with a window. Despite living in a bigger house, we will remain a closely knit family. All things will stay the same, except for the fact that at night we will not sleep in the same room.”Mr Anas now falls silent. He will shut the shop at 9pm after which he will walk back home. Post-dinner, he will hang out with friends along the neighbourhood’s crowded alleys. (That’s his daily routine.) He will return by midnight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-room-of-his-own-his-dream-101634165158093.html
14-10-2021||Delhi||Gangster Gogi knew of plots to kill him in court||Gangster Jitender Gogi, who was shot dead in a shocking and sensational killing in the Rohini court by his rivals last month, knew that there was a threat to his life every time he went to the court premises, and specifically of at least two previous attempts, according to people aware of the matter and official documents reviewed by HT.Gogi, 30, made these revelations in his last confession, recorded four months before he was shot 18 times in courtroom number 207 on September 24 by members suspected to be from the Tillu Tajpuria gang.His 30-page confession also details his life in crime going back to when he was just 17.According to the confession, Gogi said that the first plan to kill him at Rohini court was hatched in March 2013, when, a day before the hearing, he got a tip-off that his rival Tillu Tajpuria (actual name Sunil Maan) would be waiting to murder him when the police brought him to the court premises. Gogi claimed he survived because he gathered “more than 40-50 men as his security guards” to escort him to the court, and Tajpuria’s plan could not be carried out.“In 2013, an informer told me that I would be murdered in Rohini jail by Tillu. So, on the date of hearing, I went to the court along with gang members Jelly, Gullu, Yogesh, Monu Nepali, Rohit Moi, Monu, Digvijay Saroha alias Nanu, Monu Nepali, Rohit Moi and about 40 more boys. We spotted Amit alias Dabang of the Tillu gang at gate number 5. Tillu, Sannata, Umesh Kala, Deepak alias Raju, Chigla and total around 9-10 boys were standing on the stairs of the court.”At the court, Gogi said that while his henchmen outnumbered Tajpuria’s gang, two members of their gangs clashed, and a pistol belonging to one of Gogi’s gang member’s fell on the ground, and went off accidentally. Gogi claimed that Tajpuria and his gang fled the spot.The second such attempt, he told police, was in 2016 when Gogi was in Rohini jail. This time, after learning that Tajpuria was planning to kill him in court the next day, Gogi fled custody before reaching the court.On July 30, 2016, when a police team was taking him to the Jind court for a hearing in a government public transport bus, his accomplices in two different cars -- a Hyundai I 20 and a Maruti SX4 -- stopped the bus at Bahadurgarh. Other gang members inside the bus (posing as passengers) assaulted the police personnel, and then snatched their MP-4 guns, helping Gogi escape.HT has seen a copy of the confession, recorded on April 8 , after police registered a new case against Gogi and his gang members under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (Mcoca) to rein in its organised crime network.A senior officer of the special cell, which is probing Gogi’s case, said, “Gogi may have died but there are many members of his gang who benefitted financially from the crimes they committed. The investigation against them will continue. Also, a special cell team was accompanying Gogi on the day of the murder and also shot the two gunmen dead within seconds that morning.”In his confession, Gogi, for the first time, also revealed that his first brush with crime was not at the Swami Shraddhanand College in 2010 after a dispute with Tajpuria during the college elections as is widely believed.At 17, he confessed that he “broke open a man’s head” after a quarrel between his mother and a neighbour. Gogi’s mother and elder brother were convicted for a year in the case, but Gogi was released in days because he was a minor. This case was never reported papers because the law does not permit police to release the records of juvenile offenders.Gogi and Tajpuria, who were once friends, later got embroiled in a bloody gang war that has resulted in the death of over two dozen men from both gangs in the last decade. Gogi’s murder in the Rohini courtroom on September 24, was the last confirmed death in this crime saga.On Monday, another member of Tajpuria gang was shot dead in Rohini. Delhi Police, which is on high alert after Gogi’s murder, are checking if the murder is related to Gogi’s killing.Police have arrested four people, including Tillu Tajpuria, for Gogi’s murder. Police said that Tajpuria and other gangsters hired gunmen who posed as lawyers on the morning of September 24; entered the courtroom; waited for an hour inside, and then shot Gogi dead within a minute of his entering the courtroom.Ironically, one of the murders planned by the Gogi gang, too, was in this same court and carried out the same way. On January 16, 2018 one of Gogi’s associates posed as a lawyer, and entered the Rohini court to kill a rival Ravi Bhardwaj. Though the plot could not be executed, Gogi’s men followed Bhardwaj and shot him 15 times outside a local eatery.LN Rao, who retired as the special cell’s deputy commissioner of police, after working in the Delhi police for over three decades said, “Attacking rivals during their court production is relatively easy. The date of the court production, the route which they take and the specific courts that prisoners have to attend is known.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gangster-gogi-knew-of-plots-to-kill-him-in-court-101634163265409.html
14-10-2021||Bhopal||MP govt defers bull castration drive amid opposition||The Madhya Pradesh government on Wednesday deferred a drive to castrate 1.2 million bulls of the so-called nondescript variety after BJP member of Parliament from state capital Bhopal, Pragya Thakur, and leaders of the opposition Congress demanding that the move be scrapped, claiming, erroneously, that it could harm efforts to increase the population of indigenous varieties.Cattle belong to non-descript breeds are not of any particular strain and the cows of this variety are usually very low producers of milk.According to the state’s livestock count, Madhya Pradesh has 29 million bovines (18.7 million cows and 10.3 million buffaloes) , 9.73% of the total population of bovines in India in 2019. The state’s bovine population has increased by over 2.5 million since 2017. In terms of milk production , MP stands third in 2020-21 after Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan with 17.1 million tonnes of production; it accounts for 7% of the total milk production in the country, according to the ministry of food processing.Castration driveAccording to the state, at least 2.6 million bulls were castrated over the past three years in Madhya Pradesh. However, there are still close to 4 million nondescript bulls and their population is increasing every year. The high number was behind the animal husbandry department proposing a massive castration drive.“The reason behind poor yield of milk is that more than 80% of total population of cows belong to nondescript (not well defined breeds). When nondescript bulls mate with cows, the result is usually nondescript calves of either sex. The cows so produced give just around one litre milk per day. When farmers fail to realise the money of cow feed from milk production, they are compelled to abandon them,” said JN Kansotia, additional chief secretary animal husbandry department, MP.To control the rising population of nondescript cattle, the department proposed a mass castration drive to be held between October 4 and 23.Kansotia added that the department is trying to improve the quality of cows through artificial insemination but using semen of Indian breeds only. “This drive is to stop the increase of population of nondescript cattle, not to promote any foreign breed but some people misguided MP Pragya Thakur about it and we tried to explain the same to her on Wednesday,” he said. He added that the drive has been abandoned for now.Improving milk yield of the cows is part of the central government’s programme to improve farm incomes . Niti Aayog estimated in 2017 that farm incomes can double by 2022 if income from cattle and poultry increased by at least 60%. And, for that, experts say, states need to control the rising population of nondescript bulls.The controversyEarlier, Thakur spoke to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan protesting against the drive, calling it “an act against nature” and saying it was aimed to end the breed of Indian cows and invoked Hindu God Shiva in her claim. Shiva’s steed is the bull. “...I objected to it and talked with the chief minister that it will finish the population of many Indian breeds and promote foreign breeds.”Thakur got support from an unlikely quarter, the opposition Congress. spokesperson Narendra Saluja said the order clearly showed that the government is against Indian breed of cows and wants to finish them off.BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal, however, defended the government and said, “The state government takes any decision for the welfare of cows so we shouldn’t interfere in the working of the government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-govt-defers-bull-castration-drive-amid-opposition-101634159245776.html

The duo were killed two days after Makhan Lal Bindroo, a 68-year-old chemist, street vendor Virender Paswan from Bihar’s Bhagalpur, and Muhammad Shafi Lone, a taxi driver, were shot dead in Srinagar and Bandipora districts on October 5. On October 3, two persons were killed in two separate incidents in Srinagar.Abdullah reminded that when people left from J&K, Sikh community remained here.“It was you. We have to live here and die here. And I am proud of that. You gave me confidence that time,” he said.He said that the killers did not serve any religion by killing innocents. “A teacher would teach our children and show them the path. Killing her and then thinking that they are serving Islam. No, they are definitely serving the devil,” he said.“The devil will go into hell and they will also go into hell,” he said.The senior leader said that the whole country is “burning”. “Attempts are being made to divide us . But those who are doing this won’t be successful. For some time we will get a setback but the almighty won’t allow them to succeed. Those who are doing it will get some benefit for the time being but will ultimately perish ,” he said.Later while talking to media persons on the targeted killings, Abdullah said that all the Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs and Christians have to fight the perpetrators together.“We have to live courageously and not fear them. They will never succeed. Whatever they are thinking they will fail. But all of us have to stand strong – Muslims, Sikhs, Hindus and Christian. Whosoever we are, we have to stand together to fight them,” he said.He said that a storm of communal divide is emerging in India where Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs are being divided. “And this politics of division needs to be stopped. If it is not stopped then the Indian won’t survive. If India has to be saved then we have to live together and only then India will progress forward,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jammu-and-kashmir-will-never-become-a-part-of-pakistan-farooq-on-kashmir-killings-101634159802293.html
14-10-2021||Chandigarh||NGT denies permission to Himachal HC for reconstruction of its old building in Shimla||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has denied permission to the Himachal Pradesh High Court for reconstruction of its old building block saying that construction in core area of Shimla is a serious hazard to public safety and environment.A bench of NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said, undoubtedly, the requirement of the High Court is highest priority but in view of danger to the public safety, it cannot modify its earlier order.With regard to the recommendation of the supervisory committee, constituted by NGT, the tribunal said it has merely considered the exceptional requirement but not the issue of public safety and desirability of prohibiting constructions in view of vulnerability of the area.“Constructions in core areas of Shimla being serious hazard to public safety and environment, any modification as suggested in the application will not be viable,” the bench said in its October 8 order.The NGT was hearing a fresh plea filed by a Himachal Pradesh High Court in a decided matter to permit reconstruction of its old building block which is in the core area of Shimla, by modifying its November 16, 2017 order. The NGT in 2017 had banned all construction, residential or commercial, in any part of the “green, forest and core areas” of Himachal Pradesh and within three metres of the national highways.It had also formed the supervisory committee to consider and evaluate the need for construction of buildings of exceptional nature and make recommendations, if necessary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ngt-denies-permission-to-himachal-hc-for-reconstruction-of-its-old-building-in-shimla-101634159622397.html

Vaccines have been administered to the entire eligible population,” said Kinnaur DC Abid Husain Sadiq. The administration had set a target to administer two doses of vaccines to 60,305 people. He said that health workers trekked through the mountains to vaccinate a sizeable number of shepherds in the pasture land and also in the small dogris (isolated houses in the orchards. Himachal Pradesh government had in August announced that it has met its 100% first dose vaccination target against Covid-19 for all above 18 years. Meanwhile, Jammu and Kashmir recorded 75 fresh Covid-19 cases on Wednesday. Also, for the seventh consecutive day, no death caused by the virus was reported. Of the total cases, 60 cases were reported in Kashmir valley while the Jammu division saw 15 infections. The number of patients who were cured in the UT was 122 with active cases reaching 946.The government’s daily health bulletin also said that 16 districts of the UT — Rajouri, Poonch, Ramban, Samba, Jammu, Doda, Kathua, Baramulla, Srinagar, Anantnag, Shopian, Budgam, Bandipora, Kulgam, Pulwama and Ganderbal — have managed to vaccinate 100% of its adult population with the first dose after more than 96,550 vaccines were administered on Wednesday.

14-10-2021||Chandigarh||HP bypolls: BJP expels Chetan Bragta||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday expelled Chetan Bragta, the convener of its IT cell, for a period of six-year for contesting the byelection against the party’s official candidate in Jubbal and Kotkhai assembly segment, said party’s office secretary Pyar Singh in a press release issued here. Earlier, the state party chief, Suresh Kashyap, said that he himself had spoken to Bragta many times and urged him to withdraw his name. “The decision against allocating tickets to the kin of deceased leaders was made by the central high command,” he added. Now, the contest in the apple affluent Jubbal and Kotkhai segment will be a triangular one. There are four candidates in fray, but the major competition is between Congress’ Rohit Thakur, BJP’s Neelam Seraik and Independent Chetan Bragta, who’s the eldest son of former horticulture minister Narendra Bragta, a popular leader in the region. Narendra Bragta, who had been a minister twice, was the chief whip of the party with a cabinet rank when he died due to post-Covid complication in June this year. Narendra is largely credited for strengthening the apple economy in the state. Soon after his death, the party projected Chetan as his apparent political successor and asked him to step into campaign field. Chetan remained at the forefront of electioneering with the party’s ministers who repeatedly toured the constituency. As many as seven ministers, including CM Jai Ram Thakur, were canvassing in the Jubbal-Kotkhai segment to improve prospects of the party. However, the BJP’s central election committee took the principal decision to discourage dynastic politics while selecting candidates. The party denied ticket to Chetan and preferred Neelam over him. She has been a three-time zila parishad member from Tharola ward and pradhan from Baghan panchayat. She has served the party in different capacities. Chetan’s candidature has now added difficulties to the BJP as majority of the party cadres and office-bearers of the block unit are supporting with him. The party is also likely to take action against the office-bearers and workers who ‘defied’ the party dictates in Jubbal and Kotkhai.“My father lived for apples and served the party for many years. I will work towards strengthening the horticulture economy besides development of the area. I will live up to the dreams of my father,” Chetan said. “Fortunately, I have been allotted apple as my election symbol,” he said, adding that he didn’t want to comment on what the BJP did to him. “That chapter is closed now. All I know is that there was a big conspiracy against me,” Chetan said. The party had placated Govind Ram Sharma, former legislator from Arki, who was demanding a ticket. The party had denied ticket to Govind in 2017 and pitted Rattan Pal Singh against former CM Virbhadra Singh who shifted to Arki after vacating Shimla Rural seat for his son Vikramaditya Singh. Despite repeated persuasion, Sharma has refused to campaign for the party nominee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hp-bypolls-bjp-expels-chetan-bragta-101634159082148.html
14-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ashu, Ludhiana mayor hand in glove with advertisement mafia: SAD||Accusing cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and mayor Balkar Sandhu of being hand in glove with advertisement ‘mafia’, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) led by former cabinet minister and SAD-BSP candidate from Ludhiana west, Maheshinder Singh Grewal criticised the Congress leaders for causing a revenue loss of crores to the state exchequer/municipal corporation (MC) by benefitting the outdoor advertisement contractor in the city. Addressing a press conference at his residence in Model Town area on Wednesday, Grewal claimed that the advertisement contractor had been given an annual relief of ₹9 crore in the advertisement contract for seven years citing the pandemic. As per the original contract, the contractor had to pay ₹23 crores as annual fee, but the fee has now been reduced to around 14 crores. Further, he alleged that the government was paying ₹32,000 per month for every board installed in the city to the contractor for government advertisements. However, the contractor was only paying ₹16,000 for every board to the MC. The MC is also not auctioning the vacant advertisement media/furniture in the city to benefit the contractor.Accusing minister Ashu’s wife, councillor Mamta Ashu of allegedly exercising extra-constitutional powers in the MC, Grewal also accused the MC of adopting a pick-and-choose policy while removing illegal hoardings from the city. Grewal statd that Ludhiana MC has turned into ‘Corporation of scams’ under the congress rule. However, refuting the allegations, the mayor said the relief had been provided by the state government. “Many other sectors have also been provided relief due to the pandemic and the MC has no role in the same,” he said.The state government had directly approached the contractor for government advertisement and the MC recovers the amount from the contract as per the contract, he added.The minister could not be reached for comments despite repeated attempts.Grewal making derogatory remarks: CouncillorPosting a video on social media, councillor Mamta Ashu accused Grewal of making derogatory remarks against her during the press conference. She said,” During the conference, Grewal said that one Mamta Ashu, who claims to be the wife of minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu.” Does this show the mentality of Grewal towards the opposite gender, questioned Mamta.Speaking on the allegations of issuing orders to MC officials, Mamta said she did not issue any orders, rather appealed to the MC and Congress supporters to remove illegal hoardings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ashu-ludhiana-mayor-hand-in-glove-with-advertisement-mafia-sad-101634157341978.html

14-10-2021||Chandigarh||Victim had saved motorist’s life hours before being shot dead by his brother in Ludhiana||Hours before being killed by his brother over a property dispute, Gagandeep Singh had arranged for an ambulance for a motorist who had met with an accident on Dugri Road on Monday evening. Little did he know that another ambulance would be ferrying him to the hospital later in the day. It was the Molotov cocktail of a property dispute, the presence of a weapon, and a short temper that led to a brother snuffing the life out of his sibling. A pall of gloom has descended on the victim’s house in Basant Avenue. Friends and families of the victims are in a sate of disbelief and say the brothers shared a “very strong bond and it boggles the mind that one would kill the other over a property dispute.” While the victim’s eight-year-old daughter is inconsolable, his widow, Rupinder Kaur, an eyewitness, is in a state of abject shock. The victim’s father Harjeet Singh, the owner of a chain of bakeries, is devastated by the tragedy that had befallen both his sons. Life had been good until a few yeas ago when Harjeet Singh had been running a flourishing bakery business near Deepak Cinema. However, the chasm between the father and son widened as Palwinder was more interested in politics. Later, Harjeet and the victim decided to shift and began running a bakery on Dugri Road. Meanwhile, the bakery business run by Palwinder near Deepak Cinema crashed, and the division of property, in which Palwinder felt he had received the short end of the stick brought things to a head. Both brothers short-tempered: Family friends Family, friends and relatives, who were visiting the family to express their condolences said the presence of the firearm in the house had led to the regrettable outcome. A family friend, requesting anonymity, said, “Both brothers were short tempered and would lose their cool at the slightest provocation. Had there been no fire arm, the maximum the brothers could have done was to injure each other in a fight. The presence of a firearm in the house has led to an irreparable loss. Now, one brother is dead and the other jailed, neither has any use for the property.” As condolences poured in on social media, friends re-shared old posts of Palwinder ironically wishing a long life for his brother, whose birthday was in 22 days. however, it was not to be. Station house officer Jasdev Singh said the accused was presented before a court and sent to a two-day police remand. “We are yet to recover the weapon that was used in the crime,” said station house officer Jasdev Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/victim-had-saved-motorist-s-life-hours-before-being-shot-dead-by-his-brother-in-ludhiana-101634156861995.html

The minister also directed officials to work on Saturdays and open all 32 driving-test tracks till the pending cases of driving licences are settled. Instructing the officials of Chandigarh-based centralised company “Smart Chip”, which provides smart driving licences, to meet the deadline of three days, Raja Warring asked the transports department to impose a penalty on the company in case of delay in issuing licences. The minister also asked postal authorities to explore modalities to increase the time of receiving licences from post offices from 7 days to 15 days, adding that there will be a significant reduction in complaints. The transport minister, after resolving the complaints, called up Jagbir Singh of Issru village of Ludhiana district and Avinash Goyal of Budhlada in Mansa district and informed them of the status of their registration certificates.

14-10-2021||Chandigarh||Uncertainty prevails over firecracker wholesalers in Ludhiana||The ban on sale of firecrackers in Delhi and Chandigarh has put Ludhiana-based wholesalers in a fix with Dussehra and Diwali, the most profitable festivals, just around the corner. It does not matter that Punjab has not banned sales as the businessmen feel the ongoing farmer agitation and the pandemic have caused a slump in the business.Wholesalers say that on the directions of the Punjab and Haryana high court in the past, the number of licences issued in the city has already been reduced and they can only set shop a week before Diwali, as opposed to a month before the festival of lights as was done before. A wholesaler, Tribhuvan Thapar, said, “Earlier, 66 licences had been issued for setting up a firecracker market in the Grain Market near Jalandhar bypass. However, after the court’s directions, only 40 licences have been issued in the city, and only 13 sellers will be able to setup vends at the grain market.”The wholesalers say they have already made huge investments and may run into losses if sales do not pick up. “Our business has been going through a slump for the last few years,” said Thapar.They have demanded that the validity of licences should be increased, and a few permanent markets be alloted in the city for the sale of firecrackers.People may not buy crackers due to financial constraintsWholesaler Ramesh Aggarwal said financial constraints and rising inflation amid the pandemic are also a major concern as the public will not purchase crackers. There is uncertainty in the market and we cannot predict the response we will receive this year. “Each year, the craze for firecrackers reduces among the youth, and this year people will not purchase firecrackers in solidarity with the farmers’ stir.”Another wholesaler, Taranjit Singh Bunty, said the administration may carry out a draw of lots for providing licences on October 25 this year, following which the markets will be established. “The administration should allot the licences a little earlier this year, so that the business can get back on track.Joint commissioner of police (headquarters) J Elanchezhian said no fresh directions have been issued by the state government regarding the trade and use of firecrackers and licences will be issued for sale of crackers in the coming time, as per the instructions received from the state. “The process to allot the licences will begin in a few days,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/uncertainty-prevails-over-firecracker-wholesalers-in-ludhiana-101634156202663.html
14-10-2021||Chandigarh||Behbal Kalan firing anniversary: Govts only formed probe panels, justice remains elusive after 6 years: Victims’ families||The families of Gurjeet Singh and Krishan Bhagwan Singh, who were killed in the police firing at Faridkot district’s Behbal Kalan on October 14, 2015, say that the Shiromani Akali Dal and the Congress governments in Punjab have only formed probe panels and justice remains elusive even after six years of the incident. The trial in the case is yet to start in the court, they rued. Sukhraj Singh, son of Krishan Bhagwan of Niamiwala village who along with Gurjeet of Sarawan village was protesting against the desecration of Guru Granth Sahib at Bargari village two days earlier, said, “During the 2017 assembly elections, the Congress promised justice in the police firing cases but it failed to provide justice even after remaining in power for more than four years. Replacing Amarinder Singh with Charanjit Singh Channi as chief minister is merely an eyewash as there is no change in the situation. Even now, the counsel of the accused (former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini) was appointed as advocate general. How do we expect justice?” Krishan Bhagwan and Gurjeet had joined the villagers in holding a demonstration at the Behbal Kalan bus stand. The trial, Sukhraj added, has not even started in the Faridkot court so far as charges were not framed against the accused even more than two years after filing of the first chargesheet. “Moreover, the Punjab and Haryana high court has stayed proceedings against Saini. So, I doubt there will be any significant development in this case,” he said. They are going to hold ‘shaheedi samagam’ (martyrdom congregation) at Bargari on Thursday, he said, adding that they will not allow political parties to participate in the event. Disappointed over delay in delivery of justice, Gurjeet’s father Sadhu Singh said political parties are again playing politics over the sacrilege and firing incidents. “They are just running for political gains but I am the one who lost a son. Even after six years, those responsible for this are roaming freely. I have lost all the hope for justice now,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/behbal-kalan-firing-anniversary-govts-only-formed-probe-panels-justice-remains-elusive-after-6-years-victims-families-101634155791899.html

The accused, Chandar Kanta, 74, of Sardar Nagar, and her son Monu alias lovely, 36, had been arrested with 70g heroin, 1,500 intoxicant pills, five mobile phones, an electronic weighing machine, a scooter and two toy pistols on April 3.  The police had claimed that the accused had been arrested from Sardar Nagar after receiving a tip-off, when they were crossing the area on a scooter. However, the CCTV footage allegedly shows that Monu had been arrested from a Shivpuri locality, at a time when his mother was not accompanying him.Accused lost hand in a mishap The complainant, Arun Kumar of Shimla Colony, who is Chandar Kanta’s younger son, said the polices aid his mother was sitting on the pillion with a packet of drugs in her hand. However, his mother had lost her left hand in a road mishap and as a septuagenarian she could not sit without either holding the scooter or the person riding the scooter, thus she could not be holding the drugs as claimed by the police. He alleged the police had framed his elderly mother for arguing with the police officials and said that he had also raised the matter before the then commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal, who had marked a probe to additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, city 1) Pragya Jain, but to no avail.He also claimed that on April 3, his brother was in Shivpuri in the house of one of his friends. The police had nabbed him from Shivpuri. The police personnel were captured in the CCTVs installed in the street while arresting and taking away his brother and later implicated him and his mother in the drug peddling case.“I have submitted the CCTV footage to the police, but no progress has been made in six months,” he said. When contacted, ADCP Pragya Jain said the matter is under investigation and they will take appropriate action as per the report.Déjà vuIn a similar case, sub-inspector Simranjit Kaur, the former Meharban station house officer, had been suspended for implicating a man in a drug peddling case and the police had also initiated the process to cancel the FIR.

14-10-2021||Chandigarh||Political slugfest in Punjab over BSF’s new jurisdiction||Chandigarh/Amritsar Political leaders from Punjab, including chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, on Wednesday reacted sharply to denounce the Centre’s move to widen the jurisdiction of Border Security Force (BSF) for seizure, search and arrest up to 50km from the international border with Pakistan. Other than the BJP leaders who hailed the move, former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh was the only exception to support the step.“I strongly condemn the GoI’s unilateral decision to give additional powers to BSF within 50 KM belt running along the international borders, which is a direct attack on the federalism. I urge the Union Home Minister @AmitShah to immediately roll back this irrational decision (sic),” Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Chani tweeted. “It’s an attack on federalism and an unseen emergency,” said deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa who holds home portfolio, asking the Union home minister Amit Shah to withdraw the decision. He clarified that the chief minister never asked the Centre for enhancing the BSF’s jurisdiction in Punjab. “Without obtaining the concurrence of the state government, the amendment in the law amounts to encroachment on the powers of the states,” added Randhawa. Earlier, in a tweet, senior Congress leader Sunil Jakhar had taken a dig at the chief minister over the issue. “Be careful what you ask for! Has @CHARANJITCHANNI unwittingly managed to hand over half of Punjab to Central govt. 25000sq km (out of total 50,000sq km) has now been placed under BSF jurisdiction. Punjab Police stands castigated. Do we still want more autonomy to States (sic)?” he tweeted. Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) described the move to hand over almost half of the state to the BSF akin to “imposition of the President’s rule through back door”. This virtually turns the state into a de-facto Union Territory and the devious attempt to place the state under the central rule will be opposed, a party statement said. “It is most unlikely that the Centre would have taken such a drastic decision without the prior consent of the state government and all the noise which Channi and his colleagues are making is an attempt to hide their complicity in this decision,” party chief Sukhbir Singh Badal said in a statement. He said chief minister Channi’s unscheduled meeting with Amit Shah last week apparently cleared the decks for the “dangerous move. However, former Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh supported the move. His media adviser Raveen Thukral in a message on Twitter quoted him saying, “Our soldiers are being killed in Kashmir. We’re seeing more & more weapons and drugs being pushed by Pak-backed terrorists into Punjab. BSF’s enhanced presence & powers will only make us stronger. Let’s not drag central forces into politics”. He further quoted the ex-CM: “partisan considerations can’t and shouldn’t dictate our stand on issues of national security. I’d said that at the time of 2016 surgical strikes and am saying it again; we have to rise above politics when India’s security is at stake, as it is now.” BJP national general secretary Subhash Sharma said national security was of utmost importance and leaders should refrain from politicising the issue. “Keeping in view of the drones entering Punjab from Pakistan, former chief minister Amarinder Singh had on record termed the situation dangerous. In the past few months, many terrorist modules have been busted that shows the seriousness of the situation in the border state,” he said. “We hope that political parties would rise above their political interests and not create a precarious situation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/political-slugfest-in-punjab-over-bsf-s-new-jurisdiction-101634155601964.html

During the corresponding time last year, the state had a stock of about 3.5 lakh tonne DAP.Agriculture minister Randeep Singh Nabha, said, “I have sought time from the Union minister for chemicals and fertilisers. I will hopefully meet him this week and request him for adequate supply of DAP.” “DAP is an essential input for ensuing optimum productivity of wheat and it is to be applied at the time of sowing,” the agriculture minister said in a demi-official letter to the central minister.” “In Punjab, wheat is sown over 35 lakh hectares. Potato sowing has also started, for which at least two quintal per hectare DAP is needed and for wheat, the per hectare requirement is one quintal,” it was further stated. After Punjab government took up the matter with Centre, an allocation of 2 lakh tonne was made. An official with the state agricultural department revealed that the usually, the department starts building stocks in the months of August and September, and Markfed is the state agency that procures DAP. “This year too, Markfed tried to buy stocks but owing to fluctuation in prices in the international market and the policy of subsidy that ended on September 30, Markfed could not buy the stocks,” said the officer. In the previous season, DAP was imported from China, however, this year, most of the stocks are coming from the United States. The Centre may have assured Punjab for timely supply of stocks, but it takes 10-15 days for the stocks to reach the state. “How will the Centre fulfill the state’s demand in such a short span? The only saving grace is that paddy harvesting has been delayed by a week to ten days’ this time due to late rainfall. So we hope that by then, the DAP supplies will start reaching the farmers,” the official further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-short-of-4-8-lakh-tonne-dap-ahead-of-wheat-sowing-season-101634155543407.html
14-10-2021||Mumbai||BMC plans to generate electricity by putting up solar panels along Mumbai Coastal Road||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has plans to generate electricity from the 10-km-long stretch of Mumbai Coastal Road Project by setting up solar panels.State environment minister and Mumbai suburban guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray has asked the BMC to identify space for installing solar panels on the coastal road project between Nariman Point and Worli that has been under construction since October 2018. According to the plan, the BMC will have to identify space on the cycle track or median (divider) that will be constructed as part of the ongoing Coastal Road project. The plan was revealed by Thackeray last week at the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) relating to climate change along with BMC officials.Thackeray told HT, “The Coastal Road will have more than 90 hectares of green space. We want to have carbon sequestration by means of multiple measures. The first and foremost is we would be having a global call for design for landscape and trees to have dense urban forest, enough for carbon capture. There is already a cycle track and walking pathway, along with a huge promenade towards the sea, and I have asked the BMC to explore the idea to have solar panels either over the cycle track or the median to see if we can generate solar energy.”Thackeray added, “However, none of the open space would be encroached on by the solar panels. For Mumbai- Nagpur, I have pitched for solar farms along the Highway alignment, because of which we would have the potential of 250 mw generated. This is different, we may give the electricity to the grid as well.”Similarly, the Maharashtra State Development Corporation (MSRDC) which is constructing the Mumbai-Nagpur Expressway has proposed to install solar panels on the Expressway which is expected to be thrown open fully next year. The plan to install solar panels was mooted by the MSRDC in July 2016. Mumbai Coastal Road might be the first intra-city road to have solar panels generating electricity for public consumption. A month ago, National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) also signed an MoU with Energy Efficiency Services Ltd.(EESL) to conduct feasibility studies of establishment of Solar Power projects on the available vacant land parcels with NHAI and rooftops of NHAI buildings/ structures at Toll Plaza and other NHAI owned buildings/ structures.In Mumbai, the Coastal Road will be the first intra-city road to get solar panels and later other arterial roads also might be considered. However, currently the BMC’s focus when it comes to the 2,000-km-long road network it handles in the city is to concretise around 80% of the total road network in the next six to seven years to bring down the menace of potholes. Mumbai-based architect Rahul Kadri of IMK Architects who is working with the BMC on the Malabar Hill walkway project said, “It is a good idea to have solar panels say on the cycle track, medians, on top of the tunnels or on the entrance of the tunnel when it comes to Coastal Road project. This will go with the design also. However, the solar panels should not be installed on green space considering that space will not be usable later.”The construction work of the ₹12,700 crore coastal road was started in October 2018, and since then the project has been headlines for environmental issues. In July 2019, the Bombay high court (HC) put a stay on the project citing that it needed to have environmental clearances. The coastal road project measuring around 10km between Princess Street flyover and Worli-end of Bandra-Worli sea link was earlier expected to be ready by July 2023. However, owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, which initially delayed the delivery of the Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) from China. Also, the BMC had to tweak its plan to not use Chinese experts for the assembling of the TBM in the backdrop of border tensions between India and China.Currently, the BMC has completed over 40% of the civil works for the Coastal Road Project and over 1-km tunnel works out of the total 1.9-km tunneling is completed. The BMC recently also appointed Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) for carrying out a comprehensive scientific survey to scrutinise the loss of lives of the fishing communities due to the ongoing Coastal Road Project.Meanwhile, the coastal road project was originally planned between Nariman Point and Kandivali, claiming it will ease traffic for those travelling between north and south Mumbai. However, now there is a question whether there should be a coastal road or a sea link beyond Versova to connect to the suburbs. The state is yet to take a call on it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-plans-to-generate-electricity-by-putting-up-solar-panels-along-mumbai-coastal-road-101634155542035.html

Investigating officer Avtar Singh said the girl’s parents were migrant workers who worked at factory unit in the locality and had left their daughter with a relative living in the area, while they went to work. However, their daughter was nowhere to be found when they returned. Desperate inquiries to neighbours, relatives and acquaintances bore no results and the family registered a complaint with the police the next day. Police said the girl had lost her way, while playing with children in the locality and had reached Dholewal Chowk where a woman spotted her and gave her shelter.“We had learnt that a woman in the Dholewal area had rescued a child and after we ascertained that she was indeed the child that had gone missing from Vijay Nagar, she was handed over to her parents,” the police said, adding that the girl’s parents said they had to leave their child in the care of a relative as they both needed to earn to run the house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/day-on-missing-three-year-old-reunited-with-family-in-ludhiana-101634155423162.html
14-10-2021||Chandigarh||Call records belie Punjab cops’ claim, high court grants bail to 2 drug case accused||The Punjab and Haryana high court has granted bail to two persons accused in a Faridkot drug seizure case upon finding that the call records of a deputy superintendent of police (DSP) and a sub-inspector (SI) did not match with the location they showed as place of arrest. The bench of Justice Gurvinder Singh also directed the trial court that it should scrutinise the evidence meticulously as “some kind of doubt in the conduct of the police has been created”. The court was dealing with two bail petitions of Sahil Kumar and Ajay Kumar Jindal and another plea from Sahil’s brother seeking transfer of the probe to the CBI in the case registered on November 11, 2020 at Kotkapura police station. The police had claimed that synthetic drugs were seized from Sahil and Jindal was arrested on his disclosure statement. Sahil was purportedly arrested by SI Kulbir Singh in the presence of DSP Jaspal Singh, according to the FIR. Sahil’s counsel had produced in the court both the officers’ call records that showed neither the SI nor the DSP were in the places of arrest at the time. He had argued that no disclosure statement was given to police and that it was a false implication upon his vehicle hitting a car with some police officials, which was being driven by SHO, Sanjeev Kumar. Jindal’s counsel had claimed that he was falsely implicated by SI Kulbir Singh in another drug seizure case in December 2019. The trial court had asked police to preserve the CCTV footage of police station on the date of arrest. But the order was not complied with. In a subsequent inquiry he was exonerated. It was also informed that in March 2020 he moved the high court seeking action against the SI for false implication. “The police will also be required to explain their conduct, particularly with regards to their failure to preserve the CCTV footage despite the trial court order,” the HC bench said. It, however, declined to the transfer the probe to the CBI since chargesheet had been presented.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/call-records-belie-claims-of-punjab-cops-high-court-grants-bail-to-2-drug-case-accused-101634155421852.html
14-10-2021||Chandigarh||PAU experts confirm efficacy of mating-disruption technique to prevent pink bollworm in cotton||After two years of field studies conducted by Punjab Agriculture University (PAU), experts have expressed confidence in the efficacy of the innovative ‘mating-disruption technique’ (MDT) in preventing the attack of the deadly pink bollworm (PBW) in cotton crop.After the worst-ever attack of PBW this year, Punjab government has decided to adopt MDT as an integrated pest management solution from the next kharif sowing season.Following approval by the Central Insecticide Board (CIB) of the union ministry of agriculture and farmers’ welfare, MDT was tested in several parts of the country over the last year including, at PAU’s research farms in Bathinda and Faridkot.Principal entomologist of PAU, Vijay Kumar said the results in the last two seasons were overwhelming. MDT involves the application of a pea size of pheromone paste on cotton plants. It is recommended to put the paste at 400 spots per acre.He said MDT is an advanced technology of the currently used pheromone trap, which contains chemicals secreted by insects to lure male moths. These traps mainly help in identifying the presence of PBM in the fields.“A pheromone scent in MDT confuses the male adults, preventing them from finding and mating with female adults and reduces the number of eggs laid and PBW population in subsequent generations. It was observed that the first application of the bio-safe paste should be made after 50-55 days of sowing. Next two applications should be done after a period of 30 days each. For best results, the maximum area should be covered to ensure that moths do not invade from the adjoining unprotected fields,” said Kumar.State agriculture minister Randeep Singh Nabha said it must be accepted that PBW is now a major threat to cotton in Punjab and ways should be explored to contain it.“MDT is a simple safeguard that costs about ₹1,200 per acre and it would be made available to maximum farmers. It is widely used in European countries to protect horticulture crops, particularly apples from pest attacks. This is an environment-friendly method where MDT targets only PBM’s population cycle and other insects remain completely unharmed,” he said.The government is trying to pursue an entrepreneur to establish a plant in Punjab to ensure higher availability at a competitive price, added the minister.Nabha said deputy commissioners have been asked to submit a list of enterprising farmers who can act as community leaders to sensitise farmers about measures to protect the cash crop.“Farmers will be taken to Telangana and Karnataka to expose them to practices adopted by cotton-growers there to check PBW infestation and earn better,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pau-experts-confirm-efficacy-of-mating-disruption-technique-to-prevent-pink-bollworm-in-cotton-101634155241926.html

Conducting a meeting with zonal commissioners and health branch officials at the MC Zone-D office on Wednesday, MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal directed the officials to ensure regular fogging in the city. Citing the rising cases of dengue in the city, the officials have been directed to avoid water accumulation, especially near religious places and Dussehra fair sites, to stop mosquito breeding. With the heavy rush of visitors being witnessed in the markets and the Dussehra fair sites, the MC staff has been directed to commence night sweeping wherever possible. Teams of sweepers should be formed, and the main roads of the roads should also be cleaned on a regular basis. Also, the MC should conduct meetings with religious organisations and take up sanitisation drives in and around religious places. One of the officials said Sabharwal also directed the health branch staff to ensure timely lifting of garbage from the city. Heaps of garbage can be seen at the secondary dump points in the city, which gives a filthy look to the city. Further, the councillors have also been raising concerns over irregular fogging in their respective areas. The staff has been directed to pull up their socks. Sabharwal said directions have also been issued to keep MC offices clean and create a friendly atmosphere for visitors. Office furniture should be in good condition and the officials should ensure reaching offices on time. Surprise inspections would also be conducted to check punctuality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ensure-cleanliness-fogging-ludhiana-mc-chief-101634155122330.html
14-10-2021||Chandigarh||Kejriwal promises 24-hour power supply, steps to boost industry if AAP voted to power||Amid the ongoing power crisis due to coal shortage, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who is on a two-day visit to Punjab, promised round-the-clock electricity supply in the state if his party is voted to power in the 2022 polls. He said the power scarcity in Punjab was man-made and once the transmission system is upgraded, half the problem will be solved. “We faced similar problem in Delhi during our initial years in government. We changed the transmission system and the situation has improved to the point that people don’t buy inverters now,” Kejriwal said. He was speaking during an interactive session with the Jalandhar-based industrialists at a private resort. He unveiled a 10-point agenda for the development of industry, trade and commerce. He underlined the need to give special focus on MSME and small scale industry sectors. “Ek mauka saanu vi (give us a chance too). I assure that you will forget others,” Kejriwal said.After listening to the grievances of industrialists, Kejriwal pledged to end red-tapism and ‘inspector raj’. “Corruption runs in the system because the intentions of the governments are not honest. If the CM and ministers are honest, the entire system will fall in place. We did this in Delhi,” he said. He said the problem of delay in VAT refunds will be solved within 3-6 months after coming to power and an instalment system will be introduced. To prove his point, the AAP leader said his government in Delhi had stopped “raid raj” and reduced VAT rate that led to doubling of tax revenue at ₹60,000 crore. It happened because the government trusted the traders, he said. Kejriwal also promised the formation of a trade and industry body and its decisions will have to be implemented by the state government. He also underlined the need to make the change of land use (CLU) process transparent to eradicate corruption. AAP Punjab president and MP Bhagwant Mann, MLA Aman Arora and other senior leaders of the party were also present. Meanwhile, a group of farmers opposed Kejriwal’s event but the police kept them at bay. Leader of opposition in the Punjab assembly Harpal Singh Cheema said they don’t organise rallies as advised by the Samuykt Kisan Morcha.

14-10-2021||Chandigarh||Retired Punjab power engineers blame private plants for crisis||Accusing the successive governments in Punjab of privatising the power generation sector, a forum of retired Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) engineers on Wednesday sought to reverse the policy and asked the utility to take electricity generation under its direct control. “The PSPCL can buy private thermal plants in Punjab by monetising its assets. The land attached with the Bathinda thermal plant which has been closed is worth ₹20,000 crore. Using these funds, the corporation can buy the three thermal plants at Rajpura, Mansa and Goindwal Sahib,” said PSPCL retired deputy chief engineer Bhupinder Singh, who is convener of the forum. He said cancellation of power purchase agreements (PPAs) with the private power plants would lead to acute power shortage and long-drawn litigations. “There is no provision of cancellation of the PPAs,” Singh said. Due to insufficient generation on its own, the PSPCL was dependent on outside sources to supply power to consumers as the state-run thermal plants contribute merely 3% of the total energy, the lowest in the country, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/retired-punjab-power-engineers-blame-private-plants-for-crisis-101634154881799.html

14-10-2021||Chandigarh||Bhola drugs case: No objection to opening of sealed reports, Punjab tells HC||The Punjab government on Wednesday told Punjab and Haryana high court that it has no objection to opening sealed-cover reports on drugs menace in the state while alleging involvement of influential persons. State’s advocate general APS Deol told high court bench of justices AG Masih and Ashok Kumar Verma that prior to taking up other issues, the issue of opening of sealed cover reports can be taken up on priority so that state’s prosecution agencies can proceed as per law. Interestingly, the state’s advocate general in his submissions on Wednesday also referred to another set of reports submitted in 2018 by an SIT led by Siddharth Chattopadhyaya, to probe the role of police officers in the drugs racket. Three reports were signed by all SIT members and one report only by Chattopadhyaya. On May 23, 2018, the high court had also taken this report on record, observing that all these reports need to be examined in conjunction with reference to the issues formulated by the court or the task assigned to the SIT by way of orders passed from time to time. These submissions were made during the resumed hearing in a 2013 suo motu petition, initiated into an alleged ₹6,000 crore drug racket case in which the court is monitoring the probe by various agencies. On October 5, the high court had advanced the hearing by a month on an application moved by an advocate Navkiran Singh, who is an intervener in 2013 suo motu petition. The three crucial reports which Navkiran is demanding that they be opened are: One by then special task force head HS Sidhu, another of then enforcement directorate assistant director Niranjan Singh and third of a committee headed by then additional chief secretary (home) Nirmaljeet Singh Kalsi. All these reports are lying in a sealed cover before the high court since 2018. The reports are mainly on allegations of involvement of some high-profile politicians of the state. The hearing on Wednesday was conducted through virtual mode and started at around 4:30 pm. The court while deferring the matter for Thursday observed that the drugs menace PIL has a number of issues associated with it and all the issues cannot be taken up simultaneously. Hence, issues to be adjudicated, including that of sealed cover reports, would be formulated first and then specific dates would be given to conducting hearings on different issues. On Thursday, the court is likely to frame various issues associated with the case. Earlier, the court was apprised by different lawyers about the proceedings so far. Central government sought time from the court to get an update on probe by central agencies, including that of bringing back NRIs, who have been named in drugs cases. Senior advocate Anupam Gupta highlighted the importance of issue, especially in view of change of dispensation in Afghanistan and how Punjab has become more vulnerable. Meanwhile, state Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Wednesday tweeted again on the state government’s resolve to fight drugs menace. “STF report on multi-crore Drug racket linked to Majithia will be opened today by Hon’ble High Court. After more than 3.5 yrs of wait Judiciary will name the main culprits A Priority among High Command’s 18 Point Agenda yet Mothers of Punjab are still awaiting action by the State (sic),” he tweeted. Sidhu had led the charge against former CM Captain Amarinder Singh for a tardy probe into drugs cases. After Captain’s ouster, Sidhu and Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi had announced a speedy probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bhola-drugs-case-no-objection-to-opening-of-sealed-reports-punjab-tells-hc-101634154762841.html

Hundreds of industrialists from across the district attended the meeting chaired by Badal, along with state industries minister Gurkirat Singh Kotli and food and supply minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu. Making a call to the industry to re-impose their faith in Congress in the upcoming elections, Badal said all issues pertaining to VAT will be elaborately discussed in the next cabinet meeting. “A scheme will be effectively rolled out to settle around 50,000 pending VAT assessments,” he said, adding, “A faceless system would also be rolled out to assess the taxes to ensure industrialists do not face any kind of harassment in the government offices.” Manpreet said he would be touring all major industrial towns in the next 10 days to address issues of the industrialists. ‘Unfortunate that 80% state dependent on coal for power’ Manpreet said the state government has taken up the coal-shortage issue with the union government. “It is unfortunate that 80% of the state is dependent on coal for power. Coal is not the future, solar and gas is,” he said. Food, civil supplies and consumer affairs minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said the Ludhiana municipal corporation would spend ₹15 crore and Improvement Trust would give ₹10 crore for infrastructure development in industrial areas/focal points. Industries and commerce minister Gurkirat Singh Kotli announced to set up a new focal point in Khanna soon and a grant of ₹20 crore would be issued for the infrastructure development of the existing focal point. Factionalism evidentFactionalism in Congress came to the fore when a number of leaders, including KK Bawa, chairman of Punjab State Industrial Development Board (PSIDC), and Amarjeet Singh Tikka, chairman of Punjab Medium Industrial Development Board (PMIDB) were left fuming, claiming that they were not invited for the event even though they hold important posts pertaining to industry. “As many as eight of us holding important posts were not invited,” said Tikka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/50000-pending-vat-assessments-new-scheme-on-the-anvil-manpreet-badal-101634154761776.html

14-10-2021||Chandigarh||Classical dancer Mallika Sarabhai holds session at Chitkara College of Education||Renowned Indian classical dancer, actor and activist Mallika Sarabhai and author, educator and historian Vikramjit Singh Rooprai conducted expert sessions on performing arts at the Chitkara College of Education on Tuesday. They helped the new batches of bachelor of education and master of education get conditioned to the use of performing arts as a classroom pedagogy-restructuring tool, through highly enriching and engaging sessions on “edutainment katha” and “the art of storytelling in teaching.”The speakers said, “Theatre and performing arts are evocative teaching methodologies, which not only engage the creative side of the brain, but also provide an ideal balance in the students’ patterns of study. As it us easy for children to become swamped in a sea of theory, experiential learning helps to rejuvenate and engage the students.” Addressing the new batches at the orientation programme, the pro-chancellor Madhu Chitkara said it is very important to keep pace with the latest educational trends and techniques when teaching the millennial and digital natives. “The students these days have a very short attention span and it becomes exigent for an educator to formulate captivating lessons for the dynamic learners. However, the inclusion of performing arts in education provides pupils with an excellent opportunity to enthral their mind, body and emotions into a collaborative expression. Our pedagogy maestros for the day, Mallika Sarabhai and Mr Vikramjit Singh Rooprai, magnificently depicted the same in their instructive expert talk and workshop,” Chitkara.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/classical-dancer-mallika-sarabhai-holds-session-at-chitkara-college-of-education-101634153261838.html
14-10-2021||Pune||Focus on students, not hotel with liquor licence: Bombay HC to Pune school||MUMBAI:It is better that educational institutions inculcate students with strong moral values to prepare them to face challenges in life rather than worry about the effect of a hotel with a liquor licence in the same neighbourhood as the school, the Bombay high court has said“It is thus more important that an endeavour of an educational institution should be to impart education, so that the basic human values and good virtues are inculcated in the students, to make them ideal citizens,” justice GS Kulkarni said, his parting advice as the court on Tuesday rejected a request by school management’s executives against the liquor licence.“It is thus a sincere hope, that these words fall on the receptive ears of the institution and the institution creates a situation for itself, that it would feel proud of its students.”The case revolved around an attempt by a hotel located in a village in Pune district’s Junar subdivision to shift the business to the town within the limits of Junar municipal council. The request for transferring the liquor licence was rejected by the district collector. The hotel owner went in appeal to the Maharashtra commissioner of excise, who reversed the collector’s order and granted him permission.Some office-bearers of the school petitioned the high court, challenging the new order.Justice Kulkarni rejected the argument that cited the likelihood of a law and order problem due to the hotel’s liquor licence, noting that there was no such apprehension expressed by the police and this was “a total figment of imagination of the petitioners”.“In the present facts, the petitioner’s institution ought not to have formed such opinion that the education being imparted by their educational institution was so fragile that the students would get easily influenced by a restaurant serving liquor in the vicinity,” he said.This, the court said, was for two reasons.Firstly, this educational institution was never bothered about a similar restaurant having a liquor licence functioning in the vicinity for the last 10 to 12 years. Secondly and most importantly, the court said, if the quality of learning and inculcation of moral values in the children was of a standard, the institution ought not to worry at all about any student being adversely affected by any such place in the vicinity of the school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/focus-on-students-not-hotel-with-liquor-licence-bombay-hc-to-pune-school-101634153149009.html

14-10-2021||Lucknow||UP assembly to elect deputy speaker on October 18||It’s official now. The Uttar Pradesh assembly will elect Nitin Agarwal as its deputy speaker on October 18, with the new deputy speaker holding office for less than five months.“Yes, Nitin Agarwal will be the choice for election to the post of deputy speaker of state assembly,” said Suresh Khanna, minister for finance and parliamentary affairs.The state assembly was constituted on March 14, 2017 and the end of its five-year term will mark the end of term of the new deputy speaker.“The Hon’ble Speaker has fixed the date of 18th October, 2021 for the election of Deputy Speaker of the seventeenth Vidhan Sabha of Uttar Pradesh. Accordingly this election will be held at the Vidhan Sabha hall, Lucknow on the 18th October, 2021 at 11AM,” said Pradeep Kumar Dubey, principal secretary, legislative assembly, Uttar Pradesh, in a press statement, here, on Wednesday.Dubey further said the nomination papers to be obtained from his office may be submitted to him on October 17. “Any member of the house may nominate another member for this election by submitting the prescribed nomination paper, duly filled in, to the Principal Secretary, Vidhan Sabha, 11AM to 1PM, on 17th October 2021. Nomination forms may be obtained from the office of Principal Secretary Vidhan Sabha,” said Dubey.As per tradition, the Deputy Speaker is elected from among the members of the main opposition party. Will Samajwadi Party member Nitin Agarwal be elected the deputy speaker of state assembly?“I have no indication about my likely election to the post of deputy speaker. But if given any responsibility, I will perform duties to the best of my ability,” said Agarwal, who is being considered the frontrunner for the post. Along with his father, Naresh Agarwal, Nitin joined the BJP in 2018. The Samajwadi Party’s petition seeking disqualification of Nitin Agarwal was rejected recently.“The Deputy Speaker can be elected from any political party, though traditionally, a member of an opposition party is elected to the post. It’s not late for the election of deputy speaker though the same should have been done much earlier. No Deputy Speaker was elected till the end of term of state assembly during the term of many assemblies in the past,” said Ammar Rizvi, who was UP assembly deputy speaker from September 28, 2001 to January 20, 2002. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who completes his five-year term on March 19, 2021, recently expanded his ministry by inducting seven new ministers. New ministers will be effectively in office for a few weeks as the Election Commission of India’s model code of conduct is likely to come into force in the last week of December 2021 or early in January 2022.Will the opposition support the move? “We are not aware of the agenda of the assembly session. A meeting of the business advisory committee has been apparently convened on October 17, 2021. As per tradition, the deputy speaker is elected from the main opposition party. The election is done in consultation with leaders of opposition parties. If they want to elect a member of Samajwadi Party as the deputy speaker they would have consulted our leadership,” said leader of opposition, Ram Govind Chaudhary.“We are not aware of the state assembly’s agenda so far. We will take a call once the agenda is finalised,” said Congress Legislature Party leader Aradhna Mishra ‘Mona’.The state government, meanwhile, proposes to table replacing bills to the ordinances that have been promulgated by the governor after the last session of the state assembly.“Everything is being done keeping in view forthcoming assembly elections. Rajesh Agarwal was dropped as minister for finance earlier. The BJP government wants to appease the ‘bania’ community and the likely election of Nitin Agarwal as deputy speaker is a move in the same direction,” said Professor SK Dwivedi, former head of department, political science, Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-assembly-to-elect-deputy-speaker-on-october-18-101634152421742.html

14-10-2021||Chandigarh||Dhankar gives ‘break false anti-farm law narrative’ call to BJP rank and file||Haryana BJP president Om Prakash Dhankar on Wednesday called upon the “vigilant” rank and file of the party to take a pledge to counter the “false narrative” against the Centre’s three farm laws and applauded the state government for its “political will” while taking a slew of pro-farmer steps.In his presidential address during the day-long Haryana BJP’s regional council meeting at Panchkula held for the first time after 1982, Dhankar set the agenda for expanding organisational base on strength of “service, ideology and ideals” and the “dedicated” foot soldiers of the party, besides good governance of the Manohar Lal Khattar-led government.“Let’s take a vow to break the false narrative against the farm laws. Vigilant BJP workers will counter this misinformation against the farm laws... keep the Hindi version of the law with yourself and spread it across the state,” Dhankar told the gathering in his near hour- long address.Taking a dig at those terming the three farm laws as black laws, he quipped: “Kali to hamari murrah bhi hai (Our murrah buffalo is also black)... but see the milk yield... colour doesn’t matter... we should focus on the usefulness...”During the day, BJP held three sessions till late evening to formulate the road map for the party activities and discussed the strategy to reach out to people informing them about policies and programmes of the state government that will complete seven years in power on October 27.Among those attending this programme were key BJP leaders and workers including chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, cabinet ministers, MLAs, MPs, heads of frontal organisations, districts presidents, etc.The state BJP chief said the farm laws were brought in for the welfare of the cultivators, but a “misleading narrative” was launched and the Opposition started spreading lies that MSP will be stopped and mandis will be disbanded.“Now, they have stopped talking about MSP and mandis. It is our responsibility to break the back of this false narrative. The MSP had started from Haryana and there is no question of stopping MSP and closing mandis. They should demand MSP for bajra in Rajasthan and MSP in the states where it is not given. Haryana procures the highest number of crops under the MSP,” he said.Pats CM KhattarDhankar said by transferring MSP directly to the bank accounts of the cultivators despite protests from “a particular lobby”, the Haryana government had displayed its “political will”.He said Haryana was the first state that started releasing the MSP money directly into the farmers’ bank accounts and discontinued the earlier practice of releasing the money to arhtiyas.Not just this, he said, the Haryana government was also the first in the country to start paying interest to farmers and others for delay, if any, in releasing payments related to food grain procurement.The state BJP chief told the gathering that in the past seven years, the BJP had launched “numerous” pro-people programmes and asked the party workers to popularise “seven key reforms of seven years” rule of the party in Haryana among people.Ahead of October 27, when BJP will complete seven years in power in Haryana, he said 70,000 party workers will call on seven lakh people in a day, while seven ministers will hold press conferences.“Our government has done an extraordinary job. The scenario of Haryana has changed. Our sports policy is being discussed across country and other states are copying our transparency driven policies. Our government has been rolling out policies and programmes to benefit every section of the society,” Dhankar said. wrapping up his speech amid applause.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dhankar-gives-break-false-anti-farm-law-narrative-call-to-bjp-rank-and-file-101634151884175.html
14-10-2021||Chandigarh||19 candidates in fray for Ellenabad bypoll||As many as 19 candidates are in fray for the Ellenabad bypoll which is scheduled on October 30, said election officials after two candidates withdrew their nominations on the last day. Counting of votes will take place on November 2.The seat fell vacant after Indian National Lok Dal (INLD)’s lone MLA Abhay Singh Chautala resigned from the Ellenabad constituency on January 27 in favour of farmers protesting against Centre’s three farm laws. He is seeking re-election for a fourth consecutive term from this rural dominated seat, which is considered his family’s bastion. He is pitted against BJP’s Gobind Kanda and Congress’ Pawan Beniwal, both turncoats.Farmers protesting against the farm laws have installed banners, banning the entry of BJP candidate Gobind Kanda, in more than half a dozen villages of Ellenabad. These villages are Amritsar Kalan, Raipur, Budi Mari, Moju Khera, Sant Nagar, Damdma, Jivan Nagar, Sant Nagar and other villages.Rakesh Kumar, of Amritsar Kalan, said they have decided to boycott the entry of BJP-JJP joint nominee Gobind Kanda in their village on directions of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM).“We have decided to teach BJP a lesson in this bypoll. Farmers are upset with the saffron party as they have failed to end the deadlock with the protesters. We never thought this agitation will continue for such a long time as we had faith in the BJP government that they will resolve the issue,” he added.Ravi Azad, state youth president of Bharatiya Kisan Union, said many leaders of the SKM are canvassing the villages of Ellenabad constituency and asking people to boycott the BJP candidate.“We will not campaign in favour of any candidate but will oppose BJP’s Gobind Kanda. More than 10 villages have installed banners in the constituency banning entry of BJP-JJP leaders,” he added.Sirsa deputy commissioner (DC) Anish Yadav on Tuesday had conducted a meeting with former sarpanches and nambardars of all 74 villages of Ellenabad constituency and urged them to cooperate with the administration in conducting the bypoll peacefully.“As many as 15 companies of paramilitary forces have been deployed in the constituency. We have urged the former sarpanches and nambardars to ensure that no untoward incident takes place. We have also appealed to the general public not to create hurdles in canvassing of candidates,” the DC added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/19-candidates-in-fray-for-ellenabad-bypoll-101634151702629.html

Police said they are also examining CCTV footage from the hotel for clues.According to police, the suspect promised to buy the girl a new school uniform, as her old one was in tatters, and allegedly asked her to accompany him to get her measurements taken. Police said her mother, who was unwell, asked the girl to go with the suspect as the family trusted him. The victim told police that her family became acquainted with the accused, Anil, during their visits to a community kitchen at a nearby temple.Investigators said the suspect reportedly took the girl to the hotel around 10.30am on Sunday and made her sit in a room as he said he has to finish some work.She claimed that after a while, she reportedly got suspicious of Anil’s behaviour and screamed, but the latter allegedly covered her mouth and sexually assaulted her.However, she managed to escape from the room when Anil stepped away from her a few moments later. Anil allegedly tried to chase her but gave up soon.According to police, she reached her house and told her mother about the episode after which they approached the police station. The police took the girl for medical examination where she was also counselled.“We are scanning the CCTV cameras in and around the hotel and raids are being carried out to nab the accused,” said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/13yearold-girl-raped-in-hotel-at-delhi-s-paharganj-by-family-friend-101634151701605.html
14-10-2021||Other||Akhilesh says BJP will never act against Union minister||Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav has said that the BJP will never act against the Union minister whose son has been arrested in connection with the killing of four farmers, as the party solidly backs criminals.Yadav was speaking in Hamirpur on Wednesday as part of his ongoing Vijay Rath Yatra, which moved through Jalaun and Kanpur Dehat, where he addressed workers at meetings.Yadav said Adityanath has a liking for two things - the bull and the bulldozer - but the people of Bundelkhand have decided to bulldoze the BJP with their votes in next year’s assembly elections.“They will run the bulldozer of votes on the BJP in the coming polls,” he said.Yadav was apparently referring to the stray cattle menace in Bundelkhand and the government’s drive to raze buildings mostly of criminals and politicians in various parts of the state.“The BJP will never act against the union minister because it stands with criminals. If criminals are the happiest anywhere, it is under the BJP government,” he said.Eight people, including four farmers and a journalist, were killed in the October 3 violence that erupted during a farmers’ protest in Lakhimpur Kheri. Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra’s son, Ashish Mishra, is among those arrested in connection with the incident.In an indirect attack to UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, but without taking any names, Yadav said the ‘chillumjeevi’ was to distribute tablet computers among students now and wondered why it was not done in the last over four years. ‘Chillum’ is a clay smoking pipe often used by sadhus.He warned the people against the ‘chillumjeevi’ and asked them if they had understood who he was referring to.The UP chief minister distributed tablet computers and smartphones among youngsters recently.Addressing a public meeting later, Yadav said, “When farmers protested against agriculture laws, they were crushed under the wheels of vehicles.” Hitting out at the ruling BJP over three contentious farm laws of the Centre, he said, “I want to tell the farmers of Bundelkhand, Uttar Pradesh and the country that the manner in which the BJP has brought the three black laws, it will crush you like the (four) farmers were crushed and killed in Lakhimpur Kheri.”“As of now, farmers and laws have been crushed, and the Constitution might also be crushed. So, the BJP needs to be removed with the strength of votes,” the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister added.On the state of affairs in the water-scarce Bundelkhand region, he said, “Maximum number of farmers have committed suicide in Mahoha, Hamirpur, Banda and the surrounding areas and after coming to power, the SP government will extend all facilities to farmers here, be it irrigation or mandis.” He alleged that the three new farm laws brought by the Centre will force farmers to quit farming and make them labourers.“There is very little time left for the election. The BJP does not want to give backward classes and Dalits their rights, and therefore, a caste-based census has not taken place till now. It should be done as the BJP says that Yadavs have benefitted the most. I want to tell them that they are misleading the people,” the SP chief said.Reiterating his charge that projects launched during his tenure as chief minister have been re-inaugurated and renamed by the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh, Yadav alleged that the current regime has sold government assets.He also alleged that in the name of a defence corridor in the Bundelkhand region, the land of farmers has been acquired but no industry has come up here.“This is a ‘sutli bomb’ (damp squib) of the BJP. They had shown the dream of a defence corridor and betrayed the poor people of Bundelkhand. These are people who tell lies and there is a need to be alert. Just think, if a yogi is telling lies, where will the people go?” Yadav said.Talking about the ‘Samajwadi pension scheme’ launched by his government, he said that if needed, the amount under the scheme will be increased three-fold after the SP comes to power again.The scheme, started by Yadav in 2014, provides a monthly pension of ₹500 to families falling below the poverty line.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/akhilesh-says-bjp-will-never-act-against-union-minister-101634151642015.html

The woman’s husband and daughter also suffered stab wounds and are undergoing treatment at a hospital, police said, adding that they have arrested four persons in connection with the murder and attempts to murder.According to the police, the police control room received a call on Saturday to alert them that a woman was stabbed in Narela area following a scuffle with a group of men. Soon, a team reached the spot and found blood trails on the ground. Further inquiry with the locals revealed that three people were injured in the stabbing and all were taken to the hospital for treatment.Police said that the victims were identified as Lal Mohammad (50), his wife Gulshan (42) and their daughter Reshma (24), all residents of a slum colony in Narela Industrial Area.“Gulshan was declared brought dead at the hospital while the others sustained deep wounds for which they are being treated,” a police officer, associated with the case, said. A case under sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at the Narela police station.Following investigations, four people were arrested, police said. They were identified as Jahid, Aayan, Shamim and Saddam. According to a senior police officer, the incident took place after a quarrel broke out between the accused and victims after the group gathered outside the victims’ house.“The place where the incident took place is congested. The eight accused were standing near the victim’s house. One of the victims objected to them standing there and that led to an argument. The accused attacked the family with sharp objects and left them wounded,” the officer said, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwoman-stabbed-to-death-husband-daughter-injured-after-attack-in-narela-101634151581551.html
14-10-2021||Noida||5 murders that destroyed the Tyagi family, and shook a Ghaziabad sleepy hamlet||Located off the dusty national highway in Ghaziabad, Brajesh Tyagi’s rundown house in the middle of Basantpur Saitli village is completely unremarkable. Five airless, dark rooms with chipped paint on the walls and exposed brick for floors earlier supported a family of four, now reduced to two. Charpoys are spread for visitors to sit but the house is barely furnished otherwise.Tyagi, 60, is a garment worker who cycles to the factory in Muradnagar every day, returning after dark. He earns roughly ₹9,000 a month, and a negligible amount from the 1.5 acre of land he owns. The family has lived in the area for at least three generations.The Tyagi household is a strange sight in a village with wide cemented roads and dotted with swank farmhouses. Yet, looks can be deceiving. The shabby home is built on a plot worth at least ₹50 lakh, and is ringed by agricultural land with a current market value of nearly ₹3 crore.The reason: The land lines the Eastern Peripheral Expressway and the Meerut Expressway that form the backbone of commercial traffic into the Capital, and where plot prices have appreciated as much as 20 times over the past two decades. Police say the value of the land was the main reason behind five grisly murders in the Tyagi family over the past two decades. The victims include Tyagi’s two sons, two nieces and his brother.The suspect: Tyagi’s youngest brother Leelu, 48, who dropped out of school in class eight, and allegedly killed his brother, two stepdaughters and his brother’s children using deceit and contract killers. But what’s intriguing is the family’s puzzling reticence in involving the police when three children disappeared over a period of 10 years.“Neither did the Tyagi family realise Leelu could be involved, nor did they have the courage to entertain such thoughts,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of police, Ghaziabad (Rural).Leelu is currently in police custody and police say he is owning up to the older killings as well, though it will be difficult to try him for crimes allegedly committed over 20 years ago, given the lack of evidence and timely investigation.The stout, short man makes no bones about why he carried out the murders: for the sake of his 19-year-old son Vibhor, known to the family as Shanky. “I did it to ensure my son gets the property,” he told journalists shortly after his arrest on September 23.MURDER 1The middle Tyagi brother, Sudhir, was Leelu’s first target, say police.In 2000, Sudhir went missing from Meerut where he lived with Anita and two daughters, Parul and Payal. The family launched a brief search, but the police were not approached. Sudhir was never traced. Within a year, Leelu married Anita and soon they were living at Sudhir’s Muradnagar home with the two girls.Police say Leelu has confessed to shooting Sudhir dead with a countrymade pistol with the help of a Meerut-based contract killer, Subhash. Subhash, who was allegedly paid R1 lakh, died five years ago. Sudhir’s body was allegedly dumped in Gang Nahar canal, but never recovered. “Sudhir killed two birds with one stone. He got to marry Anita and own Sudhir’s share of the property,” said Satish Kumar, station house officer (SHO) of Muradnagar.Tyagi said Sudhir’s disappearance didn’t draw the family’s attention because he was already estranged and had moved away to Meerut. “Anita herself didn’t show much interest in finding him, so we did not either,” he added. MURDER 2With Sudhir out of the way, Leelu was assured of a higher share in the family property. But he was still worried, police say. “While Leelu wished to spend his life with Anita, he feared that someday her daughters would seek their share,” SHO Kumar said.Sometime in 2003, Leelu allegedly poisoned his older stepdaughter, eight-year-old Payal, while Anita was away at her parents’ home in Ghaziabad. When she came back, he was able to convince her that it was a natural death and cremated the girl without involving the police. Leelu told the family that Payal died of an insect bite. “We didn’t see any reason to not believe him, especially when Anita seemed satisfied,” said Tyagi.Police say Anita’s behavior was suspicious but add that they’ve not been able to question her because she is on the run, along with her son Shanky.MURDER 3Three years after Payal’s death, her 15-year-old sister Parul went missing. “Leelu convinced Anita that Parul had eloped. The police weren’t involved and Parul never returned home,” SHO Kumar said.The police claim Leelu has told investigators that he strangled Parul while Anita was again at her parents’ home in Ghaziabad and then dumped her body in the Gang Nahar canal in Muradnagar itself. Again, Anita didn’t mention her suspicions to the rest of the family, or speak to the police. Family members remember that Leelu was so convincing in talking about Parul’s alleged elopement that no one suspected foul play. “Leelu is very intelligent,” said SP Raja.For years afterwards, the Tyagi family hoped for Parul’s return but took solace in Anita’s behavior that nothing had gone wrong. “If there was anything suspicious about the death or disappearance of the daughters, wouldn’t a mother (Anita) have stood up against Leelu?” asked Rajni, Tyagi’s wife. Leelu later told reporters that he killed the girls to avoid having to bear their wedding expenses.MURDER 4With his stepdaughters dead, Leelu showered his affection on Shanky, born to Anita and him in 2002. Villagers said Leelu spoilt Shanky, who was arrested in June for allegedly robbing a foreign woman and released on bail in a month. Despite the brush with police, Leelu bought him a Royal Enfield motorcycle.Leelu also grew increasingly greedy about the share of property for his beloved son – and set his eyes on his eldest brother’s family. His first target was Tyagi’s 14-year-old son, Neeshu.In 2012, Leelu allegedly paid two locals to strangle Neeshu and dump his body in the Gang Nahar canal. Leelu told police that he always needed people to assist him since he didn’t know how to drive – a curious flaw that later helped police piece together the murder because there were so many accomplices. This time, Tyagi went to the police and filed a missing person’s complaint. But it never translated into an FIR and Raja said the police failed to trace Neeshu. The Tyagis continued to harbour hopes of Neeshu’s return but neither murder nor Leelu’s role in his disappearance ever occurred to them. “Leelu actively helped me search for Neeshu. He was an ideal brother,” said Tyagi.MURDER 5Emboldened , Leelu apparently set his sights on the one person standing between his son and the Tyagi fortune: Tyagi’s elder son Reshu, 24.Reshu worked as a decoration services provider for banquet halls in Ghaziabad, but was looking out for better jobs. Leelu used Reshu’s desperation to lure him away from the house on August 8. “Leelu called up Reshu and told him that he had a new business idea in which he would make my son a partner,” said Rajni.On the main national highway outside the village, five men in a Hyundai i20 awaited Reshu, said police. The five men included Leelu, a retired UP Police sub-inspector Surender Tyagi, Surender’s associate Rahul Sharma and Leelu’s friend, Vikrant Jat and his nephew, Mukesh.“They set out for Bulandshahr. They barely travelled three-four kilometres before the gang used a chain and a rope to strangulate Reshu. They kept his body in an upright position between them in the rear seat for the next two hours of the drive,” SHO Kumar said.In Bulandshahr, they visited an agricultural field belonging to Mukesh where the five men got drunk, police said. They then allegedly stuffed the body in a sack, loaded it in the car’s boot, and dumped it in Gang Nahar canal. The retired policeman was allegedly paid R3.5 lakh and Vikrant R1.3 lakh.THE UNRAVELLINGRajni sensed something was amiss when her son didn’t return home that evening on August 8. “I didn’t want to believe it, but something in me said that Leelu had something to do with Reshu’s disappearance,” she added.When Tyagi returned from the factory that evening, Rajni made her suspicion clear. Tyagi cycled to Leelu’s home, some three kilometres away, and blamed him for Reshu’s disappearance. “He offered no defence, he just silently stared,” Tyagi said.Unlike previous occasions, however, the villagers stepped in to offer advice. “We asked him if he didn’t care about Reshu. That triggered him (Tyagi) to file a missing complaint on August 15,” said a neighbour, requesting anonymity.In his complaint, however, Tyagi, didn’t even mention Leelu. “My head said Leelu killed my son. But I loved Leelu,” he said.After August 8, Leelu stopped visiting the Tyagi home or even calling his brother. But police said that he made at least two visits to the local police station to enquire about the progress in the investigation. “He was gauging if he was in trouble,” said Kumar.Eventually, police’s probe narrowed down to Leelu after Reshu’s friends said the victim was last seen with his uncle. The last call on Reshu’s phone was also from Leelu. Villages told the police about the previous deaths and disappearances in the Tyagi family.Police realised that in the case of each death, Leelu was the sole benefactor. “The police finally persuaded me to file a case against Leelu. I didn’t believe he was involved, but people around me kept warning that I would be killed next,” said Tyagi.On September 22, a murder case was registered and Leelu was arrested the next day. Arrests of the retired policeman and his assistant Rahul Sharma followed on September 24. THE INVESTIGATIONPolice primarily used Leelu’s confession and his brother’s statements to explain the unusual behaviour of the Tyagi family in never reporting earlier disappearances to the police. “Leelu wielded great influence over the family. Brijesh loved as well as feared his brother. He wouldn’t even entertain such thoughts about Leelu until he actually heard his confession,” Raja said.The only time Leelu’s composure broke is when he begged investigators to not involve his son Shanky, said police. “He repeatedly requested us not to target his son,” Kumar said.Police have little hope of recovering Reshu’s body but say they have enough evidence in recordings of phone calls between Leelu, the retired policeman and his assistant Rahul Sharma. “In the call recordings, Leelu is heard telling the two men that they must go underground since they have been busted. He also tells them that the body is unlikely to be recovered,” said Raja.Police say that these recordings, recovered from each of their phones, could either be recorded automatically, or saved with a purpose of blackmailing later. Other evidence includes the phone locations of the victim and the suspects.The rope allegedly used in the murder has been recovered, the iron chain and the car remain untraced. Two alleged accomplices, Vikrant Jat and Mukesh, have surrendered to the Bulandshahr police in connection with other previous crimes. Ghaziabad Police have sought their remand for interrogation.Villagers and neighbours said they did hear about the earlier disappearances but avoided interfering. “This is an urban village. The family did not seem interested in accepting our theories,” said a villager requesting anonymity. “The deaths were spread out over several years. That helped him (Leelu) avoid suspicion,” the villager added.THE RECKONINGOn September 23, police brought the brothers face to face for the first time since the night Reshu disappeared.The story was so improbable that Tyagi refused to believe the police at the Muradnagar police station as investigators narrated the sordid saga of five murders. “I wanted to believe that he was being framed and forced to make these confessions,” said Tyagi.Thirty minutes later, he was hurtling himself at Leelu’s throat in rage as policemen struggled to hold him back. He cursed his brother and his own stupidity in never involving the police earlier. “I don’t know if I was angry at him for being a remorseless killer, or at myself for believing him to be an ideal brother all these years,” said Tyagi.In the half-an-hour, he had to come to terms with the revelations that his two missing sons would never return, that he had remained blind to three other murders in his family, and that he and his wife were probably next on the list.He also found out that police had almost no hope of gathering evidence in the previous murders. “We are focused on the latest murder. Whether he is convicted for one murder or five, it’s the same,” SP Raja said.Leelu quietly stood and heard his elder brother’s curses and words of anguish, said policemen present at the time. “I am sorry,” he said, before being dragged back to jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/5-murders-that-destroyed-the-tyagi-family-and-shook-a-ghaziabad-sleepy-hamlet-101634151521636.html

We will continue to oppose the meeting of the BJP-JJP leaders,” he added.Bhagwan Valmiki Trikaldarshi Society president Deepak Aditya accused the protesters of taking control of the helipad area, and eventually forcing the administration to cancel the CM’s visit in view of the law and order situation.“Earlier, the farmers had assured us that they will cooperate with us but they had taken control of the helipad area,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/khattar-cancels-gohana-visit-after-farmers-take-control-of-helipad-area-101634151402292.html
14-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM’s son wedding: Cop suspended for security breach||Mohali senior superintendent of police Navjot Singh Mahal on Wednesday suspended inspector Sukhbir Singh, posted with the crime investigating agency, for breach in the Punjab chief minister’s security during his son’s pre-wedding ceremony at a marriage palace in Kharar on October 8. The action has been taken after the additional director general of police (ADGP, intelligence) wrote a letter to the inspector general of police, pointing out various lapses in the CM security.The inspector was on duty with three constables — Jaskaran Singh, Darshan Singh and Satbir Singh — at the entrance during the sangeet function. He had suspended the three constables, who went inside the palace after consuming liquor, even reaching near the chief minister (CM). The SSP said the inspector has also been suspended for negligence of duty as he was the in-charge at the main gate. According to the ADGP’s letter, when CM Charanjit Singh Channi arrived at the venue around 9.30 pm, no one was present at the gate to identify the guests. Due to weak checking, many armed employees also entered the venue. Some cops posted at the metal detectors even left for dinner, while some in uniform were consuming liquor. Even women personnel deployed in civil dress were seen enjoying the function, it said.The letter further stated that one uniformed CIA personnel posted in Kharar, who was drunk, crossed the security cordon of the CM and reached close to him to show his closeness, and no attempt was made to stop him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-s-son-wedding-cop-suspended-for-security-breach-101634151347823.html

14-10-2021||Chandigarh||MPLADS: Chandigarh admn gets ₹2.5 crore windfall||The Chandigarh administration has got another shot in the arm after the Union government released ₹2.5 crore funds under the Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS). It is the residual amount for the 2019-2020 fiscal and can be used for works other than those related to Covid-19 relief.Each MP is allocated ₹5 crore discretionary funds annually. Before the pandemic hit Chandigarh in March 2020, the Centre had released ₹2.5 crore for 2019-20.  MP Kirron Kher had allocated these funds mainly to health institutes, including the PGIMER, for buying medical equipment, such as ventilators.In view of the Covid-19 crisis and nationwide lockdown, the Government of India in April 2020 decided to suspend MPLADS for two years (2020-2021 and 2021-2022).The release of the pending funds has come at crucial time for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is eyeing to retain power in the upcoming municipal elections.The Chandigarh administration had recently revised the grant-in-aid (GIA) estimates for the municipal corporation for the current fiscal by 40%. Closely following the decision, the administration got another windfall as the Centre lifted the 20% mandatory cut on spending that was imposed last year as part of austerity measures due to the pandemic. It will add at least ₹520 crore in the UT’s kitty this fiscal, and boost development works being executed by both the administration and MC. “We are putting the funds to use according to the demand and requirements. For instance, recently Arun Sood (BJP state president) requested funds for development in some areas, which has been approved,” said MP Kirron Kher.Sood said as the funds cannot be used for new projects, they are being spent on expanding works in the existing projects. “For instance, we are laying road tiles and upgrading sewerage system in some areas,” he said.The MPLADS funds are also being used for setting up gyms in parks and for installation of lights, said an official.The official, who did not wish to be named, said that there is a greater urgency in the ruling dispensation to spend the funds before the model code of conduct is enforced.“We have already allocated ₹1 crore to the MC for extension of development works sanctioned in 2019. The remaining ₹1.5 crore will be allocated once the projects are approved,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mplads-chandigarh-admn-gets-2-5-crore-windfall-101634151345345.html

14-10-2021||Delhi||28 Tihar officials suspended, 2 sacked, for helping ex-Unitech bosses||Twenty-eight Tihar jail officers were suspended, and services of two contractual employees were terminated by the director general of prisons on Wednesday evening for their alleged role in helping jailed Unitech ex-promoters Sanjay and Ajay Chandra violate prison rules and run a “secret underground office in south Delhi” from inside the jail, officers aware of the matter said on Wednesday.The prison department has also written to the Delhi government’s home department to suspend one superintendent and a deputy superintendent, who were named in the case. Prison department comes under the Delhi home department.These 32 officers were named in an inquiry report submitted to the Supreme Court by Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana.To be sure, officers of the rank of superintendent and deputy superintendent can only be suspended by the home department and not the prison headquarters. “The process to suspend them has begun. The director general has already written to the home department. It is likely to happen soon,” one prison officer, who asked not to be named, said.HT contacted a Delhi government spokesperson for a comment, but they did not respond.The prison department said that all these 32 jail officials were posted in jail number 7 of Tihar, where the Chandra brothers were lodged until the morning of August 28, when they were shifted to Arthur Road and Taloja jail in Maharashtra on the orders of the Supreme Court.The accused officers included one superintendent, one deputy superintendent, seven assistant superintendent, 10 head warders, 11 warders and two contractual employees. One of the contractual employees is a data entry operator, another is a nursing orderly, the officials said.After suspension, the accused will have to face an investigation by the Delhi Police crime branch which filed a first information report (FIR) on Tuesday in the case under sections of Prevention of Corruption Act. The case was registered on the basis of an inquiry report that Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana’s submitted to the Supreme Court.On October 6, the Supreme Court, after going through the police commissioner’s report, ordered the government to suspend the officers named in the report.On August 26, the apex court directed the Delhi Police chief to “personally look” into the role of prison officials after the Enforcement Directorate(ED) informed the court that Sanjay Chandra and Ajay Chandra violated prison rules and ran a “secret underground office” in south Delhi from inside Tihar jail with the help of jail officers.When contacted, director general (prisons), Sandeep Goel, said,” We have received the letter from Delhi Police with the names of the 32 jail officials who have been found prima facie complicit in the matter, during the inquiry. We are taking further action.”A mid-level prison officer, who asked not to be named, said in the coming days many prison officers would be transferred within the prison. “This is the first time that so many officers have been suspended in one day, and in a single case. They will also be questioned by the crime branch for their alleged role. Maybe this case will serve as a lesson to jail officials to not to get involved in corrupt practices or help prisoners violate rules by extending favours,” the officer added.The Chandra brothers were arrested in April 2017 for duping homebuyers in 74 Unitech projects. The two were also being probed by the ED.The ED, in a report to the apex court, had said that the two businessmen used the prison complex to transfer the proceeds of crime, and were instructing their people to dispose of their properties. The ED had said that it also unearthed a secret underground office’ in Delhi, which was being operated by erstwhile Unitech founder Ramesh Chandra and visited by his two son – Sanjay and Ajay – when they were on parole or bail.The Delhi Police have also named the Chandra brothers and their father, Ramesh Chandra, in the FIR for bribing jail officers.“We will start questioning the jail officers. The inquiry found evidence against them indicating they accepted money to extend the favours. This is why we also added sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act,” a crime branch officer, who asked not to be named, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/28-tihar-officials-suspended-2-sacked-for-helping-ex-unitech-bosses-101634151343045.html

14-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Police zero in on three men for theft from cash van||Even after five days, Chandigarh Police have made no arrest for the theft of a trunk carrying ₹39 lakh from a cash van on October 8. However, making the first breakthrough, police have zeroed in on three youths who can be seen taking the trunk while the cash was being loaded at an ATM in Sector 34.The CCTV footage shows their faces clearly, but they don’t match with any of the previous or present employees of the security firm that transports cash to various ATMs in the tricity.A senior police officer privy to the investigation said it seems to be the handiwork of a gang from out of town and efforts are on to identify the trio. Bhupinder Singh, who works as a custodian with the security firm based in Sector 47, had lodged a complaint regarding misplacement of a trunk carrying ₹39 lakh from the van.He told police that on October 8, he along with three others had left the office with ₹1.9 crore around 10 am. While ₹70 lakh were put in one bag, the remaining ₹39 lakh were in an iron trunk that was already sealed by the company.After loading cash at various ATMs, when they reached Nayagoan, the trunk was found missing. The company checked the vehicle’s location through CCTV cameras and GPS, but there was no unusual stoppage or deviation from the route. Under stress after being questioned by police, the driver of the cash van had committed suicide by jumping in front of a train on Monday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhpolice-zero-in-on-three-men-for-theft-from-cash-van-101634151292179.html

Then the festive season began and it further shot up. The wholesale rate has gone up and that is reflected in the retail rate as well,” said Ankit Kumar, a retail vegetable vendor in south Delhi’s Mehrauli Market.About 10 days ago, traders said tomatoes were selling for around ₹40 per kilogram across retail markets in Delhi.“On October 1, we were purchasing tomatoes for ₹2,000 per quintal, which works out to ₹20 per kilogram. The rate has almost doubled now. The supply is tighter,” said Iqbal Rafi, a wholesale vendor in the agricultural produce market in Okhla.“Unseasonal rain in tomato-producing states such as Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra have damaged crops due to which the supply to consumer markets like Delhi has been affected. This has led to a rise in prices,” said Ashok Kaushik, president of tomato traders’ association in Azadpur market.Tomato prices have witnessed an increase across metro cities, traders said.Among the metros, the maximum increase in the retail price of tomato was in Kolkata where the produce was as costly as ₹72 per kilo on October 12, as compared to ₹38 per kilo a month ago. In Delhi and Chennai, retail prices of tomatoes increased to ₹57 per kilo from ₹30 per kilo and ₹20 per kilo, respectively, a month ago, according to data compiled by the Union consumer affairs ministry. In Mumbai, retail tomato prices rose to ₹53 per kilo from ₹15 per kilo a month ago, the data showed.Data from Azadpur Mandi shows that the average arrival price of tomato has increased by 90% in just a month — it is ₹26.59 /kilo between the 1st and 12th of October as compared to ₹13.95/kilo in September. However, the average daily arrival quantity has fallen by around 15% in October, traders said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tomato-prices-soar-to-70-a-kilo-in-delhi-as-rain-damages-crops-in-states-101634151290961.html

Chairing a meeting of all stakeholders to discuss measures to curb drug menace, SSP Hamid Akhtar on Tuesday listed various activities with a timeline to be undertaken by police officers in coordination with civil society members.The SSP said that to involve the youth in sports, primarily in the countryside, Ambala Olympics will be organised with games such as volleyball and kabaddi. Akhtar, a 2008-batch IPS officer who grabbed headlines for his drive against drugs during his previous posting in Sirsa, said lack of documentation on deaths due to drugs was one of the biggest hurdles there. “In Ambala, I’ll ensure that such data is prepared for the past five years and families are encouraged to reveal the actual cause of death of drug addicts,” he said. Tip-off box at all police stationsThe SSP also instructed all station house officers to install a tip-off box on the lines of suggestion box at police stations, for the locals to submit anonymous complaints against drug trade. Assistant sub-inspector Rajesh Kumar was made the nodal officer of this initiative. He will also organise awareness camps at educational institutes twice a week and meetings of drug addicts with those who have recovered once a week.Akhtar said the addicts who have recovered will be one of the biggest assets during this initiative and will be encouraged to come forward. “Other than regular drug recoveries, the crime branch will step up efforts to nab the manufacturers and suppliers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambala-olympics-to-wean-youths-away-from-drugs-101634151289773.html

Action will be initiated against the builder accordingly,” she said. According to the National Building Code and Punjab Municipal Bylaws, one-third space of the total height of the building should be left between two towers for sunlight, air, and movement of fire tender. Among other violations, the builder, Fortune Multitech Private Limited, has constructed 15 shops at the place earmarked for a park and parking area. While the possession of houses has not been handed over yet, the resident welfare association (RWA) has taken the builder to court over the violations.Advocate Mukesh Kumar Verma, who represents the RWA, said: “The shops have been constructed without the consent of allottees or change of land use from the competent authority. The builder has also increased the number of flats from 396 to 476 without approval under the Punjab Apartment and Property Regulation Act.”RWA president Parveen Bhadoo said: “Our association has apprised the ADC about all violations done by the builder, and will provide all the proofs.” Sunny Garg, director, Fortune Multitech Private Limited, said: “I am not aware of any such visit by the ADC at Victoria Heights.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/building-violations-adc-visits-zirakpur-project-seeks-report-101634151286861.html
14-10-2021||Chandigarh||Despite 76% fall in stubble burning cases, Haryana cities record poor air quality||Even as the Haryana government is claiming a considerable fall in stubble burning cases, the air quality of eight Haryana cities has reached the poor category.Figures provided by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board show more than 76% dip in cases of stubble burning. The cases have come down to 298 from September 15 to October 12, against 1,264 cases reported during this period last year.But the air quality measured by the Central Pollution Control Board revealed that the air quality in eight cities has turned poor as the Air Quality Index (AQI) of Panipat was measured at 280, followed by Faridabad (274), Ballabgarh (269), Gurugram Sector 51 (254), Yamunanagar (223), Sonepat (208), Rohtak (206), and Karnal (205).Of 24 cities mentioned in the AQI bulletin of the CPCB, Narnaul is the only city in Haryana which has satisfactory air quality as the air quality of several other cities including Bhiwani, Ambala, Charkhi Dadri, Daruhera, Fatehabad, Hisar, Jind, Kaithal, Kurukshetra, Manesar, Panchkula and Sirsa was measured as moderate.AQI between 0 to 50 is considered good, 51 to 100 satisfactory, and 101 to 200 moderate. However, AQI between 201 to 300 is classified as poor, 301 to 400 very poor and it crosses over to the severe zone at 401.As per reports, the air quality of several Haryana cities got affected in the past couple of days following a sudden rise in the incidents of stubble burning.The figures revealed that around 85% farm fire incidents were reported in the last five days as Haryana recorded 51 cases on Tuesday, taking the total number for this year to 298.A major change in air quality of most Haryana cities was reported in past one week as on October 6 only Yamunanagar had poor quality with AQI of 223.The air quality of most Haryana cities including Ambala, Bhiwani, Hisar, Gurugram, Kaithal, Karnal, Kurukshetra, Manesar, Panipat, Palwal, Panchkula, Rohtak, Sonepat was satisfactory; and moderate in Bahadurgarh, Ballabhgarh, Bhiwadi, Charkhi Dadri and Faridabad.Reacting to fall in cases of stubble burning this year, HSPCB member secretary S Narayanan said the steps for ex-situ and in-situ management of the crop residue and deployment of eco-friendly equipments in large scale have brought a positive result to check stubble burning.On rise in cases in the past couple of days, he said, “Delayed harvest could be the reason behind it but before jumping to any conclusion (that the cases may rise in days to come), he said they should wait for a week as they are trying to prevent the incidences.On why the air quality of most cities has changed despite a considerable fall in stubble burning cases, Narayanan has refuted any dodging or dereliction in monitoring, saying, “monitoring is done by the Haryana Space Applications Centre. There are many factors that may be affecting the air quality.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/despite-76-fall-in-stubble-burning-cases-haryana-cities-record-poor-air-quality-101634151285103.html
14-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi residents take the e-route to mark Durga Puja from home||Ritwik Sen hurriedly did up the buttons of his crisply ironed kurta as his teenage son turned on the laptop on the centre table and logged on to the Facebook page of a prominent Durga Puja organiser in the national capital. Sen’s wife Mandira, quickly fetched a book of Sanskrit shlokas from the drawer of the small temple alcove in their Kalkaji home.Soon, the laptop screen came alive with a temple priest reciting shlokas and the Sens followed, turning the pages of the prayer book in Mandira’s hand as they missed a word or two. Around 23km away, in Dwarka’s Sector 6, Pancham Bharadwaj and family kept the rituals in a similar fashion. So did Anirban Sengupta’s family in east Delhi’s Vasundhara Enclave.“These are rituals which we cannot miss. But safety protocols are paramount in light of Covid-19. So it is safer to follow these rituals online, even though people are allowed to be physically present in venues this year,” said Sengupta.Even though the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) allowed visitors at Durga Puja pandals this year, unlike the previous year when no visitor was allowed in pandals, several families on Wednesday chose to offer their Durga Ashtami prayers at home, while watching a live-stream of rituals being performed at a puja pandal of their choosing.The community prayers, known as pushpanjali, are marked by offering of flowers to deities during Durga Puja. It is a prominent event on Ashthami – the eighth day of nine-day rituals.In the years before Covid, pushpanjali was a grand affair with the 500-odd Durga Puja venues in the capital witnessing thousands of visitors, often compelling organisers to break the gathering into batches and urging priests to repeat the shlokas for the benefit of each batch.Last year, in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, organisers were forced to take the rituals online. They continued with the practise this year as well, even though they were allowed to entertain devotees at venues – subjected to restrictions such as a maximum of 200 guests or 50% of total seating capacity, whichever is lower.“The event was broadcast live on social media as well as on our website. We also tied up with several cable TV operators for live coverage. Even though we are following all necessary guidelines, we kept the online option open to devotees,” said Swapan Ganguly, convener of Kali Bari temple, in New Delhi’s Mandir Marg, which hosts one of the most prominent Durga Pujas in the city.In a similar fashion, most Durga Puja organisers also made arrangements for online booking for bhog – food that is traditionally distributed among the masses. “Distribution of bhog is usually a massive affair, and involves large gatherings at venues. Organisers made online arrangements this time,” said Robin Bose, general secretary of Durga Puja committee in Kashmere Gate.Durga Puja festivities are marked by cultural events, exhibitions and food, a wide range of which is often available in temporary stalls that are set up inside and outside pandals and they stay open late into the night to cater to the rush. Localities such as CR Park transform into smaller version of Kolkata, where Durga Puja is a grand annual affair.While the DDMA did not allow fairs and stalls in and outside venues, most organisers dropped cultural events from their plans, in view of a decline in sponsorships and donations. Collectively, these factors have contributed in changing the Durga Puja experience for residents in the city.“It is difficult to imagine Durga Puja without food stalls and cultural events. In other years, we used to go pandal hopping with friends till midnight,” said Ashmita Basu, a resident of Mayur Vihar Phase 1.Divya Ghosh, a resident of CR Park, said, “The fact that the festival is still being organised, shows that things are returning to normal. Safety is a priority and I am sure people are taking the necessary precautions. But things still feel different — festivities are low-key, there are no food stalls or cultural events, all much needed ingredients for a full puja experience.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/many-say-ashtami-prayers-at-home-watching-a-live-stream-of-durga-puja-rituals-101634151041667.html
14-10-2021||Delhi||Proposal to shrink National Capital Region||New Delhi: The National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB) is considering a reduction in the area under the National Capital Region -- a region envisaged in 1985 for coordinated urban development in and around Delhi -- limiting it to within 100km radius from Rajghat, Delhi.The plan was discussed at the NCRPB’s meeting on Tuesday where the four participating states broadly agreed to it. Currently, the NCR consists of 24 districts in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan and entire Delhi, spread across an area of 55,083 square kilometres.If implemented, parts of Panipat in Haryana and Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh will be dropped from the new NCR map.According to the proposal discussed in the meeting, the geographical size of the region will be a contiguous circular region of 100km radius from Rajghat (Delhi). “Beyond 100 km radius and up to the existing NCR boundary, all notified cities/ towns along with a corridor of one km on either side of connecting expressways/ national highways/ state highways/ Regional Rapid Transit System will be included,” a statement from the Union housing and urban affairs ministry said.“The idea is to have a compact area so that the development can be planned in a better manner,” said a housing and urban affairs ministry official.A senior NCRPB official said there are a lot of rural areas which are currently part of the NCR. “Tehsil, including rural areas, coming under the 100km radius will be included in NCR. But the state government will decide whether tehsil, which are partly covered under the new NCR boundary, should be part of the NCR or not,” said a senior official.HT reported on Tuesday that the Haryana government is pushing for a one-third reduction in its area under the NCR. Officials said the proposal to reduce the state’s area was prepared keeping in view that the inclusion of areas extending to even far-flung districts such as Bhiwani, Charkhi Dadri, Mahendergarh, Jind and Karnal, was not serving any purpose in terms of reducing the urbanisation pressure on the national capital.“Also, the state government feels that restrictions applicable to NCR were difficult to implement in the hinterland included in the NCR,” an official told HT.NCRPB officials said the NCR delineation plan has been in the pipeline since 2017. “Over the years, new areas have been added to the NCR due to which its area has increased from 30,000 sq.km to over 55,000sq.km. We have been working on various models to reduce the area. But now a broad consensus has been reached between participating states on the matter,” said a senior NCRPB official who is aware of the matter.In June last year, when the country was facing the raging Covid19 pandemic, experts had questioned the viability of the NCR as a concept, as sealed and unsealed borders at will, failed to share or pool health care infrastructure, and not tried to evolve a common strategy in the face of rising Covid-19 cases. This prompted the Supreme Court to order the Centre to convene a meeting of member states – Delhi, UP, Haryana and Rajasthan – in order to evolve a “common programme and common portal” for easing interstate movement in the NCR.Also, even 36 years after its inception, except Metro there is no other reliable public transport between the NCR cities.Urban planning and transport experts say if the proposal to redraw the boundaries of the NCR is implemented, it will be beneficial for all cities and towns in the region.Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning at the School of Planning and Architecture, said, “The proposed plan will include all the major NCR towns and settlements. It is rural areas in these towns that will be excluded. It will benefit the rural areas, as the state governments can plan for their development in a better manner. The area in the 100km radius can be developed as a core area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/proposal-to-shrink-national-capital-region-101634150921548.html
14-10-2021||Delhi||DDA will hold public hearings from Oct 18 to finalise master plan 2041||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) will start holding public consultations for finalising the Master Plan of Delhi 2041 from October 18, officials said Wednesday. The land-owning agency said the entire process will be online and it has already received over 33,000 comments/feedback on the draft master plan. “We will put the schedule for public hearings on our website. We will also inform individuals, who gave their suggestions/comments to the master plan, through email about the public hearing dates,” said a senior DDA official, asking not to be named. DDA officials said to ensure that people don’t face any problems during the public hearings, the suggestions/objections have been divided based on the chapters in the new master plan. “Issues have been clubbed topic-wise so that we can hear the views of all people. We held public consultations online last year — when the master plan was being prepared — to get the people’s perspective. This year, we held online consultations after the MPD 2041 was put in the public domain to clarify people’s doubts related to the new plan,” said the official quoted above. The land-owning agency plans to notify MPD 2041, the vision document for city’s development over the next two decades, by end-December. The process was delayed due to the pandemic, as the land-owning agency had to extend the last date for submission of public suggestions/objections by a month following a demand for an extension from the public. While it received over 12,000 comments on its portal, a large number of people submitted their comments manually, the DDA said. Explaining the process, a senior official said based on people’s input during the public hearing, the MPD 2041 will be finalised. It will then be tabled in the DDA meeting. Once approved, it will be sent to the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs for notification. The MPD 2041 focuses on regeneration of old areas (unauthorised colonies, urbanised villages), allowing mixed use development, providing affordable rental housing and small format housing, promoting walkability and non-motorised transport, and developing green-blue (green spaces and waterfronts) infrastructure and corridors, among others, for the sustainable development of the city. This time, the land-owning agency has introduced new concepts and proposals to make Delhi a 24X7 city by promoting night time economy and nightlife; increasing economic activities; allowing mixed development, especially in industrial areas; and ensuring planned development of urban extensions, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dda-will-hold-public-hearings-from-oct-18-to-finalise-master-plan-2041-101634150861839.html

He, however, refused to divulge any more details. Police, on Wednesday, registered a case under IPC sections of murder. They are now investigating the case by questioning the family members of the child and their neighbours.They are also scrutinising footage from CCTV cameras in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhimissing-child-found-dead-in-bag-in-neighbour-s-balcony-in-uttam-nagar-101634150741914.html
14-10-2021||Delhi||3 civic bodies told to submit new deadlines for bio-mining of Delhi's landfills||The three municipal corporations have been asked to submit revised deadlines and action plan for the completion of bio-mining at the three major landfills at Okhla, Bhalswa and Ghazipur, a senior official overseeing the project said on Wednesday.In a recent review meeting of the state-level committee overseeing the project, chaired by the chief secretary, it was pointed out that the project progress was “very slow” and “incremental”.The data from the three civic bodies shows that almost two years after the project was started, on the orders of National Green Tribunal (NGT), only around 11% of the total legacy waste at the three sites has been excavated and treated. According to the old set of deadlines submitted to the NGT, Bhalswa landfill is to be cleared by June 2022, Okhla landfill by March 2023 and Ghazipur landfill by December 2023.Before the start of the project in July 2019, the three landfill sites cumulatively had 280 lakh tonnes of legacy waste. The bio-mining process is currently suspended on account of the monsoon. The data from three corporations shows that a total of 3.46 million tonnes of legacy waste had been bio-mined till July when the monsoon arrived.The East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has managed to bio-mine 770,000 tonnes of legacy waste at the Ghazipur site which holds 14 million tonnes of waste. EDMC mayor Shyam Sunder Aggarwal said the record-setting monsoon rain has caused the project progress to slow down. “We are changing our approach to hasten the process. Now, we will introduce bigger trommel machines. A company is being appointed to take responsibility of 50 lakh [5 million] tonnes of waste,” he said.Data submitted by North MCD shows that 1.8 million tonnes of waste was bio-mined from Bhalswa landfill, nearly 22% of the total legacy waste at the site.Similarly, South MCD has bio-mined 630,000 tonnes of legacy waste from Okhla landfill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/civic-bodies-to-submit-revised-deadlines-for-bio-mining-at-delhi-landfills-101634150681555.html
14-10-2021||Delhi||A full house for Ramlila — at Red Fort, and at homes||The scene from the Ramayana, which depicts Angad, the prince of the monkey army, trying to convince Ravana to not wage a war against Rama is about to begin and the socially distanced seats on the Red Fort grounds – the venue of the most prominent Ramlila in Delhi – are fully occupied.The tension on stage picks up. Ravana commands his guards and attendants to overpower Angad. The attempted negotiation has failed. The prince shakes off the guards and jumps on to the roof of Ravana’s palace, sending the King’s men into a tizzy. He crushes the surface where he lands. The crowd applauds and the light show begins. For those in the audience, it feels like Angad is flying off to where the monkey army has set up camp.“With a thinner crowd this year, Ramlila is a different experience. But we should be thankful that at least things are returning to normal. I am sure that thousands are watching the Ramlila from their homes, as we are live-streaming the performance every day,” said Brijesh Goyal, office bearer of Delhi’s ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), who essays the role of Angad in the Luv-Kush Ramlila on Red Fort grounds.The pandemic has evidently changed the way the Ramlila — a theatrical enactment of the Hindu epic Ramayana, is staged in the run-up to Dussehra. Delhi, in the pre-pandemic years, usually hosted about 100 Ramlilas of varying scales of grandeur, with the most prominent one being the Luv-Kush Ramlila on the grounds outside Red Fort.Before Covid-19 arrived, the crowd at the Red Fort ground starts swelling after sunset on the nine days of Navratri which ends on Dussehra with the burning of the effigies of King Ravana, his brother Kumbhakarna and son Meghnad.Last year, the state disaster management authority had allowed no visitors at the venue, following which several organisers went for live-streaming of Ramlila. This year, too, they have continued with the live-streaming.“It is not only about the limitations on the maximum size of the crowd, a large number of people, especially the elderly, should take necessary precautions in light of the pandemic and avoid crowded places,” said Arjun Kumar, general secretary, Luv Kush Ramlia committee.It is 7pm Wednesday and around 600 people are watching the Ramlila live on the committee’s YouTube channel and 2,000 on its Facebook page.“Ramlila is a cultural event for us and watching it with family is a tradition. We eagerly wait for it every year. It is good that the organisers are streaming it live online,” said Krishnapal Tiwari, a resident of Dilshad Garden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/thinner-crowds-absent-food-stalls-fail-to-dampen-spirits-at-red-fort-ramlila-101634150503459.html

He said the construction agency was warned of a fine if it doesn’t comply with all the dust pollution guidelines within two days.“I appeal to the people of Delhi that if there is pollution anywhere in Delhi, please complain about it on the Green Delhi app so that immediate action can be taken. To curb vehicular pollution, the ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaign will also start from October 18.

14-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s north civic body reduces fee for cell phone towers||The North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Wednesday approved a 40% reduction in the fee levied for installation of telecom network towers, a move that could help improve cellular connectivity in areas under the north civic body.The standing committee, the top decision making body of the corporation, approved a plan for cellular operators and telecom service providers in the area to be required to pay a fee of ₹3 lakh for five years for each tower, down from ₹5 lakh earlier.The South Delhi Municipal Corporation had also reduced rates in July, earlier this year, based on a settlement reached with the cellular operator association and telecom infrastructure providers.Earlier, the operators were expected to pay 25% extra fee, per mobile tower site, in case they plan to share the towers. “Under the new regime, the extra fee for mobile tower sharing has also been removed,” the official explained.Now cellular operators will have to pay a fee of ₹3 lakh for 5 years for rooftop and on the ground towers irrespective of sharing. For pole sites less than 12 metres high, a fee of ₹25,000 will be levied for a period of 5 years, but if the height exceeds 12 metres, the operator will have to pay a fee equal to that fixed for towers ( ₹3 lakh).Jogi Ram Jain, the standing committee chairman of the north corporation, said the rates have been reduced to bring a uniformity in the rates with the south corporation. “We had also received directions in this regard from the Union communications ministry. This may lead to reduction in revenue, but it will ultimately help to strengthen the mobile connectivity,” Jain said.Installation of mobile towers, especially the cell on wheels, has lately become a contentious issue with resistance to new installations being observed from resident welfare associations. Last month, more than 56 resident welfare associations (RWAs) in south Delhi also petitioned the south corporation on problems regarding the new mobile cellular towers while demanding a more consultative process to fix the locations.However, Delhi continues to face poor mobile connectivity issues. Last year, the Cellular Operator Association of India stated that Delhi has over 28,000 towers and 16,680 km of fiber network and in order to resolve the connectivity issues, the city needs over 18,000 additional towers by 2024.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-north-civic-body-reduces-fee-for-cell-phone-towers-101634149901563.html

Civic activists and NGOs have strongly opposed this action. “The PMC has given permission for cutting of 25 trees on the Pashan road in front of the Pune rural police headquarters. Soon the work of new footpaths and cycle tracks will begin here and for that these trees have been chopped. Our demand is that trees should not be cut down for any reason,” said Deepak Shrote of Vasundhara organisation. “When we came to know about the tree cutting, we immediately rushed to the spot. We were around 50 people and as we went there all the workers went away,” he added. “There are several cycle tracks around the city not used. Why are these 50-year old trees being cut down, which is harming the environment. This cycle track route should be changed,” said Prashant Kadam, another nearby citizen. When contacted, Ashok Ghorpade, PMC tree department, said, “We have nothing to do with this tree cutting. The order would have been given by local ward officers.

The FDA typically follows the advice of its experts but is not bound to do so.Moderna is seeking approval of a booster shot that includes 50 micrograms of vaccine, half of strength of its regular dose but still higher than the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, which contains 30 micrograms of vaccine.Dr. Ofer Levy, a panel member, said it is important to remember that the United States and Israel are different populations and that the vaccine Israel used is different, but he added that as both use similar mRNA technology the Israel findings are relevant.The panel will vote on whether Moderna boosters should be given six months after the second dose to individuals aged 65 and over, those at high-risk of severe Covid-19 and to people ages 18 to 64 who are at risk of frequently exposed to coronavirus infections due to their jobs.If the FDA signs off on Moderna's booster, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will make specific recommendations on who should get the shots."What we're seeing is a break in the epidemic curve in Israel," said Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, director of public health services at the Ministry of Health in Israel.She said the booster vaccination program, which now includes 50% of the population among all age groups, is starting to reduce infections even among the unvaccinated populations in Israel.Israel, which has been closely monitoring vaccines in its population, said in a slide presentation that administering a booster dose led to greater protection against confirmed infection in those aged 16 and above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fda-advisers-weigh-case-for-booster-shots-of-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-101634231065928.html

WHO report links it to Covid-19 pandemic||Deaths due to tuberculosis have increased for the first time in over a decade reversing years of global progress, the World Health Organization said on Thursday citing the 2021 Global TB report. The UN health agency said in its annual report that progress towards TB milestones has been hit hard by the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Not only the number of people dying of tuberculosis increased last year, but also far fewer people were diagnosed and treated for infectious bacterial disease.According to the report, tuberculosis was second only to Covid-19 as a leading cause of death from a single infectious agent. The impact of disruptions caused by the pandemic on new TB cases and related deaths could be “much worse” in 2021 and 2022, suggest modelling projections.WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement that the Global TB report confirms “our fears that the disruption of essential health services due to the pandemic could start to unravel years of progress against tuberculosis.”“This is alarming news that must serve as a global wake-up call to the urgent need for investments and innovation to close the gaps in diagnosis, treatment and care for the millions of people affected by this ancient but preventable and treatable disease,” Tedros added.The UN health agency estimates that about 4.1 million people currently suffering from TB have either went undiagnosed or have not officially reported to national authorities, up by 1.2 million from 2019. India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and China have contributed the most to the global reductions in TB notifications between 2019 and 2020.Despite some success stories from some countries and regions, global TB targets are "mostly off-track", according to the report.“The immediate priority is to restore access to and provision of essential TB services such that levels of TB case detection and treatment can recover to at least 2019 levels,” the report concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tb-deaths-rise-for-first-time-in-over-a-decade-who-report-links-it-to-covid-19-pandemic-101634230097849.html

The treasury department had also slapped sanctions on him at that time.There is an additional reward of $1 million for information that could lead to financially disrupting Khan’s racket.The 40-year-old Pakistani national is alleged to have “organised, led, and worked” with accomplices to have facilitated the travel of undocumented individuals to the United States between January 2015 and December 2020 in exchange for unspecified payments.“Abid Ali Khan allegedly operates a Pakistani-based smuggling network that facilitates the travel of undocumented individuals into the United States from the Middle East and southwest Asia in exchange for payment,” the US state department said while announcing the reward. It added that in addition to planning and coordinating international travel from Pakistan through multiple countries, Ali Khan also allegedly offered or provided false documents to foreign nationals to help them travel overseas.Smuggling organisations such as Abid Ali Khan’s use routes that go through Central America and involve days of going through perilous conditions, sometimes without food and water. The end result is often not worth all the risk or the money paid to the smugglers - those caught are sent right back.Indians are also known to have used these networks to reach United States, though it’s not clear if they were organised or led by Abid Ali Khan. Many of them seek asylum when caught, claiming persecution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-announces-reward-for-alleged-pakistani-smuggler-abid-ali-khan-101634227609925.html

Beijing, however, added that it will support the probe.The coronavirus first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, triggering the worst pandemic in a century.The WHO on Wednesday announced a new probe to trace the origin of the virus and released a proposed list of 25 experts to advise it on next steps.Chinese scientist Yungui Yang of Beijing Institute of Genomics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences is a leading Chinese scientist included in the Scientific Advisory Group on the Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO).Beijing has dismissed accusations that it withheld critical data during an earlier WHO probe into the origin of Covid-19 in February, saying that the investigation was politicised by the US and that the scope of the search should be widened to other countries.Asked to comment on the new probe, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said it should be carried out in the “spirit of science” and shouldn’t be used as a political tool.“China will continue to support and participate in international coronavirus origins -tracing, yet opposes any form of political manipulation on the issue,” Zhao said on Thursday.“China has always maintained that the tracing of virus origins is a serious and complex scientific issue, and that research should be conducted by scientists in cooperation,” Zhao said.He added that the result of the previous study on the matter should be respected. In August, vice foreign minister Ma Zhaoxu had said China opposes “political tracing… and abandoning the joint report” issued after a WHO expert team visited Wuhan in January.“We support scientific tracing,” Ma had said.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in June that it was premature to rule out a potential link between the Covid-19 pandemic and a laboratory leak, adding that he had asked China to be more transparent as scientists search for the origin of the coronavirus.National health commission (NHC) vice minister Zeng Yixin had also told reporters in June that the WHO’s second planned probe had listed the hypothesis that China had violated lab regulations and leaked the virus as one of the major research objectives, and he was “very shocked” after reading the proposal.Zeng said China cannot accept the current version of the WHO plan because it has been compromised by political manipulation and disrespects scientific facts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-china-warns-against-manipulation-of-new-who-virus-origin-probe-101634225449046.html

The comments came after Union home minister Amit Shah referred to surgical strike in his speech in Goa. Remembering former Goa chief minister and India's former defence minister Manohar Parrikar, Amit Shah on Thursday said the surgical strike was a new chapter in India's defence."Surgical strike under PM Modi and former defence minister Manohar Parrikar was an important step. We sent out a message that no one can disturb India's borders. There was a time for talks, But now is the time to reciprocate," Amit Shah said.India now gives befitting reply: Amit Shah warns Pakistan, refers to surgical strikeCriticising the defence policy of the UPA government, Amit Shah said there used to be talks when India's border got attacked. But now is the time to reciprocate. "When the terrorists attacked Poonch, India gave a befitting reply in the form of surgical strike. That was the beginning of a new chapter when India conveyed the message that it will give a reply in the same language," Amit Shah said.Pakistan said Amit Shah's statement, which has been interpreted as a veiled warning for more surgical strikes, is irresponsible and provocative. "His delusional statement only goes to further demonstrate the BJP-RSS combine’s propensity to stoke regional tensions for both ideological reasons and political expediency, based on enmity towards Pakistan," Pakistan's ministry of foreign affairs said in the statement. “While Pakistan is a peace-loving country, we will spare no effort in resolutely thwarting any aggressive designs," it said. "Pakistan’s swift response to India’s Balakot misadventure in 2019, including the downing of Indian combat aircraft and capture of Indian Air Force pilot, fully demonstrated the will, capacity and preparedness of our armed forces to deter Indian aggression," it said.Union minister Amit Shah's statement and Pakistan's reaction come in the backdrop of increased incidents of civilians' killing in J&K. Amit Shah will visit J&K between October 23 and October 25, his first visit after the scrapping of Article 370 in August 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-condemns-amit-shah-s-surgical-strike-comment-says-it-s-peaceloving-101634221957233.html
14-10-2021||World||Norway's bow-and-arrow attack possibly an 'act of terror', says police||The killing of five people in Norway in a bow-and-arrow attack appears to be an "act of terror," the Norwegian security service said Thursday, with the suspect, a Danish Muslim convert, already on their radar over fears he had been radicalised.Four women and a man died and two others were injured on Wednesday in the south-eastern town of Kongsberg in Norway's deadliest attack in a decade."The events in Kongsberg currently appear to be an act of terror, but the investigation... will determine in closer detail what the acts were motivated by," Norway's intelligence service PST said in a statement."We're talking about a convert to Islam," police official Ole Bredrup Saeverud told reporters on Thursday, adding: "There were fears linked to radicalisation previously."Saeverud said the 37-year-old suspect had confessed to the facts of the matter during questioning. Those who were killed during the attack were all aged between 50 and 70."We are investigating among other things to determine whether this was an act of terror," Saeverud added.Reports that linked him to radicalisation pre-dated this year, Saeverud said, and police had followed up at the time. "We haven't had any reports about him in 2021, but earlier," he said."We're relatively sure that he acted alone."PST also confirmed that the suspect was known to them but added the couldn't give "further details about him."It aslo said they didn't believe the threat level in the country had changed, describing it as "moderate"."Our evaluation is that what happened in Kongsberg Wednesday October 13 does not change the national threat assessment," PST said.Murder in Norway is rare.It was the deadliest attack since far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 people in 2011.Since then, Norway has seen one other far-right attack, carried out by a self-proclaimed neo-Nazi who opened fire into a mosque.'Like Kabul'On Thursday it was largely quiet in Kongsberg, a picturesque town of 25,000 people with wooden facades and the foliage changing colour for the autumn.Streets were almost empty with only a light police presence.A few police officers stood outside a store where part of the attack took place. A glass door there was chipped by a shot.Two candles flickered outside the town's church.The suspect was due to appear before a judge on Friday for a custody hearing.He was undergoing a psychiatric examination on Thursday, the prosecutor said.The victims have not yet been named publicly, but one of the wounded was an off-duty police officer who had been in a store.Norwegian media questioned why it took police more than a half-hour to arrest the suspect after the first reports of the attack.Police were informed of the attack at 6:13 pm (1613 GMT) and the suspect was arrested at 6:47 pm. He fired arrows at police, who responded with warning shots, Saeverud said.Thomas Nilsen was at home when he heard the screams and said images of war came to mind."I thought it was Kabul," he told AFP."I heard children screaming, barking and then the sound of a helicopter circling around my house," Terje Kristiansen, another witness, said."I didn't sleep much," he added.Arrow stuck in wallImages in the media showed a black arrow sticking out of a wall and what looked like competition-grade arrows lying on the ground.Police said Thursday the suspect had also used other weapons, but provided no details."These events shake us," said Prime Minister Erna Solberg, who stepped down Thursday, replaced by Jonas Gahr Store, whose Labour Party won recent parliamentary elections.Store lamented the "horrible acts", while Norway's King Harald said he was "appalled by the tragic events".Norwegian police are not normally armed, but after the attack, the National Police Directorate ordered that officers be armed nationwide.Norway rarely experiences such violence, but 10 years ago Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 people in the country's worst massacre since World War II.Breivik first set off a bomb in Oslo next to the building that housed the office of the prime minister, then went on a shooting spree at a summer camp for left-wing youth on the island of Utoya.Several planned jihadist attacks have also been foiled by security services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/norways-bow-and-arrow-attack-possibly-an-act-of-terror-says-police-101634214648756.html
14-10-2021||World||China warns against 'manipulation' as WHO renews virus origin probe||China's Foreign Ministry on Thursday warned against what it called possible “political manipulation” of a renewed probe by the World Health Organization into the origins of the coronavirus, while saying it would support the international body's efforts.The WHO on Wednesday released a proposed list of 25 experts to advise it on next steps in the search for the virus' origins after its earlier efforts were attacked for going too easy on China, where the first human cases were detected in late 2019.Beijing was accused of withholding raw data on early cases during a visit by a WHO team in February and has since resisted calls for further investigation, saying the U.S. and others were politicizing the matter.Foreign Ministry spoksperson Zhao Lijian said China would “continue to support and participate in global scientific tracing and firmly oppose any forms of political manipulation.”“We hope that all parties concerned, including the WHO secretariat and the advisory group, will effectively uphold an objective and responsible scientific attitude," Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing.The experts proposed by the U.N. health agency include some who were on the original team that went to the central Chinese city of Wuhan to investigate the origins of COVID-19.The findings of the original WHO-led team were inconclusive, and the experts released a report concluding it was “extremely unlikely” that the coronavirus leaked from a Wuhan lab, prompting criticism from outside scientists that the theory had not been properly vetted. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus later acknowledged it had been “premature” to dismiss the lab theory.Beijing has repeatedly questioned whether the virus did indeed originate in China, and has called for investigations into U.S. military laboratories without providing any solid evidence.China has largely stamped out cases of local transmission of COVID-19 infections through mask wearing, quarantining and electronic case tracing, along with sometimes draconian measures including lockdowns and mandatory mass testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-against-manipulation-as-who-renews-virus-origin-probe-101634209986055.html
14-10-2021||World||Pakistan airline suspends flights from Kabul citing Taliban's ‘heavy-handed’ interference||Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) on Thursday announced the suspension of flights from Kabul, accusing the Taliban of “heavy-handed” interference, according to news agencies. The Taliban government had ordered Pakistan’s national flag carrier to cut prices to the levels when it was operating during the Western-backed Afghan government. PIA accused the Sunni Pashtun group, which announced an interim government last month, of arbitrary rule changes and intimidation of staff."We are suspending our flight operations to Kabul from today because of the heavy-handedness of the authorities," news agency Reuters quoted PIA spokesperson as saying.Reports suggest that Taliban officials used derogatory language towards the airline staff and also manhandled a staff member. PIA spokesperson has said the flights to and from Kabul will remain suspended until “the situation becomes conducive”, reported AFP.The Pakistani carrier has been facing criticism for charging an exorbitant amount, as much as $1,200 for a one-way flight from Kabul to Islamabad. The airline has defended the ticket prices saying the operation was "not very lucrative financially" and it was only operating flights on "humanitarian grounds".PIA was the only international commercial airline operating on a regular basis out of Kabul. The airline had initially said that it would only operate chartered flights following requests from some international institutions and missions."Honestly, there will be some way for the evacuees to fly back before regular flights are resumed. At best, ours would be charter operations, operating on behest of certain customers demands who want to get their people out of Kabul," ANI had quoted PIA spokesperson Abdullah Khan as saying.Days after PIA's denial of resuming commercial flights to Kabul, the airline landed the first commercial international flight at Hamid Karzai International Airport since the Taliban retook power in Afghanistan.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-airline-suspends-flights-from-kabul-citing-taliban-s-interference-101634209039596.html

There are more than 3,000 pandals in Bangladesh observing Durga Puja at present.As the news spread like wildfire through digital media, there were violent attacks on pandals in Noakhali, Chandpur, Cox’s Bazaar, areas around Chattogram, Chapainawabganj, Pabna, Moulvibazara and Kurigram. However, there were no disturbances in Dhaka, Brahmanbaria, Jashore and other major cities.Initially, the police were slow to react but after the high commissioner of India spoke to the administration, there was heavy deployment of armed police and local enforcement agencies. Three people, including two desecration protestors, were killed in Chandpur and dozens were injured by rubber bullets in Cumilla.While Dhaka has ensured that heavy police deployment will continue till Friday, it is quite evident that communal flames were being fanned by the opposition JEI, which has had an injection of confidence after the Sunni terrorist force Taliban occupied Afghanistan. The JEI coined the slogan “ Bangladesh Banega Afghanistan” in a bid to radicalise the youth towards ultra-conservative Islam to achieve political objectives.“The basic idea behind October 13 incident was to embarrass Bangladesh’s government credentials and force a reaction from India,” said a diplomat based in Dhaka. The Jamaat thrives on radicalised youth to oppose the Sheikh Hasina government and is networked with other pro-Taliban regimes in Bangladesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jamaateislami-behind-the-pandal-violence-in-bangladesh-say-officials-101634205996205.html
14-10-2021||World||6 killed in Lebanon amid clashes over Beirut blast probe||Armed clashes erupted on Thursday in Beirut during a protest organised by the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and its allies against the lead judge probing last year's blast in the city's port.At least six people were killed and dozens were wounded in the most protracted and violent street fighting in the city in years, authorities said.The exchanges of fire along a former front line from the 1975-90 civil war involved pistols, automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades, and were reminiscent of that conflict.Gunfire echoed in the Lebanese capital for several hours and ambulances, sirens wailing, rushed to pick up casualties. Snipers shot from buildings. Bullets penetrated apartment windows in the area.It was not immediately clear what triggered Thursday's violence. Both sides said their protesters came under fire from snipers on rooftops.Tensions had been running high after the Iran-backed Hezbollah and its Shiite allies from the Amal Movement demanded the removal of Tarek Bitar, the judge leading the investigation into last year's massive port explosion.The two parties called for a protest near the Justice Palace, located along the former front line between Muslim Shiite and Christian areas.The violence unfolded while US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland was in town, meeting with Lebanese officials. Her schedule was slightly thrown off by the action on the streets.Nuland later told an airport news conference that an impartial judiciary is the guarantor of all rights, in apparent criticism of Hezbollah.“The Lebanese people deserve no less and the victims and the families of those lost in the port blast deserve no less,” she said. “Today's unacceptable violence makes clear what the stakes are.”The demands for Bitar's removal and calls for protests upset many who considered it blatant intervention in the work of the judiciary.The right wing Christian Lebanese Forces mobilised supporters Wednesday evening after Hezbollah and Amal called for the protest at the Justice Palace, located in a Christian area.Videos circulating on social media showed supporters of the Christian Lebanese Forces marching in the streets, carrying large crosses.As the clashes erupted, a journalist with The Associated Press saw a man open fire with a pistol and gunmen shooting in the direction of protesters from the balcony of a building.Several men fell immediately from the gunfire and bled on the street. The army deployed heavily and sent patrols to the area to search for the gunmen, following the exchanges of gunfire between the Muslim and Christian sides of the capital.Lebanese authorities said at least six people were killed and 30 wounded. A staffer at the emergency room at al-Sahel hospital said they received three bodies and 15 people who were wounded. One of the dead, a woman, had received a bullet to her head. Two of the injured were in critical condition.Four projectiles fell near a private French school, Freres of Furn el Chebbak, causing panic, a security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press.The students huddled in the central corridors with the windows open to avoid major impact, in scenes reminiscent of the civil war. Smoke covered the neighborhood where intense gunfire was relentless.A car caught fire, while a blaze was reported in a lower floor where residents were stuck and called for help.Sporadic shooting continued even after army troops deployed to the area Thursday. Residents and civilians in the area were ducking to avoid the shooting. Someone screamed: “Some martyrs on the ground!” People pulled one man who was apparently shot and down, away from the line of fire. Others pulled another body away.In some videos circulating online, some men were chanting: “Shiite Shiite” on the streets, as residents were running from the gunfire.In a statement, Prime Minister Najib Mikati appealed for calm and urged people “not to be dragged into civil strife.”The court probe centers on hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrates that had been improperly stored at a port warehouse that detonated on August 4, 2020, killing at least 215 people, injuring thousands and destroying parts of nearby neighbourhoods.It was one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in history and has further devastated the country already roiled by political divisions and unprecedented economic and financial meltdown.Bitar is the second judge to lead the complicated investigation - his predecessor was removed following legal challenges.Now Bitar has come up against formidable opposition from the powerful Hezbollah group and its allies who accuse him of singling out politicians for questioning, most of them allied with Hezbollah.None of Hezbollah's officials have so far been charged in the 14-month-old investigation.The tensions over the port blast add to Lebanon's enormous multiple troubles, including an unprecedented economic and financial meltdown, an energy crisis leading to extended electricity blackouts, hyperinflation and soaring poverty.Beirut resident Haneen Chemaly, who heads a local NGOs that provides social services, accused Lebanon's leaders of steering the country into civil war, saying it's “the last card they have to use.”“They have (driven) us into bankruptcy, devastation and now they are scaring us with the specter of civil war,” she said.Nuland, who said she was visiting to express support for Mikati's new government. At a press conference held at Beirut airport, she urged for “strong action” by the government that would demonstrate a will to enact reforms.The armed clash, however, could derail Mikati's month-old government even before it begins tackling Lebanon's economic meltdown.A Cabinet meeting was cancelled Wednesday after Hezbollah demanded urgent government action against the judge. One Hezbollah-allied minister said he and other Shiite Cabinet members would stage a walkout if Bitar isn't removed, further complicating Mikati's mission||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-killed-in-lebanon-amid-clashes-over-beirut-blast-probe-101634206547657.html

The attack took place in different parts of the Norwegian town of Kongsberg, 68 km southwest of the capital, Oslo, in which an off-duty police officer also got injured.“There earlier had been worries of the man having been radicalised,” regional police chief Ole B. Saeverud told a news conference, adding that they are yet to determine whether it was a terrorist attack.Four women and a man, aged between 50 and 70, were killed in Norway’s deadliest attack in a decade. Reports suggest that police were informed of the attack at 6:13 pm (local time) (4.13pm GMT) and the suspect was arrested at 6:47 pm (local time). While bow-and-arrow was mainly used for the attack, some other weapons were also used by the suspect.The regional police chief said the 37-year-old suspect, a Danish citizen, had confessed during questioning. The reports linking the suspect to radicalisation were before 2021 and police had followed up at the time, Saeverud added.Murders, let alone mass killings, in Norway are rare and the previous deadliest attack was in 2011 when far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 people.This time, the police said they are "talking about a convert to Islam" but are “relatively sure” that the suspect acted alone.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bowandarrow-attack-norway-suspect-known-to-police-had-coverted-to-islam-101634204223426.html

The list of ‘Dangerous Individuals and Organizations’ that Facebook doesn't allow on its platform was leaked by The Intercept on Tuesday.Hindutva group Sanatan Sanstha, banned Communist Party of India(Maoist) and Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah) are among the 10 groups from India on that Facebook list, according to The Intercept. So are the All Tripura Tiger Force, Kangleipak Communist Party, Khalistan Tiger Force, People’s Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak.

Another 14 people who showed no signs of life were among 55 taken to the hospital. In Taiwan, official confirmation of a death can only be made in the hospital.Li said the death toll could surpass 40, as firefighters conducted search and rescue efforts into the afternoon.Video shown on Taiwanese television showed orange flames and smoke billowing out of the lower floors of the building as firefighters sprayed water at it from the street. After daybreak, they could be seen spraying water into the middle floors of the still smoldering building from elevated platforms.The cause of the fire was unclear, but firefighters noted the flames burned most intensely where a lot of clutter had been piled up, the fire department statement said.Eyewitnesses told Taiwan media that they heard an explosion around 3 a.m.The building is about 40 years old with shops on the lower levels and apartments above.

The International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) said 99 per cent of Palau's population over 12 has had both shots of the Covid-19 vaccine as it praised what it said was the country’s "remarkable" pace of vaccination.The Red Cross cited Palau government figures which show that 16,152 people out of its population of about 18,000 have been given the Covid-19 jab. "It is important to celebrate the success of reaching high vaccination rates in many Pacific countries, including Palau, Fiji and the Cook Islands," Katie Greenwood, the head of the IFRC's Pacific office, said. However, Greenwood added it was "critical that we try to get everyone vaccinated ahead of the cyclone season, which threatens to damage homes and infrastructure, stretching resources and services needed to contain Covid-19".Also read | WHO forms 'last chance' to find Covid-19 origins, urges China to provide dataAccording to New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, there could be up to 12 tropical cyclones in the Southwest Pacific between November and next April.The body said in a statement that Palau, an archipelago of 500 islands in the western Pacific Ocean, is in the "top spot" and ahead of countries like Portugal, which was named one of the world's most vaccinated countries when 80 per cent of its 10 million people were fully immunised in September.Also read | Canada's Quebec postpones Covid-19 vaccine mandates, fearing healthcare crisisThe Red Cross also said that other Pacific nations are leading the world in vaccination rates, on a per capita basis. The Cook Islands with a population of 17,000 had 96 per cent of its eligible population fully vaccinated against Covid-19 and Fiji, which has 896,000 people, has given one dose to 96 per cent of the country’s eligible people, it said.However, other small countries in the region—the Solomon Islands with a population of 650,000 and Kiribati with a population of 119,000—have inoculated less than 10 per cent of their people against Covid-19. It also cited Our World in Data figures to add that Papua New Guinea has less than 1 per cent of its population fully vaccinated.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/this-country-has-beaten-the-world-with-99-covid-vaccination-101634195584905.html

14-10-2021||World||Japan PM dissolves parliament, paves way for election||Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is seeking a mandate for his policies in the October 31 parliamentary election. Meanwhile, the opposition has vowed to close Japan's income gap.Japan's new prime minister Fumio Kishida dissolved the lower house of parliament on Thursday, setting the stage for national elections later this month.Kishida, who formally took over the reins from Yoshihide Suga 11 days ago, will be seeking to maintain a lower house majority for his conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).The prime minister also enjoys reasonable public support , according to opinion polls.Voters in Japan will head to the polls on October 31 to choose a new parliament, and indirectly elect the country's next government.Kishida to lead LDP into pollsThe last lower house election was held in 2017 under Shinzo Abe, who pulled the long-ruling LDP further to the right while serving as Japan's longest-serving prime minister.This time, Kishida will lead the party, along with its coalition partner the Komeito party, into the election."I want to use the election to tell the people what we're trying to do and what we're aiming for," he told reporters at his office.Talking about his time in office so far, Kishida said: "I've had a very busy schedule but strangely, I'm not feeling tired — I'm feeling fulfilled."Opposition calls for ‘wealth distribution first’The country's largest opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ), announced its plan to focus on closing Japan's income gap with wealth redistribution if it were to win the election.A similar position has been announced by Kishida, blurring the policy differences between the LDP and CDPJ ahead of the election.“Wage hikes and distribution once growth is achieved.' This is what [former prime minister] Abe was saying. But there was no growth over the past eight, nine years, and no wage hikes,” CDPJ chief Yukio Edano told reporters.“If we don't distribute wealth first, no growth is achieved. This is a rather clear difference [between the two parties,” Edano said.The CDPJ has also highlighted its support for issues such as same-sex marriage and different surnames for couples.On the other hand, the LDP remains socially conservative, and Kishida has said he was not in favor of same-sex marriage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-pm-dissolves-parliament-paves-way-for-election-101634194851693.html

Iran is accused of violating the deal by enriching uranium.The United States and Israel said Wednesday they were looking at further possible ways of dealing with Iran if Tehran does not come back in good faith to negotiations to rescue a landmark nuclear deal.Speaking after three-way talks with the foreign ministers of Israel and the United Arab Emirates, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said "other options" were on the table if Iran were to reject an offer to comply again with the agreement in the event that the US rejoins it."We will look at every option to deal with the challenge posed by Iran," he said. "And we continue to believe that diplomacy is the most effective way to do that. But it takes two to engage in diplomacy, and we have not seen from Iran a willingness to do that at this point."Israel threatens actionPossible non-diplomatic options could include military force, but also a further tightening of sanctions or covert actions against Iran.Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid was more forthright in his warnings to Tehran."There are moments when nations must use force to protect the world from evil,'' he said. "If a terror regime is going to acquire a nuclear weapon we must act," he said."Israel reserves the right to act at any given moment in any way. That is not only our right, it is also our responsibility,'' he added.What is the nuclear deal?Under the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and several world powers, including the US and Germany, Iran agreed to discontinue certain elements of its nuclear program that the West fears could lead to the development of nuclear weapons.In return for that and for allowing comprehensive international inspections of its nuclear facilities, the country was to receive billions of dollars' worth of sanctions relief.The deal has been in jeopardy since former US President Donald Trump withdrew from it in 2018, with Iran violating a number of the agreements it had made.Israel was not a party to the deal, which was negotiated by the administration of former US President Barack Obama.Iran has indicated that it might be ready to come back to indirect negotiations on the deal with the US but has not set a definite date.Tehran has always denied it is seeking to build nuclear weapons, claiming its atomic research is for civilian purposes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-warns-of-other-options-on-iran-s-nuclear-program-if-diplomacy-fails-101634190707261.html
14-10-2021||World||Canada: Quebec postpones Covid-19 vaccine mandates, fearing healthcare crisis||Quebec, the first province in Canada scheduled to enforce a Covid-19 vaccine mandate from Friday, has postponed its enforcement by a month due to concerns that it may trigger a healthcare crisis caused by depleted staffing.Quebec’s decision to pause the move came as public sector unions continue to oppose mandatory Covid-19 vaccine requirements for central and provincial government employees.The prospect of depleted staffing amid a fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic eventually compelled Quebec to postpone the mandate deadline to November 15. Healthcare workers, including doctors and nurses who were not fully vaccinated by the original October 15 deadline faced the prospect of being suspended.The “risk” to the healthcare system in Quebec is considered to be “too high” if the mid-October vaccine mandate sparks a crisis, fears provincial health minister Christian Dubé. According to CBC News, in remarks in French on Wednesday, he said, “We want to apply mandatory vaccinations for healthcare workers, but not at the expense of our ability to treat citizens.”While over 90% of healthcare workers in Quebec are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, around 22,000 who have taken only one dose or none are liable for suspension under new vaccine mandates.Unions representing healthcare workers have been opposing the measure, as has been the case at the federal level, where the deadline for enforcement is on October 30. The federal vaccine mandates, championed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, are piecemeal and do not cover all employees such as the Canadian Armed Forces, which is exempted from compulsory jabs against Covid-19. However, a face-off is still looming as the date of enforcement nears.The Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC), which represents 215,000 central government employees, has contested the expected implementation and said it will “continue to represent unvaccinated members who have punitive action taken against them as a result of their vaccination status”. Similarly, the National Police Federation, which represents Royal Canadian Mounted Police personnel, had asserted it will “continue to support members’ access to [Covid-19] vaccines, and their choice to be vaccinated or not”.NO COVID-19 CASES ON DIRECT FLIGHTS FROM INDIA In another development, over a fortnight following the lifting of a five-month-long ban on direct passenger flights from India to Canada, no Covid-19 cases have been reported among those who have flown in since, according to data from Public Health Agency of Canada.The ban, first imposed in April, was originally aimed at curbing the spread of the Delta variant of Covid-19 in Canada when a devastating second wave was at its peak in India. However, it was then renewed several times and testing requirements for those flying in to Canada via other countries were put in place. Those measures were kept in place even as Canada opened up for all fully vaccinated travellers before finally lifting the ban on September 27.Data from the Public Health Agency of Canada, tracking incidence of infections on international flights, shows that no cases have been reported so far from direct flights originating from India, either operated by Air Canada or Air India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-quebec-postpones-covid-19-vaccine-mandates-fearing-healthcare-crisis-101634190404458.html

Also known as ‘World Eye Day’ or ‘World Vision Day’, the occasion is an international day of awareness to focus attention on and encouraging everyone to think about the importance of their own eye health.World Sight Day: HistoryWorld Sight Day (WSD) is coordinated by the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB). The day began to be officially observed as an IAPB event in the year 2000 and has been marked in several different ways in nations across the world each year since then. The Queen of the United Kingdom joined the awareness campaign for World Sight Day in the year 2020, marking a milestone in recognition.World Sight Day: SignificanceEye health impacts education, employment, quality of life, poverty and so many other sustainable development goals. “This WSD we want organisations and the public to come together to encourage governments, corporations, institutions and individuals to actively support universal access to eye health and ensure that everyone counts,” the IAPB wrote in an official post.World Sight Day is supported by over 150 IAPB member organisations, including every major eye care NGO in the world, apex professional bodies for ophthalmology and optometry, teaching hospitals and corporations, united in working together to eliminate avoidable blindness and visual impairment.World Sight Day: EventsEvery year, hundreds of activities are planned and executed on World Sight Day. This year, for World Sight Day 2021, the IAPB pledged to work with members and partners to deliver some “high-impact events of our own” with the World Sight Day Global Challenge.On World Sight Day 2021, the IAPB has taken out a ‘social media toolkit’ to address issues of eye health around the world. “We want to tell everyone to #LoveYourEyes, and get 1 million people to have a sight test or care for their eyes,” the toolkit explained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-sight-day-2021-history-significance-and-how-to-raise-awareness-101634187152209.html
14-10-2021||World||37-year-old Danish man suspected to be behind bow and arrow attack in Norway||A 37-year-old Danish citizen is suspected of killing five people in a bow-and-arrow attack in the Norwegian town of Kongsberg in a rare incident of mass killing in Norway, police said on Thursday.Two people, including an off-duty police officer, were wounded in the Wednesday evening attacks, which took place in different locations in the town, 68 km (42 miles) southwest of the capital, Oslo."This very serious situation is of course making a deep impression on Kongsberg and those who live here," district police chief Oeyvind Aas said in a statement.The suspect, who was apprehended, was believed to have been acting alone, police said. They said nothing about a possible motive.Several of the attacks were committed with a bow and arrow, Aas said late on Wednesday, though police were also investigating whether other weapons were used.The death toll was the worst of any attack in Norway since 2011 when far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 people, most of them teenagers at a youth camp.The police said they were giving information on the man's nationality after rumours swirled on social media about people not linked to the attacks.Norway's incoming prime minister, Jonas Gahr Stoere, who is due to take power on Thursday after winning a general election last month, said he had been kept informed by the outgoing government."What we've learned from Kongsberg bears witness of a gruesome and brutal act," Stoere said in a statement to news agency NTB.The attacks went on for more than half an hour over a "large area" of Kongsberg, including at a Coop Extra grocery store, the Aftenposten newspaper cited police as saying.A woman living near the store said she had heard alarms as she was walking home."I saw a group of police officers, including one who held several arrows in his hand," the woman, Marit Hoefle, told the newspaper.Investigators are considering whether the attacks amounted to an act of terrorism and said they would give more details of the incident later on Thursday.Police were interrogating the suspect and he was cooperating, his defence lawyer said."He is cooperating and is giving detailed statements regarding this event," lawyer Fredrik Neumann told public broadcaster NRK.Images from one of the crime scenes showed an arrow that appeared to be stuck in the wall of a wood-paneled building.About 28,000 people live in the Kongsberg municipality.Following the attacks, the police directorate said it had ordered officers nationwide to carry firearms. Norwegian police are normally unarmed but officers have access to guns when needed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/37yearold-danish-man-suspected-to-be-behind-bow-and-arrow-attack-in-norway-101634188138699.html

As the Covid-19 pandemic prompted school closings and disrupted classrooms last year, 415 children from elementary to high school age were recorded as having taken their own lives, according to the education ministry's survey.The number is up by nearly 100 from last year, the highest since record-keeping began in 1974, the Asahi newspaper reported on Thursday.Suicide has a long history in Japan as a way of avoiding perceived shame or dishonour, and its suicide rate has long topped the Group of Seven nations, but a national effort brought numbers down by roughly 40 percent over 15 years, including 10 straight years of decline from 2009.Amid the pandemic, suicides increased in 2020 after a decade of declines, with the number of women committing suicide surging amid the emotional and financial stress caused by the coronavirus pandemic, although fewer men took their own lives.The education ministry said a record high of more than 196,127 school children were absent for 30 days or more, media reported.The results showed that changes in school and household environments due to the pandemic have had a huge impact on children's behaviour, NHK quoted an education ministry official as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-japan-battles-covid-19-child-suicide-rate-highest-in-over-40-years-report-101634181525575.html

Notably, the development comes days after the Afghan capital had in a similar fashion plunged into darkness amid reports that the country's new Taliban rulers have not yet paid Central Asian electricity suppliers or reinstituted the framework to collect money from consumers.The technical issues emerged in the northern Afghan province of Baghlan, Sputnik reported citing DABS. “The technical staff is working to resolve this issue as soon as possible,” the statement read.Why is electricity supply dwindling in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan?The newly anointed Taliban rulers, according to reports, are struggling with the non-payment of electricity dues to Central Asian electricity suppliers.Almost 80 per cent of the supply of Afghanistan's entire power consumption is imported from neighbouring countries like Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. When the Taliban launched a lightning-fast offensive and seized Kabul from the erstwhile Ashraf Ghani government, the outfit took over the state energy utility, also inheriting all its debts in the process. The new rulers, however, have failed to pay off the creditors due to a lack of funds and a framework to collect money from consumers.How does the Taliban plan to pay off the debt?Afghanistan's electricity body, now under Taliban control, is reportedly intending to sell off the estates of its debtors in a bid to pay the nearly $62 million worth of power bills to the central Asian countries. Safiullah Ahamdzai, the acting head of DABAS, told news agencies that the plan will be implemented, all debts will be paid off to prevent electricity exporting countries from cutting off the supply, and only then will Afghanistan enjoy uninterrupted power connection.However, a former head of DABS, Daud Noorzai, said earlier this month that in case the Taliban fail to implement the ‘plan’ and do not pay off the bills to the Central Asian energy suppliers, electricity supply to the Afghan capital province of Kabul could be cut off by winter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blackout-in-kabul-did-taliban-fail-to-pay-electricity-suppliers-101634177392155.html

Both countries share a border with Afghanistan.Tajikistan's national security chief, Saimumin Yatimov, for his part told the video conference that he had registered an "intensification" of attempts to "smuggle drugs, weapons, ammunition" from Afghanistan into his country.Afghanistan has long been the world's largest producer of opium and heroin, with profits from the illicit trade helping fund the Taliban.Earlier Wednesday French President Emmanuel Macron hosted Tajikistan's leader Emomali Rakhmon in Paris, vowing to help the Central Asian state maintain stability.While the Taliban has said it does not pose a threat to Central Asian countries, the ex-Soviet republics in the region have previously been targeted by attacks attributed to allies of Afghan Islamists.Last week the Kremlin's envoy to Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, said Russia will invite the Taliban to Moscow for international talks on Afghanistan scheduled for October 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraq-syria-militants-actively-entering-afghanistan-russia-s-putin-101634172176085.html

I'm looking at new studies, I already have the highest immunization, why would I get vaccinated?" the 66-year-old said late Tuesday night in an interview with Jovem Pan radio."It would be the same as betting 10 reais on the lottery to win two. It doesn't make sense."A coronavirus skeptic, Bolsonaro previously claimed the Pfizer vaccine could turn people into crocodiles due to secondary effects.Since contracting Covid-19 in July 2020, Bolsonaro has repeatedly claimed that tests have shown he has a large number of antibodies to fight the virus and thus does not need to be vaccinated, something experts dispute.Bolsonaro is also strongly opposed to the health passes, given to those that are vaccinated, required by some large Brazilian cities in order to access certain public spaces."For me, freedom comes before everything else. If a citizen doesn't want to get vaccinated, that's his right and that's the end of it," Bolsonaro told Jovem Pan.Almost 100 million of Brazil's 213 million population are entirely vaccinated against Covid-19, while another 50 million have had one dose.Last week, the country surpassed 600,000 deaths from Covid-19, the second-worst death toll in the world after the United States.Bolsonaro's refusal to get vaccinated has also solicited criticism from abroad, notably in September when he traveled to New York for the UN General Assembly.While there, he was photographed standing in a street eating pizza, something Brazilian press attributed to his being unable to enter restaurants due to being unvaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/doesnt-make-sense-brazil-s-bolsonaro-decides-not-to-get-vaccinated-against-covid19-101634171899863.html

Eleven new deaths were recorded.Most new cases were detected in Melbourne, with the city now clearly at the centre of the country's Delta outbreak.Sydney, where the first case was detected in mid-June, continued a downward trend in new cases. Daily infections in New South Wales eased further to 406 on Thursday, the majority in Sydney, well down from the state's pandemic high of 1,599 hit in early September.Sydney could enjoy more freedoms from Monday, beating forecasts by a week, as the proportion of fully vaccinated people above 16 is expected to top 80% this weekend. The city came out of a lockdown of more than 100 days earlier this week.As Sydney and Melbourne aim to begin to live with COVID-19, some virus-free states have flagged they may delay their reopening plans even after higher vaccinations amid fears outbreaks could overwhelm hospitals.Officials are bracing for a spike in infections in Australia's two largest cities once tough restrictions end, but they hope higher vaccination rates will limit hospitalisations.Higher inoculation coverage among the most vulnerable populations has helped Australia to keep its death rate from the Delta flare-up lower than last year's outbreaks. Still, Delta has accounted for about 77% of the country's 136,000 cases. Total deaths stand at 1,495 since the pandemic began.Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt on Thursday said Australia's medical regulator has allowed Pfizer to submit an application to allow five-to 11-year-olds to be vaccinated with its COVID-19 vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australias-victoria-sees-record-daily-surge-in-covid-19-cases-101634168054966.html

This will be the second time that the Indian side will come face-to-face with Taliban representatives at a Moscow Format meeting since 2018, and also the second formal contact between the two sides since the Taliban marched into Kabul on August 15 after the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani government. India has so far held off on any formal recognition of the Taliban setup in Kabul, with New Delhi saying there are questions about its legitimacy as it is not inclusive and was formed without negotiations. “We have received an invitation for the Moscow Format meeting on Afghanistan on October 20. We will be participating in it,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said during a weekly news briefing. There is no confirmation on who will attend the meeting but India is likely to be represented by a joint secretary from the external affairs ministry, he said. India participated in the second meeting under the Moscow Format in November 2018 at a “non-official level”, sending retired ambassadors TCA Raghavan and Amar Sinha to represent the country. That meeting was attended by a five-member Taliban delegation led by Sher Mohammed Abbas Stanekzai, a key player in the group’s political office in Qatar and the current deputy foreign minister. Stanekzai also met India’s ambassador to Qatar, Deepak Mittal, at the Indian embassy in Doha on August 31, the first officially acknowledged contact between the two sides. The Moscow Format was launched in 2017 as a six-party mechanism for consultations between representatives of Afghanistan, China, Pakistan, Iran, India and Russia. Russia also started the “extended troika” dialogue on Afghanistan that includes the US, China and Pakistan. This will be the first meeting of the Moscow Format since the Taliban takeover of Kabul. Russia and the Central Asian states have concerns about terrorism and instability spilling over from Afghanistan. Russia is particularly concerned about the activities of Islamic State on Afghan soil. The world community has mounted pressure on the Taliban to deliver on its commitments regarding human rights and counter-terrorism even as it tries to fashion a response to the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. Bagchi didn’t give a direct response to a question on India providing humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan but reiterated New Delhi’s call for the world community to create the “best possible enabling environment”, including unimpeded and unrestricted access for aid providers and non-discriminatory distribution of aid. “India’s policy towards Afghanistan is guided by our friendship with the Afghan people. We have in the past provided assistance both for infrastructure as well as humanitarian [needs],” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-participate-in-moscow-format-dialogue-on-afghanistan-101634236132269.html
14-10-2021||India||Maharashtra housing minister Jitendra Awhad arrested on kidnapping, assault charges||Maharashtra housing minister Jitendra Awhad was arrested on Thursday evening by the Thane Vartak Nagar police in connection with the Anand Karmuse kidnapping and assault case. He was later released on bail. Earlier, five people had been arrested for the alleged abduction, including three police constables. Thane resident, Anant Karmuse, 40, had alleged that he was beaten up inside Awhad’s bungalow by 10-15 people for posting a morphed photograph of the leader on social media for his stand against the call by PM Narendra Modi to hold a candlelight vigil on April 5 at 9.00 pm to applaud the efforts of all those involved in the battle against Covid-19.After Karmuse posted the morphed photograph of Awhad, two people in police uniform came to his house and asked him to accompany them to the police station. Karmuse alleged that instead of the police station he was taken to Awhad’s bungalow in Thane, beaten up by around by 10 to 15 people and was made to apologise for the post. On Thursday afternoon at about 2.45 pm, Awhad was called by the Thane Vartak Nagar police who wanted to record his statement. Later he was arrested under Sections 365, 324, 143, 147, 148, 506 of Indian Penal Code. “After Awhad’s arrest, the Vartak Nagar Police recorded his statement and then he was produced in Thane court. The court released him on bail on a bond of ₹10,000 and one surety. He was arrested in connection with the kidnapping and assault on Anant Karmuse, a Thane resident,” Deputy Commissioner of Police, Zone V, Vinay Rathod said. “He would have been arrested one-and-half years back. Police officials arrested him on the ground and evidence which I had provided then not now. Why was he not arrested at that time? They have CCTV footage of his bungalow and he is clearly visible. I never stopped the fight against him despite several threats, and bribes offered. I will fight till he gets convicted,” Anant Karmuse said.Following the arrest of the minister, the BJP has demanded his resignation. Kirit Somaiya tweeted, “BJP demands Minister Jitendra Awhad must be sacked from the Ministry.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-housing-minister-jitendra-awhad-arrested-on-kidnapping-assault-charges-101634235952021.html
14-10-2021||India||India confirms participation in Oct 20 Moscow Format meet on Afghanistan||India on Thursday confirmed its participation in a meeting of the Moscow Format dialogue on Afghanistan on October 20 that is set to be joined by representatives of the Taliban setup in Kabul. This will be the second time that the Indian side will come face-to-face with Taliban representatives at a Moscow Format meeting since 2018, and also the second formal contact between the two sides since the Taliban marched into Kabul on August 15 after the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani government. India has so far held off on any formal recognition of the Taliban setup in Kabul, with New Delhi saying there are questions about its legitimacy as it is not inclusive and was formed without negotiations. “We have received an invitation for the Moscow Format meeting on Afghanistan on October 20. We will be participating in it,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said during a weekly news briefing. There is no confirmation on who will attend the meeting but India is likely to be represented by a joint secretary from the external affairs ministry, he said.

As reported, there have been primarily three findings from Aryan's WhatApp chats.First, the 6 gram charas that was found on Arbaaz Merchant was for the consumption of Arbaaz and Aryan, the NCB has claimed. NCB counsel, additional solicitor general Anil Singh told the court to note the WhatsApp chat between Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant where 'they said they are going to have a blast', LiveLaw reported. ASG says that the panchnama clearly shows that the 6 gms of charas found from Arbaaz Merchant's shoe was for their consumption. "They said 'they' are going to have a blast," please note this. #AryanKhanBailSecond, the NCB earlier said in the court that Aryan Khan had interacted with some foreign nationals. Two foreign nationals have been arrested in connection with the case.Third, Aryan Khan's WhatsApp conversation involved the mention of some ‘bulk quantity’, which the NCB assumed is not for personal consumption and accused Aryan Khan of drugs trafficking.'In the land of Mahatma Gandhi': NCB's 5 points opposing Aryan Khan's bail pleaNot Queen's English: What Aryan Khan's lawyer saidAryan Khan's lawyer Amit Desai said the context of WhatsApp chats matters the most.

The way they communicate is very different," Desai said.He also argued that Aryan spend some time abroad recently. If the conversation is from that time, one must remember that many things are legal in other countries, he said. "Conversations on chats can often be misunderstood. WhatsApp chats are supposed to be private conversations. But I am told there are no messages or conversations on the mobile about the rave party," he said."We need to see… is this youthful banter, friendly gossip, joke..is someone trying to tell him I got this, I did this, were they trying to joke or laugh about it?"

The coal minister added they have been supplying 2 million tonnes of coal since Wednesday, indicating the situation is headed towards improvement.“Closure of some coal mines and inundation of a few others due to monsoon led to the hindrance in coal supply to power plants,” news agency PTI quoted Joshi as saying."We can produce two million tonnes of coal per day," he added, acknowledging there is a need to produce more coal.The minister also paid a visit to the Ashoka mine of the Central Coalfields Ltd (CCL) at Piparwar in Chatra district of Jharkhand. After the visit, he said the power plants in the country will continue to receive the required amount of coal. Joshi also held discussions with officials of CCL and Eastern Coalfields Ltd (ECL) on the prevailing situation. Apart from holding discussion on the coal crisis, the minister also discussed the issue related to the availability of land for mining at the meeting, PTI reported.Many states in the past few days have given power cut warnings if the coal crisis doesn't improve. While load shedding is already taking place in Karnaraka's capital city Bengaluru, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi claiming that power generation was being affected and requested him to intervene in the matter. Shortly after, the Ministry of Coal said there was ample coal available in the country to meet the demand for power plants.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coal-shortage-was-due-to-monsoons-pralhad-joshi-101634213491977.html
14-10-2021||India||India backs WHO move for new expert group to probe origins of Covid-19 pandemic||India on Thursday backed the World Health Organization (WHO)’s decision to create an expert group to examine the origins of new pathogens, including the Coronavirus that causes Covid-19, and said all countries should cooperate with the probe. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced the launch of the Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO) at a news briefing on Wednesday, and Michael Ryan, executive director of WHO’s health emergencies programme, said this represented the “last chance” to determine the origins of SARS-CoV-2. India has consistently backed all moves by WHO to establish the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, and called on all stakeholders, including China, to cooperate with such efforts. External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi reiterated this position when he was asked about the new expert group at a regular news briefing on Thursday. “Let me just reiterate what we have stated till now – we have our interest in further studies and data on this issue of the origin [of the Coronavirus] and the need for understanding and cooperation by all concerned,” he said, without naming China. The Indian side, he said, was gathering details of what the new move by WHO would entail. Raman Gangakhedkar, the Dr CG Pandit National Chair at the Indian Council of Medical Research in India, and Yungui Yang of the Beijing Institute of Genomics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, are among the 26 members of SAGO. Responding to WHO’s announcement, China warned against any “political manipulation” of the renewed probe into the origins of Covid-19 but said it would support the investigation. The Coronavirus first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, triggering the worst pandemic in a century. Asked about the new probe, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said it should be conducted in the “spirit of science” and not used as a political tool. The result of the previous study on the matter should be respected, he added. “China will continue to support and participate in international Coronavirus origins -tracing, yet opposes any form of political manipulation on the issue,” Zhao told a news briefing in Beijing. He added, “China has always maintained that tracing of virus origins is a serious and complex scientific issue and that research should be conducted by scientists in cooperation.” Tedros said SAGO will advise WHO on developing a global framework to guide studies into “origins of emerging and re-emerging pathogens with epidemic and pandemic potential, including SARS-CoV-2”. He said that while SARS-CoV-2 is the latest virus to spark a pandemic, “it will not be the last”. Ryan noted the current pandemic “has stopped our whole world” and said the expert group “may be our last chance to understand the origins of this virus in a...collective and mutually responsible way”. He urged everyone, including countries, to create space for discussions on the issue. Maria van Kerkhove, WHO’s technical lead on Covid-19, said the expert group is expected to call for further studies in China by international missions. “I anticipate that the SAGO in its discussions about the urgent next steps for understanding the origins of the current pandemic will recommend further studies in China and potentially elsewhere...We very much hope that there will be further missions to China and other countries,” she said. The 26 members of SAGO were selected from more than 700 applications following a global call. Tedros said they were chosen for their world-class expertise and experience in a range of disciplines, and geographic and gender diversity. There will be a two-week public consultation period for WHO to receive feedback on the proposed members. China has dismissed theories that the Coronavirus leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan and has said no more visits by international experts are needed. A WHO-led team spent four weeks in and around Wuhan this year with Chinese scientists, and said in a joint report in March that the Coronavirus had probably been transmitted from bats to humans through another animal, but further research was needed. Tedros has said this investigation was hampered by a dearth of raw data pertaining to the first days of the Covid-19 outbreak and called for laboratory audits. Van Kerkhove said “more than three dozen recommended studies” must still be carried out to determine how the Coronavirus crossed from animal species to humans. Reported Chinese testing for antibodies in Wuhan residents in 2019 will be “absolutely critical” to understanding the virus’s origins, she said. WHO, in an editorial in Science, said detailed investigations of the earliest known and suspected cases in China prior to December 2019 are still needed, including analyses of stored blood samples from 2019 in Wuhan and retrospective searches of hospital and mortality data for earlier cases. Labs in the area where the first reports of human infections emerged in Wuhan must be a focus, as ruling out an accident requires sufficient evidence, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-backs-who-move-for-new-expert-group-to-probe-origins-of-covid-19-pandemic-101634221548272.html

An announcement regarding Sidhu's post in the PPCC is expected on Friday.“Navjot Sidhu has clearly stated that decision of the Congress President will be acceptable to him. The instructions are clear that Navjot Sidhu should work as Punjab Congress President and set up organisational structure. An announcement will be made tomorrow,” Harish Rawat said after the meeting.Sidhu, who was made the Punjab Congress chief in July this year, resigned last month due to internal differences with the party. His resignation was, however, rejected by the Congress high command.“I expressed my concerns regarding Punjab and Punjab Congress to party high-command. I've full faith in Congress president, Priyanka ji and Rahul ji. Whatever decision they'll take, it'll for the betterment of Congress and Punjab. I'll follow their directions,” Sidhu told reporters outside the AICC office.‘Some things take time’Earlier this week, Rawat had, in a tweet, informed that Sidhu will meet them to discuss "organisational matters" of the Punjab Congress.“Navjot Singh Sidhu and Charanjit Channi have spoken on some issues, a solution will emerge...there are some things that take time,” Rawat had said prior to the meeting today.This is the first official meeting between Sidhu and the Congress central leadership since the resignation.Meanwhile, yesterday Sidhu told reporters that he is always grateful to the party high command for "facilitating" him but asserted that there "can never be compromises"."I have 'ishq' with Punjab. What is the meaning of 'Ishq'? People think it is something physical. No... It breaks away from all relationships and this is the kind of my 'Ishq' for Punjab. Those who understand my 'Ishq' for Punjab will never level any allegations against me," he said."Everywhere my merit was ignored. In politics, 5 can be made 50 and 50 can be turned into zero... I will always be grateful to them. But how to move forward by making compromises? This system stands up like a monster and bites you," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navjot-sidhu-meets-congress-leaders-in-delhi-harish-rawat-says-some-things-take-time-101634220502494.html

The participation will be at the joint secretary level, the ministry has confirmed. This will be the second time New Delhi will be face to face with the Taliban after the group toppled the Ashraf Ghani government in a coup on August 15, and the first meeting after the Taliban announced its Cabinet.Moscow Format is a negotiation mechanism established in 2017 to address the issues of Afghanistan. It includes countries like Afghanistan, China, Pakistan, Iran and India. The United States too had participated in Moscow Format before. This is not the first time that the Taliban will be invited to the platform, but the first time after they have their government in Afghanistan.At G20 special summit on Afghanistan, PM Modi calls for inclusive administration in KabulAmid international appeal for an inclusive government in Afghanistan, Russia has decided to continue its Moscow Format. The Taliban too are looking for international recognition while the countries are buying time before recognising the Taliban government in Afghanistan.On international platforms, India has clarified its stance that it will stand by the Afghan people. PM Modi has urged the international community to ensure that Afghan territory does not become a source of radicalisation and terrorism.The first official contact between New Delhi and the Taliban was on August 31 when the ambassador of India to Qatar, Deepak Mittar, met Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai, the head of Taliban's political office in Doha. That meeting took place at the Embassy of India in Doha at the request of the Taliban side.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1st-moscow-format-after-taliban-takeover-on-oct-20-india-says-it-will-attend-101634219423530.html
14-10-2021||India||Amid opposition, Adani Group takes charge of Thiruvananthapuram airport||Amid opposition by a section of airport staff as well as the ruling LDF government in Kerala, the Adani Group has taken charge of the operation and management of the Thiruvananthapuram International Airport on Thursday.“Connecting lives with cherished travel experiences, we are pleased to share that #Thiruvananthapuram Airport is now a #GatewayToGoodness. We are privileged to serve and welcome passengers to God’s Own Country filled with lush greenery, beautiful beaches, and exquisite cuisine,” the group said in a tweet, both in English and Malayalam, after the takeover. The CPI (M)-led state government had tried its best to stall the takeover and last year the state assembly had passed a unanimous resolution against it. Its petition questioning the takeover was rejected by all courts. But Congress MP from the state capital Shashi Tharoor has hailed the move and said it will help develop the airport and increase its connectivity. In February 2019, the government-owned Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) participated in the open bidding for the airport but Adani Enterprises won it with the highest bid. Adani group offered to pay a fee of Rs. 168 per passenger, followed by KSIDC at ₹135 and GMR Group at ₹63. Though KSIDC was also given a 10% discount since it was a government entity, Adani quoted more than 30% to win the bid. After losing the bid, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking him not to hand over the airport to a private entity, citing the successful public-private partnership model of Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL) and Kannur airports. He said the state deserved preferential consideration over a private group, taking into account its experience in running two airports. Later its pleas were turned down by the High Court and Supreme Court. One of the oldest airports in the country, built in 1932, the Thiruvananthapuram Airport was operated so far by the Airports Authority of India (AAI). It is situated in the middle of the city on 638 acres of land donated by the erstwhile rulers of Travancore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-opposition-adani-group-takes-charge-of-thiruvananthapuram-airport-101634219567919.html

The development comes as India – the world's second largest coal producer, and among the fourth largest reserves – battles one of its worst power supply deficits in years. However, the company assured that it is only a temporary move till the situation stabilises."This is only a temporary prioritisation, in the interest of the Nation, to tide over the low coal stock situation at the stressed power plants and scale up supplies to them," the source, familiar with Coal India's plan was quoted as saying by Reuters.The company has not issued any official comment on the same.With India's economic reopening after the prolonged virus-infused lockdown, India has witnessed a surge in power demand to above pre-pandemic levels. This means state-run Coal India's supplies were no longer enough.Coal India said it had stopped all online auctions of coal except those meant for the power sector. Additionally, most of India's 135 coal-fired power plants have fuel stocks of less than three days.The government has even asked power producers in the country to import up to 10% of their coal needs amid fuel shortages in various states. The Centre also warned states against sale of electricity on power exchanges to cash in on surging prices, asserting that federal companies will curb their power supplies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coal-india-temporarily-halts-supply-to-customers-outside-power-sector-101634214426065.html

14-10-2021||India||Govt rejigs fertiliser-subsidy regime to continue offering crop nutrients at below-market rates||The Union government has revamped parts of its subsidy regime for fertilisers and crop nutrients to continue providing them at below-market rates, while rolling over special discounts announced for the summer-sown season to the oncoming winter-sown months, according to an official statement on Thursday. International prices of raw materials for some key crop nutrients such as di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and 22 grades of P&K fertilisers have been increasing for over 18 months, trade data show. Most of these fertilisers have seen a jump of over 50% in prices, forcing the government to expand subsidy. India relies on import of raw materials for crop nutrients as well as finished products and compensates fertiliser companies who sell them at below-inflation rates. Subsidised rates under the so-called nutrient-based subsidy regime -- the mechanism by which the Centre disburses the subsidy to manufacturers – will be extended to the winter-sown season at a cost of ₹28,602 crore, the government’s calculations show. This means while prices will be allowed to be increased, the roll-over to October 2021 to March 2022 period will keep the retail per kg subsidy rates for a group of nutrients known as nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium unchanged. The second key change is the inclusion of potash-derived from molasses or PDM, a crop nutrient derived from sugarcane waster matter, under the nutrient-based subsidy scheme for the first time. India’s is the world’s second-largest cane grower after Brazil. Potash extracted from sugarcane waste will reduce India’s reliance of 100% import of more than 4.2 million tonne of mineral-based potash, an essential crop nutrient which is critical for India’s food security. “This decision will improve the income level of sugarcane growers and sugar mills,” the official statement said. A “special one-time package” for additional subsidy on di-ammonium phosphate or DAP at a projected additional cost of ₹5,716 crore along with an additional subsidy on three most consumed fertilisers called NPK worth ₹35115 crore has been approved by the Modi government. The total fertiliser subsidy on account of these new steps could go up to ₹36,000 crore, an official said. A central team is monitoring availability of fertilisers in the country on a daily basis, according to the official. The government has already directed all the fertilisers companies to ensure the availability of these fertilisers in the market for farmers and sell all old stocks at old prices. “We expect a nearly 10% increase in fertiliser demand,” an official of the agriculture ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-rejigs-fertiliser-subsidy-regime-to-continue-offering-crop-nutrients-at-below-market-rates-101634216687355.html

In a letter to PM Modi, the Opposition leader of the West Bengal Assembly said the notorious vandals are habituated to targeting the ‘Sanatani’ minority community in Bangladesh.“This time the religious fanatics took to the streets to vandalize several Durga Puja pandals and various temples also. Presently the condition of Sanatani People living in Bangladesh is very miserable,” he wrote, referring to the term often used to describe Hindu movements.The violent attack on pandals occurred after the alleged desecration of the Quran in Cumilla, a city in the Chittagong Division of Bangladesh, by placing it near the feet of goddess Durga’s idol at a puja pandal. Citing diplomats in Dhaka and New Delhi, HT earlier reported that the Jamaat-e-Islami (JEI) might be behind the attacks with an intention of embarrassing the Sheikh Hasina government.The attacks on pandals mainly took place in Noakhali, Chandpur, Cox’s Bazaar, areas around Chattogram, Chapainawabganj, Pabna, Moulvibazara and Kurigram. No disturbance was reported in Dhaka, Brahmanbaria, Jashore and other major cities.Adhikari highlighted that many Bangladeshi Hindus, who have crossed over to West Bengal to escape the inhuman atrocities of the past, are making “frantic calls” to stand in support of the victims.“Hence I heartily request you please take necessary and urgent steps at your disposal as early as possible to provide relief to the Sanatani People of Bangladesh,” wrote Adhikari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suvendu-adhikari-urges-pm-modi-to-take-urgent-steps-after-pandal-attacks-in-bangladesh-101634215018640.html
14-10-2021||India||Centre mulling making forensics mandatory for serious criminal cases: Amit Shah||Any crime that involves a possible punishment of six years or more needs to necessarily include a forensic investigation, Union Home Minister Amit Shah has said in Goa. The minister also indicated that the Union government is considering making it mandatory for such investigation to be conducted. Shah said that forensic evidence strengthens the prosecution’s hand and can take the conviction rate for criminal cases higher. He was speaking an event to lay the foundation stone for the Goa campus of the National Forensic Science University. “We are trying to focus on ensuring that there should be compulsory visits of the forensic science team in all crimes where the punishment is more than six years (serious crimes). If we achieve this then in more than 600 districts across the country, one forensic science laboratory, even if small, will have to be set up along with a mobile forensic van,” Shah said. “If we have to do this then we will need 30,000 to 40,000 forensic scientists. From where will we get them? On the one hand there is unemployment; on the other hand skilled manpower is not there. If we are to bridge this then education and skilling is the way forward. Which is why we are setting up the forensic science university,” Shah added. “The wrongdoer can be brought to justice only when the conviction ratio rises and when the people can rest assured that he will spend a long time in jail. This can happen only when the conviction rate climbs higher. This can happen when the prosecutor has in his hands scientific evidence. The concept had come to our country, even the labs came but there was a shortage of manpower so cases were dragging on and on,” he added. Shah is in Goa to lay the foundation stone for the Goa campus of the National Forensic Science University which he said will help staff forensic labs across the country ten years from now. “This is a big gift for the youth of Goa. In this campus, forensic science in general, forensic chemistry, toxicology, biotechnology, fingerprint, DNA science, financial crimes investigation, cyber-security analysis, digital forensic science and wildlife forensic science courses will be available. I call on science stream students from the state to take up these courses,” Shah said. “Not only for students and children -- police officers, judicial officers and people related to cyber-security and private security researchers will also have the option for diploma courses,” he added. “I know that Goa is a small state. But if you look for the number of sailors across the country, you will find that most of them are from Goa. Most of the sailors of the country come from Goa. So I wish to say that in ten years’ time there should be a situation where most of the forensic scientists from across the country come from Goa,” he added. Shah called on the institute to also offer Goa-specific courses that can tackle issues like tourist security, drugs, narcotics, coastal policing etc. “Look at Goa’s crime situation as a tourist hub and you need to make some courses ready for tourist security, a suitable centre also needs to be set up for drugs and narcotics and for coastal policing too a centre of the NFSU unit needs to be set up,” he added. The college is not only for Goa but law enforcement agencies from across west India and neighbouring Karnataka who could use its expertise, he said. The courses at the college will start immediately, the minister informed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-mulling-making-forensics-mandatory-for-serious-criminal-cases-amit-shah-101634214106914.html

He claimed that rumours regarding the recovery of ganja and drugs were spread by the anti-drug agency despite none of it was recovered from his son-in-law's possession. The Maharashtra minister said they are moving court against the agency, the harassment meted out to them, and for quashing the case."BJP leaders have been targeting me by saying that I am defaming the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) to take revenge over the arrest of my son-in-law. Since the last press conference, which was held on October 9, I have been getting threatening calls. This is why the state government upgraded my security," news agency ANI quoted Malik as saying during a press conference on Thursday."The NCB had arrested my son-in-law (Sameer Khan) earlier in July. When his house was raided by the NCB, there was no recovery but still there were rumours that ganja and drugs were recovered. It was done by NCB to defame me," he said."Hearing Khan's bail application, the court released him in September. My whole family including my daughter was in trauma," he added.Nawab Malik, in his presser on October 9, claimed that the NCB had initially detained 11 persons from a Goa-bound cruise ship off Mumbai coast, but let off three of them, including the brother-in-law of BJP leader Mohit Bharatiya, a couple of hours later. He also termed the NCB's raid on the cruise as "fake, planned and conspired to defame the film industry and the Maharashtra government".

The bail plea came up for hearing on Wednesday but as NCB counsel Anil Singh could not finish his argument on Wednesday, the hearing resumed on Thursday. As the court heard both the parties, it reserved the order for October 20, which means Aryan Khan will have to spend this week too in judicial custody. Aryan has now completed his isolation period in Arthur Road jail and has now been moved with other inmates.Aryan Khan regular consumer of drugs, says NCB; compares with Rhea-Showik caseWhat happened during Thursday's hearingThe NCB opposed Aryan Khan's bail plea and said that Aryan Khan can't be granted bail as bail has nothing to do with the quantity of drugs recovered from him. NCB counsel Anil Singh said Aryan is a regular consumer of drugs, his WhatsApp interaction has revealed. The fact that he was not found with drugs is immaterial as there are some provisions in the NDPS Act where the recovery of drugs is not at all crucial, he said. "Innocent until proven guilty doesn't apply in the cases of NDPS offences. In the NDPS Act, the presumption is of culpable a mental state, and it is for the accused to prove that he was not in possession during the trial," Singh said.He also submitted that the NCB will ultimately find out how all the arrested are connected to each other and will establish a case of conspiracy. "This isn't a case of bail at this state. It can be considered at an appropriate stage," he said.'In the land of Mahatma Gandhi': NCB's 5 points opposing Aryan Khan's bail pleaCountering NCB's arguments regarding Aryan Khan's WhatsApp chat, his lawyer Amit Desai said the context of the WhatsApp chats is important as casual conversations between friends on WhatsApp may appear suspicious. He also said that Aryan Khan was overseas for a while where a lot of these things are legitimate.Regarding a WhatsApp chat ‘Let’s have a blast' apparently exchanged between Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant, Amit Desai said, “Today's generation has a means of communication, which is English...not the Queen's English…it's sometimes what the older generation will call torture. The way they communicate is very different. But by no stretch of the imagination is this boy involved in illicit international drug trafficking.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aryan-khan-to-remain-in-jail-till-next-wednesday-court-reserves-order-101634210632816.html

"I disagree. This is our future generation. The entire country will be depending on them. This is not what our freedom fighters in the land of Mahatma Gandhi envisioned," Anil Singh said.> NCB officers are working day and night to fight the drug menace. They also get beaten up when they are on the duty, Singh said.> On the specific case of Aryan Khan, Singh said Aryan Khan should not be granted bail as he is part of the conspiracy. He was aware of the possession of drugs.> Aryan Khan is not a first-time consumer of drugs. Referring to his WhatsApp chats, the NCB said that he has been a regular consumer of drugs and the 6 gram charas found from Arbaaz Merchant was for their consumption.> Referring to the Rhea Chakraborty-Showik Chakraborty case, Singh said that the quantity does not always matter, as Rhea Chakraborty's brother Showik Chakraborty was also not found in possession of drugs.On Wednesday, Aryan Khan's lawyer Amit Desai argued that the judicial system should not penalise the “kids” in bail. They are some young kids, Amit Desai said, adding that they should not be considered drug peddlers, racketeers or traffickers. Desai had argued that they have suffered enough and have learnt their lesson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-the-land-of-mahatma-gandhi-ncb-s-5-points-opposing-aryan-khan-s-bail-plea-101634209768720.html
14-10-2021||India||Farmers blame black marketing, hoarding of fertilizer as MP govt preps to invoke NSA||Farmers looted bags of DAP (diammonium phosphate) fertilizer from a warehouse in the third such incident in Chambal division of Madhya Pradesh in the last five days, police said. There is an acute shortage of urea, especially in the northern parts of the state just before the winter crop sowing season and farmers are becoming desperate, they added. The farmers in the region have also resorted to blocking roads, demanding distribution of urea. Most of the warehouses are almost empty and the supply is not in consonance with the demand, said local government officials. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Tuesday said there was no shortage of fertilizer in the state. MP requires 4 lakh tonnes of urea for the Rabi season and the state has already received 2.5 lakh tonne, the CM said.State home minister Narottam Mishra, however, said the administration is receiving reports of illegal hoarding and supply of sub-standard fertilizers in DAP bags and the government has decided to invoke the stringent national security act (NSA) against the businessman for black marketing and illegal hoarding of fertiliser. On Monday farmers, who were waiting in the queue in grain market in Sabalgarh in Morena, looted more than 50 bags of fertilizer from a truck, police said. Police said a group of farmers stole fertilizer bags from warehouses of cooperative societies in Fup and Mehgaon area of Bhind in two separate incidents. An FIR has been registered only in one of these cases, police said.State officials and experts said the major reasons behind the crisis are changes in crop pattern, black marketing and farmers defaulting on loan repayments. Farmers are eligible for fertilizer from the government at subsidised rates only if they have repaid loans. Agriculture expert Vinayak Tomar said: “Nearly 61% of total mustard production of the state takes place in Morena, Bhind, Sheopur and Gwalior. With the sudden increase in the price of mustard from ₹4,800 per quintal to ₹8,000/per quintal, many farmers, who used to sow wheat and bajra, have started sowing mustard for winter crop also. Mid-September and October is the best time for sowing mustard so the demand for urea has increased suddenly. Earlier, there was a balance as for wheat, farmers need fertilizer by the end of October and in November.”Then there is black marketing.“The (state) agriculture department gives fertilizers to cooperative societies according to the agricultural land of registered farmers. There is a ban on open sale of fertilizers from the societies to stop black-marketing in UP and Rajasthan (the fertilizer from the state is illegally shipped there). Similarly, societies are not providing fertilizers to defaulter farmers, who have not cleared their loans,” said Shiv Mangal Singh, former president of district cooperative bank in Morena. He added that private shops have stock of urea that are being sold at a premium of ₹200-300 for a 50 kg bag. In the past two days, Gwalior and Morena district administration raided warehouses of two traders and recovered more than 200 bags, which were being hoarded. A resident of Gurema village in Morena, Shankar Singh Jadon, 62, said, “This is the peak season of sowing and I am standing in queue daily for the past 15 days and I received only two bags for my three acres of land. At one time, the society manager is providing only two bags to a farmer. In the (open) market, the same bag is being sold at ₹1500. The government is promoting black marketing.”Another farmer from Gormi in Bhind, Ran Singh Narwariya, said, “If we don’t find urea on time, sowing will be affected. The state government is compelling us either to borrow money to purchase the fertilizer in black or steal it from the warehouse.”MP Kisan Congress president Dinesh Gurjar said, “The government should make fertilizer available within a week or we will intensify our protest.” On Tuesday, Chouhan instructed all the collectors to ensure a smooth supply of fertilizers to farmers.Farmers’ welfare and agricultural minister Kamal Patel said, “There is no crisis of fertilizer (availability) in MP and it is being supplied smoothly. Some defaulting farmers are creating a ruckus but we are ensuring that they get DAP (Di-ammonium Phosphate) bags at subsidized rates from the market. We are also conducting raids to stop the hoarding of fertilizers”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-blame-black-marketing-hoarding-of-fertilizer-as-mp-govt-preps-to-invoke-nsa-101634208466250.html

Singh said that terrorism is a common threat to the countries under the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) that “challenges us in equal measure” and it reinforced the role of all citizens in the fight against it.“And this fight cannot be won by half the population of our region or of a country. Women have and will remain equal contributors in this fight, both within the armed forces and beyond them,” Singh during his address at the SCO international webinar on the role of women in the armed forces.Women have and will remain equal contributors in this fight, both within the armed forces and beyond them: Raksha Mantri Shri @rajnathsinghWhile mentioning women who reached the helm of Indian administration, Singh referred to former prime minister Indira Gandhi and former president Pratibha Patil and said that women reaching higher ranks within the armed forces came as no surprise. “It, therefore, comes as no surprise that a number of women have reached the rank of lieutenant general and equivalent within the Indian armed forces, leading their men and women under the most challenging conditions,” he said.The defence minister also said that the country was amongst the oldest to induct women into its armed forces and highlighted the role of women in the Indian Military Nursing Service for more than 100 years now. He also said that the army had begun commissioning women in 1992 and they are now present within most branches.Also read | After SC judgement, UPSC invites application from women candidates for NDA exam“Women are now being accepted for permanent commission and shall be commanding army units and battalions in near future,” he said. “I am happy to share with you that from next year, women shall be able to join our premier tri-service pre-commissioning training institute, the National Defence Academy,” he added.Singh also said that the role of women should be recognised and reinforced in all spheres of security and nation-building, apart from their role in the armed forces. He also pointed to the role of women in the navy, the coast guard and the UN peacekeeping missions within the services and said that India’s approach has been progressive towards their induction into these services.“We have found that the process of induction, given its broad-based and progressive path, has also simultaneously prepared the society and the armed forces for this change. This is an important aspect to ensure a smooth and successful transition,” he said.The ministry of defence said in February this year that the Indian Army has 6,807 women or 0.56 per cent of its total strength, the Indian Air Force 1,607 or 1.08 per cent and the Indian Navy 704 women officers or 6.5 per cent of the arm’s strength.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-says-women-will-be-equal-contributors-in-fight-against-terrorism-highlights-role-in-armed-forces-101634206484570.html

The three were arrested on October 3 and are currently lodged at Arthur Road prison. Their bail plea was submitted in the special NDPS court after a Mumbai magistrate rejected their bail and remanded them to judicial custody. The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has argued that Aryan Khan, the eldest son of Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan, should not get bail in the case just because he was not found in possession of drugs. Stay tuned for live updates.Follow all the updates here:Bail plea hearing adjourned till October 20After hearing the arguments of both the sides in the bail application of Aryan Khan, Actor Arbaaz Merchant and model Munmun Dhamecha, the Mumbai court has adjourned the matter to 20th October, 2021, for bail order,Possibility of conspiracy, speculation in Aryan Khan's case: Desai in court“This young man was overseas for a while.

This allegations are fake. Nothing to do will illicit drug trafficking. These chats needs to be seen as whole. They need to see if they (the chats) are jokes, banter. Context is important when we deal with evidential value,” Aryan Khan's lawyer in court.Investigation in regards to Aryan Khan ended on October 7: Desai tells court“The custody was given in bailable offence to facilitate investigation,” Desai continues, “Then he was remanded to judicial custody. Now the learned magistrate heard everything of the NCB, applied his mind and concluded that no investigation's is actually happening now.

14-10-2021||India||‘Captain is with BJP’: Punjab minister alleges Amarinder behind govt's BSF move||A day after the Centre extended the jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF) to a 50-kilometre belt along the international border in few states, including Punjab, Congress leader and cabinet minister Pargat Singh attacked Amarinder Singh over the Union government's move.In an apparent reference to Captain's meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah last month, Pargat Singh said that Amarinder Singh went to Delhi to delay the paddy procurement and now he has motivated the government to extend the BSF’s jurisdiction to Punjab. “I have always said the Captain is with the BJP only. Earlier he went to Delhi to make a delay in paddy procurement and now this... If you are deploying BSF in Punjab it shows your motive to impose governor rule...,” news agency ANI quoted Pargat Singh as saying.“I want to appeal to the Union home minister to not take Punjab in different directions for the 2022 and 2024 elections. We will not allow anyone to make Punjab communal,” Singh added, referring to the assembly polls scheduled to be held in the state next year and the general elections later.On Wednesday, Amarinder Singh extended his support to the move and urged people not to drag central armed forces into politics. “Our soldiers are being killed in Kashmir. We’re seeing more & more weapons & drugs being pushed by Pak-backed terrorists into Punjab. BSF’s enhanced presence & powers will only make us stronger. Let’s not drag central armed forces into politics," Singh's media adviser tweeted on his behalf.Meanwhile, Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi requested Amit Shah to immediately roll back this decision, terming it a "direct attack on federalism".In a move aimed at maintaining "zero tolerance" against terrorism and cross border crimes, the Centre has empowered the BSF to conduct searches, arrest suspects and make seizures up to an area of 50 km inside Indian territory from the International Border (IB) along the India-Pakistan and India-Bangladesh borders.As per the fresh order, the BSF, which was only empowered to take action up to fifteen kilometres in the states of Punjab, West Bengal and Assam, has now been authorised to spread its jurisdiction up to 50km without any hurdle or further permission either from central or state governments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/captain-is-with-bjp-punjab-minister-alleges-amarinder-behind-govt-s-bsf-move-101634203006472.html

These include, for example, tribes such as Onge and Jarawa, researchers said. Both the tribes are isolated from the population on mainland India, as these are found on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.Speaking about the research, Professor Gyaneshwer Chaubey of the BHU, who co-led the exercise with CSIR’s Kumarasamy Thangaraj, said, “There might be some speculations on the effects on Covid-19 among isolated populations. However, for the first time, we used genomic data to study the risk of the infection on 227 isolated Indian populations. It was found that the ones which carry long homozygous segments in their genome are highly susceptible to Covid-19.”The team investigated the high-density genomic data of more than 1600 people across these 227 groups. Among these, high frequency for Covid-19 risk alleles (gene) was found among the Onge and Jarawa tribes.Besides these, the other groups found on here are the Great Andamanese and Sentinels.“The study noted that these inhabitants live in protected areas and the general public is not allowed to interact with them. However, after seeing the number of cases among the islanders, it can be said that they are at greater risk mainly from illegal intruders and health workers. The total census of this population is less than 1000 in number,” Chaubey, who teaches molecular anthropology at BHU, further said.On Thursday, two more people tested positive for coronavirus in the Union territory of Andaman and Nicobar, pushing the cumulative tally to 7637, according to a health department bulletin. This includes 7499 recoveries and nine active cases, while the toll remained unchanged at 129.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isolated-populations-of-india-are-at-higher-risk-of-covid-19-study-finds-101634201424692.html
14-10-2021||India||WPI inflation eases to 10.66% in September on lower food prices||India’s headline wholesale price inflation for September rose 10.66% from a year ago, a six-month low, signalling cooling prices, government data showed on Thursday. The key gauge of producer prices in September, however, remained in double-digits. In August, wholesale inflation was 11.39%. The easing of wholesale prices was led by a decline in prices of food articles, especially vegetables. Fuel and power category prices rose slightly at a slower pace to stand at 24.81% in September from a year ago, compared with a 26.09% rise in August. Prices of manufactured goods, the biggest component in the WPI basket, rose 11.41%, marginally lower than August’s 11.39%. Price rise is a key determinant of monetary policies. Moderate inflation helps the Reserve Bank to keep interest rates low to spur economic activity hit by the pandemic. The slide in prices was largely driven by declining food prices at the wholesale level, which can pressure farm incomes. Inflation, or the rate at which prices rise, of food articles, dropped by nearly 5%, Thursday’s data showed. Vegetable inflation fell by 32.5%. Within horticulture items, wholesale onion rates saw a 1.9% decline in September, after a sharp rise of 62.8% in August from a year ago. Data released on October 12 showed retail inflation eased in September. The Retail inflation rate, as measured by the widely watched consumer price index, stood at 4.35% in September 2021. In August consumer prices rose 5.3%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/september-wholesale-inflation-cools-to-six-month-low-at-1066-101634201267656.html
14-10-2021||India||Aryan Khan regular consumer of drugs, says NCB; compares with Rhea-Showik case||Drawing a parallel between the cruise rave party case and that of the Rhea Chakraborty-Showik case, ASG Anil Singh on Thursday told the court that the fact that Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan was not found in possession of drugs does not mean he should get bail. In the case of Showik Chakraborty, the brother of Rhea Chakraborty, there was no recovery. But the court at that time said that the matter was being investigated, Anil Singh said. "The record and the evidence before your honour shows that he is a regular consumer of contraband for last few years. The contraband in possession of Arbaz Merchant who accompanied Khan was for the consumption of both of them," Anil Singh said as he continued his argument opposing the bail plea on Thursday.Aryan Khan drugs case hearing to continue today. Here's where things standThe agency in its reply to the bail plea, which was submitted in front of the special NDPS court on Wednesday, said the quantity of the recovery is immaterial as the initial probe has revealed that Aryan Khan is a regular consumer of drugs and used to procure through Arbaaz Merchant."There are provisions in the NDPS Act which have got nothing to do with quantity so that can not be the argument to say that the punishment is only for a year. Once the connection is established, then the quantity is not important. My submission is that this is not a case for grant of bail," Anil Singh said.The NCB counsel also said that the "innocent until proven guilty" does not apply in the cases of NDPS offences. "In the NDPS Act, the presumption is of culpable a mental state, and it is for the accused to prove that he was not in possession during the trial," Anil Singh said.As he argued on Wednesday, Anil Singh had said Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant are friends and they know each other for years. Though no drug was found from Aryan Khan, he knew about the possession. His WhatsApp chats revealed references to ‘bulk quantity’, which can not be for individual consumption, the NCB counsel said accusing Aryan Khan of illicit drug trafficking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aryan-khan-regular-consumer-of-drugs-says-ncb-compares-with-rhea-showik-case-101634200726833.html

In the 10-second-long video, which is being shared widely on social media, Pragya Thakur is seen playing a round of kabaddi with local players at a Kali temple in Bhopal. Pragya Thakur was reportedly asked by the players, who were already there, to join them.The video of Pragya Thakur, who is often seen in a wheelchair in public, is from Wednesday. The video has been retweeted by various Congress leaders, who took a jibe at Pragya Thakur, asking about her next appearance with the National Investigation Agency (NIA).This comes just days after another video was posted on Twitter showing Pragya Thakur performing Garba. A controversial figure, she is often targeted over videos showing her dancing at weddings and playing basketball.A member of Parliament from Bhopal, she has been charged for terrorist activities and she is currently out on bail. She has skipped hearings in the Malegaon blast case citing serious injuries because of alleged custodial torture.Pragya Thakur is among the seven accused in the 2008 Malegaon blast case in which six people were killed and 100 others were injured. Pragya Thakur was arrested after it was found that a motorcycle used in the blast was registered in her name. She was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and murder and fanning enmity between communities under the Indian Penal Code (IPC). She was granted bail in 2017 after the special NIA court dropped charges of being a member of a terrorist organisation as well as those under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA). She is being tried under UAPA act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-garba-pragya-thakur-seen-playing-kabaddi-in-bhopal-in-viral-video-101634200376285.html

Addressing a press conference, Malik also said that his son-in-law Sameer Khan, who was recently granted bail in a drugs case after nine months, will move the high court to seek quashing of charges levelled against him by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB).Khan was arrested by the NCB in January this year in an alleged drug case. He got bail last month. Apart from the recent drugs bust on board a cruise liner off the Mumbai coast, that led to the arrest of Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan, the NCB last year investigated a drug case linked to the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and several other matters related to narcotics involving high-profile people.Malik last week alleged that the NCB's raid on the cruise ship off the Mumbai coast on October 2 was “fake”, and no narcotic drugs were found during it. On Wednesday, the minister alleged that the “NCB has malafide intentions and is involved in only selective leaks to frame people.”He also said that his security was beefed up after he started getting “threats” when he raised doubts over the NCB's investigations.Referring to the bail order issued by an NDPS court in connection with the case involving his son-in-law Sameer Khan, Malik said there was “no prima facie evidence of a drug syndicate.”It is surprising that an agency like the NCB cannot differentiate between drugs that fall under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and tobacco-related items, the NCP leader said. “It (NCB) said ganja was seized (in the case involving Sameer Khan), but there was none. I just had to make things clear today after the bail order, since the BJP was targeting me over my son-in-law when I raised issues about the NCB's fake case of the cruise drug party,” the NCP leader said.Malik also claimed his family faced trauma and stigma due to the NCB.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nawab-malik-slams-ncb-alleges-malafide-intentions-behind-selective-leaks-to-frame-people-101634198957725.html

Officials said the two are so far not being treated as suspects in the case and that they are assisting the agency in connecting some dots.The ED earlier in August recorded Fernandez’s statement as she may have been duped by Chandrasekhar. Chandrasekhar, who is lodged in Delhi’s Rohini jail, is under Delhi Police and ED’s probe for cheating, conspiracy, and extortion. ED raided Chandrasekhar’s sea-facing bungalow in Chennai on August 24 and recovered several high-end cars such as Rolls-Royce Ghost. He was arrested in April 2017 for allegedly taking money from Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam leader TTV Dhinakaran to allegedly bribe Election Commission officials in connection with a dispute over the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s “two leaves” poll symbol.In a statement in August, ED said searches were conducted at the residential and business premises of Leena Maria Paul, the wife of Chandrasekhar and an actress. “Sukesh Chandrashekhar is a known conman. He has been part of the crime world since the age of 17. He has multiple FIRs against him and was lodged in Rohini Jail. Despite being lodged in jail, Sukesh Chandrashekhar did not stop conning people. He has used technology to his aid and advantage and spoofed calls to dupe people as the numbers reflecting on the seven of the called party were from Government officers and he claimed to be Government officer offering to help people for a price of course. In this case also, Sukesh Chandrasekhar extorted money to the tune of ₹200 Crores by impersonating Senior Government officials,” the ED said in the statement. “During the search, it was revealed that she (Paul) along with Sukesh Chandrashekhar lead a lavish life in a bungalow in Chennai which is no less than a resort and have various luxury cars including BMW, Range Rover, Mercedes. The house is luxurious sea facing bungalow with home theatre and a fleet of cars and servants. Leena Maria Paul loves luxury like her partner Sukesh and there are numerous shoes, shades, bags and clothes. The shoes are Ferragamo, Chanel, Dior, Louis Vuitton and bags of the same brands including Hermes. The rugs in the house are Versace with Italian Marble floors, dining table and expensive furniture.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nora-fatehi-appears-before-enforcement-directorate-in-money-laundering-probe-101634198266721.html

He slammed the move, accusing the state government of being "anti-farmer".The farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri have claimed that a vehicle in the convoy of Union minister Ajay Mishra's son Ashish Mishra ran over the farmers who were returning after a protest, killing four of them.

The announcement came following a series of targeted attacks that left seven civilians dead in the region this month. Displaced Kashmir Pandit employees expressed apprehensions about their postings in far-flung areas after the attacks.Around 3,000 such employees are posted across Kashmir and a bulk of them stay in guarded transit government accommodations. A teacher from Jammu was among the civilians killed in the targeted attacks that prompted many displaced Kashmiri employees to leave the Valley.A statement quoting divisional commissioner (Kashmir) Pundurang K Pole on Wednesday said he has instructed deputy commissioners and senior police superintendents to regularly visit colonies and accommodations of displaced Kashmiris. It added they were being briefed about the security, confidence-building measures, facilities, and other arrangements being put in place for their safety and security. “The officers have been issued clear cut directions to preferably post these migrant employees in safe and secure zones instead of far-flung and vulnerable areas for the time being.”Office bearers of employees’ unions have visited some of the transit accommodations to express solidarity with the displaced Kashmiri employees.The Centre told Parliament in July that 3,841 displaced Kashmiris have moved back to Kashmir and have taken up jobs across Kashmir under the Prime Minister’s Rehabilitation Package. It added 6,000 residential units were being constructed for the Kashmir Pandit employees in the Valley and that 1,000 of them have been allotted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/displaced-kashmiri-employees-to-be-posted-in-safer-areas-after-attacks-on-civilians-101634191905159.html
14-10-2021||India||Meghalaya: Rebel group warns people against voting for ruling party in by-polls||The proscribed Hynñiewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC) has asked the citizens of the state not to vote for the ruling National People’s Party (NPP) in the upcoming by-elections to the three Assembly seats, slated for October 30.The rebels also served a one-week ultimatum to the NPP to shut down all its facilities in the Khasi and Jaiñtia Hills region.“We urged the people not to vote for the NPP in the by-election as a mark of protest against the gunning down of Cherish Thangkhiew,” HNLC general secretary-cum-spokesperson Saiñkupar Nongtraw said in an emailed communiqué late Wednesday.Thangkhiew, a former self-styled general secretary of the HNLC, was allegedly killed in a police operation to arrest him from his residence in the wee hours of August 13.Claiming that national parties come and go in Meghalaya but none of them can truly serve the people of the state, Nongtraw said, “I feel the national parties are just like a rainbow coalition and that they can never address the problems faced by the state,” while asserting, “Therefore, we need our own regional parties which can deliver and fulfil the aspirations of the people.” The outfit leader further announced that the NPP is directed to shut down all its offices in the Khasi and Jaiñtia Hills region beginning today. “We will give only one week to complete the exercise,” he warned.Meanwhile, the HNLC has referred to the police statement that an HNLC cadre, named Emanuel Suchen, had recently surrendered in Khliehriat, East Jaiñtia Hills District as a “drama”.“Six months ago, Suchen was arrested by the police for his alleged involvement in the IED blast. Even after he was released, police repeatedly conducted searches and raids often threatening him with dire consequences which forced him to go underground and subsequently surrender,” Nongtraw elaborated while affirming that Suchen was never involved in the planting of any IED explosive as alleged by the police.“Simply because they failed to gather concrete evidence regarding the IED cases, the state police resorted to random arrests of former cadres of the HNLC as well as innocent youths as if they were chickens in a farm, but it is not easy to arrest cadres of the outfit. Such arrests only show that they (police) are weak and have become like swines drunk on fermented corn,” Nongtraw scoffed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meghalaya-hnlc-directs-people-not-to-vote-for-npp-in-bypolls-101634191545590.html

14-10-2021||India||Global edible oil producers are outsmarting India’s moves to curb prices||International edible oil producers are synchronizing price increases with India’s series of actions to soften their domestic rates by slashing import duties. This has had the effect of making India’s steps to ease the price of cooking oils less effective, market watchers say.Higher food inflation not only impacts poorer households more, which tend to spend a larger share of their monthly budgets on food, compared to the well-off, but they also throw the Reserve Bank’s inflation targets off gear.Inflation must stay within a “tolerable” range to enable India to quickly consolidate gains from a nascent economic recovery underway since the pandemic took a heavy toll on Asia’s third-largest economy.In a key policy move to tame inflation, India on Wednesday virtually abolished basic customs duty on crude imports of three edible oils, a basic ingredient of most Indian cooking. But international markets are coordinating prices to thwart India’s moves to make imports cheaper, market data show.India has also pared basic customs duty on refined varieties of edible oil to 17.5% from 32.5%. Both these measures should offer at least short-term relief to consumer prices, while the government would lose out on revenue needed to keep borrowing under check.“Almost instantly, major producer penciled in the duty cuts by India and raised prices to a similar extent so that there is no impact or very less impact on rates by the time it reaches the consumer,” said Atul Chaturvedi of the Indian Solvent Extractors’ Association, the industry body of oilseed processors, after analysing movement in a fresh increase in Malaysia’s prices.The tariff cuts announced by India on Wednesday will be in force until March 2022. This is the fifth reduction in import tariffs on vegetable oils since February. Edible oils have inflated household budgets since India imports up to two-thirds of its domestic consumption requirements of edible oils.Duty cuts should -- other market factors remaining the same -- immediately lower prices and potentially stave off food inflation soaring to multi-year highs. “However, prices are moving sinisterly in the global edible oil markets, almost in response to India’s measures,” said Ashok Agrawal of Comtrade, a commodities trading firm.Soon after India’s decision to cut duty rates, exportable edible oil rates in Malaysia moved by an extent enough to match India’s cuts. So, what is at play here? Simply, India’s moves to depress the rates of edible oils are being negated by an almost similar increases in the rates such that international prices remain high.The main advantage of international producer nations is that India has a gluttonous appetite for edible oils. The country imports up to two-third of its domestic demand for edible oil through imports since the domestic output is not sufficient.Palm is one of the most widely consumed oils, which is found in everything from bread to ice-creams. Edible oil is India’s third most high-value import, after crude oil and gold. India typically imports from producers such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina and Russia.According to a central notification, imported crude palm oil, the most widely consumed of edible oils in the Indian market, will now be charged an agri infrastructure cess of 7.5%, while unrefined soyabean and sunflower oils will attract a cess of 5 %, down from 20%.The lowering of the cess will bring down the effective customs duty on palm, soyabean and sunflower oils 8.5%, 5.5% and 5.5% respectively, according to the government’s notification.The reductions will cut prices by up to ₹20,000 a tonne, which is expected to have a pass-through effect on final consumer prices. However, a fresh increase in Malaysian prices has made market watchers unsure to what extent Indian consumers will benefit from duty cuts.According to official data, the share of rural and urban consumption in total is 3.8% and 2.7%. Much of the demand comes from commercial users, like biscuit and snack makers.“If international prices increase further, the duty cuts may not be effective because they will necessitate further reductions,” said Agrawal. “We are getting into this trap.”In June, the government cut duties on palm oil by 5% and lifted restrictions on the import of refined palm oil, as food inflation worries mounted.Edible oil prices have risen by up to 60%, according to data from the consumer affairs ministry from a year ago. Average costs of a litre of mustard oil rose to ₹170 in August compared to ₹120 a year ago.India’s usual levies on edible oil imports ranges between 32.5% (for palm oil, the cheapest edible oil) and 35% for soyabean oil. The country produces about 11 million tonnes of edible oil but consumption hovers around 24 million tonnes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/global-edible-oil-producers-are-outsmarting-india-s-moves-to-curb-prices-101634188006321.html

Domestic destinations that are in demand during this long weekend are Leh-Ladakh, Kashmir, Rajasthan, Goa, Uttarakhand, Andaman. As travel restrictions are at ease now, the industry is seeing an upsurge in travel bookings, particularly for leisure travel or visiting hometowns. As a result of this, portals unanimously said they are seeing a surge in the demand for air travel bookings and they are hoping that the demand continues to grow throughout Diwali week. “Especially for Mumbai and New Delhi, there is a sharp uptick in bookings. Also, due to the increase in demand, flight rates have gone up but there are a lot of offers like EzCancel (powered by Cleartrip) which offers full refunds on flight cancellation only at a minimal charge and fuelling demand in part as it empowers the customers,” said Prahlad Krishnamurti, chief business officer, Cleartrip. As travel restrictions have eased following the pandemic, demand for rental cars has also increased. “The bookings are mainly from Tier 1 cities, such as Delhi and Bangalore. While the lockdown forced people to stay at home, there is a pent-up demand for travel and we are seeing people renting premium/luxury cars to have a comfortable and luxurious experience,” said Sunil Gupta, managing director and chief executive officer (CEO), Avis India.A MakeMyTrip spokesperson said that they are seeing strong demand for hotels and homestays during the upcoming long weekend of Dussehra with many opting for a quick weekend getaway to the hills or to the beaches of Goa and Pondicherry. “On MakeMyTrip, advance bookings for the upcoming festive season have touched 75% of pre-Covid levels.

"There are thousands who have been forgotten," he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. The remarks were made in response to All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi's comments, who said that that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will soon declare the RSS ideologue as "the father of the nation".A row broke over on Wednesday after defence minister Rajnath Singh said that it was on Mahatma Gandhi's request that Veer Savarkar filed mercy petitions. Singh also claimed that there was a deliberate conspiracy to defame Savarkar.The comments prompted immediate criticism from the opposition parties which accused him of "trying to rewrite history".The Union minister was speaking after releasing a book on Savarkar.
14-10-2021||India||India moves a step forward in achieving E20 fuel dream||The ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) has notified test standards for vehicles compliant with ethanol-blended fuel variants E12 and E15 that will act as intermediaries in India’s target of achieving 20% ethanol blending in petrol (E20) across the country by the year 2023. In its notification dated October 11, which was made public on Wednesday, the ministry made it mandatory for all automobile manufacturers to put “clearly visible stickers” on every vehicle informing about its compatibility to the level of ethanol blend (E12, E15, E20).While E12 has 12% ethanol blended with petrol, E15 has 15%. Currently, India is using E10 fuel (petrol blended with 10% ethanol). A MoRTH official said the notification sets the norms for automobile manufacturers for type testing of vehicles compliant with these two bio-fuel variants. “They can now start production of vehicles that are E12 and E15 compliant, apart from being E20 compliant which is the larger goal,” the official said. Ethanol blended fuel is less expensive than petrol and has lower carbon emissions, reducing the impact of vehicular pollution. Besides, by introducing ethanol-blended fuel, the central government wants to reduce its heavy dependency on crude oil imports, the rate of which is highly volatile. India currently imports 85% of its total fuel. Produced using sugarcane and grains such as corn, surplus rice, damaged food grains, bajra, jowar, and sweet sorghum, ethanol is considered to be one of most suitable alternative blending, transportation fuel due to its better quality and environmental benefits, according to a NITI Aayog report released in June. The report said the use of this fuel will result in an annual saving of $5 billion in India’s oil imports.In June, India brought forward its target for producing E20 by two years. Initially set for 2030, the target date was brought forward to 2025. The date was, through another notification, advanced to April 1, 2023.“The notification made public on Wednesday will help automobile manufacturers to introduce intermediary level - E12 and E15 - compliant vehicles. While India has to shift to E20 fuel by 2023 or 2025 maximum, several oil producing companies in India had raised questions to the government as to what happens when the country is hit by a year of bad produce (of sugarcane and other food grains) on account of weather or for some unforeseen reason. That is why these two blended fuel types have also been notified now so that if ethanol production reduces some time, then vehicles can use fuel that has lower ethanol blending,” said said PK Banerjee, executive director of Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-moves-a-step-forward-in-achieving-e20-fuel-dream-101634184705229.html

14-10-2021||India||New abortion rules notified for ‘special categories’ of women, details here||The government has notified new rules under which the gestational limit for termination of a pregnancy has been increased from 20 to 24 weeks for certain categories of women. According to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Rules, 2021, these categories include survivors of sexual assault or rape or incest, minors, women whose marital status changes during an ongoing pregnancy (widowhood and divorce), and those with physical disabilities.The new rules also cover mentally ill women, cases of foetal malformation that has a substantial risk of being incompatible with life or if the child is born it may suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities to be seriously handicapped and women with pregnancy in humanitarian settings or disaster or emergency situations as may be declared by the government.The new rules come under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act, 2021 passed by Parliament in March.Earlier, abortion required the opinion of one doctor if it is done within 12 weeks of conception and two doctors if it is done between 12 and 20 weeks.According to the new rules, a state-level medical board will be set up to decide if pregnancy may be terminated after 24 weeks in cases of foetal malformation and if the foetal malformation has a substantial risk of it being incompatible with life or if the child is born it may suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities to be seriously handicapped.The function of the Medical Board shall be to examine the woman and her reports if she approaches for medical termination of pregnancy and provides the opinion with regard to the termination of pregnancy or rejection of a request for termination within three days of receiving the request.The Board has also been tasked to ensure that the termination procedure, when advised by it, is carried out with all safety precautions along with appropriate counselling within five days of the receipt of the request for medical termination of pregnancy.Poonam Muttreja, the Executive Director of the Population Foundation of India (PFI), said given the advancements in scientific and medical technology, the extended 24 week gestation period should apply to all women and not just 'special categories of women'."We welcome the new rules under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act notified by the Union Government recently, which are an outcome of the  MTP Amendment Act, 2021 passed by Parliament in March this year."However, given the advancements in scientific and medical technology the world has witnessed over the years, the extended 24 week gestation period should be for all women and not just 'special categories of women'," she said."In addition, the creation of state medical boards could potentially create impediments for women's access to abortion services as many women discover they are pregnant at a later stage," Muttreja added.Dr. Jaideep Malhotra, founder of Rainbow IVF and former president of Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India, said it is a "much-awaited, sensitive and forward-looking amendment"  for both the beneficiaries and the gynaecologists, who faced this turmoil for years and had their hands tied in the face of the law.Dr. Loveleena Nadir, a senior gynecologist, said the new rules of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act notified by the Union Government are a welcome move and a leap ahead for women's reproductive choices."I hope that this is a first step towards making safe abortion accessible to all women and not just restricted to women in special categories," said Dr. Loveleena Nadir, Senior Gynecologist in New Delhi."This would empower women and make India a liberal woman supporting country," Nadir added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-abortion-rules-notified-for-special-categories-of-women-details-here-101634179830782.html

14-10-2021||India||Explained: Why bypolls in 14 states are crucial ahead of Assembly elections||The country is set to witness assembly elections in five states next year. But before that, by-elections to three Lok Sabha seats and 30 assembly seats spread across 14 states will capture the political pulse of the country.These bypolls are being held amid fears of the third wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and the ongoing farmers' agitation. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and many state governments will be keenly watching these polls.The seats where Lok Sabha by-elections will be held are Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Mandi in Himachal Pradesh and Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh. In Khandwa, elections were necessitated due to the death of BJP MP Nandkumar Chauhan, while in Himachal, Mandi is vacant since the death of BJP leader Ramswaroop Sharma.

14-10-2021||India||New Kushinagar airport is step towards India firming its Buddhist legacy||Amidst the presence of more than 100 priests and eight high priests from Sri Lanka led by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajpaksa’s minister son Namal, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will place Kushinagar, site of Lord Buddha’s Parinirvana, firmly on Buddhist Tourism circuit by inaugurating the international airport on October 20.Keeping firm sight on 3Ts - trade, tourism, technology - as markers for economic development, PM Modi will inaugurate the new airport also in the presence of ambassadors of at least 10-15 countries, where Buddhism is both practiced and preached. UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath will also be present on the occasion and the two leaders are expected to address a political rally afterwards.It is understood that PM Modi will also visit the Parinirvana Stupa, where Lord Buddha after decades of missionary activity is said to passed away in 487 BCE in Kushinagar. It is said that Mauryan king Ashoka the Great visited the parinirvana site, which was expanded to include a reclining statue of founder of Buddhism during Gupta period after expansion during Kushan empire. The present temple was build by the Central Government in 1956.Excavations in the past century in the area by Indian and foreign archeologists have also led them to believe that Piprahwa, some 100 km away from Kushinagar, was the site of the ancient city of Kapilavastu, the capital of Shakya kingdom, where Prince Siddhartha Gautama spent the first 29 years of his life. Others believe that Kapilavastu is in Nepal. It is at Piprahwa that a buried stupa was found containing relics of Buddha. The founder of Buddhism attained Nirvana in Bodh Gaya in adjacent Bihar.According to UP government officials, more than 110 Buddhist priests and eight high priests are flying from Sri Lanka for the inauguration with 35-year-old Sports Minister Namal Rajapaksa leading the delegation. The priests will conduct religious ceremonies at the Parinirvana Stupa.The inauguration of Kushinagar international airport will coincide with the city being linked with other Buddhist sites by dedicated trains for Indians and foreigners interested in pilgrimage or religious tourism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-kushinagar-airport-is-step-towards-india-firming-its-buddhist-legacy-101634179676541.html

14-10-2021||India||Aryan Khan drugs case hearing to continue today. Here's where things stand||The Mumbai cruise drug raid by Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and the subsequent arrest of actor Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan, among others, in recent days has generated quite a buzz. As the investigation into the case progresses, a Mumbai court will on Thursday continue the hearing on bail applications of Khan and other accused Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha. The court had on Wednesday adjourned the hearing after the NCB claimed to have found Aryan Khan's links with the illicit procurement and distribution of contraband.What is the case all about?The NCB had on October 2 busted the alleged drugs party on the Cordelia Cruise ship, which was on its way from Mumbai to Goa. The team seized 13 grams of cocaine, 21gm of Hashish, 22 pills of MDMA, 5gm of MD, and 6 gm of charas. It has made as many as 20 arrests so far, including two Nigerian nationals.The special Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) court is hearing a plea for bail to Khan and other accused.What NCB has claimed in court so farThe NCB, in its reply filed at the special court on Wednesday, said its investigation has revealed that 23-year-old Khan used to procure drugs from Merchant, his close friend, who was also arrested after the raid on the cruise ship."Investigation has revealed accused number 1 (Aryan Khan's) role in the illicit procurement and distribution of contraband," said the NCB in its reply. The central investigative agency further said, “It is also revealed in the investigation that accused number 1 (Aryan) used to procure drugs from accused number 2 (Arbaaz) and people connected to Arbaaz.”Also Read | Drugs hidden in sanitary pad, shoes: How those aboard cruise tried to evade securityEarlier, the central agency accessed WhatsApp chats between Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant, and officials familiar with the development said that Merchant may have “shared some drugs” with Khan.“Accused numbers 1 and 2 are associated and worked in close collaborations so the offences are attracted against them, especially section 29 of the NDPS Act (criminal conspiracy to commit an offence),” the reply added.The NCB earlier revealed that those aboard the cruise ship initially planned to evade the security check by attempting to conceal the drugs in personal belongings, including shoes, socks, and even inside a sanitary napkin. Elaborating more on this, the NCB said on Wednesday that six grams of charas were removed from the shoes of accused number 2 (Arbaaz) during the raid by the NCB.Aryan's defenceArguing for Aryan Khan's bail plea, his counsel, senior advocate Amit Desai on Wednesday cited many verdicts related to the seizure of a small number of drugs. As he claimed that his client was not even on the cruise and was apprehended as he was going to attend the party, Desai highlighted a few points regarding international practices.Desai argued that many countries have made substances like cannabis legal and removed them from the schedule of dangerous drugs. They (the accused) are some young kids and they have “suffered enough” and learned their lessons if at all, the lawyer said, adding that these kids should not be considered drug peddlers, racketeers, or traffickers since the term ‘illicit drug trafficking’ is very serious.Also Read | Many countries have legalised these drugs: 5 things Aryan Khan's lawyer saidAryan was being represented by advocate Satish Maneshinde in all previous hearings. Earlier, the defence insisted that the NCB has no grounds to continue to keep the accused in custody since no drugs were recovered from the personal possession of Aryan Khan and that his WhatsApp chats only consisted of messages about football and other related stuff. However, Aryan Khan's bail plea has been rejected thrice after he was arrested by the NCB on October 3. On October 7, he along with seven others were sent to 1-day judicial custody. A special NDPS court is now hearing the bail plea.Meanwhile, Maneshinde clarified on Wednesday that the bulk of the main argument on part of Aryan Khan will be carried forth by advocate Amit Desai from here on out and that he will only add anything if required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aryan-khan-drugs-case-hearing-to-continue-today-here-s-where-things-stand-101634170590054.html

He is also scheduled to meet Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat in Delhi.The meeting between Sidhu and the senior leadership of Congress is first since September 28, when he posted his resignation on social media, saying he can’t compromise on Punjab’s future and its welfare agenda. The abrupt resignation triggered a fresh turmoil for Congress which was already struggling to control the infighting in the state unit, months before it is set to hold legislative assembly elections.According to Rawat's earlier tweet, Sidhu is arriving in the national capital to discuss the "organisational matters" of the state Congress with the party leaders. "Navjot Singh Sidhu, President Punjab Congress will be meeting me and KC Venugopal for discussion on certain organisational matters pertaining to the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee at Venugopal's office (in Delhi) on October 14," he tweeted on October 12.The meeting also comes two days before the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting in which the forthcoming assembly elections in five states, including Punjab, are on the agenda.The Congress has been in turmoil in Punjab for the past several months and the replacement of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, who had faced a revolt by Sidhu and several other ministers and MLAs, has failed to put an end to infighting.The cricketer-turned-politician had expressed his unhapiness over some appointments in new chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi's cabinet. Following Sidhu's resignation, both leaders held a meeting and agreed to a “consultation mechanism” to allow Sidhu to have a say in important decisions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sidhu-in-delhi-today-to-discuss-organisational-matters-with-cong-leaders-101634172374140.html

Ayudha Puja symbolise the victory of good over evil and celebration of the annihilation of demon Mahishasura by Goddess Durga, he said in a statement.It is celebrated as part of the Navratri festival.What is Ayudha Puja?Also known as 'Astra Puja' (worship), it is the day when people worship and clean the instruments they use, weapons (whoever possesses it), machine, tools etc.These tools can be as small as pins, knives or spanners as well as large devices like computers, heavy machinery, cars and buses.In South India, Ayudha Puja is also celebrated along with Saraswati Puja.Historical referenceThe story of Ayudha Puja is connected to the killing of demon Mahushasura. According to Hindu mythology, the demon started massacring innocent people after receiving a boon from Lord Brahma that he could only be killed by a woman.All the gods then pleaded Lord Brahma to find a solution to the problem.Goddess Durga was then assigned the task to end Mahishasura. All the gods gave her their weapons to help her defeat the demon.Spiritual and philosophical meaningAccording to spiritual gurus and experts, the worshipping of instruments and weapons gives a feeling of fulfillment. When a person shows reverence to the things he/she possesses, it brings them to harmony with the universe, according to experts."Reverence in ownership frees you from greed and jealousy," said Art of Living founder Sri Sri Ravishankar.Rituals performed on Ayudha PujaOn this day, all the instruments are thoroughly cleaned and worshipped. Some devotees also keep their tools in front of the goddess to seek her blessings and mark the victory she achieved.A mixture of turmeric and sandalwood (tilak) is applied on the tools and vehicles. Some people also decorate these things with flowers.While worshipping Goddess Saraswati, some students seek her blessings by keeping booms and study material in front of them.Union minister Rajnath Singh has performed Ayudha Puja (or Shastra Puja) for several years. In 2019, he performed the puja in Paris while receiving the first Rafale fighter jet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ayudha-puja-history-meaning-and-significance-of-this-navratri-day-101634170307380.html
14-10-2021||India||North Korean children, elderly risk starving: Report||North Koreans living under strict pandemic restrictions are facing a growing food crisis and the most vulnerable children and elderly people in the isolated Asian nation are at risk of starvation, a UN investigator said in a report released Wednesday.Tomás Ojea Quintana said in the report to the UN General Assembly that North Korea’s agriculture sector appears to be facing multiple challenges due to a drop in imports of fertilizer and other agricultural items from neighboring China, the impact of UN and international sanctions stemming from its nuclear program, and an outbreak of African swine fever.He said prolonged and strict pandemic measures since January 2020 have resulted in “severe economic hardship and increased vulnerability to human rights violations among the general population.” The measures include a full-scale border shutdown, travel restrictions between cities and regions, and restricted imports of non-essential supplies including humanitarian goods.Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the Argentine lawyer said, over 40% of North Koreans were “food insecure,” with many suffering from malnutrition and stunted growth. That number has increased, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, he said, pointing to rising prices for rice and corn in different regions in June and emergency government measures.North Korea said Monday that leader Kim Jong Un urged officials to overcome the “grim situation” and “unprecedented difficulties” facing the country and make stronger efforts to improve the food and living conditions of his people. State media said that in his speech marking the 76th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers’ Party, Kim confirmed the party’s determination to carry out a five-year plan to boost “the national economy and solving the people’s food, clothing and housing problems.”Ojea Quintana painted a grim picture of life for the North Korean people who have “already suffered and waited too long for peace, security, development and basic human rights,”Since the COVID-19 restrictions, he said, they have faced a worsening ordeal including further isolation, “wider and harsher state command over people’s lives, the further stifling of economic activity, and the exodus of humanitarian agencies from the country.”As a result, he said, “families can no longer support themselves” and are increasingly taking out loans and selling household items to survive.“Many factories and mines have shut down because of a lack of power, machine parts and raw materials,” Ojea Quintana said. “The number of homeless people and street children is increasing ... (and) social concerns such as prostitution, drug use, trafficking of drugs and robbery are reportedly on the rise due to economic deprivation.”He said the government has reportedly mobilized urban residents, those recently discharged from the military, orphaned children and married women to bolster agricultural production and work on farms. But floods in early August and a lack of fertilizer, pesticides, fuel for vehicles and agricultural parts are “likely to impact food production,” he said.In his wide-ranging final report as the UN special investigator on human rights in North Korea, Ojea Quintana called on the Security Council to consider lifting sanctions “that negatively affect humanitarian assistance and human rights, including under the COVID-19 pandemic.”He renewed his call for the UN’s most powerful body to refer the situation in North Korea to the International Criminal Court or establish a tribunal to investigate possible crimes against humanity.“These crimes are likely ongoing, epitomized by continued operation of large political prison camps,” Ojea Quintana said.The existence of these camps, known as kwanliso, “represents the worst excesses of a system of governance that systematically violates the human rights of its people,” he said.Nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have stalled for more than two years due to disagreements over North Korea’s demand to end US-led sanctions and US demands for significant North Korean steps toward denuclearization.North Korea has ramped up its missile testing activity in recent weeks while making conditional peace offers to South Korea, reviving a pattern of pressuring the south to get what it wants from the United States.“This is the time to send clear signals, take concrete action and find creative ways to give momentum to the stalled diplomatic process for securing a peaceful resolution to the conflict,” Ojea Quintana said, “and it could include the announcement of a peace declaration among parties.”Since he was appointed to his post in 2016, North Korea has refused to let Ojea Quintana visit the country. He said COVID-19 has restricted his visits to neighboring countries, so he held a series of online meetings with victims of human rights violations, their family members, civil society organizations, UN agencies and UN member nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/north-korean-children-elderly-risk-starving-report-101634166816765.html

Like the Maoist leaders are in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and other states and their cadres (in Chhattisgarh) do the job of firing bullets and getting hit… The same is the situation in the RSS. ..The local RSS workers have no value and everything is centered in Nagpur,” Baghel told reporters who sought his reaction to governor Anusuiya Uikey’s letter.The RSS, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) ideological fount, is headquartered in Nagpur.In her letter, the governor sought an impartial inquiry into the violence that took place on October 5 in Kawardha, the headquarter of Kabirdham district, during a rally taken out by right-wing outfits. Scores of people have been booked by the police for the violence.On Tuesday, police named former CM Raman Singh’s son Abhishek Singh and BJP MP from Rajnandgaon, Santosh Pandey, in a case registered for rioting and causing damage to property in connection with the communal violence in the town. District police chief Mohit Garg said both were present at the rally which turned violent after bikes were torched and some houses ransacked.Baghel’s comments drew an immediate and sharp reaction from the BJP.Senior BJP legislator and leader of opposition in the assembly Dharamlal Kaushik said, “The way CM has compared Sangh and Naxalism, in reality, these are not Bhupesh Baghel’s words, but are of his Leftist ideology. The Congress has lost its core ideology and deviated from the Gandhian ideology.”Kaushik also advised Baghel to read up on the RSS. “I advise Baghel that if he wants to speak about the Sangh, then he should read about it. One should see the work of the Sangh by going to the Sangh’s place,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/like-maoist-leaders-bhupesh-baghel-takes-swipe-at-rss-bjp-comeback-follows-101634155603278.html

But he doesn’t seem to be free of RSS habit of rewriting history. He has given a twist to what Gandhi actually wrote on Jan 25 1920. Here is that letter to Savarkar’s brother,” tweeted the Congress leader, posting a copy of Gandhi’s letter to Savarkar. Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary, Sitaram Yechury tweeted a copy of Savarkar’s mercy petition on Wednesday. “Preposterous rewriting of history. Savarkar’s mercy petitions are in 1911 & 1913. Gandhiji enters Indian freedom struggle in 1915. Such distortions cannot mislead. The fact is RSS was never part of the freedom struggle. Often collaboratedWhile AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi reminded Singh that Savarkar had sought “leniency, mercy and promising to be a faithful servant of the crown” after just six months in prison, CPI chief D. Raja termed the theory as “factory of lies” and RJD leader Manoj Jha quipped that th BJP’s “‘craft of history’ doesn’t follow rules of history.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-targets-rajnath-over-savarkar-remark-101634152781782.html

14-10-2021||India||Cong leaders caught on tape ‘linking Shivakumar to graft’||The Congress in Karnataka was embarrassed on Wednesday after two party leaders were caught on tape purportedly linking state unit chief DK Shivakumar to allegations of corruption.Party media coordinator M A Saleem and former Lok Sabha member VS Ugrappa were heard whispering in front of microphones and cameras of media organisations minutes before a press conference in Bengaluru on Tuesday. Video clips of the incident went viral on Wednesday.In the roughly two-minute-long clip, Saleem and Ugrappa are heard purportedly talking about corruption and money being made by Shivakumar and people close to the leader. “If they have made 50-100 (crore) imagine how much he has, He is a collection giraki (customer),” Saleem is heard purportedly saying in Kannada and Ugrappa is passively lending an ear. The verbal exchange is caught on the microphones placed before them.In reply, Ugrappa is purportedly heard saying that he did not know about these things.Next, Saleem is heard hailing former chief minister Siddaramaiah and complaining that Shivakumar stammered in his speeches. The two senior leaders are old rivals.After the video clip went viral, the Congress expelled Saleem for six years and issued a show-cause notice to Ugrappa, who is considered close to Siddaramaiah.“Before the press conference, some internal conversations happened. Congress party keeps discipline in mind and the disciplinary committee will take appropriate action and we will all adhere to it,” Shivakumar said.He added that he has no connection with the allegations but conceded that the entire episode was “embarrassing” to the party. “I was never part of any ‘percentage’ (share in contracts) and I don’t need it. I have no connection with it,” he said.Ugrappa feigned innocence and said that he did not respond to Saleem and later pulled up the media coordinator for the statement.“When I was about to start the press conference, he whispered something in my ear. There was an irrigation scam and he said that they are trying to make such allegations (against Shivakumar),” Ugrappa said. He added that Shivakumar is a good administrator, disciplined and a pro-people politician who was not into “percentage” politics.The developments come at a time when the Congress is trying to win some ground back in the October 30 bypolls in Hanagal and Sindgi after a bitter loss in the 2019 general elections and later the collapse of its alliance government with the Janata Dal (Secular).The Congress is also trying to mobilise support on the ground ahead of the yet-to-be announced zilla and taluka panchayat elections which is likely to provide a good indication of which way the 2023 assembly polls could go.But its preparations have been marred by a bitter war between Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar, two of the party’s tallest leaders in the state who are vying to be the next chief ministerial candidate.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) used the episode to attack the Congress.“Former Congress MP V S Ugrappa and KPCC media coordinator Salim discuss how party president DK Shivakumar takes bribes and a close aid of his has made between 50-100 crores in collection. They are also discussing how he stutters while talking and as if he his drunk,” party leader Amit Malviya tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-leaders-caught-on-tape-linking-dk-shivakumar-to-graft-101634152122195.html
14-10-2021||India||Court rejects discharge plea of minister among 6 in 2015 Kerala assembly violence case||In a setback to the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) government in Kerala, the chief judicial magistrate (CJM) court in Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday rejected a discharge petition moved by six legislators, including state education minister V Sivankutty in connection with the 2015 assembly violence case. Rejecting the plea, magistrate R Rekha directed all accused to appear before the court on November 22 to frame charges, which will be later read out to them. The accused contended that the video of the assembly proceedings were heavily edited and media blew the incident out of proportion. They also argued that their sole intention was to disrupt the budget speech and furniture was damaged by the security personnel during pushing and shoving in the assembly. However, the court rejected their contention and asked them to face charges. The counsel for the accused said he said he will move the High Court. Earlier the High Court and Supreme Court had rejected their pleas to quash the case. In March, 2015, the Kerala assembly witnessed violent incidents after then opposition LDF legislators tried to prevent finance minister KM Mani, also the Kerala Congress (M) chairman and a constituent of ruling UDF then, from presenting the budget alleging his role in the 2014 bar bribery case. Angry members snapped mikes, threw chairs, destroyed furniture and damaged lights during the ruckus, which also resulted in two legislators getting hospitalised. The session was live when the violence took place and property worth ₹2.20 lakh was destroyed in the melee. Since coming to power in 2016, the LDF tried to withdraw the case but the CJM court rejected the move in 2018. The government then moved the high court, which also turned down its plea. The Pinarayi Vijayan-led government had invoked the privilege of legislators and public interest to justify its decision to withdraw the case, but the high court rejected it saying privilege was not a license to unleash violence in the House. Later, in July, the Supreme Court also upheld the lower court’s verdict and directed all accused to face criminal proceedings. The apex court said acts of destruction of public property cannot be equated with either the freedom of speech of the legislator, or with forms of protest legitimately available to the members of opposition. “Privileges and immunities are not gateway to claim exemption from the general law of the land, particularly as in this case the criminal law which governs the action of every citizen,” a bench of justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah had said. Following the SC rap, opposition Congress sought the resignation of one of Sivankutty, but chief minister Vijayan rejected it saying the government will fight it out legally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-rejects-discharge-plea-of-minister-among-6-in-2015-kerala-assembly-violence-case-101634152061684.html
14-10-2021||India||Siddaramaiah, BSY dismiss Kumaraswamy’s secret meeting claim||Senior Congress member and leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah and senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader BS Yediyurappa on Wednesday dismissed JD(S) leader HD Kumaraswamy’s claim that both the leaders had secret late night meeting.Kumaraswamy on Tuesday alleged that two others who occupied the top post in the chair were holding meetings as a result of which the Income Tax (I-T) raids were unleashed in an effort to “control” Yediyurappa.“I had gone to meet Yediyurappa on his birthday. I had not met him personally as chief minister or as the Leader of Opposition. I have not met him (personally) till today. We both were in the same hospital when we were infected by Corona, even then we had not met,” Siddaramaiah said.The Congress leader said that it was actually Kumaraswamy who held multiple meetings with Yediyurappa when the latter was the chief minister. Terming the claims as ‘blatant lies’, Siddaramaiah said that he would retire from politics if Kumaraswamy can prove that he had met Yediyurappa.Yediyurappa also took to social media to rubbish the claims made by his predecessor.“Other than my birthday on February 27, 2020, I have not personally met Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah. I have no need to have such a meeting. We in the party are working to bring BJP back to power in the state,” Yediyurappa said in a post on Twitter.He added that his only goal was to bring back BJP to power in 2023 and has been working on the same.“I have never compromised on the ideology that I have believed in, and will never compromise in the future. As Siddaramaiah has clarified that no such meeting has taken place, I’m too clarifying that the reports in the media in this regard are far from truth and meaningless,” Yediyurappa added.The claims and denial come at a time when the three major political parties in Karnataka are gearing up for the October 30 bypolls in Hanagal and Sindgi that has evolving into a huge electoral battle for all the outfits in the state.Kumaraswamy has been actively making statements against the Congress and the BJP as the former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda-led party is shrug off the tab that it is in a tacit alliance with the saffron outfit to take on the Congress, which they both consider the common enemy.The recent IT raids on close associates of Yediyurappa had given the political opposition another opportunity to attack BJP and its internal rumblings which had led to the 78-year-old stepping down from the top post on July 26.Kumaraswamy on Tuesday hinted that the IT raids on Yediyurappa was part of a possible ₹20,000 crore irrigation scam, as alleged even by BJP legislator AH Vishwanath.“Anyone with the slightest understanding of politics can understand that the recent IT raids were for what reasons. IT raids were with a political motive and it is to control or checkmate Yediyurappa as both (Siddaramaiah and Yediyurappa) had a late night meeting about political developments, and the BJP that has government both at the centre and state got to know about it from their sources, and probably have tightened things,” Kumaraswamy had said.Though the three chief ministers have spared no opportunity to criticise the other, they have worked together in the past as JD(S) has allied with both national parties at the state level as well as smaller district, zilla and taluka units.Karnataka’s politics has been defined, in recent years, by coalition building abilities through which Siddaramaiah, Deve Gowda and Yediyurappa have remained relevant in state politics and have seldom allowed Delhi to dictate terms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/siddaramaiah-bsy-dismiss-kumaraswamy-s-secret-meeting-claim-101634151885337.html
14-10-2021||India||19 candidates in fray from two seats in Oct 30 by-elections in Karnataka||A total of 19 candidates are in the fray in Sindagi and Hangal assembly constituencies for the October 30 by elections, poll officials said on Wednesday.Wednesday being the last day for withdrawal of nominations, two from Sindagi and four from Hangal withdrew their papers, leaving six and thirteen candidates in the fray from the two constituencies respectively.Two candidates from Sindagi are women.Counting of votes will take place on November 2.The by-elections have been necessitated as the seats fell vacant following the death of Sindagi JD(S) legislator M C Managuli and BJP’s C M Udasi from Hangal.While Ramesh Bhusanur, who came second behind Managuli in 2018 polls, is the BJP candidate from Sindagi, Shivaraj Sajjanar is its candidate from Hangal constituency.The Congress has named Managuli’s son Ashok Managuli, who has joined the party, as its candidate from Sindgi, while former MLC Srinivas Mane is its candidate from Hangal.JD(S), which was the first to announce its candidates, has fielded 33-year-old post graduate Naziya Shakeel Ahmed Angadi from Sindagi and 35-year-old B.E, M.Tech (CSE) graduate Niyaz Shaikh from Hangal.This is the first electoral challenge for chief minister Basavaraj Bommai after taking charge. Retaining Hangal is even more important for him as it is the neighboring constituency to his Shiggaon assembly segment.The Congress, by ensuring a win, wants to give momentum for its preparations in the run up to 2023 assembly polls in the state, while JD(S) is looking to retain Sindagi seat and thereby prove that it still commands a support base in the northern districts.Congress leaders have alleged that JD(S) deliberately fielded minority candidates for the Hangal and Sindagi by-elections to help the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/19-candidates-in-fray-from-two-seats-in-oct-30-by-elections-in-karnataka-101634151883037.html

The same situation has happened before in Kalburgi but at least now the government would have taken war foot relief decision,” added Siddaramaiah. The Greek island of Crete anticipated more aftershocks within 48 hours after a 6.3 magnitude earthquake jolted the island, the Athens-Macedonian News Agency (ANA-MPA) reported on Wednesday citing the Earthquake Planning and Protection Organization of Greece (EPPO) earlier today. Following the earthquake, which occurred off the coast of Crete on Tuesday, the island felt two more aftershocks with a magnitude of 4 and 4.4, respectively.

14-10-2021||India||Another building collapses, Bengaluru civic body under lens||Even as the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) ordered a survey of old buildings in the city, one building in Kamala Nagar,which is part of Mahalaxmi Layout, partially collapsed on Tuesday night while side wall of a house collapsed on Wednesday. The collapses in the last few weeks have raised questions on the civic body and its ability to monitor the construction of such structures. The building in the Mahalaxmi Layout which had partially collapsed on Monday night was razed on Wednesday by disaster management personnel. “All the people who lived in those house’s and within the vicinity have been shifted elsewhere. Accommodation and food arrangements have been made for such families,” the BBMP said in a statement on Wednesday. Sharing information on the other collapse, the civic body said, “An old Mangalore tiles house side wall collapsed around 10 am on Wednesday in Ward no 119, second cross, PVN lane, Nagarthpet. No injuries were reported as no one was stayed in the house for last 6 years; as per the neighbours. The house was also not under maintenance. Removal of debris will be started immediately.” The city, since the last few weeks, has been witnessing a sudden spate of building collapses on account of non-maintenance of old buildings and construction with poor quality of materials and basic design flaws. The BBMP has skirted responsibility on the issue blaming the owners and contractors for the collapses, overlooking at the approvals given by the agency. Experts had also questioned the lackadaisical attitude of the BBMP. “ I think there is a need for a proactive approach, like the 15-20 year car policy, with regular checks on old and ageing buildings,” V Ravichandar, a Bengaluru-based urban infrastructure expert, told Hindustan Times.Experts also point out violations of building permits by builders that is often neglected or has the tacit approval of officials.“Because of the violations, the foundation of a building does not have the capacity to take the load,” Ravichandar said. “It is important to involve the community and Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) for early identification of any signs of cracks or damage.”BJP legislator from Mahalaxmi Layout and Cabinet minister K Gopalaiah on Wednesday said that action will be taken against the owners of the buildings. “The police will take action mercilessly against the owners,” he said. He added that around 10 homes next to the dilapidated building in Mahalaxmi Layout has been evacuated to ensure there is no threat to human lives. Stating that the building was among the list of dilapidated structures surveyed by the BBMP in 2009, Gopalaiah added that since the owner had not yet returned the rent advance taken from the tenants in the building, hence people were still staying there. The BBMP carried out a survey of dilapidated buildings in Bengaluru and found that there were at least 185 such structures that had to be brought down. However, by the BBMP’s own admission, only 10 have been brought down so far while people continue to reside in the remaining ones, adding to the possibility of another catastrophe. The BBMP had ordered a rapid survey of dilapidated buildings last month and had given itself a deadline to complete the exercise within 15 days. Gaurav Gupta, the BBMP’s chief commissioner on Wednesday said that there were 185 dilapidated buildings in the 2019 survey, of which only 10 have been demolished and action was being taken on the remaining ones. “The new survey had a 15 day deadline and we have got preliminary results,” Gupta said in Bengaluru on Wednesday. There have been at least six buildings that have collapsed in Bengaluru in the last couple of weeks and Gupta had instructed zonal joint commissioners and chief engineers to form a committee to conduct a resurvey of dilapidated buildings and submit a report within 15 days.On September 30, revenue minister R Ashok held a meeting with BBMP, the city’s civic body, to take stock of old and dangerously unstable buildings in the city.Most of Benglauru’s public infrastructure is crumbling as roads are full of potholes, uncleared garbage, unplanned expansion of the city, encroached and toxic lakes and flooding of homes, offices and streets during heavy rains, making life miserable for the over 12 million residents of a city that aspires a global status on account of its prowess in technology, startups and aerospace among other sectors. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), at least 18 people in Bengaluru are said to have died due to negligence of civic bodies in the whole of last year which is more than six times of such fatalities recorded across at least six other urban centres in the country including Delhi and Mumbai. The BBMP has blamed the heavy rains witnessed in Bengaluru as the reason for some of these deaths and accidents but has never clarified why the quality of roads and civic infrastructure in one of India’s richest cities remain this poor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-building-collapses-bengaluru-civic-body-under-lens-101634151822985.html
14-10-2021||India||Karnataka CM Bommai’s remark on moral policing triggers row||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Wednesday stoked a controversy with his statements that appeared to justify incidents of moral policing and communal disharmony in the state.“There are several sentiments in the society. Those emotions should not be affected and such should be the behaviour. When such emotions are hurt there is likely to be an action and reaction,” Bommai told reporters in Mangaluru, about 350 km from Bengaluru.Besides policing, Bommai said, the government’s duty is also about taking action to maintain harmony in society.“Even youngsters should watch their actions to ensure it does not hurt sentiments of the society,” he said, adding that there should be “morality in the society and we cannot live without it”.Reacting to the CM’s remark, a statement endorsed by 35 human rights activists and organisations stated that the justification of moral policing and communal violence by the chief minister sends out a “dangerous message”.“This statement has been made at a time when instances of communal policing have increased in the Karnataka, which has in fact witnessed the killing of persons for the simple act of loving across caste and religion,” said the statement released on Wednesday.“Your statement that social morality is (to) be protected is not an innocent message. It sends out a dangerous message that as far as you are concerned, it is ok to use violence to enforce what some people see as ‘morality’,” the statement added.Activists also said such acts of violence affect the dignity of the youth and instill fear in them. “It condemns minorities and Dalits to lead the life of second class citizens. It also conveys the message that women have no right in choosing their partners. It is an attack on all women in fact. It also fills the minds of many youth among majority community with hate,” the statement added.The CM’s statement comes at a time when Karnataka has been witnessing a surge in cases of moral policing allegedly by individuals associated with right-wing outfits.On Tuesday, police in Bagalkote district arrested eight people after a fight between two Class IXth students took communal colour after members of both Hindu and Muslim groups attacked each other.According to the police, both students are from the same locality. There were allegations that one of the students objected to the other wearing a skull cap, however, police said they are yet to ascertain what led to the fight.On September 28, decapitated body of a 24-year-old Muslim man, Arbaz Mullah, was found on a railway track in Belagavi district. On October 8, police arrested 10 people, including the parents of a woman he was in a relationship with, for his murder.The Belagavi police said the woman’s parents, Eerappa and Susheela Kumbhar, and Maharaja Nagappa alias Pundalik Mutgekar, a member of Hindu group Sri Ram Sena Hindustan, are the prime suspects in the murder.On Monday, HT reported two separate cases of moral policing in Dakshina Kannada and Shivamogga districts.In the Dakshina Kannada incident, police said two persons belonging to a right-wing group waylaid a car with four occupants, including a Muslim couple and two Hindu girls, and objected to them travelling together.In Shivamogga district, two youngsters were detained in a case of moral policing after they allegedly assaulted a Hindu youth for dropping off a Muslim girl on his two-wheeler.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-cm-bommbai-s-remark-on-moral-policing-triggers-row-101634151821644.html
14-10-2021||India||Govt withdraws quarantine rules for UK nationals||ndia has withdrawn the need for UK nationals to mandatorily quarantine for 10 days upon arrival, irrespective of their vaccination status, days after the government in London added India to the list of countries from where people will be able to show proof of vaccination to skip a similar quarantine rule.The decisions caps a controversy over vaccine passports that reached some of the highest diplomatic channels, beginning with the UK refusing to recognise India’s vaccine certificates at first and prompting a retaliatory move by New Delhi.In an official memorandum issued on October 11, the Union health ministry said that based on the evolving scenario, it was decided that the revised guidelines stand withdrawn and the earlier guidelines on international arrival issued on February 17, this year, will be applicable to all international travellers arriving in India from the UK, a person familiar with developments said.According to the travel rules from February 17, airlines need to ensure passengers have a negative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result before they board the flight at UK. On arrival, they need to take a test at the first point of entry. If positive, the passenger needs to be isolated and treated. If they are negative, they need to be in home quarantine for seven days and get re-tested on the eighth day.Initially, the UK recognised Covishield vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India but retained the 10-day quarantine period for fully vaccinated travellers from India. The move was attacked as discriminatory by the Indian government. India then decided to impose reciprocal curbs against all British nationals arriving in the country as the contentious issue relating to the UK not recognising Indian vaccine certificates could not be resolved despite holding a series of technical-level talks.UK officials later held multiple discussions with teams in India managing the Co-WIN platform, which is used to issue as well as verify vaccine certificates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-withdraws-quarantine-rules-for-uk-nationals-101634151762843.html

A meeting would be held with the Covid expert committee soon after Dasara festival next week to discuss the situation, and a decision on relaxing the restrictions in border districts would be taken,” Bommai said on Wednesday in Mangaluru. The statements come when Karnataka has actively relaxed Covid restrictions across the state to kick-start economic activity around the festive period.The state government has already relaxed restrictions to allow physical classes for students above 6th grade, 100% occupancy in cinema halls, pubs and other places since October 1.There is now a demand for reopening classes for students between 1-5th grades. “(A) decision will also be taken regarding reopening of primary schools too,” Bommai said.The proposal to reopen classes for young students comes even as trials of Covid-19 vaccination for children aged between 2-18 years old are underway.“Children and adolescents will be vaccinated soon. Karnataka is in the forefront of vaccination,” Bommai said.The Covid-19 infection numbers in Karnataka appear to have stabilised, if government data is anything to go by, allowing the Bommai-led administration to continue easing restrictions after nearly two years of lockdowns and the uncertainty attached to it.Bommai also said that he would take a decision on the withdrawal of cases filed against the public for violation of any Covid-19 norms during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/call-on-easing-covid-curbs-on-state-borders-after-dasara-cm-bommai-101634151761700.html

Three out of the docu-series’ four total episodes are now streaming: ‘The King of Good Times’ about Kingfisher’s Vijay Mallya, ‘Diamonds Aren’t Forever’ about jeweller Nirav Modi, and ‘The World’s Biggest Family’ about Sahara’s Subrata Roy.The fourth and final episode, about Satyam’s Ramalinga Raju, could not be released due to a separate order of injunction from a Hyderabad court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lucknow-court-summons-netflix-over-docuseries-101634151161498.html
14-10-2021||India||Cong meets President, calls for Mishra’s dismissal||A Congress delegation, including Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi, on Wednesday called on President Ram Nath Kovind to demand the immediate dismissal of Union minister of state for home affairs, Ajay Mishra Teni, and ask for an independent judicial investigation by sitting judges of the Supreme Court or high court into the violence in Lakhimpur Kheri earlier this month.Gandhi said after the meeting with Kovind that when he went to meet the families of the victims last week, they had two principal demands.“The family members told us that they wanted two things. First, they want justice. They want the murderer to be punished. They also said, the father of the person who has committed the murder is the (junior) home minister, so, as long as a person is a minister, a proper investigation and justice can’t be achieved,” the Congress leader said.Eight people died after violence erupted after a car mowed down farmers protesting in Lakhimpur Kheri. So far, police have arrested six people--Ashish Mishra, his alleged accomplices Luv Kush and Ashish Pandey, former Union minister, late Akhilesh Das’s nephew, Ankit Das, his gunner Latif alias Kale and his driver Shekhar Bharti -- in connection with the case.The Congress also demanded an “independent judicial investigation by a commission comprising of two sitting judges of the Supreme Court of India or the high court”, and maintained that such an investigation was necessary. “Ajay Mishra Teni in a public function openly threatened the agitating farmers and even boasted about his dubious antecedents. How can justice be done when the original provocation came from Union MoS Home Affairs himself?” the memorandum to the President said.The seven-member delegation also included general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, and senior party leaders KC Venugopal, AK Antony and Ghulam Nabi Azad.They described the Lakhimpur incident as “one of the most gruesome and premeditated acts of bone-chilling murder ever seen and caught on camera” the memorandum said.They also alleged that UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath was making “conciliatory statements towards him (the Union minister), [which] suggests this situation is unlikely to change without intervention” added the memorandum.“Mishra’s role is also yet to be investigated and the same is unlikely while he continues in office. Furthermore, which police official would dare to fairly investigate the son of Union MoS Home Affairs with the father occupying a position of such high influence and who enjoys continued endorsements from both the central and the state governments.” the memorandum said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/laskhimpur-violence-congress-meets-prez-calls-for-ajay-mishra-s-dismissal-101634151100991.html
14-10-2021||India||India will administer 1bn vaccine doses by October-end: Mandaviya||NEW DELHI: India will cross an important milestone of having administered a billion vaccine doses by the third week of October, and will then take a call on resumption of exports of locally-made Covid vaccines, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said on Wednesday. He added that this month, around 280 million doses are available for the country’s vaccine drive. The government said on September 20 that it would resume exports of vaccines in October. And the numbers have suggested for some time now that India will cross the billion-doses mark around mid-October. Till Wednesday night, India had administered 967 million doses, with 276 million people having received both doses and another 414 million having received one dose. A total of 940 million Indians aged 18 and above are eligible for vaccines. Only China has administered more vaccine doses than India. Bharatiya Janata Party insiders on condition of anonymity said that the government is keen on speeding up the vaccination drive ahead of the upcoming assembly elections and wants to present the inoculation programme as a major achievement of the Narendra Modi administration.On Tuesday, the subject expert committee of the drug regulator recommended the emergency use of Bharat Biotech’s COVID-19 vaccine for those in the 2 to 18 years age-group . India is yet to start vaccinations of those under the age of 18, although another vaccine for those in the 12-18 age group, ZyCoV-D was approved on August 20. “As on date, 73% of the total population has been given at least a single dose of the vaccine; close to 30% has received both doses and we are following up with states to increase the vaccine administration. There are 80 million doses kept ready for use by the states,” said a government functionary. In an analysis published on Wednesday, HT pointed out that vaccinations in India may be nearing a ceiling. Most experts believe not more than 75-80% of the population will want to take vaccines. The functionary said that most states have inoculated about 60% of their population (one dose), but without citing numbers said the proportion of vaccinated people is lower in the tribal areas. “There is no shortage of vaccines, it has however been noticed worldwide that there tends to be a saturation once 70% of the population is covered. So efforts are on to cover the remaining the population and counter any vaccine hesitancy. As for the availability of vaccines, the production for October alone is about 280 million doses. Of this 220 million are of Covishield, 60 million Covaxin and 6 million, the DNA vaccine (ZyCov-D),” the functionary saidTo a separate question on how the government plans to counter the bar on travels inoculated with Covaxin which is awaiting clearances from the World Health Organisation and not recognised by countries such as Canada, Australia and the UK., the official said, “While we are awaiting clearances (from the World Health Organisation) we are also working on country- to- country mutual agreements for waiving the restrictions. So far about 15-16 counties including Italy are allowing travellers with Covaxin jabs.” Most countries, including Australia most recently, recognise Covishield, the Indian variant of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 shot. India is also yet to take a call on administering booster doses to senior citizens, healthcare workers and those with comorbidities even though the WHO has recommended booster doses for the immunocompromised. “There is no expert opinion yet in India on the booster doses. The sero survey that was conducted shows a pan India prevalence of antibodies in 67% of the population and we will also be conducting a survey to study breakthrough cases,”the functionary explained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-will-administer-1-billion-covid-vaccine-doses-by-third-week-of-october-mansukh-mandaviya-101634150981684.html
14-10-2021||India||Sputnik Light 70% effective against Delta variant: RDIF||The Russian-made one-shot Sputnik Light vaccine shows 70% efficacy in preventing Covid-19 caused by the Delta variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) said on Wednesday, citing data from the vaccine’s developer.Gamaleya Institute, which uploaded a pre-print on the medical website medRxiv, said its findings were based on 28,000 participants who received a dose of Sputnik Light, compared with a control group of 5.6 million individuals who were not vaccinated.“The Sputnik Light vaccine administered alone has demonstrated 70% efficacy against infection from the Delta variant of coronavirus during the first three months after vaccination. The vaccine is 75% effective among subjects under the age of 60. Sputnik Light has demonstrated a superior efficacy compared with some two-shot vaccines, which have shown a major decline in efficacy against the Delta variant to less than 50% five months after injection,” said RDIF in a statement based on a study conducted in Russia.The data used in the study was collected in July 2021 in Moscow.“In a certain cohort of Russian people, the efficacy was seen to be as high as 83% also. The vaccine’s one-shot regimen makes it is a strong solution for countries with low vaccination rates. Sputnik Light can also be successfully used to maintain existing herd immunity as a booster shot,” said Denis Logunov, deputy director, Gamaleya Center.The data comes as Russia battles soaring infections and hesitancy about vaccines at home.Countries around the world are deploying or considering administering third dose of Pfizer or Moderna vaccines or booster shots to some of their population, although there is no consensus among scientists about how broadly they should be used.Sputnik Light as a booster for other vaccines will be almost as effective against the Delta variant as Russia’s flagship two-shot Sputnik V vaccine, RDIF added. Sputnik V, in its two-dose regimen, is one of six Covid-19 vaccines that have been granted emergency use approval by the Indian drugs regulator.RDIF said Sputnik Light would be over 83% effective against infection and over 94% effective against hospitalisation.Kirill Dmitriev, head of the RDIF, told Reuters he expected Sputnik Light to become the main Russian vaccine against Covid-19. “Eventually, we believe that Sputnik Light could be the main vaccine one year from now when many people will just need to get revaccinated or will have had COVID and won’t need Sputnik V,” said Dmitriev.Sputnik Light will be produced by RDIF’s global partners in at least 10 countries (India, China, South Korea, Vietnam, Mexico, Argentina, Serbia, Turkey, etc.).Experts said a one-shot regimen may have benefits for some, but a two-dose vaccine will eventually work better. “One-shot vaccines could possibly be good for people who have been previously infected, as some protection is expected...,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, vaccinologist from Christian Medical College, Vellore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sputnik-light-70-effective-against-delta-variant-rdif-101634150561616.html
14-10-2021||India||UK foreign secy’s visit: Boosting trade, Indo-Pacific security to top agenda||Boosting trade and investment, including negotiations for an interim early harvest deal, and security cooperation across the Indo-Pacific are expected to top the agenda during UK foreign secretary Liz Truss’ maiden visit to India next week.This will be the first visit to Asia by Truss since she replaced Dominic Raab as foreign secretary in mid-September, and only her second trip abroad following a visit to the US and Mexico. She is expected to review bilateral ties with her Indian counterpart S Jaishankar and meet top business leaders in New Delhi and Mumbai during her three-day visit.With India and the UK recently sorting out a row over vaccine certification for travellers, both sides are looking forward to meaningful engagement on key issues, especially trade and investment and closer cooperation across the Indo-Pacific. With the two sides set to launch negotiations for a free trade agreement on November 1, the UK is especially keen on finalising an interim early harvest deal by March 2022.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Truss is expected to make a strong pitch for closer economic ties as part of the UK’s efforts to forge new trade partnerships around the world in the wake of its exit from the European Union. Among the top business leaders Truss is expected to meet during her visit is Ratan Tata, the people said.In a reflection of the UK’s focus on the Indo-Pacific, Truss’ trip to Mumbai will be timed to coincide with the arrival of a carrier strike group led by HMS Queen Elizabeth, Britain’s largest warship, in the waters off India’s financial hub on October 21. The aircraft carrier is transiting the Indian Ocean on her maiden deployment and conducted exercises with the Indian Navy in May. The UK carrier strike group will carry out further exercises with the Indian Navy and air force this month.Two executives working in separate industry associations said, requesting anonymity, said the Indian government has been constant touch with domestic industry to obtain its views for trade negotiations with the UK. In order to address concerns of all stakeholders, the commerce ministry sought comments from industry representatives in June, an official of an economic ministry said on condition of anonymity.“FTAs cannot be one-sided. It is about give and take. Hence, industry should be prepared for opening up in certain areas and competing with foreign entities. But the gains are immense for both India and the UK, and both partners are taking the views of industry leaders of the two sides for better understanding,” the official said.Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) director general Chandrajit Banerjee said: “We understand the UK government had done initial consultations with its own industry. In India, industry too was consulted on issues which are part of the early harvest deal as well as for the future comprehensive FTA. These include goods, services, investment and procurement.”He added, “Our trade negotiating team is having regular consultations with industry. Since the target is to complete the early harvest deal by December-end, senior officials have already engaged in negotiations. At the political level, the leaders are likely to meet on the sidelines of the G20 Summit and the WTO ministerial conference later this year.“India is hoping to get preferential access for those products where we lost GSP. That includes textiles, apparel and other labour intensive export-oriented products. Besides, in services, we expect further easing of work visas for Indian professionals, both for intra-corporate transfers and contractual service providers.”PHD Chambers of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI) president Pradeep Multani said possible opportunities existed in negotiating higher thresholds to “reserve some sectors temporarily and to exclude some permanently”.India should take an aggressive approach instead of a defensive one, as Indian businesses would have easier access to the UK market, he said. “It is fair to assume that ICT, financial services, food and beverages and pharmaceuticals will benefit the most from the trade and investment agreement, but this will only become evident as discussions proceed,” he said.According to a spokesperson of FICCI, the two governments have been consulting industry associations in India and the UK. “These meetings have been ongoing since the announcement of the Enhanced Trade Partnership. Once negotiations start between the two countries, more meetings will be scheduled,” the spokesperson said, referring to the partnership launched by the Indian and UK prime ministers during a virtual summit in May.“FICCI has submitted its recommendations to the commerce ministry covering industry expectations on goods and services,” the spokesperson added.The British side is expected to demand the removal of tariffs of up to 150% on spirits, which will require more consultations with the industry before offering any concession as this could impact India’s trade negotiations with the European Union, an industry executive said, requesting anonymity.In the field of services, the UK is expected to demand market access for its legal and auditing firms. This too requires more informed consultations with professional bodies before arriving at any decision, the executive added.As part of the Enhanced Trade Partnership, Britain will open up its fisheries sector to more Indian players, facilitate opportunities for nurses, recognise Indian seafarers’ certificates and enter into a dialogue on a social security agreement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/boosting-trade-indo-pacific-security-to-top-agenda-during-uk-foreign-secy-s-visit-to-india-101634150381523.html

According to them, they received intelligence about the presence of militants in Tilwani Mohalla, in the Waggad area of Tral, and undertook a joint cordon and search operation with the army and Central Reserve Police Force.“The terrorists were given repeated opportunities to surrender; instead, they fired indiscriminately on the joint search party, which retaliated. In the ensuing encounter, one terrorist was killed, and his body was retrieved from the site of the encounter.He has been identified as Shamus-ud-din Sofi alias ShamSofi, a top commander of JeM,” said a police spokesperson on condition of anonymity.Police said Sofi was active as a militant since June 2019, figuring among the most-wanted Jaish commanders operating in the Kashmir Valley.“He was also part of groups involved in several terror cases, including attacks on security establishments and atrocities on civilians, and there were several cases against him,” the spokesperson said.The police said Sofi was first arrested in 2004 and detained under Public Safety Act for aiding terror activities.Sofi was arrested for a period of two months and then released on bail.“He provided logistical support to terror groups operating in Tral before joining an outfit himself,” the police spokesperson said, adding that Sofi also motivated local youth to join terror outfits, recruiting some himself.According to an official document, in 2007, Sofi was arrested again in another case. In 2008, he was detained under PSA as he continued his anti-national activities before being released after the Jammu and Kashmir high court order on bail. In 2019, Sofi left his home and joined the ranks of JeM and was active in the region since then.Sofi lured several young people to join terrorism . He was involved in two cases of civilian killings -- of Mohammad Ayoub Ahenger in 2020 and Shakeela in 2021, states the document. In January 2020, during an encounter in Pulwama’s Khrew, Sofi’s escaped, the document added.So far, 121 militants, including top commanders of various militant outfits, have been killed in Kashmir this year. This month alone, 10 militants have been killed in separate encounters.Since Sunday night, six encounters have taken place in Kashmir, following a spate of killings of civilians, including a well-known Srinagar chemist and two school teachers, for which a little-known outfit called The Resistance Front, believed to be backed by the Lashkar-e-Taiba, has claimed responsibility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-jaish-commander-gunned-down-in-pulwama-encounter-101634150322791.html
14-10-2021||India||NCB opposes Aryan Khan’s bail petition, hearing to continue today||Mumbai: The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Wednesday opposed the bail application filed by Aryan Khan, model Munmun Dhamecha and actor Arbaaz Merchant, arrested in connection with the seizure of drugs on board a cruise ship off the Mumbai coast, saying the agency has sought the ministry of external affairs’ help to arrest a foreign national, a suspected peddler.NCB, in its affidavit, told the court that Aryan Khan, son of actor Shah Rukh Khan, chatted with peddlers about bulk drugs and would procure them through actor Arbaaz Merchant. “During initial investigation, some international linkages pertinent to this applicant (Aryan Khan) have been unearthed which prima facie indicate towards illicit drug procurement. The investigation requires sufficient time so as to approach the foreign agency concerned,” the affidavit said.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, who appeared for NCB, told the court that bail applications are heard day in and out, but it is not like they have to be decided on the same day. “NCB is a credible agency dealing with drug trafficking. Consumption of drugs by youngsters is affecting the whole nation, not only economically but also otherwise. The agency is concerned about the gangs involved and efforts are made to trace them,” Singh said.“There are chats that mention about commercial quantities or bulk quantities. There are chats with foreign nationals in reference to hard drugs. Somebody won’t order bulk quantities for consumption. There is something more. We have spoken to the ministry of external affairs and are trying to locate the foreign national,” the ASG added.Requesting for bail for Aryan Khan, senior counsel Amit Desai told the court: “They are not drug peddlers or drug traffickers, but young kids. They have learnt their lessons, let us not penalise them.”“Nothing was found on Aryan Khan, whatever was found was from Arbaaz Merchant, that to 6 grams of Charas, the agency has been relying on his statement and claiming that both of them used to consume it. This has a one-year punishment, the involvement in consumption, no substance for sale, and there is no money, so no purchase.”Desai told the court that Aryan Khan had no money, so there was no question of purchase.Senior counsel Taraq Sayyad, representing Arbaaz Merchant, Aryan Khan’s friend, told the court: “It’s a clear case of consumption. The court should immediately grant bail; there is even no need for prosecution. Both were together and they have already accepted the fact; they don’t know anybody else. They have already spent time in jail so should be granted bail.”Counsel Ali Kashif Khan, who argued for Munmun Dhamecha, said: “I am a fashion model who had gone to do a ramp walk on the cruise. They recovered drugs from my room but there were two more people in the same room. I had just reached the cruise when the raid happened.”After hearing the arguments, additional sessions judge VV Patil adjourned the matter to Thursday. Earlier, a metropolitan magistrate rejected the bail applications of the three accused, saying they were not maintainable before it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncb-opposes-aryan-khan-s-bail-petition-hearing-to-continue-today-101634150081451.html
14-10-2021||India||Political row erupts over move to extend BSF jurisdiction||A decision by the Union home ministry to extend the area under jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF) in three states sparked a political controversy on Wednesday with the ruling parties in Punjab and West Bengal opposing the decision.The third state, Assam, is ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The Union government amended the BSF Act to authorise the force to undertake search, seizure and arrest within a larger 50 km stretch, instead of the existing 15 kms, from the international border in Punjab, West Bengal and Assam.In Gujarat, which shares border with Pakistan, the same limit was reduced from 80 km to 50 km, and in Rajasthan, it was kept unchanged at 50 km.Punjab, which is ruled by the Congress, called the move an attack on federalism.“I strongly condemn the government of India’s unilateral decision to give additional powers to BSF within 50km belt running along the international borders, which is a direct attack on the federalism. I urge the Union home minister Amit Shah to immediately rollback this irrational decision,” Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi tweeted.Earlier in the day, the chief minister faced some barbs from former party state unit chief Sunil Jakhar. “Has Charanjit Channi unwittingly managed to hand over half of Punjab to Central govt? 25000sq km (out of total 50,000sq km) has now been placed under BSF jurisdiction,” Jakhar tweeted.Former chief minister Amarinder Singh supported the move. “Let’s not drag central armed forces into politics,” he said.In Bengal, the ruling Trinamool Congress opposed the decision.“I am sure the Bengal government will oppose this because it (the plan) is infringing on the sovereign rights of the state. The BSF, in any case, is a problematic organisation. There are allegations of links between BSF and smugglers. To let them increase their area of operation would be suicidal. I totally oppose this,” party MP Saugata Roy told HT.In Bengal, several officers of the BSF are under the scanner of the Central Bureau of Investigation in a 2020 transborder cattle smuggling case.A BSF spokesperson said the decision established uniformity in defining the area within which the force could operate. “This will also enable improved operational effectiveness in curbing trans-border crime,” the spokesperson added.The BJP accused the Opposition of politicising national security. “We hope that political parties would rise above their political interests and not create a precarious situation,” said party national secretary Subhash Sharma. The Union home ministry issued a notification in this context on October 11 amending a July, 2014 enabling provision for the BSF personnel and officers while they operate in border areas.The notification will allow the force to search, seizure and arrest on par with the state police in an extended area. BSF personnel will continue to invoke these powers in the “whole of the area” in Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Nagaland and Meghalaya and the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-row-erupts-over-move-to-extend-bsf-jurisdiction-101634149961784.html
14-10-2021||India||Coal power generation outage down to 6 GW from 11, says ministry||The coal-based electricity generation outage came down to 6 GW on Wednesday from 11 GW a day earlier, the power ministry said in an official statement. The government statement comes against the backdrop of the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) drawing up a plan to ensure uninterrupted fuel supplies to power plants amid some states raising concerns that depleted stocks at power plants may lead to blackouts.“The Power System Operation Corporation Ltd (POSOCO) reported that the total capacity of units under outage due to low coal stocks has reduced from 11 GW on October 12 to 6 GW on October 13,” the ministry said.Earlier in the day, coal minister Pralhad Joshi said cumulative coal supplies to thermal power plants crossed 2 million tonne on Tuesday and dispatch of the dry fuel is being enhanced to the plants.“I don’t want to do politics over this. We have already been meeting the total requirement. Today, the requirement is 1.1 million tonnes of coal for power generation and we have already supplied two million tonnes. The stock is also rising because of it. I assure that there will be no problem in meeting the supply for power generation in the country,” he said.In a letter issued on Tuesday, the Union ministry of power requested all states and UTs to utilise unallocated power of the central generating stations (CGS) to meet the requirement of their own consumers only. In case of excess power, it asked the states to inform the ministry, so that the electricity can be diverted to needy states.“It has been observed that some states are not supplying power to their consumers and imposing load shedding in some areas. At the same time, they are also selling power in the power exchange at a high price,” read the letter signed by deputy secretary, GoI, Devashis Bose, without naming any state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coal-power-generation-outage-down-to-6-gw-from-11-says-ministry-101634149722769.html
14-10-2021||India||AAP promises 24-hour power supply, industries in Punjab||Amid the ongoing power crisis due to coal shortage, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who is on a two-day visit to Punjab, promised round-the-clock electricity supply in the state if his party is voted to power in the 2022 polls. He said the power scarcity in Punjab was man-made and once the transmission system is upgraded, half the problem will be solved. “We faced a similar problem in Delhi during our initial years in government. We changed the transmission system, and the situation has improved to the point that people don’t buy inverters now,” Kejriwal said. He was speaking during an interactive session with the Jalandhar-based industrialists at a private resort. He unveiled a 10-point agenda for the development of industry, trade and commerce. The chief minister underlined the need to give special focus on MSME and small scale industry sectors. “Ek mauka saanu vi (give us a chance too). I assure you that you will forget others,” Kejriwal said.After listening to the grievances of industrialists, Kejriwal pledged to end red-tapism and ‘inspector raj’. “Corruption runs in the system because the intentions of the governments are not honest. If the CM and ministers are honest, the entire system will fall in place. We did this in Delhi,” he said. Kejriwal further said that the problem of delay in VAT(value-added tax) refunds will be solved within 3-6 months after coming to power, and an instalment system will be introduced. To prove his point, the AAP leader said his government in Delhi had stopped “raid raj” and reduced the VAT rate that led to the doubling of tax revenue at ₹60,000 crores. It happened because the government trusted the traders, he said. Kejriwal also promised the formation of a trade and industry body and its decisions will have to be implemented by the state government. He also underlined the need to make the change of land use (CLU) process transparent to eradicate corruption. AAP Punjab president and MP Bhagwant Mann, MLA Aman Arora and other senior leaders of the party were also present. Meanwhile, a group of farmers opposed Kejriwal’s event, but the police kept them at bay. Leader of opposition in the Punjab Assembly Harpal Singh Cheema said they don’t organise rallies as advised by the Samuykt Kisan Morcha.

14-10-2021||India||Amend discriminatory info on LGBTQIA+: NMC to institutes||Medical institutions shouldn’t teach students in a way that is derogatory or insulting to the LGBTQIA+ people and authors of medical textbooks should amend all unscientific and discriminatory information about the community, India’s apex medical regulatory body said on Wednesday.In an advisory, the National Medical Commission (NMC) said various medical textbooks, especially those in forensic medicine, toxicology and psychiatry contain unscientific and derogatory remarks against Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex and Asexual people. “All medical universities, colleges, institutions are requested not to approve books as recommended…if the books have unscientific, derogatory and discriminatory information about virginity, LGBTQIA+ community and homosexuals,” said the advisory, signed by NMC secretary Dr Anjula Jain.The advisory referred to a Madras high court judgment last month that said “queerphobia” – prejudicial and abusive attitudes and behavior towards the community – was rampant in medical education. The court referred to a report by Dr Trinetra Haldar Gummaraju who stated that the curriculum of undergraduate forensic medicine described “sodomy”, “lesbianism” and “oral sex” as sexual offences, and “transvestism” (cross-dressing) as a “sexual perversion”.“The NMC’s advisory based on the Madras HC’s verdict is a long-awaited and welcome step in India’s medical history. I applaud it with cautious optimism, and can only hope that authors and institutions across the country abide by the apex med-ed body,” Dr Gummaraju said. The NMC advisory asked the guidelines to be strictly applied by the government and authorities. “All medical universities, colleges, institutions are requested that while teaching UG and PG student, where the issue of gender or similar kind arise, the mention of clinical history or complaints or signs or symptoms, examination findings or history about nomenclature shall not be taught in such a way that it becomes/perceived in any way derogatory/discriminatory/insulting to LGBTQIA+ community,” the document read.Experts hailed the move. “Stigmatised, pathologised contents in medical textbooks are getting removed finally. I see the next generation of medical professionals is knowledgeable, wise, compassionate, and ethical in their approach to their patients from the LGBTQIA+ community,” said Dr Sameera Jahagirdar, a senior clinical fellow at Barts Health NHS Trust in the UK.Research by her, Dr L Ramakrishnan of SAATHII, an NGO, and others found that some authors called lesbians “mental degenerates or those who suffer from nymphomania. “Lesbians who are morbidly jealous of one another, when rejected may commit homicide, suicide or both,” read an excerpt from a forensic medicine and toxicology book.Other books listed homosexuality as a disorder and even mentioned conversion therapy, which is banned in several countries and was harshly criticised by the Madras high court.“This is a very encouraging development and we eagerly await its implementation by public and private medical colleges across the country. The issue is, however, not limited to Forensic Medicine and Psychiatry, but extends to other fields such as Gynecology, Pediatrics, and General Medicine,” said Dr Ramakrishnan.He pointed out that the ‘competency-based curriculum’ of the erstwhile Medical Council of India (2018-2019) contained antiquated terms like sodomy and gender identity disorder. “We hope the NMC will also address content in these other disciplines, and take a stand against conversion therapy.”The landmark Madras HC order had come on a petition by two students from Tamil Nadu who approached the court to seek protection from their families and the police. In response, the HC issued instructions to a slew of state and central agencies to frame guidelines that recognise the rights of the community. “The case brought to the court’s attention about wrong and unscientific information in medical textbooks, including conversion therapy. It is a welcome step and another instance where courts have led the way,” said Manuraj S, the petitioners’ lawyer.The judge, N Anand Venkatesh, even undertook counselling to understand the identity and vulnerabilities of the petitioners, and invited Dr Gummaraju to write a report on the issue. “Originally, I’d only sought to impart basic gender/sexuality literacy to justice Venkatesh. However, I believed my report would be incomplete without details of the hopelessly transphobic and queerphobic chapters in the Indian medical syllabus that normalise horrific violence and discrimination at the hands of doctors,” said Dr Gummaraju. She said these textbooks invalidated her existence and that of thousands of other queer and trans medical students and patients alike. “Now, there is something to slap across the faces of doctors who have practiced discrimination and called it ‘medicine’,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amend-discriminatory-info-on-lgbtqia-nmc-to-institutes-101634149481724.html
14-10-2021||India||India rejects China stand on V-P’s Arunachal tour||India on Wednesday angrily rejected China’s objection to a visit to Arunachal Pradesh by vice president M Venkaiah Naidu and again called on the Chinese side to work for the speedy resolution of the standoff on the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The terse exchange between the two countries highlighted tensions caused by the standoff in eastern Ladakh, which has dragged on for more than a year-and-half, and fresh face-offs between troops of the two sides in Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh sectors of the LAC.Naidu made a two-day visit to Arunachal Pradesh over the weekend as part of a tour of the northeast, and addressed a special session of the state assembly in Itanagar on Saturday. Responding to a question on the visit from state-run media, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Beijing doesn’t recognise Arunachal Pradesh (as part of India) and is firmly opposed to visits to the region by Indian leaders.Hours later, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi rejected China’s objection to the visit and asserted that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of India.“We have noted the comments made today [Wednesday] by the Chinese official spokesperson. We reject such comments. Arunachal Pradesh is an integral and inalienable part of India,” Bagchi said.“Indian leaders routinely travel to the state of Arunachal Pradesh as they do to any other state of India. Objecting to the visit of Indian leaders to a state of India does not stand to reason and understanding of Indian people,” he said.India’s demand for China to speed up the resolution of the standoff in eastern Ladakh was reiterated by Bagchi, who again accused the Chinese side of causing tensions along the LAC through unilateral attempts to “alter the status quo” in the border areas.“Further, as we have mentioned earlier, the current situation along the LAC in the Western Sector of the India-China border areas has been caused by unilatteral attempts of Chinese side to alter the status quo in violation of the bilateral agreements,” he said.“Therefore, we expect the Chinese side to work towards early resolution of the remaining issues along the LAC in eastern Ladakh while fully abiding by bilateral agreements and protocols rather than trying to link unrelated issues,” Bagchi added.The raising of Naidu’s visit to Arunachal Pradesh by Chinese state-run media was an indication that Beijing intentionally raked up the issued against the backdrop of the lingering tensions due to the LAC standoff.Replying to a question from Xinjiang Television, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao said: “China’s position on the boundary issue is consistent and clear. The Chinese government has never recognised the so-called Arunachal Pradesh established unilaterally and illegally by the Indian side and is firmly opposed to the Indian leader’s visit to the area concerned.”Zhao added, “We urge the Indian side to earnestly respect China’s major concerns, stop taking any action that would complicate and expand the boundary issue and refrain from undermining mutual trust and bilateral relations. It should instead take real concrete actions to maintain peace and stability in the China-India border areas and help bring bilateral relations back on the track of sound and steady development.”During his address to Arunachal Pradesh assembly, Naidu highlighted the transformation of the northeast and said this was evidence of resurgence in the region’s development after being neglected for decades.China has often objected to visits to Arunachal Pradesh by Indian leaders and even the Dalai Lama as part of its efforts to lay claim to the region, which Beijing refers to as “South Tibet”.The latest exchange between the foreign ministries of India and China came two days after a meeting of senior military commanders was unable to make any progress on disengagement and de-escalation at the remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh.Both countries doubled down on their positions, and the Indian said the Chinese side “was not agreeable” and “could not provide any forward-looking proposals” in response to constructive suggestions for ending the standoff on the LAC. A spokesperson for China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) contended India was making “unreasonable and unrealistic” demands.New Delhi has insisted that it is necessary to end the LAC standoff to ensure progress in the overall bilateral relations. Chinese leaders have said in recent months that the border issue should be delinked from other aspects of the bilateral relationship, a suggestion rejected by the Indian side.The standoff on the LAC emerged in the open on May 5 last year following a violent clash in Pangong Lake area. Twenty Indian soldiers and four Chinese troops were killed in a brutal clash at Galwan Valley in June 2020. Following several rounds military and diplomatic talks, the two sides withdrew frontline troops from the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February and from Gogra area in August.Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash said India has no option but to continue dialogue with China even as it strengthens its infrastructure, defences and countervailing measures. “India should not be in a hurry. The Chinese side will always test your nerve and push the envelope, but two can play the same game,” he said.“China believes time is on their side, and one shouldn’t be taken in by their rhetoric,” he said, noting that it had taken the two countries nine years to resolve a face-off at Sumdorong Chu in Arunachal Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-rejects-china-s-objection-to-vp-s-visit-to-arunachal-demands-resolution-of-lac-standoff-101634124759738.html
14-10-2021||India||PM Modi launches mega infra connectivity plan||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday launched a national master plan for multi-modal connectivity to ensure integrated planning and implementation of infrastructure projects in the next four years, with focus on expediting works on the ground, saving costs and creating jobs.The online “holistic governance” system – PM Gati Shakti – aims to reduce logistics costs and boost the economy with a planned National Infrastructure Pipeline of over ₹111 lakh crore.The Prime Minister said that with the resolve of “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (self-reliant India), the foundation for the next 25 years is being laid, and it will provide “Gati Shakti (speed and power) to the 21st century India”.“PM Gati Shakti Master Plan not only brings together governmental processes and various stakeholders, but also helps to connect different modes of transportation. This is an extension of holistic governance,” Modi said while institutionalising an integrated approach of implementing infrastructure projects initially by 16 central ministries. He also inaugurated a new exhibition complex at Pragati Maidan in the national capital.PM Gati Shakti joins different departments for the coordinated development of projects, from road to railways, aviation to agriculture, Modi said. It involves the creation of a common umbrella platform through which infrastructure projects can be planned and implemented in an efficacious manner by way of coordination between various ministries/departments on a real-time basis.The integrated approach is in line with the government’s plan to raise capital expenditure to boost the economy. Union finance minter Nirmala Sitharaman, in her Budget speech on February 1, announced a ₹5.54 lakh crore capital expenditure (capex) plan in the current financial year. In August, she also unveiled a ₹6 lakh crore plan to monetise the central government’s brownfield assets in four years, which is coterminous with the ₹111 lakh crore National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP).Saying that an integrated approach will change the perception behind the age-old signage, “work in progress” indicating incomplete infrastructure projects, PM Modi added that the signage had become “the symbol of lack of trust”, but “today’s, 21st century India is leaving behind this old systems and practices”.“Today’s mantra is – ‘Work for Progress’, ‘Wealth for Progress’, ‘Plan for progress’, ‘Preference for progress’... We have not only developed a work culture of completing the projects within the stipulated time frame but efforts are now being made to complete the projects ahead of time,” he said.Modi said that during a review of infrastructure projects in 2014, he found that hundreds of projects were incomplete due to the lack of departmental coordination. He brought all projects on a single platform and tried to remove hurdles. “Now the focus is on avoiding delays due to lack of coordination... Because of this, many unfinished projects are being completed,” he said.The PM said the change in approach has resulted in expeditious completion of infra projects. Before 2014, only 1,900km of railway lines underwent doubling. But, in the last seven years, more than 9,000km of railway lines have been doubled. Only 3,000km of railway lines were electrified before 2014, but in the last seven years, more than 24,000km of railway tracks have been electrified, he said. Similarly, before 2014, only 60 gram panchayats were connected with optical fibre, which is now expanded to 150,000 panchayats in just seven years.Union ministers Nitin Gadkari, Piyush Goyal, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Hardeep Singh Puri, Ashwini Vaishnaw and Sarbananda Sonowal were present at Wednesday’s event.PM Modi said infrastructure had not been a priority for most of the political parties as it was not even visible in their manifesto. Now, some opposition parties are criticising the construction of necessary infrastructure, he said. It is globally accepted that the creation of quality infrastructure is the way for sustainable development, which gives rise to several economic activities and creates employment on a large scale, he added.Speaking at the event, Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla said: “This is yet another example where India is setting a global benchmark for digital governance... Building and managing high-quality infrastructure is a national enterprise. Furthermore, roads and rivers do not respect state boundaries. A holistic approach to infrastructure therefore has to navigate the challenges of working through a complex federal system. It is almost like conducting a grand yet complex orchestra. The outcome is a symphony like Gati Shakti.”According to Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) president TV Narendran, the PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan is “a game changer for industry” due to “scale and speed”.Narendran, who is also CEO and managing director of Tata Steel Ltd, highlighted key impacts of PM Gati Shakti. “First, with a GIS based ERP system to map the existing and proposed connectivity projects, there will be immense clarity on how different regions and industrial hubs in the country are linked, particularly for last mile connectivity,” he said.“Second, a holistic and integrated transport connectivity strategy which incorporates roads and highways, railways, ports, airports and waterways into a single, well-targeted, synergistic network will greatly support Make in India and integrate different modes of transport,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gati-shakti-will-expedite-infra-projects-create-jobs-and-bring-prosperity-pm-modi-101634122540736.html
