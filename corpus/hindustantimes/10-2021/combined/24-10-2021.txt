One such is the graveyard of 100 British officers who were killed during the Anglo-Maratha war of 1818 by Maratha army general Bapu Gokhale. The cemetery houses not only the black marble tombstones of these martyrs but also the tombstone of another influential poet, Shahir Saganbhau. Despite being protected heritage sites under the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and finding mention in the Pune Gazette, these tombstones have all but disappeared. So much so that a Pune-based history enthusiast, Sameer Nikam, has written a letter to the chief of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), ASI and Pune police to restore these tombstones and protect the city’s rich heritage.Nikam said, “These tombstones are a part of Pune’s history. And it is sad to see that a part of our history has disappeared from the city and the authorities are not aware of it. The tombstones of British officials and Shahir Saganbhau are protected heritage sites and are mentioned in the Pune Gazette. In such a case, the local bodies should do everything in their power to maintain these heritage tombstones.”Nikam said that Shahir Saganbhau was a famous poet of his time. “Shahir Saganbhau wrote poems and powadas (Marathi ballads) celebrating the heroic deeds of the patriots of yore. He wrote powadas before and during the time of the Peshwas. His powadas on Pratapsingh and Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj are also very famous. Such a figure was buried in the heart of the city. However, due to neglect by several stakeholders, the tombstone is no longer where it was once located. Restoring these historical tombs will give a new lease of life to our rich and varied history,” he said.Pune-based senior historian Pandurang Balkawade said that our heritage sites speak to the new generation and inspire them. “There are some tombstones around Khirkee war cemetery. The tombs are located near the river. All heritage sites should be conserved and protected. The community and local government bodies should spread more awareness in this regard. We should learn from other states in India how they have developed and maintained their heritage sites to attract tourists from all over the world,” he said.Meanwhile, Gajanan Bandore, conservation officer for the Pune division, ASI, said that he is unaware about the location of these tombs. The PMC heritage cell too informed that they are not aware of the location of the tombs. An official from the heritage cell said, “We are looking into the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/history-enthusiasts-call-for-conservation-of-heritage-sites-in-pune-city-101635100081835.html
24-10-2021||Pune||Half of 56 deaths on this killer highway 35 km stretch due to human error: Police||A majority of the deaths since 2014 on the killer stretch between the new tunnel on the Mumbai-Bengaluru highway and Navale bridge have been recorded by local police as being due to human error, officials said on Sunday. The stretch between the new Katraj tunnel and Navale bridge chowk has seen 56 fatal accidents till since 2014, half of them due to “human error” the police department has claimed, adding that the remaining the accidents were mainly due to errors in road design, absence of rumblers and no signboards. On Friday night a tanker rammed into an SUV, another four-wheeler and a container, killing two and injuring two. Despite all the precautionary measures taken by the Pune traffic police department and National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), a major concern about these accidents is people not following traffic rules. “One of the main human errors is traffic violation - switching off the vehicle to drive in neutral gear and allow speeding. This is too dangerous to do on a slope like this, and in the past also there have been several accidents that happened due to this same reason,” said senior inspector Devidas Gheware of Sinhgad road police station. “Of the total 56 deaths reported between 2014 and 2021 on the 3.5km stretch starting from the new Katraj tunnel to Navale bridge chowk, half are due to human error. Apart from switching off the engine of vehicles, many drivers suddenly try and take U-turn on the highway, or a number of vehicles including two-wheelers go where there is no-entry or the wrong side of the road. All this counts as human error and there is a need for public awareness amongst daily commuters on this road,” added Gheware. It has been noticed by the traffic police that to save fuel, often drivers shut the engine on the slope, leading to a failure of the breaks and accidents. A few ago, back several boards were installed near Navale bridge alerting drivers to the dangers of shutting down the engine. Meanwhile, local residents are afraid. Several residential areas like Narhe, Ambegaon Budruk, Dhayari and Vadgaon Budruk are connected to this spot. Sandeep Kute a local resident said, “I often travel through this road for my work and daily, thousands of people pass through the highway and service road. In the past also several accidents have happened here and people have died.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/half-of-56-deaths-on-this-killer-highway-35-km-stretch-due-to-human-error-police-101635099781910.html

24-10-2021||Lucknow||Lakhimpur violence: Minister’s son down with dengue, could not be quizzed||Lucknow/Lakhimpur Kheri: Union minister Ajay Kumar Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra, an accused in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case, was shifted to the district hospital on Sunday after tests on Saturday evening showed that his blood sugar had reached “critical level”. “Some changes” were also seen in his electrocardiogram (ECG) after he was found infected with dengue while in two-day police custody, a senior medical officer said on Sunday. A police official said Ashish Mishra’s illness had interrupted the investigation as the investigators were unable to continue with his cross -examination before seven other accused taken on remand along with him. He said Mishra’s cross-questioning could not be done even on Saturday due to his illness. Ashish Mishra was sent back to the district jail on Saturday evening itself for treatment at its healthcare facility after he was diagnosed with dengue, he said. He said Mishra, his friend Ankit Das, his driver Shekhar Bharti and gunner Latif alias Kaale were taken on two-day custody remand for the second time since Friday evening. He said the investigators, however, cross-examined the other seven accused and the police would seek the custody of Mishra again after his recovery. Another police officer said a panel of senior-most physicians from the district hospital, led by the chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Shailendra Bhatnagar, examined Ashish Mishra in the jail on Sunday morning and referred him to the district hospital for treatment “under observation”. He said Mishra was moved in an ambulance to the Lakhimpur Kheri district hospital and kept in a “safe room” in the emergency OPD ward amid tight security. The CMO said Mishra’s body temperature was normal but his “critical sugar level of 9.1 HbA1c and changes in the ECG required better care and treatment” by experts at the district hospital and that it was not possible in the jail hospital. “At the district hospital, a panel of doctors will attend him under six-hourly observation and subsequent follow-up will be made thereafter,” the CMO said. “Ashish Mishra’s fresh samples have been sent to Lucknow for confirmation,” he said. Ashish Mishra alias Monu is the main accused in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case in which eight people, including four farmers, a local journalist, a driver and two Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers were killed on October 3 after a convoy of vehicles allegedly led by Ashish Mishra rammed into a group of farmers returning from a protest against the three Central farm laws. Four farmers and the local scribe were crushed to death, while one of the drivers in the convoy and the two BJP workers were lynched by angry farmers in retaliation. A total of 13 arrests have been made in the case so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lakhimpur-violence-minister-s-son-down-with-dengue-could-not-be-quizzed-101635098404231.html
24-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Man held for raping minor a repeat offender, say police||Suraj, 20, had to appear before a magistrate in the Tis Hazari court on Friday in connection with a case of sexual harassment case with a minor girl registered against him four months ago. Instead, he went to Ranjeet Nagar in central Delhi, where he allegedly raped a seven year old girl, police said on Sunday after arresting the repeat offender in connection with the second incident. On Friday, Suraj allegedly lured the seven-year-old girl with ₹10 when she was playing with her friends near her home, and took her to a room nearby, and raped her, according to the police. Investigators said Suraj, known by his first name, was earlier arrested for allegedly sexually harassing a five-year-old girl in west Delhi’s Khyala. He was on interim bail when he targeted another minor girl in Ranjeet Nagar, police said.Investigators said nearly 800 CCTV cameras were scanned to identify and nab Suraj, who is a resident of Raghubir Nagar in west Delhi.“Instead of appearing before the court, Suraj boarded a bus from Raghubir Nagar and reached Ranjeet Nagar to eat biryani. He found the minor girl playing near the market, and picked her as his target. He lured the girl to a vacant first floor factory after promising to give her ₹10, buy her sweets, and give a ball to play. He raped the minor girl and fled, leaving her injured,” an officer associated with the investigation said, adding that CCTV cameras captured the suspect taking the girl towards the factory building.Deputy commissioner of police (central) Shweta Chauhan said the girl’s father, in his complaint to the police, said that his wife informed him that their daughter’s health was “in a bad condition”. They admitted her to a local hospital, where the medical staff told the parents about the sexual assault. A case of rape and sexual assault was registered under Indian Penal Code’s sections 376AB and 377 and section 6 of protection of children from sexual offences (POCSO) act.“The case was totally blind because the suspect was unidentified. He was neither related to the girl nor lived in her neighbourhood. Also, his mobile phone number as well as identification document was not available. We formed many teams of the district’s anti-auto theft squad (AATS), special staff and the local police. They scanned nearly 800 cameras to identify the suspect,” said DCP Chauhan.First lead and the chaseInvestigators said the cameras installed within a radius of nearly 10 kilometers were scanned between Ranjeet Nagar and Moti Nagar, the last place where the suspect was seen boarding a bus going towards west Delhi’s Raghubir Nagar. It gave them an idea that the suspect could be from that area, or nearby localities. The police activated their human intelligence network in those areas and shared the video footage of the suspect with their informers as well.On Saturday, the AATS team learnt that a man of almost the same age and physical appearance was arrested four months ago in a case of sexual harassment with a five-year-old girl in Khyala. The team visited Khyala and showed the suspect’s image from the video footage to local residents who identified him as the same man arrested in the harassment case.Since the man was found to be on interim bail, his dossier was accessed and it helped the police identify his residential address. The police raided his house but found him missing along with his family members. The clothes he was wearing during the crime with the seven-year-old girl were found at his house. Local residents told the police that the family goes around selling utensils on streets. They also told the police that the suspect’s parents and siblings had gone to Rajasthan for business. He did not go with them because he had to attend the court hearing in the Khyala case, said an investigator.“From his relatives and neighbours, we got a mobile phone number that the suspect was using. Through technical surveillance, we found that the suspect was moving towards Haryana. He had left home around 8.30pm on Saturday . We scanned more CCTV cameras along the route, and found that he reached Peeragarhi in an e-rickshaw and boarded a bus for Haryana. Our teams chased the bus for nearly 130 kilometres and caught him in Rohtak,” added the investigator.During interrogation, the officer said, Suraj disclosed that he visited Ranjeet Nagar because he loved to eat biryani sold in that area. On Friday, he left home around 8am for the court hearing, but went to Ranjeet Nagar in a bus instead of attending the hearing.“He found the minor girl playing there and lured her to the vacant factory, where he assaulted her,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-man-held-for-raping-minor-a-repeat-offender-say-police-101635098401705.html

24-10-2021||Lucknow||Crucial ABAP meeting to elect new chief in Prayagraj today||The meeting of Akhil Bhartiya Akhada Parishad (ABAP), the top decision-making body of the 13 recognised Hindu monastic orders in the country, will be held at 11 am at Niranjani Akhara in Prayagraj on Monday. After the death of its chief Mahant Narendra Giri on September 20, senior saints will attend the meeting to elect the new ABAP president. The general secretary of the ABAP, Mahant Hari Giri has already reached Prayagraj from Vrindavan. The crucial meeting is being held at a time when the ABAP has already witnessed a split. A faction of Akhadas in Haridwar recently announced their own office bearers of ABAP.“The meeting on Monday will discuss the development in Haridwar and also elect a new president of the Akhada Parishad,” said Mahant Hari Giri.Seven akhadas openly rebelled and announced a new president, general secretary and the working committee on October 21 and distancing themselves from the October 25 meeting in Prayagraj.Rebel Akhadas led by Shri Panchayati Maha Nirvani Akhada and backed by three Bairagi Akhadas, who are believed to be playing a major role in the split, have claimed a majority of akhadas were on their side, and prominent seers were supporting their move and recognising the new working committee of Akhada Parishad. Since Mahakumbh 2021, three Bairagi Akhadas have been demanding due representation in the Akhada Parishad working committee, general secretary post, land allocation and other facilities at par with other major Sanyasi akhadas led by Juna and Niranjani Akhadas.

24-10-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Consumer body seeks govt intervention to get power tariff reduced||The UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad, a body representing electricity consumers in the state, on Sunday sought government’s intervention in getting existing power tariff reduced in lieu of the ₹20,596 crore that the UP Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) has overcharged consumers over the years.Parishad chairman Awadhesh Kumar Verma said the government intervention was necessary because the UPPCL was dilly-dallying in doing justice to the consumers despite the UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) having said it in its order two years ago that the corporation got the power tariff raised more than it needed by showing high losses and more expenses during a last one decade.“Acting on our petition seeking tariff reduction, the UPERC on September 17 issued a notice to the UPPCL asking it to respond to our demand within two weeks,” he said adding “But the UPPCL has sent no reply even after more than a month of the notice was served on it.”He said the Upbhokta Parishad did not favour the demand as raised by some political parties for free power considering the size of the state and the precarious financial state of the UPPCL.“But the BJP government in the state can give a good message to people and also neutralise Opposition’s offer for free power by getting the tariff reduced,” he suggested adding “And reduction of tariff will be no favour to consumers because doing so is UPPCL’s legal and moral obligation,” he said.Verma demanded the government to direct the UPERC under Section 108 of the Electricity Act, 2003, asking it to reduce the tariff in public interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-consumer-body-seeks-govt-intervention-to-get-power-tariff-reduced-101635097861726.html
24-10-2021||Bangalore||‘Karnataka doctor allegedly kills wife to get treasure’: Police||Karnataka police have arrested a doctor for allegedly murdering his wife by injecting high doses of drugs in Davanagere district on Sunday. The arrest comes nine months after the woman’s death and police said that the murder was carried out as part of a black magic ritual. Police have identified the suspect in custody as 45-year-old Dr Channakeshappa who was practising medicine in Rameshwara village in Nyamathi taluk. His wife, Shilpa, died on February 11 following an alleged overdose. Following her death, in his statement to police, Channakeshappa claimed that Shilpa was suffering from low blood pressure. On February 11, he gave her an injection of Dexamethasone following which Shilpa became too sick and died on the way to the hospital. Shilpa’s parents lodged a complaint alleging their daughter was murdered. In the initial police investigation, the doctor was able to evade arrest but policemen later raised suspicion about his movements. The investigation later found that he was practising black magic in recent years and had been visiting several black magic practitioners in the past year. It was during one such interaction when he was advised to sacrifice his wife to access tressure, said police. The doctor then decided to offer his wife as a human sacrifice and killed her with an overdose, police said. The Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) confirmed Shilpa’s death as a result of a drug overdose, following which the police took the accused into custody. The doctor has been charged with murder. This incident comes weeks after Belagavi police started a probe into a suspected case of black magic after a two-year-old girl, who was found unconscious in a sugarcane field in Halyal village near Athani on September 23, died on October 1. Police said that there were signs of torture, especially burn marks on the girl’s body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-doctor-allegedly-kills-wife-to-get-treasure-police-101635097682896.html

24-10-2021||Other||FSDA: 50% of paneer samples fail test in Lucknow, unfit for human consumption||LUCKNOW: Ahead of the festival season, around 50% of paneer samples, collected by the Food Safety and Drug Administration (FSDA) since January 2021 in the state capital, have failed the quality standard and were found ‘unfit for human consumption’. Besides, 30% of khoya, 25% of milk and around 10% of edible oil samples also failed the quality test. Designated officer of FSDA, Lucknow, SP Singh said, “This year the FSDA has collected around 103 paneer samples from various shops in the city, around 50% of them were found adulterated and having low fat percentage or foreign fat. Converting powdered milk into paneer is allowed but paneer must contain at least 50% fat. However, most of the shopkeepers use substandard powdered milk with low fat to earn more profit and also inject foreign fat into the paneer which gets detected in the test. This year, the FSDA will conduct special drives against adulterated sweets, khoya and edible oil from Monday.” Last year, the FSDA had collected around 1,200 samples of various edible items from different corners of the city, out of which 42% samples failed the test, said Singh. Meanwhile, a shopkeeper said, “Around 20 litres of milk is required to produce just 4kg of paneer, the actual cost of 1kg paneer costs over ₹330, if any shopkeeper is selling less than that then he must be compromising on quality.” During the marriage or festive season, the demand of paneer crosses 20 tons per day and no one purchases branded paneer on such occasion. “Most paneer come from milk vendors or sweet shops, where there is no one to monitor the quality of paneer produced,” said an official of the milk producer unit. “There is a need to regulate the sale of paneer, curd, milk and oil,” said the FSDA official. The high amount of adulteration in edible items is a cause of worry, said Medical Director Medanta hospital Dr Rakesh Kapoor. He added, “Any adulteration in edible items affects the human health, adulterators must be given harsh punishment.” Paneer adulteration An official of Pradeshik Cooperative Dairy Federation said that the country produces roughly 15 crore tonnes of milk annually. If all of it were only to be used to make paneer, the country would produce 7 lakh tones only. However, the country consumes 5 lakh tonnes of paneer annually. Since only a small percentage of milk is turned into paneer, then the million dollar question is where does this paneer come from? The officials admitted that the local vendors make paneer from a mixture of maida, palm oil, baking powder, old discarded skimmed milk, some use detergent, bicarbonate of soda and some also use sulphuric acid which is very harmful for health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fsda-50-of-paneer-samples-fail-test-in-lucknow-unfit-for-human-consumption-101635096481597.html

Police officials will teach these children at slum clusters, and road stretches where they beg daily.According to the police, they have also roped in Genpact in its “outreach campaign” as they want to educate and bring these children into the “mainstream of society” so that they do not waste their lives begging on the streets. They have also roped in the basic education department to get these children enrolled in nearby schools.“We have a mission to bring these children back into the mainstream of society through our outreach campaign, and ensure that they do not get involved in crime or other anti-social activities. As of now, we have set up six schools in slum clusters, and more such schools will be opened in the near future to reach out to those children in need,” said Alok Singh, commissioner of police, Gautam Budh Nagar.The six schools have been opened at slum clusters in Noida sectors 14A, 44, 63, 76, 84, and the Noida Extension as both parents of the target children go to nearby construction sites or factories for work, said the officials.“Anti-human trafficking units have conducted a survey on areas where the children were seen begging on roads. After the survey was completed, we decided to set up schools in these slum clusters, taking their parents on board. We are teaching at least 300 children at these six sites. We will conduct another survey on other such areas to reach out to the children there too,” said Vrinda Shukla, deputy commissioner of police, Gautam Budh Nagar, who is also heading the project.“These children are in the age group of 5-12 years, and have not gone to school ever. We have a target to teach and prepare them for schools in a year’s time as they have no exposure to any school earlier. Once they finish this period at our facilities, we will send them to nearby schools as the basic education department is also supporting us. We will keep a track of each child via facial mapping, to ensure that they continue their education at those schools,” Shukla added.Police are also providing books and food to these children on a daily basis, and engaging their families in this mission, so that they do not get involved in anti-social activities and spoil their lives, said the deputy commissioner of police of Gautam Budh Nagar on Sunday.“Parents of these children are happy with the system. They were worried about the future of their children, as they either get involved in crime cases or get addicted to drugs, along with other beggars,” said Shukla, adding that each school at the six sites has at least five to six teachers who teach them through videos, storytelling, and games to keep up their interest in the school.“Genpact has, via corporate social responsibility, donated funds for tents, chairs, laptops, food, and other required services at these facilities,” said Shukla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-police-to-educate-slum-kids-to-stop-them-from-begging-open-six-schools-101635096241688.html

The three victims said they were released nearly after six hours on producing signed cheques of ₹5 lakh each. Complainant Lilu Parcha (50), a resident of Gadhi Chaukhandi village, works as a sanitation worker in Delhi. Lilu’s nephew Arun Parcha said five years ago, Lilu had borrowed ₹5 lakh from one Rajendra Yadav, a resident of Behlolpur in Noida. “Rajendra had given the loan in lieu of fixed monthly instalments with interest. My uncle has cleared the loan in the last five years but Yadav claims he still owes him money,” said Arun. In the complaint registered with police, Lilu said, “Around 8:30am on Saturday, Rajendra, his son Amit, accompanied by four police personnel, reached my house in a Mahindra Bolero. They forcibly pushed me, my brother Salekh Chand and nephew Jitendra in the police van and brought us to Indirapuram,” he said. Arun alleged that the trio was kept at the Indirapuram police station till 3pm. “Rajendra and Amit, along with the police personnel, demanded money for their safe release.

According police, Umar, wanted in abduction and assault on a Lucknow-based realtor at Deoria jail some years back, is at large since CBI Lodged an FIR against him and a reward of ₹2 lakh was declared on his arrest. Umar is the eldest son of former MP Atiq Ahmad and has carried out canvassing for him when Atiq contested bypolls for Phulpur Loksabha constituency some years back while in jail. However, some months later, a Lucknow based realtor Mohit Agarwal alleged that Umar and his associates abducted him from his residence in Lucknow and took him to Deoria Jail where he was assaulted and forced to transfer his properties by Atiq. An FIR was lodged at Lucknow but Umar’s name was removed during investigations. However, the Supreme Court handed over the investigation to CBI in April 2019, following which a fresh case was lodged in connection with the incident against 12 persons including Atiq, his son Umar and associates Zaki, Faruq, Gulam Sarwar, Zafar Ullah and others. In the crackdown against Atiq Ahmad and his gang members, many of their properties were attached while dozens of residential and commercial buildings owned by them were razed by joint teams of administration, police and PDA officials under Gangster Act. While, police investigation revealed about many properties of Atiq and his close associates, none of Umar’s properties were identified or seized. Police officials said that properties, owned by Atiq and his associates and some of his relatives against whom gangster act was lodged, were identified and action was taken against them. Umar was not part of the investigation as no case was registered against him here in Pryagaraj. CBI officials have carried out separate investigations about Umar and might have identified movable and immovable assets owned by him, police officials added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prayagraj-police-to-assist-cbi-in-attaching-assets-of-atiq-s-son-101635095822412.html
24-10-2021||Patna||Lalu Prasad is a big leader, can’t comment on his remarks, says Bhakta Charan Das||All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge of Bihar, Bhakta Charan Das, on Sunday gave a polite but telling response to the remark on him by Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad. “Lalu Prasad is a big leader and I have always had great respect for him. But I am not capable of responding to his remarks on me the way he has made it,” he said, making it clear that he would not like to let the war of words degenerate further. Talking to HT over the phone in the midst of campaigning in Tarapur assembly constituency, Das said Prasad had been the voice of Dalits and deprived sections and he had acquired a bigger stature in politics. “The culture of Congress prohibits me to reply to the comments of Prasad,” added the AICC leader. Earlier, he had alleged that the RJD was hand in gloves with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and said that it won’t be surprising if both the parties team up to form the next government by dumping Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal (United) after the by-elections. Das claimed that the RJD chose to bruise the political dignity by dumping the decades-old coalition with the Congress and walked out of the united front against communal forces only after it reached some kind of an understanding with the BJP. Rubbishing the allegations that he opted out of the coalition owing to his ‘little understanding of political pulse of Bihar’, Das clarified the Congress never betrayed the RJD. “It was the RJD, which dumped the coalition by fielding their candidates on both the seats without consulting the Congress. That was an assault on the self-respect of the party’s 19 legislators. It made the Congress to decide which way it should go,” said Das. Regarding his understanding of the state politics, Das said he took the plunge into social and political activities from Bihar. “It was Bihar that made me the national convener of Chhatra Yuva Sangharsh Vahini and I fought for the rights of land of Bodh Gaya. Soon after taking over as the AICC in-charge, I toured 36 out of 38 districts of Bihar, carried out padyatras and met thousands of grassroot-level workers of the Congress. I served the people of Odisha as MLA, MP and minister in the Union Cabinet. Still, some people have doubts about my ability, but that’s their problem,” said the Congress leader. To a query whether the Congress was expecting too much from the joining of former JNUSU leader Kanhaiya Kumar, Das said that it was not like that. “Kanhaiya Kumar has been born out of agitation. There is spark in him which can guide the youth, like I did it to ensure the rights of deprived and poor people in Kalahandi and settlers of jungles. Kanhaiya represents the same philosophy. Kanhaiya is not an individual, but an inspiration for the talented youth deprived of opportunities and self-confidence,” said the AICC leader, adding that hundreds of youths had been working in the fields to ensure victory of the Congress nominees, Atirek Kumar and Rajesh Mishra, in the bypoll fray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/lalu-prasad-is-a-big-leader-can-t-comment-on-his-remarks-says-bhakta-charan-das-101635095641665.html

They have been living in a rented accommodation, on student visas, in a high-rise in Greater Noida for the past two years.“Dieumerci was driving the car at over 110km/hour at the time of the accident. Due to such a high speed, he possibly failed to spot the bus parked adjacent to the road,” Malik said.We have admitted the injured people to a nearby hospital, police said, adding that Sneha and the three Congolese are undergoing treatment.“Doctors declared Bhattacharya and Mandal dead on arrival. The car was damaged, and all the three riders were trapped inside. We had to cut the door of the car open to pull them out. The rescue operation took almost half an hour,” said a police official, requesting anonymity.Police also said that though they have not found any liquor or intoxicating substance from inside the car, they are checking whether the driver of the car was under the influence of drugs or alcohol.“We have received a written complaint from the family of the two deceased. An FIR has been registered against the driver of the car, and his blood sample has been sent for medical examination,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-2-killed-four-injured-after-speeding-car-hits-bus-on-yamuna-expressway-101635095581572.html
24-10-2021||Noida||G Noida: Residents protest against lack of facilities at housing society||Around 200 residents of La Residentia society in Greater Noida’s Sector 2 staged a protest against the developer for not providing basic amenities in the housing complex, the work for which was started in 2010. Residents planned to carry out a car rally outside the complex but the police stopped them as they had not sought permission for it and asked them to restrict their protest inside the complex only. Residents carried banners and shouted slogans against the developer f the housing project. “The complex is in extremely bad shape because the developer has not completed work on multiple services. There are at least 63 issues that the developer needs to address. He has assured to look into our issues in a month. If things don’t improve, we will protest by taking out a car rally in the city,” said Sumil Jalota, a resident of the society who took part in the protest.La Resident project was launched in 2010 on 20 acres of land in Sector Tech Zone IV. The developer was supposed to handover the possession of the plots from 2013 onwards. However, of the total 3,000 flats in the complex, only 1,200 are occupied since 2016. The remaining units are likely to be completed and delivered in the next two to three years. Residents alleged the developer has offered possession to 1,200 homebuyers without obtaining an occupancy certificate from the Greater Noida authority, structures of building have technical issues causing safety concerns, and fire safety apparatus is not properly laid out. There is no provision for rainwater harvesting, no system to treat sewerage, no waste disposal mechanism in place, no parking, no drainage and no club house among other utility services, said residents. Santosh Kumar, officer on special duty of the Greater Noida authority, said, “The developer has not cleared financial dues yet. Unless the dues are settled with the finance department, the authority cannot issue occupancy certificate and without OC, registry cannot take place. The builder first has to clear the dues.” “The society is not at all safe as the developer has not even constructed a proper boundary wall and placed any surveillance system inside the complex. We have been protesting against the developer but he does not pay heed to our issues,” said Pankaj Kumar, another resident.Eventually, the promoter of La Residentia project, Kulbushan Bajaj, discussed the issues with the residents and assured to resolve the issues. Bajaj said he could not complete the project on time and many utility services were incomplete due to legal disputes.“We shared our problem of funds with the residents. Many homebuyers are yet to pay their remaining dues against their respective flats. How can we complete the project and provide utility services without funds? We can solve many issues once residents start clearing their dues,” said Bajaj. “Initially, the project got delayed due to land dispute between farmers and the government. It got further delayed as there was a court issue involving Amrapali group that had a stake in this project,” said Bajaj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/g-noida-residents-protest-against-lack-of-facilities-at-housing-society-101635095521693.html
24-10-2021||Noida||Noida: Sec-18 market association demands better patrolling as footfall increases||With the festive season underway, the Sector 18 market association has asked the police to increase patrolling in the area as business is booming and footfall increased after the state government lifted the restrictions that were put in place on account of Covid-19, S K Jain, president Sector 18 market association, said the market is getting quite a number of shoppers due to the festive season. “Due to Karva Chauth, a number of shoppers, especially women, visited the marketplace for shopping. There was rush at the salons on Saturday and Sunday. Shops selling jewellery and readymade garments attracted a large number of customers. This is a sign that the market is slowly moving towards normalcy after the Covid-19 outbreak,” said Jain. There are around 500 shops in the Sector-18 market.Jain said due to the lockdowns, which were effected when Covid-19 was at its peak to stem the spread of the infection, many people postponed their weddings and other celebrations. “People’s movement has resumed after the government lifted the restrictions. People are rescheduling their marriage and events planned for other festivities and venturing out for shopping,” he said. The association said last year, the market made a business of ₹200 crore during Karva Chauth. “This year, we have recorded business worth ₹250 crore in three days from Friday to Sunday. We hope the sales will further increase during Diwali (November 4),” said Jain. The market association also held a meeting with the Sector 18 check post in-charge Arun Malik and demanded to improve patrolling in the area.“The police should keep surveillance in every corner in Sector 18 market to ensure no unpleasant incident like pick-pocketing, snatching, etc. takes place. They should monitor movement at all the intersections and ensure a pleasant shopping experience,” Jain said. Malik, who took charge last week, said he inspected the market and found some CCTV cameras were not functioning. “We have improved police patrolling in the market. We are also trying to make all CCTV cameras functional to ensure proper surveillance. During Diwali, we will place barricades and only one entry gate and one exit gate will be opened,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-sec-18-market-association-demands-better-patrolling-as-footfall-increases-101635095101620.html
24-10-2021||Mumbai||Spurious firecrackers being sold under guise of ‘green crackers’ in Mumbai: NGO||With the Supreme Court (SC) in the midst of reviewing the Centre’s plea on the use of green firecrackers this Diwali, Mumbai-based non-governmental organisation (NGO) Awaaz Foundation on Sunday wrote to the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), cautioning against the sale of spurious firecrackers being sold under the guise of ‘green crackers’ in Mumbai. Last week, Awaaz Foundation had purchased 30 varieties of commercially available firecrackers in Mumbai for noise testing at RCF Ground in Chembur, in collaboration with the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB).Of these 30 crackers, only 16 were found to be labelled with NEERI’s stamp of approval. NEERI, at SC’s instruction, has been working since January 2018 on developing new formulations for reducing emissions from fireworks, and is mandated to certify commercially available firecrackers. In addition to NEERI’s stamp of approval, the crackers are also mandated to be affixed with a QR (quick response) code that customers can scan them and obtain information about the crackers’ emission and composition.“Despite this, half of the products available in the market are clearly not labelled, so there is really no compliance with SC’s directions,” said Sumaira Abdulali, director, Awaaz Foundation. In her letter to Dr S Chandrasekhar, director, NEERI, she also pointed out: “Out of the crackers claiming to be ‘green’ and having the NEERI stamp, only a few crackers carried a QR code, while the rest carried bar codes which do not fulfil the requirement of the Hon’ble Supreme Court.”QR codes were mandated by SC to enable tracking of the emissions and content of the crackers. The Apex court also directed that the government should create awareness about QR codes to enable people to monitor authenticity of the crackers they purchase and agencies to ensure that no spurious crackers are distributed or sold, Abdulali explained. “Even those crackers which are labelled green are shown to contain extremely toxic contents such as barium nitrate, which even SC has expressed caution over. Without having this QR code system in place, how are consumers expected to make informed decisions,” she asked.Officials at NEERI and MPCB could not be reached for comment on Sunday. However, Dr Rakesh Kumar, former director of NEERI, said, “QR codes for emission and compositional information are necessary for production and distribution of green crackers. This is a most essential step which has been supported by the honourable Supreme Court in the interest of clean air. Regulatory authorities need to increase public awareness on this tool.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/spurious-firecrackers-being-sold-under-guise-of-green-crackers-in-mumbai-ngo-101635095041568.html

24-10-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s Covid toll crosses 140,000 mark||Even as Covid-19 deaths are on steady decline, Maharashtra’s death toll breached the 140,000 mark, with its tally touching 140,016 on Sunday. Maharashtra on Sunday recorded 1,410 Covid-19 new cases and 18 deaths.The first wave which started on March 9, 2020 and went up to February 9 saw 2,048,802 cases and 51,360 deaths. Against it, the second wave which still continues has logged 88,656 deaths. Although fewer deaths and new cases have been reported in the past 24 days of October, the fatality rate has been high at 1.86 %, as the number of deaths recorded during this period is 949 with 50,966 new cases. In contrast, the fatality rate in September for the first 24 days was 1.68 %, with 87,033 new cases and 1,463 deaths. State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said, “A fatality rate of less than 2% indicates the virus is under control. In addition, we have been able to control the death rate as our focus is on critical cases. Even in case of new patients, we isolate and arrange instant medication.” Dr Wiqar Shaikh, professor of medicine, Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Hospital, said the death rate could have been much lower had the authorities been cautious after the first wave. “The authorities just dismantled the temporary infrastructure they had readied in the first wave and acted as if Covid-19 has disappeared. They should have used the period before the second wave to beef up the entire health infrastructure in anticipation of the second wave. The history of pandemics has shown there will be multiple waves, but all this was ignored,” said Shaikh. He even blamed the citizens, saying they took part in large gatherings after October last year and hardly wore a mask. Mumbai saw 400 new cases with six deaths. The case tally is 754,507 and death toll 16,213. A total of 130,732 tests were done on Sunday, while the number of recoveries was 1,520. The total number of active patients in Maharashtra currently stands at 23,894, while the total number of deaths has now reached 140,016.There are currently 23,894 active patients across the state, in which Pune tops with 7,210 patients, followed by Mumbai with 5,075 active patients and Thane with 3,295.The death toll has now reached 140,016, with Pune leading with 19,574 deaths, followed by Mumbai with 16,213 and Thane with 11,418.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtras-covid-toll-crosses-140-000-mark-101635094441852.html
24-10-2021||Patna||RJD chief mocks Cong state in-charge, draws criticism||The conflict between the RJD and the Congress hit a new low on Sunday when RJD chief Lalu Prasad mocked the grand old party’s Bihar in-charge Bhakta Charan Das and gave a rebuff to the Congress while “wondering if his party should have left the Kusheshwar Asthan seat for the national party so that it could lose even its deposit.” Prasad, who arrived in Patna in the evening after three-and-a-half years following his incarceration in 2017, heaped scorns on the Congress in New Delhi before he left for Bihar accompanied by wife Rabri Devi and eldest daughter Misa Bharti. On his arrival in Patna, Prasad, wearing a green cap and stole, was given a rousing welcome by the RJD workers and leaders with his sons Tej Pratap Yadav and Tejashwi Prasad Yadav along with state president Jagdanand Singh at the airport. Earlier, during his media interaction with reporters in New Delhi, Prasad sounded cryptic when asked about recently strained ties between the RJD and the Congress after his party announced the names of candidates for both Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan, scheduled to go to bypolls on October 30. “Kya hota hai Congress ka gathbandhan? (What is this thing about an alliance with the Congress),” he shot back. In the same vein, he justified his party’s decision of contesting both the seats and putting a candidate from Kushweshwar Asthan, the seat that led to the dispute between the parties as the Congress had staked claim to contest it as a constituent partner in grand alliance saying that the constituency has had a traditional stronghold on the party for long. “Should we have given one seat (to Congress) for it to lose? So that it could lose even its deposit?” Prasad said. However, what created a flutter and incensed the Congress leaders in Bihar was Prasad’s bid to mock the national party’s state in-charge, Das. When asked about Das’s bid to obliquely accuse the RJD of having stitched a secret understanding with the BJP and attributing it as a reason why the opposition party was no longer keen on having ties with the Congress, Lalu replied, “Does he (Das) know anything?” In the same vein, Lalu further passed “derogatory remarks” against Das. Bihar Congress in-charge Das had also said that the RJD-Congress ties have snapped and the Congress would contest 2024 parliamentary polls alone in Bihar. The RJD chief also said he was going to Bihar after a long time and will be campaigning for two seats where bypolls are scheduled. When asked about the growing differences between his two sons, Tej Pratap and Tejashwi, Prasad denied the reports and said, “There are no differences between the duo. Both are my sons,” he said. There were posters and banners put up across the city to welcome the RJD chief, who drove straight from the airport to 10 Circular Road Bungalow. Meanwhile, the Congress senior leaders, including MLC Premchand Mishra, have strongly objected to Prasad’s bid to mock the party’s state in-charge saying it does not behove of a veteran and tall leader like the RJD chief to use such derogatory words against a Congress senior leader. “We take strong exception to the objectionable words spoken against our party’s state in-charge by the RJD chief. What will happen if Congress leaders too start using foul language against the RJD leaders. The RJD chief’s words against Das show his frustration,” said Mishra. Another leader and chairman of the state media department, Rajesh Rathore, said that Prasad should clarify whether he is planning to side with the JD(U) or the BJP to make his son Tejashwi the chief minister by distancing from the Congress. The BJP’s state spokesperson Nikhil Anand said the RJD chief’s bid to use objectionable words against the Congress’s state in-charge reflected how the 74-year-old former railway minister was holding grudges against the national party. “Lalu perhaps has realised he has been pushed to political abyss due to a conspiracy of the Congress and its leaders and his troubles during fodder scam cases. It shows, if the RJD is provoked more, the party chief would not spare Congress top leadership, including Rahul Gandhi and party national president Sonia Gandhi,” Anand said. The former chief minister and HAM(S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi said Prasad’s objectionable statement against Congress’s state in-charge was an insult to Dalits and reflects how much respect the RJD chief has for scheduled castes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/rjdchief-mocks-cong-state-in-charge-draws-criticism-101635094261501.html
24-10-2021||Pune||Chaos at health department recruitment exam in Pune after question papers arrive late||PUNE For Santosh Patil, it was a day of frustration and anger, as he along with hundreds of other aspirants faced a delay at their state health department recruitment examination at the Abeda Inamdar College. The exam was delayed by 20 minutes and students had to wait outside the examination centre. “I had come to the centre at 9am and the examination was scheduled to start by 10am, but there was no proper management at the centre. The exam paper did not arrive in time. Many of us did not even have hall tickets and there was no proper seating arrangement,” said Patil. Like Patil, aspirants at various other examination centres in Pune had to face similar problems. Right from getting the examination papers late, to no seating arrangements, and even allegations of a wrong question paper, the issues were many. Another student Kishori Shambhe said, “The examination was a classic example of mismanagment and lack of coordination. Already this exam was postponed twice and when it was actually happening we had to face many difficulties. There was lack of coordination between the officials and students and there was no communication. Even seating arrangements were improper.”The government outsourced the conducting of this exam to a firm, Nyasa Communication Private Limited (NCPL). Previously the government had to cancel the scheduled exam last month due to a lack of preparation.The exam is held to fill 6,200 vacant posts in the state health department. The examination is scheduled for group ‘C’ posts and is to be conducted in two parts, on October 24 and 31. Students who have applied for multiple posts as per their eligibility, complained of being allotted different centres on the same day.BJP city president Jagdish Mulik along with other party workers protested outside the Abeda Inamdar College against this alleged mismanagement by the state government. “State government is responsible for this mismanagement and playing with the careers of thousands of aspirants who have applied for the jobs. It is necessary to take strict action against the company who conducted today’s exams,” said Mulik. Talking about the overall mismanagement in conducting the exams, state health minister Rajesh Tope said, “The recruitment exams held across the state was well planned, still there was some mismanagement where students got the question papers late. We instructed the centres to give additional time to those students and action will be taken those responsible for it. We will take care and try to resolve issues faced today for the October 31 examination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/chaos-at-health-department-recruitment-exam-in-pune-after-question-papers-arrive-late-101635093122052.html

24-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Fire Brigade sends a team to One Avighna Park to scrutinise firefighting strategy||Two days after the major fire at the posh 60-storeyed One Avighna Park at Currey Road, the Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) on Sunday sent a team of fire brigade officers to the spot to do a post-fire inspection, and scrutinise the firefighting strategy they used during the incident, to improve firefighting in case of such incidents in future. The Mumbai Fire Brigade will also prepare a report and submit it to municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal within two weeks, regarding the cause of the fire after inspecting the premises. A senior official of the Mumbai Fire Brigade said, “The site visit was part of the procedure to inspect the premises post the fire. We have also been collecting data to help us improve firefighting strategies for high-rise buildings. On Sunday, we retraced our firefighting strategy and scrutinised it. This building is going to be there for many more years too, and we wanted to understand what should be our best vantage point and strategy.” According to the officers, a short circuit is likely to be the cause and source of the fire in apartment number 1902, on the 19th floor of One Avighna Park. However, the fire brigade will conduct a probe to determine the cause of the fire. A security guard from the housing society identified as Arun Tiwari, 27, fell to his death from the 19 floors of the building. A video that was widely circulated on social media showed the guard clinging onto the parapet of the window before he lost his grip and fell onto a fire truck parked below. The Mumbai Fire Brigade on Friday had noted that the building’s firefighting system was functional, but not operational at the time of the fire and that the fire brigade had to manually turn it on to use water from the system to fight the fire. The owner of the flat 1902, in a video, had alleged that the firefighting system had no water, and had that not been the case, it would have been easier to contain the fire at the very beginning. However, Kailash Agarwal of Nish Developers who constructed Avighna Park denied the claims and said, “The high-rises fire safety is one of the best in the world. I had procured the system from Norway by spending around ₹10 crore. I have also been regularly conducting fire drills and submitting fire audit reports to the competent authorities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-fire-brigade-sends-a-team-to-one-avighna-park-to-scrutinise-firefighting-strategy-101635092282087.html

Aakash Poptani, 25, the fifth-floor resident who was in his bedroom had suffered major injuries in the incident. Poptani, a bank employee, was rushed to Central Hospital, but was declared dead there. Two other residents also suffered injuries in the incident. Amit Udasi, 34, one of the friends of the victim, said, “After the building received notice from the civic body, Akash along with his parents had shifted to another house in Ulhasnagar. But he used to visit Paras building during the weekend to move his belongings to the new house. On Saturday too, he had been there for the same work and died. The incident is very tragic as his parents are in a shock.” Paras building has 15 flats that house four to five families and four shops. After two incidents of slab collapse in May that had killed a total of 12 residents, UMC had served notices to 1,500 buildings in the city, asking them to carry out a structural audit. The incidents had highlighted the need for structural audits of all the unsafe buildings in the city built around 1995.“This building is one of the structures made of inferior quality sand – Ulwe sand – during the 1994-1998 period. We had served notice to the residents to conduct a structural audit. We will check if the audit was done and if necessary steps were taken. Right now, we have sealed the [Paras] building,” said Yuvraj Badhane, public relations officer, UMC. As per UMC, of the 179 buildings thart were listed by the civic body as ‘priority’ for structural audits, 117 have submitted their report. Following this, UMC has demolished 30 buildings and evacuated the occupants of 32 structures. “The process of structural audit of these building is underway through a panel set up for the same. This is being done on a regular basis,” said Raja Dayanidhi, commissioner, UMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/day-after-1-died-in-slab-collapse-umc-says-paras-bldg-was-asked-to-do-structural-audit-101635091681392.html
24-10-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to propose 15% rise in seats in municipal corporations based on projected population||With the Census 2021 set to be delayed due to the pandemic, the state government is proposing to increase the number of seats in municipal corporations by 15%, by amending the respective Acts in proportion to the projected rise in the population. Although there is no final decision on the rise in the seats in Mumbai, the proposal for the rise in all other municipal corporations and nagar panchayats is expected to be brought before the state cabinet soon. The urban development department (UDD) of the state government revises the number of seats in municipal corporations on the basis of the Census every 10 years. Accordingly, the municipal corporations carry out delimitation of wards. The revision in the number of wards in Mumbai is done by amending the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, 1888, while for other municipal corporations, it is done as per the formula given in the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, 1949. The state government has proposed to increase the number of seats by making amendment in the Acts. Maharashtra has 27 municipal corporations. The projected growth of population in the past 10 years in urban areas is expected to be more than 15% in the last decade. The overall population growth reported in 2011 was 15.99%, against 22.57% in 2001. It is expected to be more than 129 million currently, from 112 million in 2011. Mahesh Pathak, principal secretary, UDD refused to speak, saying the decision will have to be taken by the cabinet. “The revision is done every 10 years based on the census on population growth. Since the Census 2021 is delayed because of Covid-19 and most municipal corporations are going to polls in 2022, it is necessary to make changes to give fair representation to the population. We are proposing a 15% rise in the incumbent seats of municipal corporations. The proposal is for 26 municipal corporations, except Mumbai, as the decision over the BMC is yet to be taken. The final decision is expected to be taken by the cabinet,” said an official from Mantralaya. Although the number of seats in Mumbai has not increased in the past last 20 years, other municipal corporations saw a significant change in the number of seats. Thane has 131 seats against 116 from 20 years ago, while the number in Nagpur has increased to 151 from 136 during this period. The total seats in municipal corporations in 2000 were 2,064, which have risen to 2,736 now. Another official said the proposal is expected to come before the cabinet in the next few days. “Fifteen municipal corporations (including Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Kalyan Dombivli in MMR) are expected to go to polls by March 2022, while eight others will have the elections until 2022. The state election commission has already asked civic bodies for delimitation on the basis of the change in their borders,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-propose-15-rise-in-seats-in-municipal-corporations-based-on-projected-population-101635090241239.html
24-10-2021||Mumbai||KDMC initiates demolition of unsafe portions of Kalyan skywalk||The Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) has initiated the work to demolish some portions of the railway station skywalk in Kalyan (West), after the staircases of the structure were declared unsafe in an audit by the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) in May 2019. “The demolition of the stairs has begun as they are unsafe. We are taking all the precautionary measures during the work. Commuters have been asked to avoid the area where the work has been undertaken,” said KDMC city engineer Sapna Koli. The demolition of the stairs of the skywalk will also help with the ongoing Station Area Traffic Improvement Scheme (SATIS) project at Kalyan station under the Smart Cities Mission. “There is a requirement of removing some portions of the skywalk to build SATIS at the station. So we are undertaking that work as well. The station area will be decongested in the coming days with SATIS project,” an official of Smart Kalyan Dombivli Corporation Limited (SKDCL) said.Kalyan residents have claimed that the demolition is a waste of money. “Crores of rupees were spent on the skywalk, and within a few years, the authorities are demolishing it. Why can’t they maintain it? The money spent on the skywalk is a waste now,” said Manoj Kukreja, 39, a resident of Tilak Chowk, Kalyan (West), who takes the skywalk to connect to station. The skywalk was built in 2009 by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) to decongest the station road and help commuters walk out of the station. It was opened to commuters in 2011. A total of ₹60 crore was spent for the 1,675-metre-long and 4-7-metre-wide skywalk.

India’s domestic passenger volume in September rose to a robust 79.20% to 70.66 lakh – as compared to 39.43 lakh passengers in the same month of 2020 – aided by increased vaccination rates, easing some more travel restrictions and demand bolstered by the festive season. Moreover, the domestic air traffic reached its highest single-day level at 327, 923 on October 17 since the beginning of the pandemic in March last year. Experts said the increase in domestic passenger volumes coupled with privatisation of Air India, launch of a new ultra-low-cost airline and relaunch of Jet Airways in its 2.0 version next year translates into possibilities of more job opportunities in all categories of the aviation business – be it for pilots, cabin crew, engineers and ground handling, among other. The industry has suffered losses due to the two waves of the Covid-19 pandemic, which brought air travel to the ground. The Indian government banned domestic air travel for nearly two months in late March last year and suspended scheduled international air services to and from India as a response to other governments’ travel and visa restrictions. The aviation industry, as a result of losses incurred, resorted to cost-cutting measures with layoffs, huge salary cuts and a forced Leave Without-Pay (LWP) programme, among others. Private airport operators also issued pay cuts to their employees. After the second wave subsided around July and the government pushed for administering more vaccine doses across the country that subsequently pushed up vaccination rates, people gradually took to flying again leading to higher passenger numbers month on month. With the restoration of 100% capacity for domestic flights by the civil aviation ministry from October 18, experts believe that the move will allow airlines to serve a wider market and in turn, will encourage air travel further. More travel means more flights, more seats and more jobs going forward but the hiring pattern will be different than seen in the market before the pandemic, say industry experts. “Hiring is more or less limited to the new start-ups as of now because existing companies are still not fully operationalising their fleet,” said Kapil Kaul, chief executive officer at CAPA India, an aviation research and advisory firm. According to Kaul, the demand for hiring will take place only once current airlines expand their fleet as there is a significant surplus in most of the technical staffing categories as of now. “Overall, we will see hiring resuming in a more meaningful manner in 2023,” Kaul said. For the country’s largest airline by market share IndiGo, lifting capacity restrictions is a positive step. “We have started to selectively re-hire,” confirmed an IndiGo spokesperson, “amid the airline commencing operations to various domestic destinations that it was not flying to in the pre-pandemic days.” “Our current hiring efforts are broad-based and cover several functional roles. At locations that we have now commenced operations, we hire for airport operations, customer service and security functions,” the airline said. “We have also commenced re-hiring for our cargo business as it continues to grow,” said the spokesperson, adding the recruitment are also on for roles across corporate functions such as digital, information technology, finance, human resource and sales. According to the budget carrier, its Cadet Pilot Program, from where it draws fresh talent for the cockpit, continued even during the pandemic. “IndiGo firmly believes in developing its talent and we have very focused attention on internal upgrades to captains and upwards including to positions such as line training captains, designated examiners, etc,” the spokesperson said. GK Chaukhiyal, head of academics at the Amethi-based Rajiv Gandhi National Aviation University too said the industry has started hiring a workforce as it seems to be coming out of the woods. “As many as 19 of our 24 students who finished their studies in May have been picked up by top airlines and even tier-1 airports,” said Chukhiyal. “It has been observed that the stakeholders are currently preferring to hire freshers instead of the experienced, he said, adding that “pilots’ recruitments are slow but they are expected to pick up in the coming months.” “Easing out the airline Covid norms will have a positive impact on the hiring by the industry and we are expecting the sector - airline and aero engineering sector to pick up by fourth quarter (Q4),” said Gautam Vohra, vice president and business head, telecom & engineering staffing at TeamLease Digital, an employment portal that deals with entry-level and blue-collar jobs in all metropolitan cities. Vohra added that with investment and new private players coming into the airline space and new airports getting operational there will be demand for talent in the areas of IT infrastructure focussed on the aviation industry, ground staff engineering and networking. Expecting 20% increase in hiring in the March quarter, he said, is likely to be back to the pre-pandemic level by the next fiscal. “The industry will be looking at ramping up their engineer pool on the O & M front, IT infrastructure. As India plans to have 100 Airports by 2024 it will give a boost to more hiring in Tier 2 / 3 cities as well,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-turbulence-owing-to-covid-pandemic-domestic-air-travel-makes-a-gradual-comeback-101635089461466.html
24-10-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Ruling parties demands high-level probe into allegations of extortion by NCB||In the wake of the revelation by a key witness in the cruise drugs case, Prabhakar Sail, Maharashtra’s ruling parties have demanded a high-level probe by Maharashtra police. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and state minister Nawab Malik said he will meet chief minister Uddhav Thackeray over the demand, while Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut has demanded suo motu cognisance by the Maharashtra police. Malik, who has been revealing lapses and violations in the probe by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), said this needs to be investigated by a special investigation team (SIT). “What we have been saying from day one has been proven true after the sensational revelation by the witness in the case. Sail has said that the NCB officials demanded money from Shah Rukh Khan and Rs8 crore of that was meant for NCB’s zonal director Sameer Wankhede. The NCB sleuths were busy in extortion by threatening Bollywood via raids. This needs to be investigated by Maharashtra police, so as to verify the claims made by Sail. Checking call records, locations of the vehicles used to carry money, mobile locations will bring the truth to the fore,” he said.Malik said he was meeting the CM personally on Monday to demand an SIT. “The extortion racket was being run by NCB officers. It can be proved by probing the information given by the witness. I will request the CM for a probe by state police,” he said.Malik had earlier raised questions over the handling of the drug case accused, Aryan Khan, by one KC Gosavi, who is facing criminal cases, and a BJP officer bearer, Manish Bhanushali. He had also questioned why Wankhede was in Maldives last year when Bollywood actors were holidaying during the lockdown. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut has demanded an inquiry into the entire episode by taking suo motu cognisance. “Witness in #AryanKhan case made to sign on blank paper by NCB is shocking. Also thr r reports that thr ws demnd of huge money. CM Uddhav Thackeray said that ths cases r made2 defame Mah’shtra. Ths seems 2b comng tru @Dwalsepatil Police shd tk suo moto cognizance @ CMOMaharashtra(sic),” he tweeted. Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole has demanded a high-level probe. “The revelations by Sail are serious in nature as he has claimed about the extortion of Rs25 crore. The NCB action appears to be a conspiracy against Maharashtra and the state government. Sail has also expressed threat to his life. The state government needs to conduct a high-level probe in the allegations,” he said. Leader of opposition in legislative council Pravin Darekar said that the ruling parties are targeting central agencies by levelling false allegations. “Nawab Malik and others have been levelling false allegations against NCB and its zonal director Sameer Wankhede. The ruling parties have been targeting central agencies and the central government for the political reasons and the new allegations related to the permissions to vehicles is one of such attempts. The allegations are baseless and false,” he said. Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said if there is any substance in the clip of Sail there should be a probe conducted into it. “We never stood by Wankhede and there was no need to be as he is not our worker or office-bearer. We never criticised him or NCB. But it needs to check who is supporting Shah Rukh Khan. Ruling party leaders have been targeting central agencies as if they have taken up the case of certain people. It is surprising the way Malik has been taking interest in the entire case,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtraruling-parties-demands-high-level-probe-into-allegations-of-extortion-by-ncb-101635088801329.html
24-10-2021||Mumbai||NCP chief Sharad Pawar made the president of Mumbai Marathi Granth Sangrahalaya||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar was on Sunday elected as the president of Mumbai Marathi Granth Sangrahalaya (MMGS), a 123-year-old library which is one of the largest in Mumbai, by an overwhelming majority. He defeated his opponent, Dhananjay Shinde, the general secretary of Maharashtra Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) by 27 votes. Pawar polled 29 votes compared to 2 votes polled by Shinde. Of the 34 members eligible to vote, 31 turned up for voting. Along with Pawar, his entire panel of seven vice-presidents also won the polls. Shinde called the election fraudulent and plans to move court. “They manipulated the granthalaya’s constitution by allowing just 34 people to vote. They should have allowed all 6,000 members to exercise their franchise. We will not sit quiet and approach the Court next week seeking to declare this election null and void,” said Shinde. Former vice-chancellor of Mumbai University Dr Bhalchandra Mungekar, who was elected as the vice-president, said everything was done according to the constitution. “Our opponents had approached the charity commissioner to stay this election, but their plea was dismissed,” said Mungekar. He said the panel will strive to increase the membership of the library. MMGS has more than 645,569 books in Marathi. The Pawar-led panel has been managing the functioning of the MMGS since 1982. It is the first time in the past four decades that the elections are being held. Earlier, the office-bearers were selected based on mutual consent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncp-chief-sharad-pawar-made-the-president-of-mumbai-marathi-granth-sangrahalaya-101635088501072.html
24-10-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC rejects petition against Mumbai BJP legislator’s election||The Bombay high court (HC) recently rejected an election petition filed by a Pune resident against the election of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Mangal Prabhat Lodha from Malabar Hill constituency on the grounds that the petitioner is neither a candidate nor a voter who was affected by the election. The court further held that though the Representation of Peoples (RP) Act permits any person to approach a court against false information provided by a candidate, the guidelines provide other remedies, and as the petitioner does not conform to the same, the petition is not maintainable. The single judge bench of justice BP Colabawalla, while hearing an interim application filed against Lodha in an election petition, was informed by advocates Amogh Singh and Jeet Gandhi that the plea was not maintainable on two main grounds. The first being that as per RP Act, the petitioner was neither a candidate nor was he a voter of the constituency from which Lodha was elected in the 2019 elections. Secondly, the advocates argued that as per the guidelines issued by the Election Commission (EC) in 2014, the petitioner could not raise the objections of false information being provided by Lodha in his affidavit or of suppressing information as the petitioner did not conform to the definition of aggrieved person as he was neither a voter nor a candidate. The election petition was filed by Manish Jadhav, who was represented by advocates Khushboo Oswal and HS Shinde. The petition had challenged the 2019 election of Lodha on the grounds that the declaration given by him in form 26 was false and he had concealed information which according to RP Act amounted to corrupt practice. The advocates also stated that as per EC guidelines of April 26, 2014, it was “open to any aggrieved person to move a petition before the appropriate court of competent jurisdiction for action under section 125A of RP Act.” In light of this submission, Oswal submitted that though Jadhav was a resident of Pune, his petition was valid. After hearing the submissions, the bench referred to that Supreme Court judgment in the Tej Bahadur Singh vs Narendra Modi case, wherein the Apex court had clearly stated that a person who is neither a voter nor a candidate of a constituency cannot file an election petition, and hence as Jadhav did not have a locus, his petition was not maintainable. With regards to the guidelines of EC and its applicability to Jadhav, the bench stated, “These guidelines, therefore, have to be read in the context of section 125A, which provides an independent remedy against the candidate who has breached the provisions of the section. This still, would not give the original petitioner [Jadhav] the locus to file an election petition under Section 81 of the said Act if the original respondent [Lodha] does not comply with the conditions as set out in the said section.” The court then allowed the interim application and dismissed the election petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-rejects-petition-against-mumbai-bjp-legislator-s-election-101635087661115.html
24-10-2021||Bhopal||Congress MLA Sachin Birla joins BJP ahead of by polls||Congress MLA, Sachin Birla, on Sunday joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of by polls on three assembly and a Lok Sabha seat in Madhya Pradesh.Law-maker from Barwaha, Sachin Birla, 39, joined BJP in the presence of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan at a political programme in Bediya in Khandwa. Barwaha assembly constituency comes under Khandwa Lok Sabha seat where by-poll will be conducted on October 30, necessitated after the death of BJP senior leader Nand Kumar Singh Chauhan. This year, BJP gave a ticket to Gyaneshvar Patil, an OBC candidate. According to a Congress leader, Birla was in touch with BJP since last year but made this announcement now. Birla belongs to the Gurjar community and could help the BJP in getting the votes of the community. He switched his side before Congress leader Sachin Pilot’s rally on October 27 in Khandwa to woo Gurjar voters. In 2018 assembly election, Birla won by 30,500 votes due to the support of Gurjar voters and other backward communities. Khandwa Lok Sabha constituency has more than 25,000 Gurjar voters.After switching the party, Birla said, “I was feeling suffocated in the party so I left it and joined BJP. I was in Congress due to ideology but when the party lost it, I didn’t find any reason to stay in the party.”BJP spokesperson Ashish Agrawal said, “Congress lost its existence and nobody wants to stay in a part of sycophants.”However, Congress called it the murder of democracy. MP Congress Committee president Kamal Nath said, “BJP realised that they are going to lose this election so they have started bargaining. They are killing democracy with money but voters know everything and will teach a lesson to BJP in this by-poll.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/congress-mla-sachin-birla-joins-bjp-ahead-of-by-polls-101635087602990.html

24-10-2021||Pune||Sassoon gets paediatric and neonatal ICU dedicated to Covid||PUNE: On Friday, October 22, a first-of-its-kind paediatric and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) dedicated to Covid-19 was inaugurated by Sassoon General Hospital (SGH) and BJ Medical College; located in its newly-built, 11-storeyed building inside the hospital premises. The new ward has been built as preparation for the much anticipated third wave wherein various studies and medical opinions have speculated that children (paediatric population) will be the most affected. Built completely through corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds and donations, this will be the first-of-its-kind centre in a government hospital. Dr Aarti Kinikar, head of the department at SGH’s paediatric ward said, “As of now, we have a general paediatric ward that was also used to isolate Covid-19 infected infants and older children. However with this new ward in place, we can have a dedicated Covid-19 ward for paediatric patients with the best of facilities. The new ward has about 12 beds and five radiant warmers for infants who are less than a month old. We also have 10 ventilators, 10 multipara monitors and syringe pumps.”Dr Kinikar said that even post Covid-19, the ward will be useful in treating infants who require specialised care and highly valued medicines that are very expensive in private set-ups. “The NICU is located on the seventh floor and the existing paediatric ward will be moved completely to the floor eventually,” she said.The funds were generated and ventilators, multipara monitors, radiant warmers, syringe pumps and other essential equipment and consumables worth Rs25 million procured through donations made by Credit Suisse through the Give India Foundation and Concern India Foundation. SGH dean Dr Vinayak Kale was present at the inaugural ceremony and said that the equipment will be used in the best interests of patients, especially poor and needy patients admitted to the paediatric and neonatal intensive care unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sassoon-gets-paediatric-and-neonatal-icu-dedicated-to-covid-101635087361079.html

The police are also investigating his mother over suspicion of the child’s murder. The child’s body was found in the Mula-Mutha river in a plastic bag with a pavement block also in it, according to police. “She had separated from her husband and their teenage son three years ago. Her parents had died so she was working on a construction site.

24-10-2021||Pune||Uruli Kanchan shoot-out: Two arrested from Indapur||PUNE Two persons have been arrested in the case of a gun-fight at an eatery in Uruli Kanchan near Pune, which led to the murder of two people, officials said on Sunday. The two arrested have been identified as Pawan Gorakh Misal (29) and Mahadev Balasaheb Adlinge (26), both residents of Dattawadi, Uruli Kanchan. Bullets were fired at around 9pm on October 22 when a man named Santosh Jagtap arrived at an eatery called Hotel Sonai, along with two men identified as his bodyguards. “We have arrested these people right now. We cannot say much by way of why the murder was committed. The area entered our jurisdiction only four months ago. These men have a history in the Pune rural police jurisdiction,” said Amitabh Gupta, commissioner of police, Pune. Misal and Adlinge were arrested from Indapur, according to additional commissioner of police (Crime) Ramnath Pokhale, and are suspected to be the two who arrived at Hotel Sonai along with a man named Swargat Bapu Khaire, who was also killed in the firing. Khaire, Misal, and Adlinge entered the eatery after Jagtap arrived there “He had a clue that something was about to go down. He arrived there and asked for the shutters to be pulled down and had armed security, which is not allowed. Licensed arms are allowed for self-defence only, not for the defence of another person,” said commissioner Gupta. The local police suspect that the rivalry began over sand mining which led to the murder of two siblings, Ramesh and Ganesh Sonwane in 2011. Jagtap was found to be the one to have killed the two brothers and is also accused in another murder in 2018 of Pintya Shelar, according to inspector Ganesh Mane of Unit 6 of the crime branch which made the two arrests. Additional CP Pokale has served as Additional SP in Pune rural police when the gang rivalry was ragingOne of two arrested, Misal, was a friend of the Sonawane brothers, according to the police. The incident has raised questions of gun control in the this area, now under the Pune police commissionerate. Moreover, if the sand mining background is to be believed, the arrests might prove to be the key to multiple cases of violence in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/uruli-kanchan-shoot-out-two-arrested-from-indapur-101635086161164.html
24-10-2021||Mumbai||‘Demand drop, verdicts, politics led to fall of ‘community-specific’ housing projects’||Mumbai Ashok Khamkar, 75, a businessman from Lalbaug, was denied a flat in a housing society 20 years ago, as it was reserved only for Jains, while Pankaj Kapoor of Liases Foras firm was not allowed to buy an apartment in Mazagaon a decade ago as the building was meant only for Dawoodi Bohra Muslims. Years later, discrimination on the basis of religion and language has receded substantially, thanks to the drop in demand for such exclusive societies, court rulings as well as the voice raised against the concept. Khamkar who owns a spice shop at Lalbaug – a predominantly Maharashtrian area – gets angry every time he recollects the incident. When Khamkar went to book an apartment in a newly announced project, the builder curtly refused, saying, “This project is only for Jains.” Though he had directly complained to prominent Shiv Sena leaders, he could not get any respite as the builder just doubled his sale price, thus forcing Khamkar to abandon his mission.In the past three decades, as Mumbai witnessed surge in construction activities, many builders started selling apartments only to restricted communities as this would fetch a huge premium for their projects. The main beneficiaries were the Jains and the Gujarati and Dawoodi Bohra communities. Other communities were strictly excluded in such projects.The community-specific construction projects mushroomed at Parel, Lalbaug, Ghatkopar, Goregaon, Mulund, Vile Parle, Malabar Hill, Byculla, Mazagaon and Borivli. In case of the Jain community, the builder would construct a ‘Derasar’ or a Jain temple and charge premium for such projects. In Mazagaon and Byculla, the influential members of the Dawoodi Bohra community would negotiate with the builders and ensure that all flats are bought by their members, thus saving precious time as well as ensuring faster money for the builder.Decades later, as massive slowdown hit the real estate sector and resulted in fewer sales, builders are no longer building exclusive enclaves for any particular section of the society.Liases Foras, a real estate research firm, said the current decision is influenced by the monetary crises faced by the realty sector. “Currently the whole focus of the builders is to sell their apartments. They are not in a position to deny the flats to anyone as they are facing paucity of funds to finance their projects. In the current market, builders can no longer take the risk of launching any project for a particular community as they are not assured that it will be fully booked by the community members,” said Pankaj Kapoor, managing director, Liases Foras.Kapoor has a point. Recently, a well-known, listed real estate company had launched a project at Lalbaug for the Jain community, but then opened doors to all communities as he failed to elicit adequate response from the Jains.Sukhraj Nahar, founder, Nahar Group, one of the reputed construction firms which had constructed Sarvodaya Nagar at Mulund exclusively for the Jain community, says “We have moved towards having mixed population in our projects.”Similar is the stance of Rajesh Vardhan who runs a 50-year old company, Vardhman Builders. He said the group has always believed in constructing inclusive houses. “Our whole focus is on sales, and religion is a secondary factor for us. We have lots of buyers even from the Muslim community,” said Vardhan.Kailash Agarwal, chairman of Avighna Group, which is responsible for executing the first cluster revamp project in Mumbai— One Avighna Park at Lalbaug — said that the stands taken by the Shiv Sena and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) are also responsible for the exclusive housing projects being junked. “Both MNS and Shiv Sena are competing with each other by espousing the Marathi cause and will not allow any discrimination towards Maharashtrians. In such a scenario, builders cannot afford to take such risks [making exclusive projects for religious communities] in their projects,” said Agarwal.In addition, a series of court verdicts against such discrimination has also made things difficult for the builders to indulge in such “adventurism”.Advocate Vinod Sampat said, “In recent times, due to the advent of social media, these practices are being looked down upon and even the courts have come down heavily on such unconstitutional steps.”The Marathi Ekikaram Samiti (MES), which works for the welfare of Maharashtrians, had recently filed a first information report (FIR), the first of its kind against a seller who had refused to sell his flat to a Maharashtrian buyer. A developer named Rahul Dedhia had posted an advertisement on Facebook stating that he wanted to sell his 1-BHK (bedroom-hall-kitchen) flat in a building that only allows Gujarati, Jain and Marwadi community members. MES head, Govardhan Deshmukh, who wanted to buy the flat, filed a complaint at Mira Road police over the prejudice, following which an FIR was registered against Dedhia under IPC section 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony). Deshmukh said he will now target builders who deny flats to members of any community. “We are asking people to file FIRs against builders who deny houses to members of other communities, be it Maharashtrians or Muslims,” said Deshmukh. MES has also written a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, asking him to crack down on such errant builders.The Students Islamic Organisation of India (SIOI), which takes up issues related to the Muslim community, points that more than 60% of builders in Mumbai deny flats to Muslims. “In many cases, Muslims prefer ghettos where they are in a majority as it ensures security to them. However, we see that the real estate suffers from Islamophobia, and Muslims are denied flats in a majority of the projects,” said Fawaz Shaheen, general secretary, SIOI. The organisation wants the state government to enact a law under which such discriminatory practices are abolished. Real estate expert Ajay Chaturvedi said such enclaves are still in existence in micro-markets. “Mid- and small-sized builders are still catering to buildings that are meant exclusively for some communities. If buyers from other communities come, the marketing team is instructed to tell that the project is fully booked or quote very exorbitant rates so that they don’t buy the flat. Many firms don’t refuse openly fearing backlash, but adopt such tactics,” said Chaturvedi.Rishi Rupawat, who lives in an exclusive Jain colony at Lalbaug, supports such enclaves. “Our colony has Jain community hailing from four major districts of Rajasthan, and this gives us a chance to bond. We can even practice our religion very freely,” said Rupawat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/demand-drop-verdicts-politics-led-to-fall-of-community-specific-housing-projects-101635083520808.html
24-10-2021||Lucknow||Women account for 45% of Covid jabs given in Lucknow||Women are lagging behind in Covid vaccination in Lucknow and accounting for only 45% of the total Covid jabs given in the state capital, according to data from the health department.Of the total 44.17 lakh (44,17,771) doses administered till 5pm on Sunday, women got 19.89 lakh or 19,89,368 (45% of the total) Covid jabs while over 24 lakh or 24,26,490 (54.92%) doses were administered to men.Experts say hesitancy and myths are holding some women back from taking the Covid vaccine doses in Lucknow.“There are myths related to getting the vaccine for a woman planning to conceive, during pregnancy or a lactating woman, though clarity on these aspects was issued long back. It seems women are still not fully aware. Hence, it is the gynaecologists’ responsibility to tell them about the vaccination,” said Dr Anoop Agrawal, president of Lucknow Nursing Home Owners’ Association.Doctors said accessibility is not a problem now as a large number of centres are administering the vaccine doses in the state capital.“On average, over 140 government and over 20 private vaccination centres run daily in the district. Each locality now has a Covid vaccination centre with several of them having more than one vaccination booth,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general, Association of International Doctors.“Many vaccination centres have women special booths while all the vaccinators are women ANMs (Auxiliary nurse midwife),” said Dr PK Gupta, former president of Indian Medical Association, Lucknow. Health officials say attempts are being made to increase the vaccination coverage among women.“We are soon going to conduct a meeting of religious leaders to give out a message on vaccination, particularly for women, as they can get vaccine dose during pregnancy or even if they are planning to conceive,” said Dr MK Singh, in charge of vaccination in Lucknow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/women-account-for-45-of-covid-jabs-given-in-lucknow-101635082740814.html

24-10-2021||Mumbai||JNPT scraps mangrove park proposal in Uran, to hand over land to forest department||The Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT), the largest port container terminal in the country, has scrapped plans to develop a 200-hectare mangrove park on its property at Uran’s Belpada wetland, reveals the responses to a Right-to-Information (RTI) request by Navi Mumbai-based NGO Nat Connect Foundation. The mangroves will now have to be handed over to the forest department for safekeeping as per orders of the Bombay high court (HC), officials said. The development of a mangrove park at Uran was first suggested by the State Wetland and Mangrove Grievance Redressal Committee, appointed by the Bombay HC, in January 2019. After consultations with the state forest department’s mangrove cell, JNPT roped in the Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) to conduct a feasibility study for the project, which was planned to be developed in two phases. The first phase of the facility (similar to one being developed in Gorai by the forest department) was to be ready by July this year at a cost of ₹5 crore under JNPT’s Port Planning & Development (PPD) department’s ‘Green Port’ initiative. It was proposed to protect two dense mangrove patches in the area, and would also have visiting galleries, mangrove walkthroughs (boardwalks), an education and nature interpretation centre and a nursery displaying the biodiversity of local mangrove species. JNPT was to foot the annual cost of maintaining the park. A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was also drafted and sent for JNPT’s approval in January 2021 following site visits by the FDCM and the preparation of a feasibility report. In March 2021, however, JNPT wrote back to the FDCM saying it “has decided not to enter into MoU for development of Eco Park under the green port initiative.” Citing a contempt notice (dated December 2020) by NGO Vanashakti (which has filed a PIL in Bombay HC seeking compliance with its September 2018 judgement on mangrove transfer to the government), JNPT wrote to the mangrove cell for clarity earlier this year and were instructed in February to initiate the handover in accordance with the court’s mandate. A senior official with JNPT’s PPD department, seeking anonymity, said, “The park would have been a valuable educational tool for the conservation of mangroves in our area, but seeing as the ownership of the land needs to be transferred to the state government, the development of this facility should also be taken up by them.” JNPT, which is legally mandated to transfer 913 hectares (ha) of mangroves on its property in Nhava Sheva to the Maharashtra forest department for safekeeping as per an order of the HC, earlier this year, claimed that it does not have any information as to the current extent of mangrove cover on its land. “We have enlisted the Maharashtra Remote Sensing Application Centre (MRSAC) for demarcation of mangrove area in JNPT as of date. Once we have the assessment we will inform the forest department and start the next steps,” said the official quoted above. Virendra Tiwari, assistant principal chief conservator of forests, mangrove cell, said, “We are hoping for a smooth and quick transfer of mangroves under JNPT to us. The land will be first notified as a reserve forest under section 4 of the Indian Forest Act (1927). After that, the process of settling any outstanding claims over the area will be settled so that it can get final notification under section 20 of the Act.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/jnpt-scraps-mangrove-park-proposal-in-uran-to-hand-over-land-to-forest-department-101635076860434.html
24-10-2021||Lucknow||‘Twitter Vadra’: UP deputy CM Maurya’s latest jibe at Priyanka Gandhi||Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya on Sunday called Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra “Twitter Vadra” and said the grand old party’s state in-charge was only “interested” in a photo-op.Speaking to reporters, Maurya said, "I think you (media) are seeing her more in the role of an opposition. I call Priyanka Gandhi Vadraji as Twitter Vadra. I don't think that barring those interested in getting their photographs clicked, there is anyone left in the Congress.”The deputy chief minister further said that the Congress was currently ahead of the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in matters of making good use of photo sessions, but all three parties had failed to create a place in the hearts of the people."Yes, they have an expertise in getting their photographs clicked, be it Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Rahul Gandhi or any other leader of the Congress. In the race of getting their photos clicked, they are ahead of the SP and BSP. But, all these three parties have failed to make any place in the public's heart," the BJP leader said.Maurya’s comments on photo-ops came days after Vadra hit out at the UP government for ordering an investigation against some police personnel who were seen clicking a selfie with her. She has been on a major offensive against the ruling party ever since the death of protesting farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri earlier this month. It has been alleged the farmers, who were agitating against Maurya’s visit to the district, were run over by some cars one of which was being driven by Union minister Ajay Kumar Mishra’s son Ashish.Maurya also dismissed Gandhi’s announcement of the Congress reserving 40% electoral tickets for women candidates in the upcoming 2022 Assembly election in the state. He said retaining seven seats the Congress had won in the 2017 elections would be considered an achievement in itself.He said the state of the SP and BSP were also and as people have not forgotten the tenures that were dominated by “corruption, crime, encouragement to mafia, casteism and appeasement".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/twitter-vadra-up-deputy-cm-maurya-s-latest-jibe-at-priyanka-gandhi-101635075377519.html
24-10-2021||Chandigarh||Stay young at heart and in mind to live to the fullest||My elderly friend was blushing when I gifted a pretty, long dress. It had been years since she had worn one, and her heart skipped a beat on seeing her secret desire unfold. Fumbling for words, she said she loved it, then modestly brushed it aside, saying that she was too old to wear it. We grown-ups have these little desires that we keep stashing away in an obscure corner of the heart, and just won’t let the child in us come out for fear of disapproval from others. We too love to dance in the rain, sing to our heart’s content, or be in the basketball court, no matter how clumsy we were at it. There’s nothing wrong in the yearnings except the stamp of: It does not look good at this age. It often becomes difficult for a fit and smart granny to pick up a cycle and rally around the neighbourhood or to enjoy a softy at a tuck shop simply because it doesn’t suit her image. Having entered middle age, I was brought to my own little guileless cravings that I had subconsciously started relegating to the past. I always wanted to age like the elderly couples dancing in the videos that popped on social media, or be agile like our own Milkha Singh in his golden years. Implementing those young dreams was a tough task because our minds were growing old faster than our bodies. Societal norms were taking over and fine-tuning age-appropriate behaviour as we were supposed to be mature and responsible. I remember having a yen for lollipops. I stopped having them when I grew up, thinking they did not hold me in a good light. When my father-in-law learnt of this little liking, he started bringing lollipops as take-homes for the whole family on every birthday. My joy knew no bounds, and I was able to enjoy my treat. Letting go once in a while and rejuvenating oneself, did add that sparkle to life. Some of my friends would wait to go on a vacation, where they would do whatever, they set their heart on. Others would look for a good excuse to slip into their idea of fun. One of my colleagues had started wearing sober colours in regular life, which were not much to her taste. She was eagerly waiting for her 25th wedding anniversary to don the brightest of colours, which she had a fancy for. If only we could break free from the shackles of ageing and stop feeling apologetic about it, our happiness quotient would skyrocket. We would do a great service to ourselves if we create an opportunity rather than wait for one to fill our days doing what we like. It would have all of us talking about our present fun instead of wistfully remembering our heydays. I plan to break the glass ceiling in my neighbourhood by dragging my lovely neighbours out of their homes when it rains the next time round. alkagaurkashyap@gmail.com The writer is a Chandigarh-based advocate||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/stay-young-at-heart-and-in-mind-to-live-to-the-fullest-101635075120284.html
24-10-2021||Pune||Your Space: Dedicated civilian airport in Pune need of the hour||PUNE The disruption of flights at Pune’s Lohegaon airport, owned by the Indian Air Force (IAF), to carry out runway resurfacing work has left flyers in the dark and at the receiving end. Many are still awaiting ticket refunds of cancelled flights. While plans for a new airport is yet to take off on the ground, what are the steps needed to ensure that the metropolitan city gets a dedicated civilian airport? Readers share their views...Dedicated civilian airport a mustIt is prudent to have a civil airport at Pune- both for operational as well as for security reasons. Civilians suffer when there is major maintenance work, military exercises and VIP movement. During such times, medical emergencies and urgent travellers suffer. The nearest airports are over 100 kilometres away. Detour costs both time and money. Defence airport left open to civilians is a big security risk. Most travellers don’t adhere to basic security guidelines, click pictures which is not in the best national interest. Considering global terrorism threats this can be avoided with a dedicated civilian airport.Mehzabin SaiyedSupport domestic air connectivityPune definitely needs a civilian airport and the only way to do that is to shift the airforce station to a new location. Shifting the civilian airport to far off places like Purandar is not going to help the cause. So what we need is lateral thinking and the only viable solution is to shift the airforce base to Purandar. What we need in Pune is an airport that gives excellent domestic connectivity and a shuttle connection to Mumbai international airport. The shuttle - a small aircraft carrying 20-40 pax has to be as frequent as every 30-40 minutes and should be subsidised by the Mumbai international airport for passengers holding a ticket to a connecting flight. This shuttle will be a feeder shuttle for all international departures from Mumbai international airport and thus will give a boost to the international departures business. If this is done, I believe the Pune airport problem can be solved.Amit AbhyankarFliers suffer due to airport closureThe airport renovation and expansion has been for so long been a demand of frequent flyer Puneites. The amenities and services, space everything needs to be expanded. Pune needs a bigger and dedicated civilian airport. Currently, due to the airport closure employees are taking flights from Mumbai instead of Pune and we have to bear the extra time and effort to travel to Mumbai.Aroh WelankarDedicated airport with better connectivity is the need of the hourA new airport will take more than a decade to become operational. The city will grow multifold in the coming decade like IT, automobiles and now EV. We need a dedicated airport with better connectivity. As the government has more flights and airports under Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik (UDAN) scheme, Pune needs the same. Many aspirational cities would want to connect with Pune airport. In the city, access roads connecting towards the airport need to be planned like better roads, artwork, beautification including..footpath and bicycle tracks. Multimodal transport connects like Metro, bus and local transport. Mumbai airport connects through a chopper or direct flight to establish a connection with international flights. These points need to be thought through by officials.Manoj PochatDevelopment and growth of the city should not be impactedPune is one of the fastest developing cities, and needs infrastructure planning on the same gear, to ensure the momentum of growth is not impacted. As Pune’s Lohegaon airport is owned by the Indian Air Force (IAF) there are strict rules that fliers have to follow. It is high time we now get a world-class civilian airport, one that is welcoming to the tourists. Not one where even if you wanna take a selfie, you are cautioned.Umang ChirimarMove air station to an isolated areaIn my opinion, the air force station has to be taken away from the highly densely populated area of Lohegaon. When it was built decades ago, this was in the outer fringes of the city then - which is how air defence installations should be. Instead of moving the civil air station to a new location, the air station should be moved to an isolated area. The air force station is a family station and comes packed with all facilities to act as a self-contained ecosystem. Whereas the civil population and the support staff will have to commute daily this huge distance to the proposed new airport creating a huge daily fuel bill.If you factor in the risk of coming in the range of any enemy airstrike in the event of a war, the Lohegaon base would be a prized target for enemy forces. Airstrike in such a densely populated city brings with it the huge human cost possibility in the event of a war.Shutting airstrip altogether or for a certain time period happens everywhere for recarpeting. Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport (CSIA) had done this exercise a few years back. This cannot be a reason to argue in favour of or against the prudence of having a combined civil-air force station.Thomas Samuel||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/your-space-dedicated-civilian-airport-in-pune-need-of-the-hour-101635072180208.html
24-10-2021||Pune||Curtain Call: Common sense of theatre etiquette must never be one-show wonder||Now that theatres have re-opened, no one could be happier than us. Yes, there will be challenges ahead and I have written about it at length. But, it is a time to celebrate! And what bigger celebration can there be than performing for a ‘live’ audience?At ‘Natak Company’, our theatre group, our social media manager – Mugdha Hasamnis – came up with a campaign in Marathi – “A reminder of how to watch plays”. It was a sarcastic take on how the audience might have forgotten theatre etiquette because of the long break. We shared it and saw it getting shared till it reached us again on social media. We laughed about it and felt nice that it resonated with people. It got me thinking. This wasn’t the first time we had made an appeal like that. God knows I have written about theatre etiquette more than once. And there is an announcement before every show! Every show! A humble appeal to ask our patrons to turn off their cell phones. In case they are supposed to receive an urgent call, they can most certainly receive it outside the auditorium in the “cry room”. The cry room is also available for a reason – for crying babies. We understand that couples may need to come and watch a play and they may not have a space to keep their small children. Once the children get cranky, which is again understandable since they are in a huge dark room with a few people on a wooden block talking loudly a few feet away and many other people around them laughing or clapping (or snoring!).I don’t even know why these things should be termed as “etiquettes”. The word does carry a certain weight to it. Like some action that needs some extra effort. In fact, I prefer the term “common sense!”. I remember sitting in the audience for a play that I had directed. There was a couple with two small children, nearly seven-eight years old. I admit that not many people had come to watch the play that day. So the kids had ample space to run around. And they did. And they were talking amongst themselves while doing that.Since I had directed the play, I knew each and every moment of it, but was still finding it hard to concentrate while watching it. My respect for my actors increased multiple times where they continued performing in this commotion. I went to the parents of the kids and politely asked them to keep them quiet. Even they were kind enough to take action, but while doing it, the father told me that it was the first time they he and his family had come to watch a play and weren’t aware of the rules. I didn’t understand why should there be a specific rule for this. Isn’t it understood, that there are actual people performing and there are others in the theatre watching; a paying audience, much like themselves. Does that mean that they will be fine if someone else creates a commotion when they have gone to watch something? I didn’t take the matter further because that would have disturbed my actors even more.I remembered something that a friend of mine told me about a Korean play he had watched at an international theatre festival in Japan. They had politely mentioned upfront that if a phone rings during the performance, they will stop it. Just a few seconds into the performance, someone’s phone rang and they stopped performing and exited the stage. Let me clarify, I am not in favour of such hard measures. Why should a majority of audience members bear the brunt for the insensitivity of a few? Though I understand why the Korean group must have had such a strict policy. It is plain disrespectful.I remember, when I was in college we used to have one day of rehearsal where our friends would create a disturbance while we were performing. It was to test our concentration in case our competitors decide to hoot-out a play.The situation isn’t that bad generally, but whenever I direct a play, we have a session with the actors where we discuss what to do in case there is a disturbance which cannot be ignored. I usually prefer that the actors stop performing till the disturbance is over and stay still. Once it has passed, they can resume from their last dialogue. The least an audience member can do is to not disturb the world created by the theatre group. Is that etiquette?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/curtain-call-common-sense-of-theatre-etiquette-must-never-be-one-show-wonder-101635071940280.html

The state government abided by the direction and demolished a slum colony in Khori Gaon and sent show-cause notices to several owners of commercial structures including farmhouses, banquet halls, etc. Many had claimed that their properties fell outside of the defined 'forest land'. However, that state's forest department had dismissed all objections stating that these lands were notified under the PLPA, 1900 and were to be treated as 'forest land.'Khattar, opposing the top court's directive this time, said that Forest Act and land notified under PLPA are different adding that 40 per of the area of Haryana comes under PLPA."Area notified under Forest Act and land notified under PLPA (Punjab Land Preservation Act) are different. Due to some mistakes both land were treated as one. 40 per cent of area of Haryana comes under PLPA," said the chief minister.Khattar also said, "PLPA was for purpose of conserving and restoring erosion of soil, and was applicable for only a limited period.

24-10-2021||Chandigarh||This bypoll, HP politicians remain mum on Pong Dam oustees’ persisting troubles||Breaking from a five-decade tradition of offering hollow promises and quiet sympathy, politicians campaigning for the Fatehpur bypoll have remained uncharacteristically mum on the hot-button issue of providing rehabilitation and compensation to those ousted from the Pong Dam area in Kangra after a hydroelectric project was setup on their land. Experts say with unemployment and inflation a major poll plank during the polls, the persisting issue of the oustees has been swept under the carpet in the face other pressing issues. Admitting that their was little talk on the long-pending issue, Congress legislator and Fatehpur bypoll in-charge Rajinder Singh Rana said, “Rehabilitation of the displaced people comes up in every session of the state assembly. However, this time the focus is on other pressing issues such as inflation and unemployment. There is anger among the people against the anti-people policies of the state and Centre.” Subhash Mehra, an oustee and senior journalist with a national Hindi daily, agrees. “It is a matter of survival. People understand that they can continue the fight only if they survive. Most locals are poor farmers and are reeling under soaring prices of essential commodities such as pulses and edible oil and they will vote on these issues,” said Mehra. BJP candidate Baldev Thakur, however, blamed the Congress for the troubles plaguing the Pong Dam oustees. “For 13 years, Congress legislator represented the constituency, but failed to raise the voice of oustees,” said Thakur. “If elected, I promise to take up their issue at every possible platform,” he said, adding that the ruling BJP government was also making sincere efforts to resettle displaced families. Dam of sorrow Fifty years have passed since over 20,000 families living in Kangra were uprooted from their land for the construction of the Pong hydroelectric power project that ushered a new era of prosperity in the arid Rajasthan. Raman Kumar, 26, a Pong Dam oustee said his grandfather gave up 10 acres of fertile land for the Pong Dam project. “I was not even born then. All my life I have seen my family struggling to get compensation and rehabilitation,” says Kumar whose family lives on a tiny island, Kuther, which ironically has neither electricity nor a school. Except for carrying out seasonal farming on the banks of the Pong Lake when the water recedes every winter, Kumar has no other means of earning a livelihood. “We are tired of all this. Politicians make promises only to break them. Now, it hardly matters now if it is an election issue or not for, we know that this battle will not end soon and we have to fight it on our own,” he said. Long-drawn battleThe construction of the dam started in 1961 on the Beas river near Pong village in Kangra district (then a part of Punjab), so that waters from its reservoir could be taken to the desert lands of Rajasthan and feed an extensive network of canal irrigation systems. A total area of 75,000 acres, spread over 94 villages in Nurpur and Dehra tehsil, was acquired for the reservoir. Of the acquired 339 tikkas (revenue estates), 223 were submerged fully and 116 partially, displacing 20,722 families and 1.5 lakh people. The submerged area was the most fertile in Kangra district and was called Haldoon Valley (which means granary) . The displaced people also did not get adequate compensation. Initially, the price was fixed at ₹140 per kanal, which was raised to ₹650 per kanal in 1965 and later to ₹1,000. The central government approached the Supreme Court, and in 1983 the price was revised to ₹750 per canal leaving the displaced people in a quandary. Most of them had already received compensation at the rate of ₹1,000 per kanal and the government had ordered recovery of the differential amount of ₹ 250.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/this-bypoll-hp-politicians-remain-mum-on-pong-dam-oustees-persisting-troubles-101635020692556.html

24-10-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz | The shopping bug||Festive season shoppers are left dazzled by fabrics and colours at the iconic Fabindia store in Chandigarh’s Sector 17. But for a humble bug, it must have been a decidedly bewildering odyssey as it flew from one rainbow stack of fabrics to another. How the disoriented insect had intruded into the santised store, where even houseflies may not dare, remains a mystery. Either it had slipped in through a vent or possibly got carried in a fabric consignment from outstation.The panicky bug landed on the back of my neck as I was shopping along with my better half. I dislodged it with my hand thinking it to be a housefly. When it landed on fabrics, I realised it was an unusual insect and was struck by the novelty of its presence among the haloed fabrics. Having grasped its predicament, and sensing it to be a plant eater, I removed it and placed it within thickly-foliaged plants outside the store.I contacted the Zoological Survey of India’s Dr. Sandeep Khushwaha as he has authored research papers on such insect families. “The insect belongs to the family, Rhopalidae, genus, Leptocoris. Your record is the first one of this from Chandigarh. It is commonly known as the soap plant bug. The 41 species of Leptocoris are distributed through Africa, South Asia and Oceania, and can be used as a biocontrol for environmental weeds,” informed Dr. Khushwaha.Demons lie in beholder’s eyeIn an area reeling under the terror of a leopard man-eater, smaller wild cat species face collateral damage under the mistaken notion that these are the progeny of the spotted marauder. Kittens of smaller wild cats such as the Jungle cat (JC) and Rusty Spotted cat can be mistaken as leopard cubs and are killed or removed from the spot – away from the mother leading to their death.Indeed, JC kittens may look like leopard cubs at a cursory first sight but they are very different. JC kittens are striped, brownish in colour and their ears have a kind of a tip in contrast to the more rounded ears of a leopard cub. However, these distinctions may not be so marked when JC kittens are extremely young and their stripes may seem like spots and their ears are yet to develop a marked tip. So, it is best to verify the species by involving experts.In a recent, heartwarming incident amid the gloom enveloping Kashmir, a trio of JC kittens unearthed from near the DC Office, Budgam, was handed over to the Police by a panicky mob fearing them to be the man-eater’s offspring and the augury of more human kills in future years. Budgam is faced with a man-eating leopard, which had killed a girl.The good thing was that, unlike in the past, when the Budgam people had quietly dislodged JC kittens, this time around they were handed over to the authorities. Wildlife SOS’s rescue personnel, Aaliya Mir, was summoned. Mir first made the anxious people aware that these were not leopard cubs. Later, with the people’s cooperation, she reunited the kittens with their distraught mother.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-the-shopping-bug-101635020452198.html

A majority of claims settlements have not been made after the SBI general insurance took over the operations in August. Earlier, we had warned of mass quitting the scheme if the problems are not resolved.”The members rued that 194 packages, including packages of gynae-obstetrics and ophthalmology, were reserved for government hospitals under the scheme and patients were forced to visit government hospitals. They demanded that packages should not be reserved so that patients could avail the facilities at private hospitals too.Residents to bear the bruntWith the IMA stopping all empanelled hospitals to stop admitting new cases, patients will have to bear the brunt of the tussle between both parties as they will not be able to get the benefit of the scheme.The Ayushman Bharat PMJAY is the health assurance scheme which aims at providing a health cover of ₹5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ima-punjab-stops-admitting-patients-under-ayushman-bharat-scheme-101635020333235.html

24-10-2021||Chandigarh||Mustafa, Capt in Twitter war over Aroosa Alam||A day after Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa ordered a probe to ascertain whether Aroosa Alam has any links with Pakistan’s spy agency Inter Services Intelligence (ISI), principal strategic adviser to Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, Mohammad Mustafa and former CM Capt Amarinder Singh entered into a war on words on Twitter on Saturday. Ex-DGP Mustafa, who is husband of Punjab cabinet Minister Razia Sultana, took on Amarinder for tweeting Aroosa’s picture with Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday evening. “Still grappling to grasp the designs behind tweeting Congress president-Aroosa picture. Please do understand, grant of Visa by the UPA or NDA doesn’t include licence to domesticate and outsource Governance apparatus to ‘Videshi mehmaan’,” Mustafa tweeted. In the next tweet, he posted an old picture of former chief secretary Vini Mahajan and then DGP Dinkar Gupta with Aroosa. “If I am wrong, explain this,” Mustafa asked Amarinder. The former chief minister, through his media adviser Raveen Thukral, quickly targeted Mustafa while releasing pictures of Aroosa with Mustafa’s wife Razia Sultana and his daughter-in-law. “And how about you explaining this. Isn’t that your wife and daughter-in-law with the same lady? How low can you get? Mixing politics with friendship! Aroosa personally cherishes these and many more such memories with your family,” Thukral quoted Amarinder as saying. The Mustafa family was reportedly close to Aroosa and Amarinder during the former’s stay in India before Amarinder-Mustafa relationship turned sour when he was overlooked for the post of the state DGP and Dinkar Gupta was elevated to the top police post. In another tweet later in the day, Mustafa targeted Thukral and wrote: “My time too precious to engage proxies. The depth and dimension of our relationships with Amarinder are beyond everyone’s comprehension, miles above pure commerce. Even during bitter fights we draw and line, Raveen Bhai, no self appointed surrogate would every understand that.” To this Thukral replied:” Mustafa bhai, with both of us without real jobs, our time is equally precious. But what I write here-quote unquote-are Amarinder’s views. But I agree, just as people can’t understand your relationships, mine too has been misunderstood by dubbing me as surrogate. Best wishes!,”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mustafa-capt-in-twitter-war-over-aroosa-alam-101635019731305.html
24-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh man sold banned BS-III bike gets ₹50,000 compensation||The sale of a Bharat Stage-III vehicle, which is not permitted on Indian roads, has cost a motorcycle manufacturer, its authorised dealer and the financing bank dear.The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Mohali, has directed the dealer, Bedi Auto Wings LLP, Industrial Area, Phase 3, Mohali, to refund ₹91,440, the price of the motorcycle, along with 12% interest, to the complainant, a resident of Colony Number 4, Industrial Area, Phase 1.The dealer; the manufacturer, Suzuki Motorcycle India Private Ltd; and IDFC First Bank Limited, that financed the vehicle, have also been told to jointly and severally pay ₹50,000 as compensation to the complainant within 30 days. From April 1, 2017, the Supreme Court had banned the sale and registration of Bharat Stage (BS)-III vehicles to make way for more eco-friendly BS-IV vehicles.However, the complainant, Rakesh Yadav, was sold a BS-III motorcycle by the automobile dealer on April 11, 2017.Yadav was caught unawares when the registration of the two-wheeler was rejected by the Registering and Licensing Authority, Chandigarh, in line with the SC directions. When he approached the dealer for a refund, his requests fell on deaf ears. Disposing of his complaint, the forum observed that the dealer made a fool of the complainant by taking advantage of his innocence and sold a vehicle which was not permitted by law.Holding the manufacturer guilty as well, the forum said, “We feel that manufacturer is equally liable for the nefarious activities of authorised dealer…It was incumbent upon the manufacturer to immediately call back or withdraw all vehicles lying in various agencies throughout India, as and when it came to know about the ban on the sale and registration of these vehicles. Manufacturer cannot escape its liability by providing us with an agreement with authorised dealer.” The order also said that IDFC First Bank Limited should also not have financed the vehicle and claimed interest on it, as it was very much aware that this specific vehicle was not permissible on the roads and its registration had been banned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-man-sold-banned-bs-iii-bike-gets-50-000-compensation-101635019612311.html

24-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Private hospitals also out of beds as dengue cases refuse to abate||With dengue case soaring to alarming proportions in the tricity, leaving government health facilities strained, even major private hospitals are running out of beds.Over 15 patients, suffering from dengue symptoms, are getting admitted to major private hospitals daily, forcing them to turn away many. The hospitals are also reporting shortage of platelets for patients with severe infection.For weeks, government hospitals in the tricity – primarily those in Chandigarh, which are catering to patients from across the region – have been buckling under the spike in dengue cases, leading patients to turn to private facilities.“We are getting patients with confirmed or suspected dengue infection from across the tricity. On an average, 15 patients are getting admitted daily, including those with severe infection. So far, we have treated 45 dengue patients and 10 suspected patients,” said Abhijit Singh, director, Fortis Hospital, Mohali, adding that to manage the increase in patient load, the hospital was ramping up its bed capacity.Dr RS Bedi, who runs Bedi Hospital in Chandigarh and is former national vice-president of the Indian Medical Association, said, “Daily, over 35 patients are getting consultancy at our hospital and around 10 require admissions. Many patients are getting diagnosed at later stages, increasing severity of infection. As we cannot arrange more beds, we are forced to turn away 4-5 patients.” Dr Achint Narang, senior consultant and head, critical care, Alchemist Hospital, Panchkula, said, “This year, we are receiving more severe cases compared to previous years. This may be related to some sort of strain change, which can be confirmed only through genetic mapping of viruses causing the infections this season. Also, more younger patients are being affected. Due to sudden spike in patient inflow, our bed capacity is nearly full.”At government hospitals, in absence of beds, patients are being treated on trolleys or in other departments. Dr Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER said, “Internal medicine department is catering to over 200 patients at present, almost double than its capacity, and most of the patients are suffering from fever. We are also admitting 15-20 confirmed dengue patients daily, with most of them in serious condition.”The situation is similar at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) in Sector 32 and Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH) in Sector 16, where more patients than the hospitals’ capacity are being treated for the infection.“We have a dedicated ward of 70 beds at the civil hospital and more beds will be added if needed,” said Dr Adarshpal Kaur, civil surgeon, Mohali, adding that many patients from Mohali are under treatment in Chandigarh hospitals as well.147 fresh dengue cases in tricityThe fresh dengue cases shot up to 147 on Saturday, against 101 on Friday.Mohali confirmed 85 cases, followed 36 in Chandigarh and 26 in Panchkula.With this, Mohali’s dengue cases this year have reached 1,981, far ahead of Chandigarh’s tally of 581 and Panchkula’s total of 422.Mohali district has also lost 21 residents to the viral infection, while three people have died in Chandigarh. Panchkula has reported no death till now.Meanwhile, the House Owners Welfare Association (HOWA), Sector 10, Panchkula, on Saturday blamed the local administration for the outbreak and urged the municipal corporation to start a special campaign to trim bushes and conduct door-to-door fogging in all sectors of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhprivate-hospitals-also-out-of-beds-as-dengue-cases-refuse-to-abate-101635019555256.html

Though the exact loss has yet to be determined, he said around ₹20,000 in cash and some jewellery articles were stolen.An agriculturist, Surender, said he owned a business in USA, where his children also lived. But currently he was living in Chandigarh with his elderly mother. He had hired a Nepalese domestic help two months ago after their regular servant went on leave. The second servant had also asked for leave recently and brought in another man a couple of days ago to work in his absence.

24-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Percentage of cyclist fatalities in 2020 highest in 5 years||Even though the number of fatalities in accidents in the city dropped to half between 2019 and 2020, the percentage of cyclist fatalities was the highest in five years, according to the Road Safety in Chandigarh 2020 report, released by the traffic police on Friday.A total of 10 cyclists were killed in road mishaps in 2020, forming 19% of the total fatalities (53) in the year. An equal number of cyclists died in 2019 as well, but overall, the accidents claimed 104 lives, making the percentage of cyclist fatalities in 2020 higher.Accidents involving cyclists continue in Chandigarh despite a large network of cycle tracks, meant to be a considerably safer means of travel.Umesh Sharma, professor in the civil engineering department of Punjab Engineering College, who specialises in traffic management, noted that though cycle tracks were available, there was an imbalance.“Most of these tracks are in northern sectors, while majority of the city’s population lives in southern sectors, where traffic movement is higher. Infrastructure for cyclists also needs to be improved. The cycle tracks must be well lit and have no obstructions or potholes, as specified by the Indian Road Congress,” he said.Use of the tracks by cyclists also remains inconsistent, even as the administration has been working to encourage cycling as a mode of transport to reduce traffic congestion.Through the year, traffic police conduct awareness drives, asking cyclists not to move on main roads, fix reflectors on their bikes and not wear dark clothes while cycling. Cycle squad also patrols the tracks for safety and removal of wrongly parked vehicles.NP Sharma, chief general manager of Chandigarh Smart City Limited, which has launched the public bicycle sharing project in the city, said they were also working on awareness campaigns for cyclists. “We will update the bicycle sharing app to contain awareness material for cyclists. Further, the UT administration has also started lighting up cycle tracks, among other infrastructure arrangements for cyclists,” he added.Pedestrian fatalities lowerMeanwhile, the number of pedestrians killed in road accidents went down. Pedestrians constituted 35% of fatalities in 2019, but the figure dipped to 23% in 2020.The traffic police’s report noted that all 11 accidents involving pedestrians happened where pedestrian infrastructure was missing, while no fatal accidents took place where zebra crossings were available.Vehicles continue to outnumber populationThe number of vehicles still continues to exceed Chandigarh’s population. As per the report, there were 12,34,757 vehicles in the city in 2020 against 11,58,491 people.It was in 2018 when the number of vehicles first crossed the number of people in the city, and the gap has only grown wider since then.The report, however, also found that the vehicle registration went down by 34% in 2020 and was also lowest in a decade. A total of 29,518 vehicles were registered in 2020, compared to 45,336 vehicles in the year before.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-percentage-of-cyclist-fatalities-in-2020-highest-in-5-years-101635019552249.html

Kaur, who is former MLA from the Amritsar East constituency, currently represented by her husband, was here to inaugurate development works worth ₹50 lakh at Mudhal village.Interacting with the media, she said no appointment or posting took place in the state without “money or gifts” to Aroosa. “ Nobody came without a gift of diamond sets for Aroosa,” she alleged. “No chairman was appointed without giving her gifts. Even in the police department, no posting took place without Aroosa’s consent. This is also an open secret that she ran away to Dubai and England with money from Punjab. Now, Captain Sahib should chase her and keep an eye on the money. Otherwise, he would lose that money as well. Captain should enjoy the rest of his life at least,” Kaur said. HT could not immediately contact Aroosa for her reaction to Kaur’s allegations.To a question on Aroosa’s picture with Congress president Sonia Gandhi shared by Amarinder’s media adviser Raveen Thukral on Twitter on Friday, Kaur said it was an old picture.Kaur said: “I never comment on anyone’s personal life, but the Prime Minister and home minister are aware of what happens in the country. They are supposed to take action.” When asked to comment on Amarinder’s plan of floating a new political party, she said: “Not even Captain Sandeep Singh Sandhu, who was his right hand man, stood by him.

24-10-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column | Sensationalising Aryan Khan case will not root out drugs||The blinding glitter of electronic media has predictably made Aryan Khan a household name. However, it has failed to cause the only reaction that could be useful to society, especially the youth: introspection. The drug issue may remain in news even after the 24/7 television and social media burn out because the “victim” happens to be a high-profile entity. However, the core issue may be lost as the public remains confused due to different versions of the event. Sadly, we seem obsessed with only two aspects of the problem – the legal and the sensational, forgetting that the problem is much closer to home and more rampant than we like to think. There may be an Aryan in our own neighbourhood or even in your own home. Therefore, it is important to look at the problem as a parent would were his own child a victim .All solutions begin with a change in social attitudes and the willingness to see drug addiction not as a stigmatic menace but a disease. Treating it as a newspaper and TV item is quite different from having to deal with it as a stark reality.It does not matter what the addiction is: drugs, alcohol or smoking. The difference is only in the intensity. The stigma associated with smoking and alcohol is lesser, and thus they are relatively easier to deal with. This shows us that the drug menace should be must be destigmatised. An addict must not be seen as an isolated, individual case but as an integral part of the organic whole that is society. After all, the infection in one organ may also take over the entire body. Contrary to popular belief, drug menace is not just an elitist luxury, but cuts right across layers of society, affecting the rich and poor, urban and rural alike in varying degrees of intensity. Fortunately, help is at hand. What is lacking is awareness of both the nature of disease and the availability of help. For instance, help is available in dedicated centres in institutions such as the PGI and support groups such AA, NA , Al-Anon. It is important to spread awareness on how to reach these help centres. As a first step, the tendency to be judgemental about victims must be overcome. Help begins with acceptance and willingness to admit and own the problem and seek help. But society must act to make it easier for the ‘patient’ to move in that directionIt is important to resist the Aryan syndrome, which is treating the issue as a titillating sensation. A mere escape from the boredom of reality. It must be seen as an opportunity to face and solve a a major social challenge .We need to go beyond the actual victim and focus on the menace as a potential epidemic. We need to focus not just on victims of the menace but also on those affected by it. Their number is alarming .Empathy is the most important tool. Empathy can alone destigmatise a patient and it must begin from the family. As one who has often been involved in support groups helping the hapless victims start new lives, I feel that everyone must empower ourselves and one another through empathy, awareness and willingness to give and receive help from one another.(The author has been an active volunteer with social awareness and support groups including Sahayta )||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sensationalising-aryan-khan-case-will-not-root-out-drugs-101635019251382.html

24-10-2021||Chandigarh||Random Forays | Why do our tempers flare up so often?||As a Scorpio by birth, I felt during my younger days that I had the licence to flare up at times. My temper would spike like a steep mountain but luckily it would subside shortly thereafter. Having read Linda Goodman and her ilk thoroughly, I knew all there was to know about the Scorpio sun sign and the volatile traits of those born in it.Over the years , I realised, however, that losing one’s cool was not so cool! Thankfully I am more temperate in my temper management these days and my friends consider me to be a relatively calm individual.The fact that anger is detrimental to our health and wellbeing is well documented. However, none of us gives a damn when moments of anger come to us. It is almost impossible in that situation to control one’s impulse to seethe and shout. But if we work on our moods in offline situations and perhaps practice yoga as well as meditation, we just might be able to refrain from boiling over even when provoked repeatedly by others.According to a Harvard University research, “Flares and flashes. Outbursts and eruptions. The words used to describe anger tend to be volcanic. And science may explain why. When an angry feeling coincides with aggressive or hostile behaviour, it also activates the amygdala, an almond-shaped part of the brain associated with emotions, particularly fear, anxiety, and anger.”If we look at ourselves a little analytically, each one of us can discern what actually makes us blow our tops. The raison d’etre for each person’s anger episodes is likely to be unique and distinct. But an introspective insight into our own conduct will enable us to understand the causes of our short fuses. Perhaps, then, it might be possible to eliminate or at least contain some of the shouting matches that we tend to indulge in. The frequency and intensity of losing one’s temper can surely be reduced if not minimised, if only we would try. Not only will such triers become more likable, they will also become healthier human beings.Another aspect of this discussion involves the vibrations that a short tempered person emits even when he or she is not actually in the midst of a tantrum. Just by being a cynical and fault finding being, an angry person rattles those who are around. A former editor, who drives around in the hills a lot these days, confided that he makes a pledge to himself each time he commences on a journey. He tells himself that he will not abuse anyone on the road even silently, and even if the ‘rascal’ deserves it! And he adds that he has a feeling of nirvana every time he accomplishes this challenging task.Our society needs many more such determined gentlemen who are able to eschew their tendency to chew people up. Haha! If a dusty desk, a spicy curry, a missing pen or an absentminded mistake repeatedly earns someone our ire, we need a re-look at our own conduct. We have no business to throw around our weight at trifles and hurt the feelings of others at home or office. Mindfulness expert Eckhart Tolle says that wherever there is anger, there is pain underneath. And one might add that an undercurrent of insecurity could be the reason for the behaviour of an over-aggressive boss or family member. A corollary to this point could be the fact that authority is not as important as respect. Someone who is firm but gentle might earn much more goodwill than someone who is unpleasantly rough with people. A powerful chair does not give us a licence to scare people. They are sure to curse us under their breath each time and we will not earn brownie points with the Almighty either.The word ‘danger’ uncannily has ‘anger’ embedded in it and thus the owner of an ‘angersome’ persona had better watch out! The tables are easily turned in real life and he might just have to repent for his uncouth conduct when the day of reckoning comes!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/random-forays-why-do-our-tempers-flare-up-so-often-101635018951455.html

The security was already tight and has been further beefed up after more inmates were transferred from Jammu and Kashmir,” said BK Singh, senior jail superintendent, Agra Central Jail.He said that such transfers from one state to another are for “security reasons. There are legal provisions under which inmates who pose a threat to security in jails in a state are shifted to jails in other states.”“Out of 38 inmates brought to Agra Central Jail, 27 are from Kashmir and 11 are from the Jammu region” Singh added. These inmates were airlifted to Agra airport from Jammu and Kashmir and were brought to Agra jail amid tight security by road. “We already had a platoon of Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) and with rising security concerns, one more company of PAC has been provided to us,” Singh said. “The roads adjoining the central jail will have partial barricading so that those reaching the area can be closely monitored,” he said. Eighty-five jail inmates in Jammu and Kashmir were transferred to Agra Central Jail in 2019 also when the state of Jammu and Kashmir and especially the valley was on high vigil after declaration of state as union territory and abrogation of Article 370 and section 35A in parliament. They were airlifted on three different occasions in August and September.Then too, the boundaries of the central jail were partially barricaded with deployment of extra police personnel, besides the PAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/agra-central-jail-to-host-38-more-jammu-and-kashmir-jail-inmates-101635018471347.html
24-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Allegations fly thick and fast over rape plaint against Simarjit Bains||With one of the two complainants withdrawing the rape plaint against Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) chief Simarjit Singh Bains, his constituency, Atam Nagar, has become a political hot bed with allegations and counter-allegations flying thick and fast.The woman, while withdrawing her complaint on Thursday, had alleged that Congress leader Kamaljit Karwal and SAD candidate Harish Rai Dhanda had pressured her to file a false complaint.Following this, the LIP had started campaigns on social media as well as on the ground-level, claiming that false complaints were being lodged against Bains with an aim to tarnish his image ahead of the 2022 assembly elections. The opposition, meanwhile, is accusing the LIP leader of threatening and forcing the complainant to withdraw the case.SAD candidate Harish Rai Dhanda said, “I feel pity for the second complainant. She has been forced and threatened to withdraw her complaint as even the police failed to take action against Bains. She has levelled allegations against us due to the pressure built by Bains. LIP supporters are trying to create a narrative that both the complaints are false but the allegations in both cases are true and the first complainant is still fighting for justice.” He added, “I have been campaigning on the development agenda and have never used rape cases to woo voters during my meetings. But we will not rest till Bains is arrested by the police. I have been supporting the first woman so that justice is served to her.”Congress leader Kamaljit Karwal also maintained he has not used the rape case for political gains. “Bains has tried to clear his name by pressuring the woman to withdraw the complaint and accuse me of blackmail. Bains and that woman should now prove the allegations levelled against me. If Bains is right and the rape complaint submitted by the woman against him was fake, why has he not taken legal action against her for defamation?” said Karwal. Despite repeated attempts, MLA Bains was not available for comments. LIP spokesperson Sunny Kainth said, “After the second woman accused Dhanda and Karwal of blackmailing her for submitting a rape complaint against Bains, it is clear that both the complaints are fake and have been submitted to defame Bains ahead of elections. Atam Nagar is the stronghold of Bains as he has won twice from the constituency. The opposition will not be able to defeat him with dirty politics.” Earlier a close aide of Bains, Karwal had snapped ties with the former during the previous assembly elections and unsuccessfully contested from the seat. Karwal is now the Congress’ halqa in-charge for Atam Nagar while Dhanda has been declared the SAD candidate from the constituency for the upcoming elections.In July this year, Bains and six others had been also booked by the police after the first complainant, who had been sitting on protest outside the police commissioner’s office for around eight months, moved court. The court had ordered the police to lodge an FIR in the case. Seeking the arrest of Bains, the complainant is still protesting outside the CP office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-allegations-fly-thick-and-fast-over-rape-plaint-against-simarjit-bains-101635018411064.html

24-10-2021||Chandigarh||Roundabout | From fig leaves to high fashion with a cause||“Why a course in fashion technology?” This question posed to a motley batch of students from different streams at the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), Panchkula, during a short elective course on creative writing was a predictable one, yet it was answered with sheer zest, passion and flair. Punya Gulati, who is pursuing a masters degree in fashion management, says, “Looking back to where it all began makes me nostalgic. I remember, I was just an eight-year-old when my sister asked me to accompany her to NIFT in Delhi. Not knowing where it would take me, I said yes. The first sight that my eyes rested on was a tall and skinny boy in black haram pants, a bell-sleeved shirt and a mop of curly toffee-brown hair. I had never seen such an apparition and the experience was surreal. This vision in front of the main gate of the institution lined with green trees bewitched me and I felt that this was where I belonged.” Others too shared their stories of being a Niftian as they call themselves with the pride of a Stephanian of yore and the hard work and setbacks they faced.Looking good and feeling fineInteracting with young folks creatively engaged in different areas of design and fashion, chasing their dreams even in these masked times, what comes to mind is Lady Gaga’s fashion song: “Looking and feeling fine, Fashion!” This is followed by a more desi song of a rather dark 2008 Hindi film Fashion with the Madhur Bhandarkar stamp: “Fashion ka hai yeh jalwa.” The film had Priyanka Chopra and Kangana Ranaut playing super models and paying a heavy price. Now old and wizened, one knows for sure that nothing ever comes to anyone anywhere without a price of some kind.Fashion began the moment humans started covering their bodies. The Biblical thought says it started with the serpent enticing Eve to give the forbidden fruit to Adam. Of course it has been a long journey from the fig leaves to high fashion and ‘The Devil Wearing Prada’ a 2006 Hollywood blockbuster film which looks at the world from the office of the top fashion magazine. Well, in the times that one is living, it is said that everyday is a fashion show and the world is your runway. However, one cannot help recall the days when women in the 80s protested on the wings of feminism against fashion shows and the use of their bodies as a commodity. One recalls participating in such processions even on the roads of Chandigarh. With liberalisation, many taboos vanished and at a film premier actor John Abraham was asked by photographers to open the buttons of his shirts as girls in the audience made catcalls. Times had changed indeed!Fashion as a movementOne saw many social and political movements sadly withering away and to an old-world person like me who carried a chip on the shoulder for being politically correct all the way, it was bit of a shock to be sent by the editor to go and cover a fashion show in a city hotel in the 90s. As models paraded their wares down the ramp one caught sight of a hoarding which carried the message loud and clear: When Fashion is a Movement! Of course with a heavy heart one edited it a bit and put it in the intro taking sweet revenge for the story appearing on the glossy pages with the headline: In Times When Fashion Is the Only Movement.However, those who have to spell change and make a statement will do it even on the fashion ramp. Two fashion designers one would like to talk about are from the East. The first one is the legendary Japanese designer Yohji Yamamoto ,78, who changed the whole perception of fashion the world over. His collections instead of laying bare women dressed them in oversized black clothes creating a sensation in Paris in tribute to his deep love and respect for women. After all he was inspired to be a master tailor in a little dress-making business run by his mother. Of the long coats he designed for women, he says: “It meant something to me; the coat guarding a home, hiding a woman’s body. Maybe I liked imagining what was inside.”Closer to home, Wendell Rodrick (1960-2020), one of the most innovative fashion designers who grew up in Mahim, Mumbai, with a diploma in catering to dizzying heights of fame but never failed to raise issues of social concern and environment. Awarded the Padma Shri , he created history by parading plus-size models at the Lakme Fashion Week. He paid tribute to the actor, Rekha, on her 60th birthday at yet another gala show and worked for the LGBTQ consistently. So fashion is what a master designer makes of it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/roundabout-from-fig-leaves-to-high-fashion-with-a-cause-101635018351859.html

24-10-2021||Chandigarh||Divorce with mutual consent: HC waives ‘cooling-off’ period for Kharar couple||The Punjab and Haryana high court has waived the minimum six-month “cooling-off” period before granting divorce to an estranged couple from Kharar. “The marriage between the parties has irretrievably broken. They have decided to part their ways amicably. Opportunity to live their lives in the manner they like cannot be denied,” the bench of Justice Arun Monga said, adding that in these circumstances insisting to wait for another six months would result in adding to their woes.The couple got married in March 2019 in Kharar. However, due to temperamental differences, they started living separately after May 2019. In September 2021, they moved a plea in family court for divorce with mutual consent and subsequently waiver of “cooling-off” period. However, the plea on waiver was dismissed.They challenged the September-8 order of principal judge, family court, Kharar, before the high court, arguing that once the parties have amicably consented to part their ways, they cannot be forced to wait for another six months. The six-month waiting period is prescribed under Section 13B (2) of the Hindu Marriage Act for divorce. Under Section 13B, when a couple files for divorce with mutual consent, they first have to establish a 12-month separation period, which is then followed by a “cooling-off” period of six months. However, the Supreme Court had in 2020 ruled that on case-to-case basis, this period can be waived. The bench, before allowing the plea, interacted with them and observed that no useful purpose would be served to unnecessarily force them to wait for six months, especially in view of statement from the estranged wife. She had submitted that she was in Canada and the grant of her permanent residence status by the immigration authorities depended on the condition that she is single/not married.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/divorce-with-mutual-consent-hc-waives-cooling-off-period-for-kharar-couple-101635017751185.html

We have told the court to extend the accused’s custody so that we can ascertain the identity of other suspects,” he said.“A team of the Haryana Police is also conducting raids in Punjab to arrest other suspects,” he added.Meanwhile, counsels for the four accused opposed the prosecution plea in court and contended that the police had recovered weapons used in the crime, blood-stained clothes and recreated the crime scene. Thus, there is no requirement to increase the remand period of the Nihangs.Court grants bail to Karnal manA local court in Sonepat granted bail to a man identified as Naveen Sandhu, of Karnal district, who was arrested on October 21 for allegedly thrashing a migrant labourer from Bihar, Manoj Paswan, who was involved in the business of selling chicken.The court has granted him bail due to lack of evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/court-extends-singhu-lynching-accused-s-police-custody-by-two-days-101635017690919.html
24-10-2021||Lucknow||Panic for platelets spikes demand in Lucknow as dengue cases rise||The demand for platelet transfusion has gone up in Lucknow with the rise in dengue cases. However, doctors say the demand is unwarranted. They say all dengue patients do not require a platelet transfusion.“The panic among attendants is pushing up the demand, and now, we are getting requests for platelets not only from hospitals in Lucknow but from Hardoi and Barabanki as well,” said Prof Tulika Chandra, HoD, transfusion medicine, King George’s Medical University (KGMU).The KGMU blood bank has observed a demand of about 150 units in the last one day, against the usual demand of between 50 to 70 units per day.Similarly, the demand has gone up in other blood banks including the Lucknow Nursing Home Association Blood Bank, Civil Hospital and Balrampur Hospital.“Till the platelet count is 20,000 there is no risk. However, the patient needs observation once the count starts falling below 40,000 and the patient has been vomiting, bleeding from the mouth or the nose. These are clear indications of risk but transfusion should be decided only by consulting a doctor and not on a panic note,” said Prof Kauser Usman, HoD, geriatric medicine, KGMU.“Among young patients, one can wait till the count falls to 10,000 before transfusion of platelets is thought of, while among pregnant women, old people and those suffering with chronic illnesses, the decision for transfusion may be taken by the doctor when the level falls to 20,000,” said Prof Chandra.“Platelet count does not matter much if the quality of platelets in the body (of the patient) is good. The count may be low but good quality platelets will function well. In such a situation also there is no need to panic and one should go by the doctor’s decision,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary-general Association of International Doctors.According to statistics, Lucknow has reported close to 800 dengue cases this year, with the rising trend seen in the past one week.“There is more panic than need. We are maintaining a stock of 10 units of platelets and every day 2 to 3 units are needed for patients admitted to our hospital,” said Dr SK Nanda of Civil hospital.Doctors said instead of going by just the count of platelets in the body, attendants should go by the doctor’s advice, who will advise transfusion depending on a patient’s condition and symptoms.The bed situationHospitals in the state capital have reserved beds for patients of infectious diseases, said the chief medical officer of Lucknow, Dr Manoj Agrawal. In all, 314 beds are reserved in the state capital in different hospitals.At Balrampur Hospital, 128 beds have been reserved where eight patients of dengue and eight of high fever are presently recuperating. Similarly, other hospitals too have beds reserved.At the Civil Hospital, 70 beds have been reserved and 36 patients of high fever are admitted. At the Civil Hospital (Mahanagar) 20 beds are reserved. The TB Hospital in Thakurganj has 14 beds reserved for dengue patients, while Rani Laxmibai Hospital has 12 beds reserved.“Samples of all patients having high fever have been sent for confirmation of dengue,” said Dr Agrawal, who inspected the facilities at Balrampur Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/panic-for-platelets-spikes-demand-in-lucknow-as-dengue-cases-rise-101635017572506.html
24-10-2021||Chandigarh||Sufficiency of cause does not give indefeasible legal right to ‘perpetual litigant’: HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court (HC) has rapped the Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (UHBVN) for delay in challenging a lower court order stating that even sufficiency of cause does not result in any indefeasible legal right to a “perpetual litigant” such as UHBVN.“It is high time that a lax litigant pays the price for casual and nonchalant approach in instituting time-bound cases in courts, particularly as enlightened a litigant as the UHBVN,” the bench of justice Arun Monga said.An order was passed in 2017 by an additional civil judge (senior division), Karnal in a dispute between the UHBVN and a private person and was asked to refund Rs1.76 lakh towards penalty and compounding fees of Rs20,000 deposited with interest at the rate of 6% per annum. It was upheld on August 6, 2019 by additional district judge, Karnal.However, the UHBVN approached the HC this month after a delay of 132 days. The UHBVN had sought that the plea be admitted for hearing as the delay was due to delay in procurement of some documents and last year’s Covid-19 restrictions. Hence, it has been filed now. The court observed that the explanation given does not inspire confidence as specific dates have not been given to explain each day’s delay. It said part delay may have been caused due to the pandemic slowdown, which though seems justifiable, but prior to that the appeal had already become time-barred.It observed that the court has discretion to condone the delay, provided sufficient cause for the same is made out. But mechanical reasons have been given as explanation as if to seek condonation of delay is a “matter of right”.“...a perpetual litigant due to nature of its business, and legally backed up with an entire vertical of department’s in house law officers giving them advice at every step, apart from worthy outsourced panel lawyers,” the bench said adding that despite the same, if delay is caused at the cost of forfeiture of vested legal right it has to be deprecated. “Delay is thus akin to self-goal. Consequences thereof have to be suffered and most certainly, there cannot be any premium on a self-goal,” the bench added, dismissing the plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sufficiency-of-cause-does-not-give-indefeasible-legal-right-to-perpetual-litigant-hc-101635017571107.html
24-10-2021||Chandigarh||HC gives Haryana six months to finalise promotion policy for differently-abled employees||The Punjab and Haryana high court has directed the Haryana government to frame a policy as expeditiously as possible, but not later than six months on the promotional avenues to differently-abled employees.The court has disposed of an appeal filed by the state government in which it had challenged the October 2018 order of the commissioner for persons with disability, Haryana on pleas demanding 3% reservation to differently-abled persons as provided under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 be implemented. When confronted with provisions of the 2016 law during the hearing, the government, during the hearing, had told court that it is ready to implement the order but demanded that directions be clarified to mean that the same are merely recommendatory in nature and should be considered while framing the policy. The complainant’s lawyer had agreed to the state’s viewpoint but demanded that the government should, however, frame the policy in a certain time-bound schedule as the benefits are being denied to deserving people. In 2018, the commissioner for persons with disability had ordered implementation of 2016 law. It was reported in the order that fixed roster points are not required in case of promotion to differently-abled persons and it would be appropriate to prepare the seniority list of the presently serving differently-abled persons cadre-wise to give reservation in promotion. It was further recorded that the right of promotion to differently-abled persons is not a limited right. The promotion benefit will follow with all benefits of promotion i.e. pay hike, seniority, etc. It was also stated that the benefit of reservation in promotion should also be available to employees who have not been appointed under the reservation category of differently-abled persons but became differently-abled during the course of employment. Also, the person becomes eligible for promotion from the date of submission of disability certificate. The benefit of reservation in promotion is not limited for once and has to be given in each cadre to give effect of 3% reservation, the 2018 order had recorded. The court disposed of the plea with a limited clarification that the 2018 order being perceived as directions are merely recommendatory in nature and not mandatory. “Being observations, shall not be construed to mean that the State shall simply ignore the same. It is expected of the competent authority to consider the said recommendations and in case the same are not accepted, give reasons thereof,” the court said, giving six months’ time for a policy to be put in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-gives-haryana-six-months-to-finalise-promotion-policy-for-differently-abled-employees-101635017390917.html

Sukhbir, accompanied by Adampur MLA, Pawan Kumar Tinu also held a press conference. “The Congress is already dead in Punjab and divided into misls or kabeelas (group or factions) like the Randhawa misls, Channi misls, Jakhar misls and others. Even these are going to disintegrate into countless more entities with Congressmen indulging in a free-for-all to destroy one another,” he said on the sidelines of the function. On Captain Amarinder Singh’s Pakistan friend, Aroosa Alam. Sukhbir alleged that it was his (Capt’s) relationship with the BJP government that ensured visas for Aroosa. Sukhbir, MP from Ferozepur, added that the Channi government in Punjab was is in complete chaos with the right hand not knowing what the left was doing.He also questioned Channi on why had he not taken prompt action to address the problems of sugarcane and cotton growers. He added that though the state government had announced a State-Advised Price (SAP) of ₹360 per quintal, sugar mills were not ready to pay this price. “Mills are not entering into bonds with farmers to purchase cane at the SAP. It is also most unfortunate that the SAP has not been notified due to which there are apprehensions that it may not be honoured by the mills.” Sukhbir also asked the chief minister to release compensation to farmers afflicted by the pink bollworm attack quickly. He added that all those killed in Kisan Andolan be paid ₹50 lakh each on the pattern of those killed in Lakhimpur Kheri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjprss-supported-capt-in-2017-polls-made-him-cm-sukhbir-101635017331080.html

In the past 15 years, penalties of ₹2.02 crore of 42% fines have been recovered whereas 58% are yet to be recovered.According to Kapoor, delay and non-recovery from the defaulting PIOs has raised doubts about the efficacy of the Act in Haryana.Following a complaint filed with the Haryana lokayukta for slow recovery of penalties and non-compliance with the norms set for recovery of penalties from the PIOs, the Haryana government had set up a monitoring committee headed by the chief secretary, in January this year, to monitor recovery of penalties imposed on errant PIOs.Kapoor said the government, in a reply of another RTI, has told that more steps are being taken in this direction. The government has decided to fix the responsibility of drawing and disbursing officer to deduct the penalty amount from salaries of defaulters and to take action against him in case he fails to do so.The under secretary to the Haryana administrative reforms department replied to Kapoor, claiming that a meeting of the monitoring committee was held last month and fresh directions were issued including penalty recovery of each department be updated, and list of officers against whom penalty is due be circulated to the secretary or HoD concerned for recovery.As per the RTI Act, PIOs are penalised with a maximum of ₹25,000 for intentionally not sharing information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-govt-issues-fresh-directions-to-recover-penalties-under-rti-act-101635016010910.html
24-10-2021||Mumbai||Kangana failed to make out positive case for transfer of hearing: Mumbai court||A proceeding cannot be transferred from one court to another merely on the basis of apprehension, a metropolitan magistrate court said in its detailed order by which actor Kangana Ranaut’s plea for transfer of the defamation case filed by lyricist Javed Akhtar against her was dismissed. The court said the actor “failed to make out a positive, concrete case to show that her apprehension was reasonable”. “If on the basis of false allegation, a matter is transferred, it will affect the morale of the presiding officer,” said additional chief metropolitan magistrate (ACMM) ST Dande in Thursday’s order that became available late on Friday evening. The court added that the Andheri magistrate acted judiciously and was not biased against Ranaut. ACMM Dande observed that unless some positive, concrete case is made out showing that there was reasonable apprehension of not getting fair trial or fair justice from the court concerned, the proceeding cannot be transferred from one court to another on mere vague and general allegations. Ranaut had sought the transfer of the case from the 10th court in Andheri to another court. The actor had submitted through her counsel, advocate Rizwan Siddiqui, that she did not have faith in the magistrate presiding over the 10th court, who was hearing the defamation case. She had alleged that the court was biased against her, as it kept on insisting for her physical appearance without any sufficient reason, that too in the case involving a bailable, non-cognisable and compoundable offence, and kept on threatening to issue an arrest warrant against her. Akhtar has filed a defamation case against Ranaut last November, alleging that she had made defamatory and baseless comments about him in a television interview. The ACMM noted that on December 19, the court had directed Juhu police to investigate the complaint and submit a report. On February 1 this year, the magistrate court had issued a process against Ranaut after the police filed a report. The order of issuance of process against the accused was upheld by the sessions court and the Bombay high court, and despite receipt of summons Ranaut had remained absent. Therefore, a bailable warrant was issued against her. The magistrate added that even thereafter, the actor had remained absent on subsequent dates as well, but the magistrate court did not issue a non-bailable warrant against her in spite of Akhtar’s counsel, Jai Bharadwaj, applying for it on numerous occasions. “It shows from the documents that the 10th court magistrate has given a fair opportunity to the accused to remain absent by granting all her exemption applications. He has not acted against the actress and neither had any bias towards her (sic),” said ACMM Dande.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kangana-failed-to-make-out-positive-case-for-transfer-of-hearing-mumbai-court-101635015890899.html
24-10-2021||Mumbai||Recent events prompt experts to revisit issue of replacing NEET with state CET||The argument between a national entrance exam for medical admissions versus a state-level entrance exam has for long been debated and the recent happenings have only made this debate stronger. Days after the Bombay high court (HC) directed the National Testing Agency (NTA) – the nodal examination authority – to conduct a fresh round of entrance exam for two students in the country who were wronged the first time, more and more people are questioning the “haphazard manner” in which an entrance exam of such great value is being conducted year after year. “This is not the first time that students have been affected due to lack of knowledge among exam invigilators. NTA has rarely ever trained personnel across the country before holding such an important exam and this has resulted in the current situation,” said Sudha Shenoy, parent and activist. She added that while two students approached HC, several others have faced issues of delay in being handed over the answer booklet or answer papers being early snatching away on the examination day. “Such issues might sound frivolous to the examiners but for students who have been preparing for an exam for two years or more, every minute of that examination counts and errors on part of the invigilators costs students their future,” she added. The National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) is an all-India medical and dental entrance exam that was initiated in 2016 by the Central government by quashing all state-held common entrance tests (CET) to bring into effect a uniform entrance test. This move was challenged by several state governments in 2016, but to no avail. In September, the Tamil Nadu (TN) Assembly passed a bill seeking permanent exemption to medical aspirants from the state from NEET. The Tamil Nadu Admission to Undergraduate Medical Degree Courses Bill, 2021, was supported by several political parties in the state and was introduced after a 19-year old medical aspirant died by suicide at his home hours before NEET was conducted on September 11. Days after the TN Assembly decision, Maharashtra minister for medical education Amit Deshmukh suggested that the government will review the all-India entrance exam and decide whether it is good for students. He responded to a letter written by a local leader addressed to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, requesting scrapping of NEET, and conducting of medical admissions based on class 12 scores instead. “Any examination which involves 15-16 lakh students cannot and should not be conducted by a central authority. For nearly 16 years before NEET was introduced, every state conducted its own entrance exam to fill up 85% seats under state quota and never faced trouble. I think it’s time to go back to the old model and put an end to the misery this exam is causing to medical aspirants,” said Dr TP Lahane, former director of the state Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER). He added that an all-India entrance exam can be conducted for those aiming for the 15% all-India quota (AIQ) seats while admissions to state quota seats be decided based on state CETs. While many stakeholders, including students and parents, agree with this stand, some still feel NEET should stay. “Students from state boards took a couple of years to be prepared and stand at par with fellow students from central boards because NEET syllabus was based on NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training) syllabus. To make changes once again will mean bringing sudden changes, which will be unfair to students who are already quite stressed preparing for such competitive exams,” said Akriti Patel, parent of a medical student.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/recent-events-prompt-experts-to-revisit-issue-of-replacing-neet-with-state-cet-101635015830911.html

She had in the past also cited how in the run up to the 2007 UP polls that BSP won with a majority, many surveys had not made the correct predictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bsp-writes-to-election-commission-seeks-ban-on-pre-poll-surveys-101635015771276.html

Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) members are doing it.Pune Municipal Corporation erected third replica at Raja Mantri garden located at Erandwana. BJP corporator Deepak Pote erected it from his ward development fund. Earlier BJP member Mahesh Wabale erected such replica near Treasure Park on Ambil Odha bridge. Recently BJP member Varsha Tapkir approved almost Rs2 crore fund for erecting such huge Shree Ram Memorial at Ambegaon-Dhankawadi pathar.All three replicas came in last one year. Even sources said that some more BJP workers planned to it at various places from their ward development fund. It shows that this is new trend to do it from ward development fund.Earlier there were trends like erecting cement concrete roads, erecting smart bus stop, distributing jute bags but now Ram Temple replica is likely to become new trend among the elected members to spend their funds.BJP member Wabale said, “I did the first replica in the city but I used my own funds for erecting it. The rest of the arch is erected by PMC funds but the replica on it is my own personal funds.”Civic activist Vijay Kumbhar objected it and said, “As per the law and Supreme court guideline, civic body cannot spend on religious structures.

On Friday night, a tanker carrying inflammable liquid fell on its right side; hitting a Tata Harrier, a 13-seater tempo, and a container in quick succession. The fumes could be felt hours later as the charred remains were absorbed into the soft mud shoulder of the highway.Senior police inspector Devidas Gheware of Sinhagad road police station recalled, “The tanker first fell on its right side and came down and hit the Tata Harrier, next hitting the 13-seater tempo which also fell on its side upon impact, and then the container. Our priority was to save the people and then clear the traffic. Panic spread and everyone started saying that there were people trapped under it.”The deceased were identified as Amar Gade and Kompotarkumar Santalal Chamar; while the injured were identified as Ganesh Gujar, Rajvardhan Patil, Chandan Pardhi, Samrat Bhide, Akash Pawar, Shekhar Kadam, Prashant Suryavanshi and Amrut Jadhav, according to the police. They are all undergoing treatment at various hospitals. Five others identified as Karuna More, Shailesh Patil, Amar Salunkhe, Shubham Dhawalia and Kanchar Katakram escaped with minor injuries. A team from an NGO that conducts research on road safety was present at the site in jackets, and claimed that they are working in association with the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC).A day before the Friday mishap, two persons were killed and two others injured in an accident just 50 to 70 metre away from the same spot. A container truck started hurtling down the slope, sweeping along with it a motorcycle near which the two deceased persons were waiting, according to the police. A complaint was lodged based on a statement recorded by a youth, 17, who was riding a Bullet motorcycle with a relative seated pillion around the time of the accident.The deceased were identified as Fatima Irfan Patel, 35; and Anjum Vajir Mujawar, 20; both residents of Shanti colony in Vijaynagar, Kalewadi, Pimpri-Chinchwad.Police inspector Gheware said, “They were waiting at selfie point, which is so ill-placed. People stop in the middle of the highway to take selfies there. At other times, fruit vendors occupy the third lane completely.”A case under sections 279, 304(a), 337, and 338 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) along with sections 134, 184 and 119/177 of the Motor Vehicles Act was registered at Sinhagad road police station.These two accidents have taken the total number of accidents that have occurred along this stretch in the past eight years to 46 and the corresponding death toll to 56. Last year, when a major pile-up occurred along the same stretch, a 24-point letter was sent to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI).While the NHAI has acted on some of the suggestions, others including a ropeway to absorb the shock of heavy vehicles that lose balance and plain solid shoulders instead of soft mud shoulders have to be still worked upon. The police claim that street lights have been improved and rumblers installed after the last mishap but that hasn’t stopped accidents from taking place especially on the steep slope. Fruit vendors and the selfie point are posing newer threats on the highway. Moreover, locals are resisting closing of the arbitrary entry-exit point where local traffic suddenly merges with the high-speed highway movement.Third accident in a row on the stretch A third incident was reported on the same stretch of Mumbai-Bengaluru highway on Saturday which had claimed four lives in two days between Thursday and Friday. The accident did not cause any death as four vehicles piled up along the highway before the Narhe bridge. A Kia SUV rammed into another vehicle and then two others, causing a minor traffic snarl in which two women sustained minor injuries, according to the police. The incident was recorded at Sinhagad road police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/narhe-trap-on-mumbai-bengaluru-highway-claims-4-more-lives-101635015112505.html

The Kanyakumari district-based SAFF chief urged the government to take steps to get appropriate compensation on par with international standards for the fishermen as well as damages for the boat.“The Panama-flagged cargo ship Navious Venus, bound for Mumbai from Singapore, did not stop after ramming into the fishing boat. It was due to sheer negligence,” he said and urged authorities to seize the ship and arrest its captain.“Such incidents continue to happen as there is no strict action. If a vehicle driver causes an accident on road he is arrested. Why this is not followed in the case of a ship? Why this indifference” he asked.The Coast Guard, in a press release, said it received information about a mid-sea collision between a merchant vessel ‘Navious Venus’ and fishing boat ‘Shijumon’. Two crew members of the fishing boat were ‘thrown overboard’ due to impact of collision, it said.All the fishermen were rescued and provided medical assistance and early on Saturday, two of them, who were injured in the collision, were taken to Thiruvananthapuram government medical college by a medical team from CG Station Vizhinjam-Thiruvananthapuram. Both the CG and SAFF said the fishing boat was escorted by local fishing boats and it reached the Colachel fishing harbour in Tamil Nadu with the remaining crew of 15.“We are in the process of getting an FIR filed with the marine police,” the SAFF chief said. “As they were tossed up due to the impact of the collision, the 15-other fishermen also suffered injuries.”In a representation to the Directorate General of Shipping seeking legal action, the SAFF said on October 22, as many as 17 fishermen set out for deep sea fishing in the mechanised boat ‘Shijumon’ from Colachel government fishing harbour. The fishing boat belonged to a fisherman, Rajamani from Kotilpaadu of Kanyakumari district.While the fishing boat was around nineteen nautical miles from Colachel, the cargo ship collided with it and caused damage, resulting in injuries to fishermen two of whom were thrown out. Immediately, the master of the boat informed the Coast Guard about the collision and requested assistance and CG personnel reached the spot immediately.The two ‘thrown out’ and injured fishermen were K Chinnathurai and P Arulraj, aged 50 and 60 respectively, and they were taken to Thiruvananthapuram government medical college hospital for treatment.”We kindly request your good office to take necessary and immediate legal action against the ship Navious Venus which collided with fishermen boat Shijumon and caused injury to the fishermen and heavy damage to the mechanised boat,” the representation said.A copy of the representation was also sent to fisheries, police and other authorities in Cochin, Chennai and Kanyakumari urging action.Of the 17 fishermen, 15 were from Tamil Nadu and two others from West Bengal. On February 15, 2012, two marines aboard an Italian-flagged oil tanker ‘Enrica Lexie’ allegedly shot dead two Indian fishermen, hailing from Kerala and on a fishing boat, “mistaking” them for pirates. Following remittance of ₹10 crore compensation by Italy, the Supreme Court had in June this year directed the closure of criminal proceedings in India against two Italian marines, in connection with the killing of two fishermen off the Kerala coast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cargo-ship-rams-boat-off-tamil-nadu-coast-two-fishermen-thrown-out-101635015050854.html
24-10-2021||Bangalore||Plans to liberate East Pak began in ’65, says Vice Admiral Chawla||Vice Admiral Anil Kumar Chawla on Saturday said the thinking to separate East Pakistan from the West actively started after the 1965 Indo-Pak war with a principal reason to stop support of Pakistan’s ISI to insurgencies in the north-east of India.East Pakistan was separated from the West after the 1971 Indo-Pak war, giving birth to a new nation -- Bangladesh.“It was mentioned that the war did not really start in December (1971). Actually, if you really go back into literature and read, the thinking started actively after the 1965 war on how to separate East Pakistan from West Pakistan,” said Chawla, who is the Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Southern Naval Command.Speaking at the Indian Air Force Conclave n the 1971 Indo-Pak war, he said the principal reason was the interference of Pakistani ISI in the insurgencies in the north-east, particularly the arming and training of the Naga rebels.“It (supporting insurgency) was actually happening in the Chittagong hill tracts, which is from where we took a leaf out, when we sort of trained the Mukti Bahini, so the thinking started then. But India was very weak then. If you recollect, the Congress party had split, Indira Gandhi had barely managed to hold on to become the PM and was not expected to last very long,” he added.The Vice Admiral was speaking at the IAF conclave to commemorate 50-years of victory in the 1971 Indo-Pak war that gave birth to Bangladesh as a country, which is being celebrated this year as ‘Swarnim Vijay Varsh’.Noting that the thought processed from 1965 onwards, he said, “It was at a very nascent stage of course, but now documents clearly bring out that after January 30, 1971 hijacking of an Indian Airlines aircraft to Lahore by Kashmiri separatists, the Indian government actually stopped overflight facilities and this prevented Pakistan re-arming in East Pakistan, and they had to route through Colombo, making it difficult and expensive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/plans-to-liberate-east-pak-began-in-65-says-vice-admiral-chawla-101635014994200.html
24-10-2021||Bangalore||Amid flooding, experts seek drainage overhaul in Bengaluru||With continuous rains over the last couple of weeks causing flooding in low-lying regions of Bengaluru, urban experts have called for a change in the way the storm water in the city is handled.Flooding has left a trail of destruction, misery, and suffering of people living in low-lying regions of the city and other places where drains and lakes have overflowed into the homes and basements. The city received 233 mm of rainfall till October 18 as against the normal of 104 mm, registering an increase of 125%, as per Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) data. The rains have again exposed chinks in Bengaluru’s poor quality of infrastructure and planning, with Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai admitting that there was a lack of town planning and unscientific methods were used for creating new residential layouts. Urban planner V Ravichandar said unless a change in storm water drainage is brought about, the situation in the city is going to be difficult. “Our growth is unplanned and rampant. We have occupied several low-lying areas in the city and these areas don’t have a storm water drain. A relook at the drainage system is much needed now,” he said. Ashwin Mahesh, an urban planning expert, says that a fundamental change is needed in the idea of transporting rainwater through stormwater drains. According to him, the design of the city storm water drains is wrong. “Water moves faster in a cylindrical space than rectangular space. It is scientifically proven. Except for the TenderSure roads in Bengaluru, we have rectangular drainages. Apart from transporting we should use socking pits to absorb water locally,” he said. On September 15, the Comptroller & Auditor General (CAG) has pulled up the agencies for inefficiency in identifying and managing storm water drains (SWDs) in the city. A performance audit report tabled in the legislative assembly on Wednesday mentioned lack of financial discipline, shoddy mapping of SWDs and tertiary drains, lack of documents related to various works taken up, and failure to clear lake and SWD encroachments. “There were discrepancies between the figures exhibited in the budget estimates and actual expenditure recorded in the cash book. This indicated the lack of reconciliation mechanism and correct reporting of expenditure, and exposes the financial indiscipline reigning in BBMP,” the report said. It also added that out of the 1,988 encroachments identified by BBMP, 1,225 were declared to be removed. However, evictions were incomplete and did not improve the condition of drains. Bengaluru’s storm water drain network is over 850km. While it’s supposed to channel storm water during the rains and be empty the rest of the year, the reality is different, with the drains filled with sewage and garbage, says Naresh Narasimhan, architect, and urban activist. “I’m also beginning to think there is an intellectual vacuum in the government. There are urban experts, but they are not in governance,” he said. BBMP in response said that under the K-100, the storm water drains are in the process of getting a facelift as part of a ₹160-crore ‘Citizens Water Way Project’. The project, with a deadline of 10 months, has been envisaged to establish the major drain as a waterway and ecological corridor, and was taken up on the lines of the ‘Sabarmati River Waterfront’ project in Gujarat, said a statement from BBMP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/amid-flooding-experts-seek-drainage-overhaul-in-bengaluru-101635014992743.html
24-10-2021||Bangalore||Network of informers fuels moral policing in Karnataka||A group of men charged towards a couple sitting in Mudipu on the outskirts of Mangaluru on February 3. The men belonging to Hindu Jagran Vedike threw a barrage of questions at them asking for their identity cards. The one thing they wanted to know was the couple’s religion. They began heckling the couple after they learned that the boy was a Muslim and the girl was a Hindu. Even though the couple fought back but the mob attacked them with helmets and handed them over to the police. The police eventually released them. It was later found that a local shopkeeper had given the right-wing mob the tip-off about the couple. Karnataka chief minister’s recent statements that appeared to justify incidents of moral policing had kicked off a controversy. On October 13, CM Basavaraj Bommai had said, “Youngsters should watch their actions to ensure it does not hurt sentiments of the society.” “There are several sentiments in the society. Those emotions should not be affected, and such should be the behaviour. When such emotions are hurt, there is likely to be an action and reaction,” Bommai told reporters in Mangaluru, about 350 km from Bengaluru. Reacting to the CM’s remark, a statement endorsed by 35 human rights activists and organizations stated that the justification of moral policing by the chief minister sends out a “dangerous message”. The police in coastal districts say they are often caught between the right-wing groups and the activists. The shopkeeper who tipped off the couple on Mudipu is part of a larger network of informants, which police admit is often stronger than that of the police department. A senior officer, who was earlier posted in coastal Karnataka and now posted in Bengaluru, said that mobile numbers of the right-wing groups are easily available. “It often takes hours before the police get to know about any incident. But during this time, these groups mobilize, attack, and in some cases leave before the police arrive. Nowadays, they don’t leave, but they wait till the police come,” said the officer. He added that the communal divide in coastal Karnataka has been fueling this network. From autorickshaw drivers to shopkeepers to schoolteachers, these informants are everywhere. “The best way to explain it is that the entire Mangaluru city is under a contact watch by these men. If they see any couples or a group of students, the information is passed on. There have been many cases where Hindu couples were heckled, but only (cases involving) interfaith couples get reported,” he added. As per records of Karnataka Communal Harmony, a Mangaluru-based organization that focuses on communal violence in the region, there have been 1,288 instances of communal violence including moral policing, cattle vigilantism, and hate speech since 2010. Among these, at least 322 instances of moral policing by vigilantes. “Interfaith couples are always attacked by a group of people and never an individual. They are forced to call their parents and their videos are recorded. After these attacks, messages announcing a raid are sent out of social media. All the attacks are well-coordinated.” Informants spread across the city provide tip-offs on interfaith couples and their movements. “Hindu right-wing groups also have a strong following among auto-rickshaw drivers and employees of private bus operators in the city. They don’t do it for monetary reasons, but they believe in concepts like love jihad,” said Vidya Dinkar, a Mangaluru-based activist. Dinker claims that even though police claim they are unable to stop these attacks, there have been instances of the police telling couples from different communities not to be seen in public together. “The sense of flawed morality and communalism remains within the police department itself. This is one of the reasons why many don’t file a police complaint. But the recent case (attack on Thursday) the girl stood her ground to get the complaint,” she said. Another group of informants is employees of security agencies (private security guards) across the city, some of whom are members of right-wing parties. An activist in the city, who didn’t want to be named, said that a security agency, Eshwari Manpower Solutions, which provides security to prominent commercial establishments in the city including malls, is run by a leader of the Bajarang Dal, Sharan Pumpwell. “Once Pumpwell’s firm is in charge of the establishment, there will not be an attack on the mall, like the pub attack that happened years ago. So, the fear created using these attacks is used to get business as well,” alleged the activist. Pumpwell said that his business and politics are separate from each other. Talking about the instances of moral policing involving his group’s members, Pumpwell said: “We are only protecting our sisters from those who are trying to convert them in the name of love. You must have heard about how girls are sent to ISIS. We don’t want it to happen here. We don’t take the law into our hands. We simply hand them over (to the police); it is the police’s job to investigate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/network-of-informers-fuels-moral-policing-in-karnataka-101635014990780.html
24-10-2021||Pune||2011 double murder could be at the root of Uruli-Kanchan shootout||PUNE An old fight over sand trade is suspected to be the cause of the firing and subsequent murders of two rival gang members in Uruli Kanchan in Pune on Friday night. While there are no arrests in the two separate cases registered, the police have theories about what led to the shootout.The two deceased have been identified as Swagat Bapu Khaire and Santosh Jagtap. The two bodyguards of Jagtap were also severely injured in the shootout.“In 2011, there was a murder in Rahu village of Daund in which two Sonawane brothers were killed. That rivalry was between two groups of sand miners. Now neither of the groups are into sand mining, but the fight is on, that is our suspicion. The rivalry seems to be long-standing,” said senior police inspector Rajendra Mokashi of Lonikalbhor police station.Two people who were hired to protect Jagtap were also injured in the shootout. The incident happened at Hotel Sonai in Uruli Kanchan where Jagtap had come. Khaire arrived there with at least three others and opened fire.“One of the bodyguards has a bullet wound on his neck, and the other has a bullet wound on his back. They are both out of danger but in the ICU, as per the doctors. We will know more after further investigation,” said Mokashi.Both the deceased men have a history of body offences, including murder, attempted murder and other violence, and both are facing charges under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/2011-double-murder-could-be-at-the-root-of-uruli-kanchan-shootout-101635014810946.html

24-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi air quality to improve as IMD predicts light rain on Sunday||Delhi may look forward to improved air quality on Sunday with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasting moderate rain over the city and a change in the wind direction.IMD officials said that under the impact of a western disturbance heavy rain and hailstorms were reported on Saturday from parts of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. The western disturbance is also likely to cause moderate to light rains in parts of Delhi on Sunday, which is expected to improve the city’s air quality further, IMD scientists said.A western disturbance is an extratropical storm originating in the Mediterranean region that brings sudden winter rain to the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent.According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data on Saturday, Delhi’s overall air quality index (AQI) was 173, in the ‘moderate’ category. This was only marginally higher than Friday’s 170, also in the ‘moderate’ zone.“The air quality is likely to improve over Sunday and Monday. The reduction in pollution levels has already started. Since the winds blowing into Delhi is from the southeast direction, the impact of stubble fires in Delhi’s pollution will be negligible—around 1-2%,” said VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment and research department.Soni, however, warned that the impact of weather conditions will only be temporary, and from October 25 when the wind direction changes back to north-westerly, pollution levels will start rising again. The north-westerlies bring in highly polluting particulate matter from the stubble fires in the neighbouring Haryana and Punjab.“Pollution levels will start rising again after October 25, but the AQI will remain in the moderate range,” Soni said.The passing of the western disturbance also resulted in a marginal increase in the temperatures in the national capital. On Saturday, the maximum temperature at the Safdarjung weather station, considered the representative for the entire city, was 32.8 degrees Celsius, a notch above the season’s normal. The minimum temperature was 18.4 degrees Celsius, two degrees above what is considered normal for this time of the year.At Palam, the maximum temperature was 32 degrees Celsius, and the minimum temperature was 20.6 degrees Celsius, three degrees above normal.“There are chances of moderate to light rain in parts of Delhi on Sunday. While the temperature over the weekend has remained slightly higher because of the western disturbance, mercury levels will start dropping from next week,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change) at Skymet Weather Services.After this year’s first ‘good’ air day on Monday, followed by ‘satisfactory’ air on Tuesday, the air quality quickly rebounded sharply into the poor zone on Wednesday. However, till then, the air quality has stayed in the moderate category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-air-quality-to-improve-as-imd-predicts-light-rain-on-sunday-101635009290631.html
24-10-2021||Delhi||Educating children highest form of patriotism, will develop society: Kejriwal||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday urged people to educate their children, calling it “the biggest step towards developing the society”. He also announced that the Delhi government will celebrate Valmiki Jayanti in a grand way annually from this year.Paying tributes to Maharshi Valmiki at an event hosted by the Delhi Sanskrit Academy at Thyagaraj Stadium, Kejriwal said, “The three lessons given by Maharishi Valmiki are respecting women, education, and compassion. I ask you all, not for votes or money, but to promise me that no matter what happens, you will provide your children with the best standard of education possible: this is the highest form of patriotism right now. If all our children flourish, so will the country.”Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, social welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam, deputy speaker of Delhi Legislative Assembly Rakhi Birla and several other dignitaries also attended the event.Kejriwal said the event will be an annual affair in Delhi. “Today a very healthy tradition is being commenced here. Up until last year, Valmiki Prakatotsav was celebrated well within the communities. However, this is the first time the Delhi government has involved all the people of Delhi and eminent individuals at such a grand scale to come together to commemorate the works of Maharishi Valmiki. And this will continue for years to come,” said Kejriwal.Maharishi Valmiki is worshipped by sections of the Dalit community. The call to hold celebrations is interesting because Kejriwal often commences Aam Aadmi Party’s campaigns ahead of polls from a Valmiki Temple on Mandir Marg in the national capital.Assembly elections are due in many states next year, including Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, and AAP is looking to strengthen its base outside Delhi by launching poll campaigns in some of these states.The chief minister also felicitated 22 meritorious students who studied in Delhi government’s schools. “Till now, financial obstacles were holding back many families from educating their children. Private schools were expensive and government schools were in a sad state. The 22 students that have been recognised today have all studied from government schools, proving the enhanced standard in these schools and making education a lot more accessible as compared to the exorbitant fees charged by public schools. Do not make your children work, educate them instead. Encourage them as much as possible,” he said.Kejriwal said his government not only ensured free coaching after Class 12, but also provided a loan of ₹10 lakh for higher education. The government also bears the cost if any student wants to pursue doctorate or other courses from any foreign university, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/educating-children-the-highest-form-of-patriotism-will-develop-society-kejriwal-101635009112307.html

Though DU has around 70,000 sanctioned UG seats, its admission policy dictates that colleges must admit all students clearing the announced cut-offs, thereby increasing the total intake in many courses.The university is expected to release a special cut-off on Monday, subject to the availability of seats in colleges, for those students who had the required percentage as per the three cut-offs but could not take admission due to any reason.A member of the admissions committee also said that the university website would not allow for cancellation of admission till the special cut-off process is over.“The special cut-off is strictly for those students who had the eligible scores as per the first three lists but could not take admission due to any reason or withdrew their application. But this will be subject to availability of seats in the college. The cancellation process has been put on hold so that there is no movement of students in between different colleges,” the official said.Eligible candidates can take admission under the special cut-off between October 26 and 27 and pay their fee by October 29. The fourth cut-off will be declared on October 30.Of the 11 undergraduate courses that announced 100% cutoff in the first list this year, seven will be closed in the fourth cut-off list, college officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/after-three-cut-offs-over-60-000-seats-in-du-taken-101635008871176.html
24-10-2021||Delhi||Kejriwal says Capital nearly winning the battle against dengue||Amid a surge in dengue cases in the city, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday declared that the national capital was “close to winning the battle” against the vector borne disease, as he urged residents to take part in the Delhi government’s “10 Hafte, 10 Baje, 10 Minute” campaign to combat the infection.“Delhi is now very close to winning the battle against dengue. Like previous weeks, this Sunday too, at 10 am, let us all spend 10 minutes, inspecting our homes and surrounding areas, for any sign of stagnant water. If you do find such water, drain it, replace it or cover with a small layer of oil. Together, let us all make Delhi dengue-free,” said a statement issued by the chief minister’s office which quoted him.The chief minister’s assertion comes amid a surge in dengue cases in the last two weeks, and the first death due to it was reported on Monday.Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led municipal corporations in Delhi for not preparing in a timely manner to control vector-borne diseases in the city.Addressing a press conference, AAP senior leader and Kalkaji MLA Atishi said the MCDs did not maintain adequate stocks of medicines to treat such diseases or arrange enough staff for the same.“There are 70% vacancies in the anti-malaria department of the MCD. Almost no fogging is taking place and MCDs’ performance in carrying out door-to-door checks or medicine administration is majorly lacking. In the last two days, shocking facts have been revealed concerning the North MCD. North MCD lacks the staff and also do not even possess the medicines and chemicals required to carry out the steps to counter dengue-malaria,” Atishi said.On October 23, HT, citing a status report from the North MCD, reported that the civic body is running abysmally low on larvicide and insecticides needed to control vector populations.The Delhi BJP said that due to the hard work and cooperation of municipal domestic breeding checkers and fogging staff, dengue and malaria spread is well under control.“The truth is that all zonal offices of North MCD have 2-3 weeks of fogging and sprinkling medicines stock and hospitals including Hindu Rao have proper stock of medicines. Around 2,900 DBC workers are working hard to check and control mosquito breeding. AAP’s Atishi is repeatedly trying to put fear in the minds of people by spreading wrong information through her politically biased statements,” said Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor.“If Atishi still feels that MCDs are lacking in preparation, then she should ask CM Arvind Kejriwal to provide additional medicines stock to MCDs instead of splashing public money on his photo hoardings,” the BJP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-says-capital-nearly-winning-the-battle-against-dengue-101635008634855.html

Besides, 30 others, including 16 policemen, were injured in brick batting that ensued after the incident, said police.The police firing took place at the Moriyawan, around 44 kilometres South-East of the state capital, where Panchayat election is scheduled on October 24. The body of the victim was lifted from the village Saturday morning when police and political leaders reached the spot and assured the locals of action against the culprits.Patna DM Chandrasekhar Singh has ordered magisterial inquiry into the incident and asked the Masaurhi SDO and SDPO to submit joint reports within 24 hours.According to the DM, the role of Masaurhi circle inspector is under scanner and senior officials are probing the matter. “The district administration will provide ex-gratia to the next to kin of the deceased as per rules. Post-mortem has been conducted with videography in presence of a magistrate,” said the DM, adding that police fired in the air in self-defence and it was not aimed at the crowd.The villagers, however, alleged that one Rohit Choudhary, professionally an electrician, who was on his way to village, was hit by a bullet and died. Sita Paswan, 52, said that when she came from outside the village, police thrashed her mercilessly and broke her left hand.Patna SSP Upendra Sharma said that 16 policemen sustained injuries and had to fire in self defence, which hit some people. “Impartial probe would be conducted into the incident from all angles. One FIR will lodge on police statement, while another will be lodged by the victims. It is a matter of investigation as to why the police had to open fire,” he added.The SSP said that the police had gone to stop campaigning beyond the permissible time. “During that time, there was a scuffle to stop the blaring loudspeaker. It soon turned into stone pelting. The entire matter is being probed and the culprits will not be spared,” he added.The villagers alleged that police resorted to lathi-charge around 7pm when they assembled near a temple. “The police team led by circle inspector Ram Kumar raided the village fourth time within three days and forced them to cast their vote in favour of former mukhia Ranjan Yadav,” they added.Another villager Devanti Devi said that the incident took place when present mukhia Suresh Sao campaigned in the village after 6pm with a music system. Suddenly a contingent of police forces reached the village and started lathi-charge. Irate over the police action, villagers pelted stones on the police.An eyewitness to the incident, Shashi Kumar, said first the police lathi charged the villagers and when the villagers retaliated by hurling stones, the police opened fire on them.

Delhi has now become the 18th state or Union Territory to surpass the 20-million figure for Covid-19 jabs, an important landmark for the city in its fight to overcome the pandemic, even as daily vaccinations have slowed down over the past month.As of 9.30pm on Saturday, according the Centre’s CoWIN dashboard, Delhi administered 20,046,547 doses. Delhi hit the 20-million milestone two days after the country crossed the much-awaited 1 billion mark in Covid-19 vaccinations -- just over nine months after the country began a massive inoculation programme to protect all its adults against Covid-19.Of the 20 million doses so far, over 5 million have taken the first jab, and 7.1 million have been fully vaccinated. Delhi has an adult population of around 15 million, according to January 2021 electoral data.Of the shots administered so far in Delhi, according to the Centre’s CoWIN dashboard, the maximum have been recorded in the north-west district with 2,396,252 shots, with the south-west district a close second at 2,314,641 jabs. The least doses were administered in the north-east district at 1,255,828.Of the total 20 million doses, more than 11 million beneficiaries were male and over 8 million were females, according to the data. However, the pace of vaccination in the national capital has slowed down this month, with only just over 75,500 vaccines being administered a day on average over the last seven days. Last month, Delhi had seen over 200,000 doses being administered a day on a few occasions. To be sure, Delhi is not an outlying region to have witnessed such a drop – it is visible at the national level as well. The seven-day average of daily vaccinations in India, which touched a peak of 9.7 million for the week ending September 23, has dropped nearly 60% in the past week. Since September-end Delhi has also seen more second jabs being administered as compared to the first dose. Of the eligible population, 47% have completed their immunisation with both doses, according to data from the government’s CoWIN portal. In a statement, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office said on Friday evening said, “As a responsible and sensitive, the Kejriwal government rapidly working on vaccinating the entire population of Delhi and will leave no one behind in this drive. The Delhi government is about to touch the two-crore [20 million] mark thanks to our highly motivated front line workers and our rigorous infrastructure, which helped accelerate our efforts even when we had low vaccine stocks.”Last week, the Centre had urged states and union territories to focus on increasing the coverage of the second dose of the vaccine. Dr Suneela Garg, professor in the department of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College, said, “There is a need to further increase the coverage of second dose in Delhi, especially during the festive season to prevent a surge after it. There is already an uptick in cases in Bengal after pooja. Technically, there is a need to reduce the gap between the two doses of Covishield to ideally eight weeks; now we have enough vaccine supply. Also, we need to remember Delhi has a huge floating population of people from the neighbouring states and the vaccine coverage in Uttar Pradesh is lower. Delhi can get cases from neighbouring states.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/20-million-in-delhi-now-have-taken-at-least-one-covid-19-shot-101635007490458.html
24-10-2021||Pune||Forget long queues, Covid vaccination centres in Pune now seeing empty chairs||PUNE: Till June and July this year, most inoculation centres in the city would often run into a “no doses left” situation as demand was high amidst short supply of vaccines. Now however, the situation has reversed so much so that despite special vaccination drives undertaken by the administration for easy access to vaccines, government centres reported nearly five lakh surplus doses as of Saturday, October 23. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, deputy director of health services, Pune circle, said, “As of now, the district has about five lakh vaccine doses in storehouses. We hope to vaccinate about 100% of the population with the first dose by the end of this month and 75% of the population with the second dose. Despite having surplus doses available and multiple vaccination centres running across the district, there are people who are hesitant to take the second dose and so we are hoping that if someone gets vaccinated this month with their first dose, going by the 84 days’ mandatory gap between the two doses, the person would get the second dose by February. So, the district would be fully immunised by February.”Dr Deshmukh said that the reason there are no takers for the second dose although it is mandatory to take the second jab to be declared as fully immunised is hesitation on the people’s part and declining fear among them about Covid-19, now that the number of new cases and deaths due to the infection has come down drastically.On Saturday, Pune city’s Covid-19 vaccination count went above the 5 million mark. Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “The fact that the city of Pune has crossed the 50 lakh doses mark is satisfactory and is reassuring for all. Since the commencement of vaccination, several drives have been conducted through various means, including centres and special drives. I would like to thank the civic staff, administration and the health department and also beneficiaries.”“Although the city had a tough time inoculating its population during the second wave, the situation began to change post-August as private hospitals joined in the drive. As a result, a heavy crowd at government vaccination centres chose to visit private ones, reducing the burden on public health machinery. By September, when the state received close to 20 million doses, Pune expedited the vaccination drive. The long queues then were replaced by empty chairs; the ‘no doses left’ boards by doses available; and once a busy health staff now waiting for people to get vaccinated,” he said.“Till July, our leaves were cancelled and work hours too were increased. But as the situation changed, we are all doing eight-hour regular duty, and there is no rush mainly because people do not seem to have a sense of urgency to get the second dose quickly after the second wave waned, said a 30-year-old nurse at Satara road-based hospital.As of Saturday - over 23,000 healthcare workers; 40,000 frontline workers; over 300,000 senior citizens; and 500,000 citizens in the 45 to 60 age group – are yet to take their second dose. Not only have all of them taken their first dose, they have also completed the mandatory 84 days after the first dose. Further, those who got infected after taking their first dose in the months of May, June or July have completed the mandatory three-month period as well. A total 884,957 people who have taken their first dose are still to take their second dose. To make access easier for people, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has even allowed housing societies to apply for mobile vaccine vans that help facilitate vaccination at one’s doorstep. Dr Suryakant Devkar, PMC immunisation officer, said, “We have surplus vaccines and so, we have increased the number of centres to make it easier for people to get the vaccine closest to their homes. Time and again, health experts and doctors have said that it is important to take both the shots. The side effects if any during the first shot are unlikely to repeat themselves after the second shot.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/forget-long-queues-covid-vaccination-centres-in-pune-now-seeing-empty-chairs-101635004130425.html

Stating this on Saturday, a state government official said that as on October 22, 210 students have recovered and rest are still in home isolation. On Saturday, 23 students were tested positive in Kangra, eight each in Una and Hamirpur, five in Bilaspur two in Mandi and one in Kullu. National Health Mission state director Hemraj Bairwa said only one school girl needed hospitalisation due to Covid-19 infection which showed that children have a better immunity against the virus. The 13-year-old student of Government Senior Secondary School at Saleti in Rakkar tehsil of Kangra district died of the contagion on Thursday. A maximum number of 143 students caught the infection in schools of Hamirpur district followed by 130 in Kangra, 74 in Una, 21 in Shimla, 22 in Mandi, 14 in Kinnaur, seven each in Bilaspur and Kullu, four in Solan and one in Lahaul-Spiti district, the official said. 61% kids have antibodies In the recent sero survey, 61% children in the age group of 10-17 years were found to have antibodies against coronavirus. Bairwa said that the death of the girl student had become a cause of concern. The district authorities said the girl had not been attending school since October 12. He said the family did not seek proper medical assistance until her condition deteriorated. She was admitted to the Government Medical College in Hamirpur where she died. He said parents should seek medical help immediately if the child faces difficulty in breathing or the oxygen level dips. Kangra chief medical officer Dr Gurdarshan Gupta said 12 more students had tested positive for Covid-19 in the same school on Friday. He said directions have been issued to collect samples of students from nearby schools also. Health authorities keeping watch Bairwa said the health authorities are keeping a watch on the situation as the number of infections among school students is on the rise. The government may take a decision to close schools again if the situation doesn’t improve. The state government had reopened schools for Classes 9-12 from September 27, while it is considering calling students of junior classes after Diwali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-covid-cases-on-rise-418-students-test-positive-since-schools-reopened-101634983189029.html

Currently there is no safety risk to people on shore, however the situation will continue to be monitored," the agency said.Video obtained by Reuters showed fire cascading down from the deck of the ship into the water.The Zim Kingston reported on Friday that it had encountered rough weather west of the Strait of Juan de Fuca."This is extremely concerning. The ship and containers are very close to Victoria, BC, and a big storm is forecast to hit tonight. We ... are worried this may be yet another environmental disaster," said David Boudinot, president of Surfrider Foundation Canada, an environmental organization.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fire-breaks-out-on-cargo-ship-containers-off-british-columbia-101635088415668.html

The power pylon was destructed in a bomb blast, Xinhua reported citing the Afghan national power company’s statement. Terrorist group Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for the explosion.“The Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS) personnel completed the restoration of a destroyed electricity tower in Qala-e-Muradbig area of Kabul province at midday on Sunday…The power supply is now back to normal,” the company’s statement read.The explosion took place in a region located on the northern outskirts of Afghanistan’s Kabul. The destruction of the power pylon cut the main power supply line to Kabul, thereby leaving the city in complete darkness. Additionally, Afghanistan has been facing power shortages for some time now, and has imported electricity from multiple neighbouring nations, including Tajikistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, among others, Xinhua reported. Owing to the blast, the supply line distributing imported electricity to Kabul was cut.Meanwhile, the Taliban said that they have arrested three people in the power pylon blast case so far.This latest attack is among several similar ones that the Islamic State has been carrying out in Afghanistan since the country was recaptured by the Taliban from the United States after two decades. The Islamic State also claimed responsibility for a suicide bomb blast of a Shiite Mosque in Kandahar, which took the lives of 60 people. The terrorist group later issued a threat to Shia Muslims as well, saying that they will be targeted everywhere – from their homes to centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/power-supply-restored-in-afghanistan-after-isil-bomb-blast-damaged-main-line-101635089350240.html

Most of the infections that spread in nearly 11 provinces since October 17 have been found to be due to cross-region tourism activities.Deputy Director of the NHC, Wu Liangyou said that the epidemiological investigations of the infections, discovered 106 out of 133 infections to be from tourism-related activities.According to the newspaper, the official said that the increase in the number of cases is going to increase as the screening continues.The official also urged the public to take the booster shots of the Covid-19 vaccines to reduce the risks of the resurgence of cases, reported Global Times.Meanwhile, Gansu, China's Northwest province, has announced the suspension of all tourism activities after a surge in the Covid-19 cases in the region, reported local media.All tourists in Lanzhou -- where most Covid-19 cases in the province were reported -- required to stay in wherever place they were and be quarantined, said Global Times Gansu registered -- from October 18 to Saturday night -- a total of 41 confirmed cases, of which 30 are from Lanzhou, seven from Zhangye, two from Jiayu Pass, one from Tianshui, and one from Longnan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-health-commission-anticipates-surge-in-covid-19-cases-triggered-by-delta-variant-101635078464343.html
24-10-2021||World||US supported by India is inimical to CPEC: Pakistan PM’s aide||The Chief of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) Authority has accused the United States of sabotaging the multi-billion dollar project, reported news agency PTI. The ambitious CPEC was launched in 2015 and is considered the economic lifeline of Pakistan.“From the point of view of the emerging geo-strategic situation, one thing is clear: the United States supported by India is inimical to CPEC. It will not let it succeed. That’s where we have to take a position,” PTI quoted Khalid Mansoor as saying while addressing the CPEC Summit at the Institute of Business Administration in Karachi on Saturday. Mansoor is the Special Assistant to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on CPEC affairs.The PM's aide further said the United States and India continue to “make attempts to manoeuvre Pakistan out of” China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) — a global infrastructure development plan — under which the Chinese government has been investing heavily in about 70 countries, PTI reported, quoting a report in the Dawn newspaper.“There’s no way Pakistan will forgo any of its benefits. It has more than once burnt its fingers in (the Western) alliance in the past,” he said, adding that their attempts to dilute China’s strategic influence in the region will fail. Mansoor said the Western powers view the CPEC as a symbol of China’s political ambition.“That’s the reason CPEC is seen suspiciously by both the United States and Europe… they view CEPC more as a move by China to expand its political, strategic and business influence,” Mansoor said, noting that China has been able to allay that apprehension “to a great extent”.The United States is now “taking stock of the economic and political consequences” of withdrawing from the region, he reasoned.“I had a detailed discussion with the people in the American embassy. I told them CPEC is available for them as well. They have also expressed their wish that they would like to develop some kind of involvement and see how it can be beneficial for both countries,” he said.Mansoor also stated that Islamabad is seeking the expansion of the CPEC to Afghanistan, adding there has been a “deep interest” in developing economic connectivity between Afghanistan and Pakistan.According to Western think tanks, the CPEC is an economic trap that has already resulted in bloated public debt levels alongside disproportionately high Chinese influence in Pakistan’s economy, the Dawn newspaper further said.The CEPC aims to connect western China with the Gwadar seaport in southwestern Pakistan through a network of roads, railways and other projects of infrastructure and development. Islamabad is the seventh largest recipient of Chinese overseas development financing with 71 projects worth USD 27.3 billion currently underway as part of the CPEC.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supported-by-india-is-inimical-to-cpec-pakistan-pm-s-aide-101635070629409.html
24-10-2021||World||Singapore PM Lee rules out indefinite Covid-19 lockdown||Singapore cannot go into an indefinite lockdown and stand still, but also cannot “simply let go and let things rip”, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said."We have to travel this road to get to living safely with Covid-19. We want to get there with as few casualties as possible,” Lee said in a Facebook post on Saturday.Singapore’s multi-ministry task force announced on Saturday a slew of measures for the effective opening up of the affluent city-state.These include requiring vaccination for all staff returning to the workplace from Jan 1, 2022, as well as adding China's Sinovac to the national vaccination programme and expanding the home recovery scheme to certain pregnant women, The Straits Times newspaper reported.The task force is co-chaired by Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong and Health Minister Ong Ye Kung.In his post, Lee highlighted the weekly infection growth rate -- the ratio of community cases in the past week over the week before.Two weeks ago, this figure was 1.5, meaning that cases were doubling roughly every fortnight.It now stands at 1.15, meaning that cases are growing 15 per cent each week. This works out to case numbers doubling about every month.If the ratio drops below one and Singapore's hospital and intensive care unit situations remain stable, some measures can be eased, Lee said."Many of you have written to express your frustrations about the restrictions, while others have voiced concerns that we are opening up too fast!" he noted."I fully understand how you feel. It has been a long journey, and the continuing uncertainty and disruption is hard on all of us." Certain sectors, such as the food and beverage industry, have had an exceptionally tough time, the Prime Minister explained.He urged everyone to continue doing their part and exercise social responsibility as Singapore works towards living safely with the virus.This includes taking vaccinations or booster doses when offered, as they reduce an individual's chances of getting seriously ill, he said.“Let's continue to stay safe and keep working together,” Lee added.The Health Ministry reported 3,598 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday, which includes 790 from migrant workers' dormitories, and six deaths from complications due to the virus. Three hundred people have died from coronavirus linked complications while 169,261 infections have been reported since the virus broke here last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-pm-lee-rules-out-indefinite-covid-19-lockdown-101635066162716.html

24-10-2021||World||Uzbekistan votes in presidential polls; Afghanistan, economy key issues||Voters across Uzbekistan on Sunday were casting their ballots in a presidential election in which the situation in Afghanistan and the need for greater connectivity to boost development figured in the low-key campaign. Incumbent President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, 64, is widely anticipated to win a second term in the absence of any real opposition from the four other parties that are in the fray. Voting across the Central Asian country of some 36 million people began at 8 am local time and will continue until 8 pm. Voting percentage at about 12 noon local time was 12.3%, as per official data. As part of the campaign, meetings and roundtables were organised in Tashkent to discuss pressing issues such as economic recovery in the post-pandemic era and the situation in Afghanistan. With some 800,000 first-time voters among the 19 million registered voters, many youngsters actively participated in the roundtables that were joined by several ministers.Mirziyoyev came to power in 2016 after the death of his mentor, Islam Karimov, Uzbekistan’s first post-independence president who ruled the country for 27 years. A second term for Mirziyoyev will allow him to deepen his reform campaign and further open up Uzbekistan to foreign trade and investment. Mirziyoyev has also struck a balance in his country’s relations with Russia and the West, while pushing forward with connectivity projects with South Asia. Also Read: Islamic State, Al-Qaeda have increased online propaganda, warns FATFDuring a virtual summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 11 last year, Mirziyoyev had proposed that Uzbekistan, India and Iran should hold a trilateral dialogue to promote connectivity through Chabahar port. India responded with alacrity to this suggestion and the first meeting of a trilateral working group was held just three days later. During the campaign, the situation in Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover in mid-August also came up for discussion, and senior Uzbek officials insisted that the war-torn country should not be isolated in view of its urgent humanitarian needs. The officials also called for the formation of a government in Kabul that includes all ethnic groups and is based on democratic principles. The officials also said Uzbekistan plans to diversify the landlocked country’s connectivity options to increase access to the ocean and large markets such as India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uzbekistan-votes-in-presidential-polls-afghanistan-economy-key-issues-101635058319209.html
24-10-2021||World||Voting underway for presidential election in Uzbekistan||Voting was underway in Central Asian Uzbekistan's presidential election Sunday, with incumbent Shavkat Mirziyoyev facing no real opposition but plenty of challenges as he bids to reform the ex-Soviet country and still maintain its authoritarian foundations.Mirziyoyev has been credited for launching what he calls a "New Uzbekistan", ending a decades-old system of forced labour and introducing limited media freedom.He came to power in 2016 after the death of his mentor, dictator Islam Karimov, who ruled Uzbekistan for 27 years.The new leader presided over an unprecedented boom in foreign tourism in the country that borders Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and counts China and Russia among its partners.But as his first term ends, the 64-year-old is struggling to counter impressions that his government is sliding back towards the habits of his long-reigning predecessor.The effects of the pandemic have also blunted his initial economic achievements, with unemployment rife amid sharp rises in living costs."We expect changes. For instance, salary increases -- our salaries are small and we don't always get them," said 20-year-old student Urazali Ergashev. He added that his mother, a teacher, often faced salary delays.Voting across the landlocked country of 34 million people began at 8:00 am local time (0300 GMT) and will last until 8:00 pm (1500 GMT).Prolonged isolation under Karimov meant that commodity-rich Uzbekistan fell well short of its economic potential for most of independence.It is against the founding president's brutal rule that the successes of Mirziyoyev's reforms have been judged.His public disavowal of torture and campaign to clean up mass forced labour in cotton fields -- where thousands of schoolchildren once toiled alongside their teachers -- gained international praise.But the last two years have seen a crackdown on dissent, rights groups said, particularly in internet freedoms that bloomed after 2016.Mirziyoyev has also sidestepped reforms that would allow competition to his rule.He faces four regime-loyal opponents plucked from parties in the rubber stamp parliament in his bid to secure a second five-year term.A would-be independent challenger, academic Khidirnazar Allakulov, fell at the first hurdle after failing to register a party that could nominate him.Human Rights Watch said this month that officials "harassed (Allakulov's) party supporters and interfered in their efforts to collect signatures for registration".Still, most Uzbeks interviewed by AFP in Tashkent said they were unconcerned by the lack of real choice on the ballot."When things are going well, why do we need so many choices?" asked pensioner Yakub Otazhanov."Let Mirziyoyev (get on with it)."Under his rule, Uzbekistan has strengthened traditional relations with Beijing and Moscow, while welcoming back international organisations and media outlets effectively banned under Karimov.But for many in the capital Tashkent, poverty rather than rights is the issue of the day."There are a lot of poor and homeless people.

24-10-2021||World||China adopts new land border law amid military impasse with India||China on Saturday passed a new law to strengthen land border protection amid the ongoing military tension along the disputed boundary with India, firming up the military-civilian role in defending the country’s borders.The legislation formalises combining the military defence of China’s land borders with improving social and economic development in border areas.It further strengthens the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) policy to work closely with civilians staying in border areas - for example, Tibetan villagers living along the border with India, Bhutan and Nepal - to work as the first line of defence.Long-standing border disputes should be resolved through negotiations, the new law adds, according to Chinese official media.India and China have been locked in a border row for 17 months, a phase that witnessed the deadly skirmish in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on June 15, 2020 when troops from both sides fought for hours with iron rods, clubs covered with barbed wire and rocks.Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in the clash, the first fatalities on the Line of Actual Control since 1975; four Chinese soldiers were killed and one was injured as well.China’s parliament, the National People’s Congress (NPC) on Saturday voted to adopt the “…new law on the protection and exploitation of the country’s land border areas, which will take effect on January 1, 2022”, the news agency Xinhua reported.The law will now govern how China guards its 22,000-km (13,670-mile) land border shared with 14 countries, including Russia, nuclear-capable North Korea and Mongolia besides India and Bhutan - two countries Beijing has land border disputes with.The state, the law says: “…shall take measures to safeguard territorial integrity and land boundaries and guard against and combat any act that undermines territorial sovereignty and land boundaries.”The law, which has 62 articles, stipulates that the state “…shall take measures to safeguard territorial integrity and land boundaries and guard against and combat any act that undermines territorial sovereignty and land boundaries”, it says.The law stipulates that the state shall take measures to “…strengthen border defence, support economic and social development as well as opening-up in border areas, improve public services and infrastructure in such areas, encourage and support people’s life and work there, and promote coordination between border defence and social, economic development in border areas”.The law “stipulates the relevant responsibilities” of the PLA, the armed militia, and local governments to support and coordinate border defence and management of areas at the border and the building of border infrastructure.Article 7 says: “Under the leadership of the Central Military Commission, relevant military organs shall organise, guide and coordinate the defence and control of land borders, maintain social stability, handle emergencies and cooperate in border defence and other related work.”The law laid out that the state has to nurture border towns and improve their overall “supporting capacity”.China has already built hundreds of border villages - by some counts more than 600 - across the country’s borders in Tibet.Article 43 of the law says: “The state supports the construction of border towns, improves the system of border towns, improves the functions of border towns and strengthens the construction of supporting capacity.”On the issue of resolving border disputes, the law says: “The state shall, following the principle of equality, mutual trust, and friendly consultation, handle land border related-affairs with neighbouring countries through negotiations to properly resolve disputes and longstanding border issues.”Gao Jinlu, from the foreign affairs committee of the NPC was quoted as saying by state media, that the land border law establishes a standardised legal framework for managing China’s land border affairs.President Xi Jinping signed orders to promulgate the law.Li Zhanshu, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, presided over the closing meeting of the 31st session of the 13th NPC Standing Committee, which ran from Tuesday to Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-adopts-new-land-border-law-amid-military-impasse-with-india-101635050098420.html

24-10-2021||World||Picasso artworks in Las Vegas fetch more than $100 million||Eleven Picasso paintings and other works that helped turn Las Vegas into an unlikely destination for art were sold at auction on Saturday for more than $100 million.The Sotheby's auction was held at the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas, where the works had been on display for years and took place two days before the 140th birthday of the Spanish artist on Oct. 25.Five of the paintings had hung on the walls of the Bellagio's fine dining restaurant, Picasso. The restaurant will continue to display 12 other Picasso works.The highest price was fetched by the 1938 painting "Femme au beret rouge-orange" of Picasso's lover and muse Marie-Therese Walter, which sold for $40.5 million, some $10 million over the high pre-sale estimate.The large-scale portraits "Homme et Enfant" and "Buste d'homme" sold for $24.4 million and $9.5 million respectively, while smaller works on ceramic, like "Le Dejeuner sur l'herbe" which sold for $2.1 million, went for three or four times their pre-sale estimate.The buyers' names were not disclosed.Saturday's sale was part of a bid by casino and hotel group MGM Resorts to further diversify its vast collection to include more art from women, people of color and emerging nations as well as from LGBTQ artists and artists with disabilities.American museums and art galleries have been working to broaden their collections in the wake of the widespread cultural reckoning in 2020 over racism at all levels of U.S. society.A 2019 Public Library of Science study of 18 leading US museums found that 85% of the artists on display are white and 87 per cent are men.The MGM Resorts Fine Arts Collection boasts about 900 works by 200 artists, including modern pieces by Bob Dylan and David Hockney. It was started more than 20 years ago by Steve Wynn, former owner of the Bellagio and former chief executive of Wynn Resorts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/picasso-artworks-in-las-vegas-fetch-more-than-100-million-101635043719343.html

The FO statement read: “No such understanding was in place.”However, it added: "Pakistan and the US have long-standing cooperation on regional security and counter-terrorism and the two sides remain engaged in regular consultations."CNN News had reported quoting three sources familiar with the details of a classified briefing with members of the US Congress that took place on Friday that the US was nearing an agreement with Pakistan for use of its airspace to conduct operations in Afghanistan.The Pakistan Opposition parties had also demanded the government to give an explanation on the reports that Pakistan had allowed the US military to use its airspace.Earlier, Prime Minister Imran Khan in an interview had categorically said that Pakistan would "absolutely not" allow any bases and use of its territory for any sort of action inside Afghanistan."Absolutely not. There is no way we are going to allow any bases, any sort of action from Pakistani territory into Afghanistan. Absolutely not," Khan had told 'Axios on HBO' in an interview in June.The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan on August 15, two weeks before the US' complete troop withdrawal on August 31 after a costly two-decade war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-rejects-reports-of-deal-with-us-to-conduct-air-operations-in-afghanistan-101635040629907.html
24-10-2021||World||‘Otoniel’, Colombia's most-wanted drug lord, captured: Government||Colombia's most-wanted drug trafficker "Otoniel" has been captured, the government said Saturday, a major victory in the world's top cocaine exporter.Dairo Antonio Usuga, who headed the country's largest narco-trafficking gang known as the Gulf Clan, was captured near one of his main outposts in Necocli, near the border with Panama.Images released by the government showed the 50-year-old Otoniel in handcuffs and surrounded by soldiers."This is the hardest strike to drug trafficking in our country this century," president Ivan Duque said in a message, adding that the arrest was "only comparable to the fall of Pablo Escobar," the famed Colombian narco-trafficking kingpin.The United States had offered a $5 million bounty for information leading to the arrest of Otoniel, who is one of the most feared men in Colombia.Otoniel was indicted in the United States in 2009, and faces extradition proceedings to the country, where he would appear in the Southern District of New York federal court.The Colombian government blames the group -- financed mainly through drug trafficking, illegal mining and extortion -- for being one of the main drivers of the worst bout of nationwide violence since the signing of a peace pact with FARC guerillas in 2016.The Gulf Clan is present in almost 300 municipalities in the country, according to the independent think tank Indepaz.Life of violence Although Otoniel announced in 2017 he intended to reach an agreement to participate with the Colombian justice system, the government instead responded by deploying at least 1,000 soldiers to hunt him down.His Clan has been decimated recently by authorities with Otoniel forced to hide in the jungle and unable to use telephones, according to police.He took over the leadership of the Gulf Clan -- previously known as the Usuga Clan -- from his brother Juan de Dios, who was killed by police in 2012.Born to a poor family, Otoniel joined the Popular Liberation Army (EPL), a Marxist guerrilla group that demobilized in 1991.After laying down his arms, he later returned to fighting, joining far-right paramilitary groups.Many of these were demobilized in 2006 at the initiative of former right-wing president Alvaro Uribe's administration, but Otoniel decided to remain in the fight.Colombia is the world's top provider of cocaine, with the United States as its principal market, despite half a century of trying to clamp down on the drug trade.In remote areas where there is little government presence, criminal groups like the Gulf Clan, dissident FARC guerrillas and leftist ELN rebels fight bloody turf battles to control drug trafficking corridors and illegal mining operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/otoniel-colombia-s-most-wanted-drug-lord-captured-government-101635039887702.html
24-10-2021||World||After California wildfires, more than 10,000 ‘hazard trees’ to be removed||In the wake of California wildfires, upwards of 10,000 trees weakened by fires, drought, disease or age must be removed, work that will keep a nearby highway closed to visitors who seek the world's two largest sequoia trees.The hazard trees could potentially fall onto people and cars on the section of State Route 180 known as Generals Highway, or they could create barriers for emergency and fire response, the Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks said on Friday.The highway is closed due to the KNP Complex blaze, which was 60 per cent contained after burning 138 square miles (357 square kilometers) of the forest, and will remain blocked off to visitors after the fire is out while saw crews cut down trees and trim branches. Cooler weather has helped slow the flames and the area was expected to see rain starting Sunday.The highway connects Giant Forest, home to the General Sherman Tree, which is considered the world's largest by volume, and Grant Grove, home to the General Grant Tree, the second-largest tree in the world. The trees along the highway include sequoias, pine, and conifer trees, said fire spokeswoman Kimberly Caschalk.The KNP Complex has been burning since September 9, when lightning ignited two fires that later merged.Forest officials said earlier this month the fires may have killed hundreds of giant sequoias, but the full extent of the damage has not been determined.The fire's impact on giant sequoia groves was mixed. Most saw low- to medium-intensity fire behaviour that the sequoias have evolved to survive, and the most notable trees survived.Firefighters took extraordinary measures to protect the sequoias by wrapping fire-resistant material around the bases of some giants, raking and clearing vegetation around them, installing sprinklers, and dousing some with water or fire-retardant gel.On Friday, forest staff unwrapped the base of the General Sherman tree after danger from the fire had passed."We're confident that tree is relatively safe," Caschalk said.Drought in the West tied to climate change is making wildfires harder to fight. Scientists say climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years — meaning the rain and snow that does fall is likely to evaporate or absorb into the soil — and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.Recent storms have helped contain some of the nation's largest wildfires this year, including one that threatened the popular Lake Tahoe resort region this summer and is now 100 per cent contained after snow blanketed the western side of the blaze and rain dropped on the eastern side. But this week's storms won't end the drought that's plaguing California and the western United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-california-wildfires-around-10-000-hazard-trees-to-be-removed-101635038591749.html
24-10-2021||World||Obama warns of Republican threat to democracy in US battleground Virginia||Former US president Barack Obama urged voters Saturday to back the Democrat in a neck-and-neck state election touted as a test of the party's prospects in next year's midterm elections -- casting the Republican as a threat to democracy.Democrat Terry McAuliffe, who is vying for a second term as Virginia's governor, has seen his lead extinguished in recent polls and is in a dead heat with Republican Glenn Youngkin ahead of the November 2 vote.Obama told a cheering crowd of several hundred rapt supporters at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond that Youngkin would cut teaching jobs, restrict abortion access and back Donald Trump's fraudulent campaign to convince Americans that the last election was stolen from him by President Joe Biden."As far as I can tell, the big message of Terry's opponent is that he's a regular guy because he wears a fleece. And he's accusing schools of brainwashing our kids," Obama said,"He's also said he wanted to audit the voting machines used in the last presidential election again. Really? Encouraging the lies and conspiracy theories that we've had to live through all this time? And yeah, we're supposed to believe he's going to stand up for our democracy?"The McAuliffe camp fears turnout among supporters in an off-year election may be low and has brought in some of the party's heavy hitters in the final stretch, including First Lady Jill Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.Biden won Virginia by 10 points in 2020 and the last time Republicans won a statewide race there was 2009.But the McAuliffe-Youngkin battle has been tightening, with a survey released this week by Monmouth University showing the Democrat's earlier lead evaporating.A McAuliffe win would boost Washington Democrats' push for twin infrastructure and social welfare mega-bills that are the cornerstone of Biden's vision for remaking the economy.But a loss could spook moderates already nervous over the high price tag, which they are trying to chisel down from a combined total of almost $5 trillion to around $3 trillion.Party chiefs hope Obama, still the most popular Democrat on the national stage five years after leaving office, will galvanize Black voters, a key constituency in Virginia."I'm here today because I believe Virginia will make the right choice. I believe America, ultimately, will make the right choice," Obama told the crowd of a few hundred cheering supporters."I believe you right here in Virginia are going to show the rest of the country, and the world, that we're not going to indulge in our worst instincts. We're not going to go back to the past that did so much damage, we're going to move forward with people like Terry leading the way."The first genuinely competitive election since Biden took office is expected to be a harbinger of the national political landscape ahead of next year's midterm elections.Wedged between the Washington suburbs in northern Virginia, a Democratic stronghold, and the state's conservative south and southwest, Richmond could go either way.McAuliffe, 64, has tried to make the race a referendum on twice-impeached Trump.Youngkin, 10 years his junior, has focused on the fight over schools, with Republicans railing against mask mandates and running ads showing McAuliffe saying he doesn't want parents involved in education.In a delicate high-wire act, Youngkin has been trying to conjure the spirit of Trump while not specifically endorsing his false election fraud claims that are backed by the majority of Republicans.The former president has not visited, although he called into a pro-Youngkin "Take Back Virginia Rally" on October 13 featuring former White House advisor Steve Bannon and other prominent promoters of Trump's election fraud lies.McAuliffe, who took the stage before Obama, pledged to work with "Reasonable Republicans" to improve the lives of Virginians."I'll work with you, but let me make one thing perfectly clear today. Glenn Youngkin is not a reasonable Republican. I call him Donald Trump in khakis," he told the crowd of a few hundred."Do we want a lapdog for Donald Trump to be our governor here in the Commonwealth? No, we don't."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/obama-warns-of-republican-threat-to-democracy-in-us-battleground-virginia-101635030700389.html
24-10-2021||World||Russia puts torture video whistleblower on wanted list||Russia on Saturday placed a former prison inmate who leaked harrowing videos of rape and torture inside a Russian prison on a wanted list.A notice on the interior ministry's website said Sergei Savelyev -- a Belarus national who is seeking asylum in France -- was wanted in connection with an unspecified criminal case.Savelyev smuggled footage of abuse out of a jail in the central city of Saratov. Fearing reprisals, he fled the country in February and last week arrived in France, where he asked for asylum.While serving 7.5 years for drug trafficking, he worked as an IT maintenance officer, earning access to the prison's internal server and those of other jails, where he found several videos.He saved them on a USB stick that he hid near the prison exit.Some of the videos were then published by the Russian rights groups Gulagu.net, prompting an official probe and the sacking of several officials.Savelyev said that while the interior ministry did not provide details of why he was wanted, he thought it was for "leaking state secrets"."They are going down the only path they know, the path of force," he said in a video from France published by Gulagu.net.Russian authorities are trying "to shut my mouth"."It's a shame that instead of using the time to reform the system and investigate all this terrible evidence we gave them, they are trying to hide the truth," he said.'Serious mistakes'Russia's vast prison system has long been an arena of torture and sexual violence inflicted on inmates, monitors say, but the videos have cast new light on such abuses.In an interview with AFP earlier this week, Savelyev said the abuse was often doled out to try to force inmates to confess or inform on other prisoners.The videos of the abuse were then used to blackmail the victim into compliance.After Gulagu.net published the videos of the abuse, the head of the jail, where prisoners needing medical attention for tuberculosis are held, was sacked, along with three regional prison officials.The top prison official for the Saratov region was also to be relieved of his post over "serious mistakes", authorities said.Savelyev told AFP he still had many other videos he had collected in jail, but refused to say what he planned to do with them.He said before he fled Russia he had been approached by Russian agents who offered him a shorter sentence in return for his cooperation."They weren't interested in knowing anything about human rights violations," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-puts-torture-video-whistleblower-on-wanted-list-101635030745330.html
24-10-2021||World||Chinese economy risks deeper slowdown than markets realise||China’s economy risks slowing faster than investors realize as President Xi Jinping’s push to cut its reliance on real estate and regulate sectors from education to technology combine with a power shortage and the pandemic.Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. are among those sounding the warning that expansion will fall short this year of the 8.2% anticipated by the consensus of economists. The slump could last into next year, forcing growth below 5%, they warn. Outside 2020’s 2.3%, that would be the weakest in three decades.Strategists at Bank of America muse that Xi may even be embracing a once-in-two decades restructuring of the economy akin to Deng Xiaoping’s modernizations of the late-1970s and Zhu Rongji’s revamping of state-enterprises and finance in the 1990s.“If so, the data flow from China could confound even the pessimists, and we are on guard for that scenario unfolding,” the strategists, led by Ajay Kapur, told clients in a report last week, in which they predicted growth of 7.7% this year and 4% in 2022.Beijing is determined to shift its economic model from its boom years, in which the country loaded up on debt and propelled itself to become the second-largest economy. Xi is now overseeing a plan to stabilize debt growth -- in order to ease financial risks -- curb inequality and channel financial resources into hi-tech manufacturing to counter the threat of technology restrictions from the U.S.Data released last week already showed a sharp slowdown in growth to 4.9% in the third quarter from 7.9% in the previous quarter, with more pain likely to come as electricity shortages persist.Even before the pandemic hit, China was surprising economists with slower-than-expected growth caused by Beijing’s resolve to ease debt risks, which meant it avoided broad stimulus even as the U.S.-China trade war threatened expansion.After modest easing to cushion the worst effects of the coronavirus, its debt-control policy resumed, with real estate companies such as China Evergrande Group feeling the biggest impact.Xi also set about seeking to reshape the consumer technology, private tutoring and real estate sectors, with officials arguing they represent a wasteful use of the country’s limited resources. Officials have mostly embraced the resulting slowdown.China’s Premier Li Keqiang in March announced a growth target of “above 6%” for the year. While analysts saw this as a signal that Beijing was prioritizing other policy goals such as financial stability and environmental protection above economic growth, most at the time saw the target as extremely conservative.“I’ve joked that maybe Li Keqiang knew more than we did,” said Bert Hofman, a former director of the World Bank’s China office who now heads the National University of Singapore’s East Asian Institute.But Beijing has signaled in recent weeks that it could loosen some policies, telling banks to pick up the pace of mortgage lending even as it repeated vows not to use the property sector as a short-term stimulus.Any policy loosening in the next few months will be aimed at “preventing disaster” rather than supporting growth, Hofman said. “As long as growth is above 6%, I think China would feel relatively happy,” he added.People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang recently said he sees about 8% expansion for this year, and to achieve that, the economy would only need to expand 3.9% in the current quarter, according to calculations from Bloomberg Economics. China’s slowdown comes as the global recovery from Covid-19 risks losing momentum.“When China’s economic engine sputters, growth fizzles the world over,” said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC Holdings Plc in Hong Kong.Among those at risk from less investment in China are commodity exporters such as Australia, South Africa and Brazil. Slower trade could also hit the likes of Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. The impact could be felt further afield, according to Tuuli McCully, Singapore-based head of Asia-Pacific economics at Scotiabank. “Countries such as Chile and Peru ship significant amounts of commodities to China and will feel the impact of weaker real estate and other fixed asset investment activity in China,” she said.Financial market spillovers may be more contained given the 18% peak to trough correction in China’s CSI 300 Index this year did not spark global contagion, said Alvin Tan, head of Asia foreign-exchange strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong. One possible upside from a cooling Chinese economy is that it could alleviate global inflation pressures, Tan said.“Nonetheless, the net impact is decidedly negative for a world that is still recovering from the pandemic,” Tan said.For now, even the most pessimistic economists expect growth to come in above 7.5% this year, a relatively rapid rate for an economy the size of China’s. Beijing has set a goal of doubling gross domestic product from 2020 levels by 2035, which implies annual growth of around 5%. That may prove to be a floor for policy makers.China could see real estate investment fall 10% in the first half of next year and still achieve 5% annual growth as its credit cycle is close to its bottom and fiscal policy could pick up ahead of a crucial Communist Party congress in the autumn, said Bo Zhuang, China economist at Loomis Sayles Investments Asia.He predicts Beijing could set a growth target around 5.5% for next year.Still, the recent weakness when combined with concerns over Evergrande is prompting analysts to wonder if they remain too sanguine on near-term prospects.Bank of America’s strategists outlined a “bearish scenario” involving a disorderly adjustment to the real estate market in which property prices fall 10%, cutting sales and deterring banks from lending to the sector. In that scenario, growth could reach as low as 7.5% this year and 2.2% in 2022.The other risk is that China’s policy makers may struggle to flick the switch back to growth mode if they feel that’s needed. Citigroup economists led by Xiangrong Yu noted that the electricity shortages that are crimping industrial production will make it harder to cushion growth by boosting investment in infrastructure. That kind of policy could only work next year once the power crunch eases, they said.Local governments are also struggling to find viable projects to invest in while property developers’ tight financing has slowed their land purchases, threatening to undermine a $1 trillion revenue source for local governments.“Property and energy problems will continue to affect growth in the fourth quarter,” said Houze Song, a China economy researcher at U.S. think tank, the Paulson Institute. It “seems likely that full year growth will end below 8%.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-economy-risks-deeper-slowdown-than-markets-realise-101635030893362.html
24-10-2021||World||Facebook assesses country risks for decisions on content removal||Facebook Inc. said it’s developed a strategy since 2018 to monitor and remove content that violates its policies, especially in countries most at risk of offline violence.The factors used for such evaluations include social tensions and civic participation, as well as how the use of its social media tools affect that country, it said, citing elections in Myanmar, Ethiopia, India and Mexico as recent examples. It also considers how the information may shed light on a current problem, such as crime, elections, violence and Covid-19 transmission and vaccination rates, it added. “This allows us to act quickly to remove content that violates our policies and take other protective measures,” according to a Facebook blog Saturday by Miranda Sissons, director of human rights policy, and Nicole Isaac, international strategic response director. “We know that we face a number of challenges with this work and it is a complex and often adversarial space — there is no one-size-fits-all solution.”   As rioters breached barricades and bludgeoned police with flagpoles before storming the US Capitol on Jan. 6, some Facebook employees took to an internal discussion board to express shock and outrage. Many of the posts were imbued with a dawning sense that they and their employer -- whose platforms for weeks had spread content questioning the legitimacy of the election -- bore part of the blame.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-assesses-country-risks-for-decisions-on-content-removal-101635030935346.html
24-10-2021||World||Saudi Arabia targets net zero emissions||Top crude exporter Saudi Arabia will aim to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2060, its de facto ruler said on Saturday, days before the COP26 global climate summit.The kingdom, one of the world’s biggest polluters, said it would also join a global effort to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030.The United Nations says more than 130 countries have set or are considering a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, an objective it says is “imperative” to safeguard a liveable climate.“I announce today Saudi Arabia’s target to reach net zero emissions by 2060,” Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told the Saudi Green Initiative forum.COP26 President Alok Sharma welcomed the announcement. “I hope this landmark announcement... will galvanise ambition from others ahead of #COP26,” Sharma tweeted, adding he was looking forward to seeing more details on the Saudi plan.Shortly after, energy giant Saudi Aramco said it committed to being a net zero enterprise by 2050. “Saudi Aramco will achieve an ambition of being also a net zero from our operation by 2050,” Aramco chief executive Amin Nasser said at the forum.Separately, Sharma said success at the upcoming COP26 climate summit is “definitely harder” than the 2015 Paris talks which resulted in a landmark accord.The October 31-November 12 gathering in Glasgow is the biggest climate conference since the Paris summit and is seen as crucial in setting worldwide emission targets to slow global warming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-targets-net-zero-emissions-101635019752579.html

Facebook has faced a storm of criticism over the past month after former employee Frances Haugen leaked internal studies showing the company knew of potential harm stoked by its sites. In the SEC complaint, the new whistleblower recounts alleged statements from 2017, when the company was deciding how to handle the controversy related to Russia’s interference in the 2016 US presidential election.“It will be a flash in the pan. Some legislators will get pissy. And then in a few weeks they will move onto something else. Meanwhile we are printing money in the basement, and we are fine,” Tucker Bounds, a member of Facebook’s communications team, was quoted in the complaint as saying, The Washington Post reported.The second whistleblower signed the complaint on October 13, a week after Haugen’s scathing testimony before a Senate panel, according to the report.According to local media on Friday, Facebook held back from doing all it could to stop users from being radicalised and US election misinformation from flooding the social network. Examples included an internal finding that 10% of political content viewed by US users in the days after the election perpetuated the falsehood that the vote had been rigged.What has come to be known as the “Big Lie” has been repeated relentlessly by former president Donald Trump and enraged his supporters, who stormed the US Capital in a deadly attack on January 6. Revelations published on Friday indicated that Facebook could have anticipated such trouble.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-whistleblower-more-leaks-add-to-fb-s-troubles-101635019565713.html
24-10-2021||World||‘Act now’, say UK scientists as Covid infections surge||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday a new Covid-19 lockdown is not on the cards, as advisers warned that acting early with lighter measures to cut rising case numbers would reduce the need for tougher restrictions later.Johnson’s government has said there is no need yet to introduce a “Plan B”. Asked on Friday about the possibility of another lockdown over winter, the prime minister said: “I’ve got to tell you at the moment that we see absolutely nothing to indicate that, that is on the cards at all.”While Johnson has scrapped the legal requirement to wear masks, he said they should still be worn in confined spaces. Covid-19 infections in Britain are up 17.9% over the last seven days, with 52,009 reported on Thursday, and the reproduction “R” number is estimated between 1.0 and 1.2. Any figure above one suggests an exponential growth in cases.“In the event of increasing case rates, earlier intervention would reduce the need for more stringent, disruptive, and longer-lasting measures,” the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) said in minutes from a October 14 meeting, published on Friday.“SAGE advises that policy work on the potential reintroduction of measures should be undertaken now so that it can be ready for rapid deployment if required.”SAGE added that among Plan B measures, reintroduction of work-from-home guidance would have the biggest impact to cut transmission, and warned that “presenteeism” might become an increasing reason for contagion in the workplace.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Friday found that Covid-19 prevalence had risen again. The ONS said Covid prevalence was at its highest level since January, when England had just entered a third national lockdown, although deaths are much lower.The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said it was investigating a Delta subvariant of the coronavirus called AY.4.2 as it was possibly more transmissible than Delta, though there was no evidence that it caused more severe disease or rendered vaccines ineffective.Meanwhile, Russia reported a record number of new cases and deaths on Saturday. The national coronavirus headquarters said there were 37,678 new cases and 1,075 deaths in the last day, the most in both categories since the pandemic began.Austria could lock down only for unvaccinatedAustria has laid out a framework for potential new lockdown measures to apply only to unvaccinated people, as inoculations lag and cases rise sharply.“I will do everything I can to ensure that the health system in this country does not reach its limit and is not overloaded because we have too many procrastinators,” Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said in a statement Saturday.If the number of Covid patients in intensive care units hits 500, or 25% of the country’s capacity, unvaccinated people would be barred from hotels and restaurants. If ICU capacity reaches one-third, or 600 units, a lockdown would go into effect for the unvaccinated, who would only be allowed to leave their homes for certain reasons.Singapore removes India from restriction listSingapore on Saturday announced the removal of India and five other South Asian countries from its travel restriction list as the island-state continues to adjust border measures in response to the global Covid-19 situation.All travellers with a 14-day travel history to Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka will be allowed to enter or transit through Singapore from Wednesday, the health ministry said.However, travellers from these countries will be subjected to the tightest of border measures, which involve a 10-day, stay-home notice period at a dedicated facility, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/act-now-say-uk-scientists-as-covid-infections-surge-101635019370225.html
24-10-2021||World||Alec Baldwin was told gun was 'cold' before movie set shooting||As a film crew and actors in Western garb prepared to rehearse a scene inside a wooden, chapel-like building on a desert movie ranch outside Santa Fe, assistant director Dave Halls stepped outside and grabbed a prop gun off a cart.He walked back in and handed it to the film's star, Alec Baldwin, assuring him it was safe to use because it didn't have live ammo.“Cold gun,” Halls yelled.It wasn't, according to court records made public on Friday. Instead, when Baldwin pulled the trigger Thursday, he killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounded director Joel Souza, who was standing behind her.Authorities were alerted to the shooting by a 911 call that hints at panic on the movie set, as detailed in a recording obtained by the Albuquerque Journal.“We had two people accidentally shot on a move set by a prop gun, we need help immediately,” a script supervisor told an emergency dispatcher. “We were rehearsing and it went off and I ran out, we all ran out.”The dispatcher asks if the gun was loaded with a real bullet.“I cannot tell you. We have two injuries,” the script director saidThe tragedy came nearly three decades after Brandon Lee, the son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee, died in a similar case, and it prompted horrified questions about how it could have happened again. The executive producer of ABC’s police drama “The Rookie” announced Friday the show would no longer use “live" weapons because the “safety of our cast and crew is too important.”Details of the shooting at the ranch on Bonanza Creek Road were included in a search warrant application filed by the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office. Investigators were seeking to examine Baldwin’s blood-stained costume for the film “Rust,” as well as the weapon that was fired, other prop guns and ammunition, and any footage that might exist.The gun was one of three that the film’s armorer, Hannah Gutierrez, had set on a cart outside the building where a scene was being acted, according to the records. Halls grabbed the gun from the cart and brought it inside to Baldwin, unaware that it was loaded with live rounds, a detective wrote in the search warrant application.It was unclear how many rounds were fired. Gutierrez removed a shell casing from the gun after the shooting, and she turned the weapon over to police when they arrived, the court records say.Halls did not immediately return phone and email messages seeking comment. The Associated Press was unable to contact Gutierrez, and several messages sent to production companies affiliated with the film were not immediately returned on Friday.The film’s script supervisor, Mamie Mitchell, said she was standing next to Hutchins when she was shot.“I ran out and called 911 and said ‘Bring everybody, send everybody,’ ” Mitchell told The Associated Press. “This woman is gone at the beginning of her career. She was an extraordinary, rare, very rare woman.”Mitchell said she and other crew members were attending a private memorial service on Friday night in Santa Fe.Baldwin described the killing as a “tragic accident.”“There are no words to convey my shock and sadness regarding the tragic accident that took the life of Halyna Hutchins, a wife, mother and deeply admired colleague of ours. I’m fully cooperating with the police investigation,” Baldwin wrote on Twitter. “My heart is broken for her husband, their son, and all who knew and loved Halyna.”No immediate charges were filed, and sheriff’s spokesman Juan Rios said Baldwin was permitted to travel.“He’s a free man,” Rios said.Images of the 63-year-old actor — known for his roles in “30 Rock” and “The Hunt for Red October” and his impression of former President Donald Trump on “Saturday Night Live” — showed him distraught outside the sheriff’s office on Thursday.Guns used in making movies are sometimes real weapons that can fire either bullets or blanks, which are gunpowder charges that produce a flash and a bang but no deadly projectile. Even blanks can eject hot gases and paper or plastic wadding from the barrel that can be lethal at close range. That proved to be the case in the death of an actor in 1984.In another on-set accident in 1993, Lee was killed after a bullet was left in a prop gun, and similar shootings have occurred involving stage weapons that were loaded with live rounds during historical re-enactments.Gun-safety protocol on sets in the United States has improved since then, said Steven Hall, a veteran director of photography in Britain. But he said one of the riskiest positions to be in is behind the camera because that person is in the line of fire in scenes where an actor appears to point a gun at the audience.Sheriff’s deputies responded about 2 p.m. to the movie set at the Bonanza Creek Ranch after 911 calls described a person being shot there, Rios said. The ranch has been used in dozens of films, including the recent Tom Hanks Western “News of the World.”Gutierrez, the film’s armorer, gave an interview in September to Arizona-based podcast “Voices of the West" in which she said she had just finished her first movie while working as the head armorer, a project in Montana starring Nicholas Cage titled “The Old Way.”“I was really nervous about it at first and I almost didn’t take the job because I wasn’t sure if I was ready but doing it, like, it went really smoothly," she said.Gutierrez is the daughter of Thell Reed, a quick-draw exhibition shooter and gun coach for stars who worked on films such as “Tombstone" and “The Quick" and “the Dead," according to his IMDB profile. Gutierrez said she grew up around guns and her father had been teaching her a little bit about firearms since she was a teenager.Hutchins, 42, worked as director of photography on the 2020 action film “Archenemy” starring Joe Manganiello. She was a 2015 graduate of the American Film Institute and was named a “rising star” by American Cinematographer in 2019.“I’m so sad about losing Halyna. And so infuriated that this could happen on a set,” said “Archenemy” director Adam Egypt Mortimer on Twitter. “She was a brilliant talent who was absolutely committed to art and to film.”Manganiello called Hutchins “an incredible talent” and “a great person” on his Instagram account. He said he was lucky to have worked with her.After the shooting, production was halted on “Rust.” The movie is about a 13-year-old boy who is left to fend for himself and his younger brother following the death of their parents in 1880s Kansas, according to the Internet Movie Database website. The teen goes on the run with his long-estranged grandfather (played by Baldwin) after the boy is sentenced to hang for the accidental killing of a local rancher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alec-baldwin-was-told-gun-was-cold-before-movie-set-shooting-101635016057366.html

The solution to the problem is that some of the senior advocates must take legal aid as a matter of choice and keep on appearing for matters pro bono so that the man who comes through the door of legal aid service clinic is assured that it is not going to be a matter which is botched up and a quality legal aid will be extended to him,” Justice Lalit said.Stressing the importance of empowering the poor and downtrodden, he said legal aid to the poor does not mean it is of poor level and it has to be of better quality and standard.Stressing the need to empower women, the judge said women should be empowered to such an extent that she may run shoulder to shoulder with everyone of us.Justice Lalit commended the efforts of the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority with respect to the establishment of the off-campus legal services clinics and release of a graphic novel to spread legal literacy in the state. The National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) and the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority (KSLSA) have been performing instrumental role in bringing justice to the doorstep of citizens by creating legal awareness amongst the common citizens. As part of NALSA Pan India Awareness and Outreach Campaign and on the occasion of UN Day which is celebrated globally to mark the anniversary of the UN charter coming into force on 24 October in 1945, the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority in association with the District Legal Services Authority, Kalaburagi organised the programme.The programme was attended by judicial officers, members of the local bar, law students, teachers and around 300 members of the Banjara Community (known colloquially as Lambanis).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/senior-advocates-must-render-pro-bono-legal-aid-to-poor-sc-judge-101635100084470.html

24-10-2021||India||The Week Ahead: Cong embarks on nationwide outreach; UP government report on Lakhimpur killings likely on Wednesday||Mumbai Following Sunday’s India-Pakistan clash at the T20 World Cup in Dubai, India gets a longish breather before their next match against New Zealand on October 31. That one’s going to be another exciting face-off between Virat Kohli and Kane Williamson, two of the best contemporary batters across all formats, and may prove crucial for the tournament’s eventual outcome. Both India and New Zealand were pre-tournament frontrunners, if not outright favourites. In other important matches, Pakistan play New Zealand and South Africa play West Indies on Tuesday, while England have their big match against Australia on Saturday. While the T20 World Cup might dominate the sports page headlines this week and the next, the next six days are going to be blazing hot for Indian politics. Monday will see a nationwide outreach drive by the Congress on the same day that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to address a big rally in his constituency of Varanasi. A status report by the Uttar Pradesh government on the Lakhimpur Kheri killings is expected this Wednesday. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee is likely to visit Goa this week around the same time that the RSS is holding its All India Executive meeting in Karnataka for three days. This is her maiden visit to the western state where the TMC is making inroads. TMC general secretary Abhishek Banerjee has already announced that the party will make an electoral foray into 15 states in the coming years. Now wonder then, that, the big daddy of all political developments in India is still elections. Voting for by-polls in about 30 assembly constituencies and some Lok Sabha segments across India will be held on October 30. This is the biggest chunk of by-polls to be held this year and could be seen as getting the pulse of the people before the 2022 assembly polls in four states. In Chhattisgarh, a meeting of state Congress party office bearers is scheduled on October 26 in which decisions on restructuring of the party unit is likely to be taken. This comes at the time when there is speculation on chief minister Bhupesh Baghel being replaced by health minister TS Singhdeo, who might return to the state this week after a long stay in Delhi where he said to have met senior party leaders. Today will also see the introduction of new guidelines for international passengers, according to which all international passengers will have to produce a negative RT-PCR report for Coronavirus disease on arrival. Airlines will have to ensure availability of negative RT-PCR report before allowing the travellers to board. Fully vaccinated travellers coming from a country with which India has reciprocal arrangements for mutual acceptance of World Health Organisation approved Covid-19 vaccines will be allowed to enter the country without having to undergo the mandatory seven-day home quarantine and test on arrival. India has signed agreements for mutual recognition of nationally or WHO recognised COVID-19 vaccines with 11 countries - the UK, France, Germany, Nepal, Belarus, Lebanon, Armenia, Ukraine, Belgium, Hungary and Serbia.In the national Capital, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) will decide on regulations for Chhat Puja celebrations. Chhat Puja this year will be celebrated on November 10 – six days after Diwali. On September 29, DDMA had prohibited Chhat Puja celebrations at riverbanks, near water bodies, grounds, parks, temples and public spaces in Delhi citing Covid-19 transmission related risks, even though community celebrations of other festivals such as Durga Puja, Ramleela, and Dussehra (with a set of limited restrictions) were allowed. This led to protests by the Bharatiya Janata Party which claimed that the prohibition on community celebration of Chhat Puja would hurt people of Poorvanchal who reside in Delhi. Poorvanchal is a popular term referring to the region that covers Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand. Chhat Puja is a popular festival among people belonging to these states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-week-ahead-cong-embarks-on-nationwide-outreach-up-government-report-on-lakhimpur-killings-likely-on-wednesday-101635096901581.html

Bajrang Dal workers demanded that the name of the show has to be changed from Ashram. Otherwise, the shooting will not be allowed to go on in the state, Bajrang Dal Bhopal leader Sushil Sudele said.“We want the film industry to be promoted here in Madhya Pradesh. People should get employment, but this land should not be used to humiliate Hindu samaj. In the earlier instalment of the series, it was shown that women are exploited inside Ashram, is it so? Stop defaming Hindus and if he wants to gain popularity then why not name any other religion and see the number of protests that happen,” the Bajrang Dal leader said.Reports said as the workers went on a rampage on the sets, they shouted "Prakash Jha Murdabad", "Bobby Deol Murdabad" and "Jai Shri Ram". They also said that they were looking for Bobby Deol, the main character of the series. Bobby Deol should learn something from his brother Sunny Deol, they said. Vehicles of the shooting party were stopped and the Bajrang Dal workers pelted stones at them, leaving some crew members injured. Police said no one was fatally injured and appropriate action will be taken against those responsible for Sunday's vandalism. Irshad Wali, DIG Bhopal, clarified, "All the miscreants have been shunned from the premises and no one has been fatally injured, though some vehicles have been damaged. Further action will be taken against those responsible."“I want to assure everyone that a similar situation will not be repeated again,” he said to ANI. "We have given only a warning for now and Prakash Raj has said that he is in talks to change the show's title," Sushil Sudele said, adding "I repeat the show's name will have to be changed from 'Ashram' or won't be filmed here in Bhopal."Bobby Deol plays the role of Baba Nirala who is a godman and also a conman. The first season of the web series was released in August 2020 on theOTT platform MX player.  This is not Ashram's first brush with controversy as a Jodhpur court in 2020 issued notice to Bobby Deol and Prakash Jha after an advocate moved the court claiming that the series hurts religious sentiments. Rajasthan Police earlier booked the makers of the series for allegedly promoting discrimination against SC/STs.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ashram-3-sets-in-bhopal-vandalised-by-bajrang-dal-ink-thrown-at-prakash-jha-101635094894695.html
24-10-2021||India||Kisan Morcha says ‘Kalash Yatras’ for Lakhimpur Kheri deceased drawing crowd||Kisan Morcha says ‘Kalash Yatras’ for Lakhimpur Kheri deceased drawing mass support -- for long headlineThe Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmer unions leading the agitating against the three central farm laws, said rallies aimed at paying homage to five of their compatriots who lost their lives during violence clashes in Lakhimpur Kheri earlier this month were drawing large crowds.The farmers body had said the 'Shahid Kisan Asthi Kalash Yatras' would be taken out in several districts across the country to distribute the ashes of the deceased farmers. “In Tamil Nadu, the yatra passed through Ulludurpet in Kallakurichi district and then entered Perambalur," a representative of SKM said."In Himachal Pradesh, ashes of the martyrs were immersed in Poanta Sahib at Yamuna Ghat. Yatras are going through various places in Punjab in all three regions of Malwa, Majha and Doaba," they added.SKM, who took the decision to organise a ‘Kalash Yatra' at the Singhu Morcha in Delhi on October 21, said the march was mobilising people to demand the arrest of Union minister Ajay Mishra, whose son Ashish is behind bars for allegedly driving one of the cars that had ran over protesting farmers on the fateful day.On October 3, farmers were protesting the official visit of deputy chief minister of Uttar Pradesh Keshav Prasad Maurya when the violence broke out leading to at least eight deaths, including that of farmers and a local journalist.“The response has been huge, and the demand for justice is growing louder,” the morcha said.SKM has also urged its constituents to organise dharnas at tehsils and district headquarters across India between 11am and 2pm on October 26 to demand the sacking of Mishra, who holds the post of junior minister in the Union home department.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kisan-morcha-says-kalash-yatras-for-lakhimpur-kheri-deceased-drawing-crowd-101635094253683.html
24-10-2021||India||‘How could PM Modi visit US where Covaxin is not approved?’ Mamata Banerjee||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday wondered how could Prime Minister Narendra Modi visit America in September after taking the indigenously developed Covaxin which is not yet approved by the US health regulator against the coronavirus disease.On a five-day tour to the north Bengal districts, Banerjee, while addressing a post-Durga puja cultural event held by the police in Siliguri town, said, “How could Modi visit America if he took Covaxin? America has not given recognition to Covaxin. Thousands of students and businessmen cannot enter America because of that. In Bengal, many people received Covishied which has been approved by foreign countries. I have even written to the Prime Minister to take steps so that Covaxin gets the approval.” The chief minister attacked the Centre on several issues, ranging from price rise to the Covid pandemic, claiming that Bengal stands third in the country in vaccination despite the Centre allotting lesser vials for her state which has a high population of 101.9 million. “Those who played gongs and utensils should look at Bengal. We were the first to start mass vaccination. We have administered 70 million vaccines so far. However, only 40 million people have received the second dose,” said Banerjee indirectly taking a swipe at Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders who asked people to play the gongs and light candles outside their homes last year to muster solidarity in the fight against Covid-19. “In a country of 1300 million, only 295.1 million have received the second dose till today, says the government. This is jumla (propaganda). Bengal stands third in vaccination because we received fewer vaccines, although our population is high. We bought vaccines with state funds. They (Centre) is giving certificates to vaccinated people. Will the death certificates carry Narendra Modi’s photograph as well? A few million have died so far,” said Banerjee. Covaxin, made by Bharat Biotech, was not approved for emergency use by USA’s top public health regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Rejecting Covaxin’s application for emergency use in the US, the FDA sought more data on clinical trials. Modi received his first dose of Covaxin at Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on March 1. “Took my first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at AIIMS. Remarkable how our doctors and scientists have worked in quick time to strengthen the global fight against COVID-19. I appeal to all those who are eligible to take the vaccine. Together, let us make India COVID-19 free!” he tweeted with a photograph of him receiving the shot. The Prime Minister received his second dose at AIIMS on April 8. He announced this in a tweet and urged citizens to get their names registered on the government’s Cowin website. The Bengal chief minister also targeted the Centre for the steep rise in petrol and diesel prices. “Prices of diesel and petrol are shooting up every day. This is hurting common people. Very soon you will have to cook with coal. Strangely, nobody is bothered. Nobody is saying a word. But we will protest,” she said. Though the Bengal BJP has targeted Banerjee for not taking a strong stand on the attack on Hindus during Durga puja in Bangladesh, the chief minister skipped the issue. Instead, she said the festival took place peacefully in Bengal. “The BJP alleged that I do not allow Durga puja in Bengal. Such a big festival took place and not a single untoward incident took place. This is not Tripura where even Santosh Mohan’s Deb’s daughter (TMC leader Sushmita Deb) was assaulted recently. How many assaults took place in north Bengal after the assembly polls? The BJP is campaigning all day. Why don’t you (BJP) look at Tripura? People cannot enter Uttar Pradesh. In Delhi, power cuts have affected life,” said Banerjee. She even questioned the Centre’s decision to extend the area of jurisdiction of the Border Security Force in Bengal, Assam and Punjab from 15 km of the international border to 50 km. “What does this mean? We do not want this. Our relations with Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh are very good. They (BJP government) are doing this to capture more power. How much more power do you want? Your demands seem to have no end,” she said. Reacting to Banerjee’s statement on Modi visiting the USA after taking Covaxin, Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said the chief minister failed to see the paradigm shift in India’s position before the world after the rule of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) came to an end. “Modi visited America because the vaccine represents the success of India’s scientific community. Covaxin has not been approved yet because there is pressure from international pharmaceutical companies. These issues will be sorted out in no time. Banerjee needs to understand that all nations respect India. There has been a paradigm shift in their position since the Congress-led UPA era,” said Bhattacharya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-could-pm-modi-visit-us-where-covaxin-is-not-approved-mamata-banerjee-101635093003598.html
24-10-2021||India||As Lalu Prasad returns home amid fanfare, son Tej Pratap fumes over ‘humiliation’||As ailing Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) patriarch Lalu Prasad returned home after years on Sunday amid much fanfare, his mercurial elder son Tej Pratap made as much news alleging humiliation at the hands of the party’s state unit chief Jagadanand Singh and MLC Sunil Singh. He later staged a protest outside his parents' residence claiming that he was stopped from meeting his father by “ agents of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)”. Earlier in the day, Tej Pratap was seen at the airport with his younger brother Tejashwi, whom the RJD patriarch seems to have passed on the reins of the party. It appeared the duo had buried their hatchet while receiving their father at the airport, but it all got lost when Tej Pratap was seen furiously leaving mother Rabri Devi’s house and telling reporters that henceforth, he would have nothing to do with the RJD.At the airport, Tej Pratap remained by his father side all along, but later accused the state RJD chief and MLC Sunil Singh of preventing him from spending some time with his father. #WATCH | Patna: RJD leader Tej Pratap Yadav met his father Lalu Prasad Yadav at the latter's residence.Tej Pratap was protesting outside Lalu Prasad's residence alleging that he was stopped by "RSS agents" from meeting his father. pic.twitter.com/eXGbyJvNTOHe had been reportedly fuming since morning when posters that were put up at some places welcoming Prasad did not feature him, but Tejashwi, Rabri Devi and Misa, among others.“I have nothing to do with the RJD henceforth. I am, though, a devoted son and will continue to dote on my father,” he said, “It was such a happy day, but I was humiliated even today.”Hitting out at Jagadanand Singh, the maverick MLA whose run-ins with functionaries of his party keep making headlines, said, “Until I am able to throw him out of the RJD, I would have nothing to do with the party. I would take a major step in the coming days,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Meanwhile, Prasad returned to his home turf of Bihar from where imprisonment in fodder scam cases had kept him away for three years. Prasad, who was released from jail a few months ago, arrived here accompanied by wife Rabri Devi and eldest daughter Misa Bharti, at whose Delhi residence he had been putting up for medical help he needs for the multiple ailments he suffers from.Chants in praise of the “messiah of the poor” rent the air as the haggard-looking septuagenarian walked out of the airport, with a shuffling gait, tiredly waving at the huge crowd.Prasad was last seen here in September 2018, after which he returned to Ranchi to serve his sentences upon expiry of the period of his bail, granted to attend elder son’s wedding and extended a number of times to help him avail medical treatment.The former Bihar chief minister drove straight to Rabri Devi’s 10, Circular Road bungalow where a large number of supporters was seen waiting outside with police and security personnel sweating it out to keep their enthusiasm under check.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-lalu-prasad-returns-home-amid-loud-cheer-son-tej-pratap-says-humiliated-101635091889300.html
24-10-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: October 25, 1954 — Political crisis in Pakistan; governor-general proclaims state of emergency||Karachi: The Pakistan Prime Minister, Mr Mohammed Ali, reconstituted his Cabinet this evening as the whole country lay under a state of emergency proclaimed by the Governor-General, Mr Ghulam Mohammed, because the constitutional machinery had broken down.Within hours of Mr Mohammed Ali’s arrival home by a specially-chartered plane, the Governor-General discussed with him the most serious political crisis in the country’s history and dissolved the Constituent Assembly, called for fresh elections “ as early as possible” and ordered a new Cabinet to be ushered in. The Pakistan Prime Minister, who named his new eight-man Cabinet to ensure “a vigorous and stable Government” in the country, himself came to power on the crest of a crisis 19 months ago when the Governor-General dismissed the Khwaja Nazimuddin Ministry. Since Mr Mohammed Ali landed at midnight last night events moved rapidly and the crisis, the existence of which was denied by him at the airport, became a reality. He conferred with Mr Ghulam Mohammed for three hours early in the morning before the Governor-General announced his momentous order to the people who were anticipating some such action. At least four hours before the communiqué was issued by Mr Ghulam Mohammed, leading East Pakistan members of the now dissolved Constituent Assembly openly said that “another coup is coming.” The crisis was precipitated by sharp differences among sections of the Muslim League Party over the provisions of the new constitution which the Prime Minister, before his departure to the U.S.A., had promised the country before the end of the year. ZONAL FEDERATION DEMAND The “rebels” from West Pakistan, including Mr Feroz Khan Noon, Chief Minister of West Punjab, Mr Daultana, Mr M. A. Khuhro, Mr Abdul Rashid, Frontier Chief Minister, and the Pakistan Interior Minister, Mr M. A. Gurmani, wanted a zonal federation for fear that East Bengal with more than half the population of the country would dominate. At a meeting at Lahore on Friday, the Punjab Muslim League Assembly Party gave a mandate to members of the Constituent Assembly from West Punjab that they should demand that in the future constitution of Pakistan only five subjects-defence, foreign affairs, currency and exchange, foreign trade and interzonal communications-should be administered by the Central Government of Pakistan. This mandate was stated to have reflected the unanimous decisions reached by senior Muslim League leaders on Thursday at the conclusion of a week’s talks between Mr Feroz Khan Noon and Mr Daulatana. SIND PARTY’S STAND Members of the Sind Assembly Party, on the other hand, considered that with the passage of the report of the Basic Principles Committee the constitution had been adopted. They demanded passage of the draft constitution by December 25. A majority of the Muslim League members of the Sind Assembly, in a statement issued yesterday, strongly opposed moves for forming a zonal federation for West Pakistan.Another additional factor in the crisis was the removal last Wednesday by the Governor-General of the disqualifications imposed under P.R.O.D.A. on four Provincial Ministers, including Mr M. A. Khuhro and Mr Faziullah, enabling them to stage a come-back in the political life of the country. The storm that had been brewing was expected to burst at the Muslim League convention fixed for October 31 but the Working Committee of the Muslim League on Friday made a dramatic eleventh-hour postponement of the convention to January “ in view of the strained political atmosphere in the country.” The decision came in for sharp criticism from Muslim League leaders from West Pakistan. They described it as a “vicious move” and “a stab in the back of the Muslim League organization.” PROCLAMATION A communiqué issued by the Cabinet secretariat said: “ The Governor-General, having considered the political crisis with which the country is faced, has with deep regret come to the conclusion that the constitutional machinery has broken down. He has, therefore, decided to declare a state of emergency throughout Pakistan. The Constituent Assembly, as at present constituted, has lost the confidence of the people and can no longer function. The ultimate authority vests in the people who will decide all issues, including constitutional issues, through representatives to be elected. “Elections will be held as early as possible. Until such time as elections are held the administration of the country will be carried on by a reconstituted Cabinet. He has called upon the Prime Minister to reform the Cabinet with a view to giving the country a vigorous and stable administration. The invitation has been accepted. “Security and stability of the country are of paramount importance and all sectional and provincial interests must be subordinated to the supreme national interest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-october-25-1954-political-crisis-in-pakistan-governor-general-proclaims-state-of-emergency-101635089641963.html

The party had described the attack as “barbaric” and also said that the people of the state would give a “befitting response” to the BJP.Further, the TMC chief also denied the BJP’s claims about violence in her state Bengal and asked the party to look at Tripura ruled by them. “There is peace in West Bengal,” she said. “In contrast, look at the happenings in your state (Tripura). Whoever dares to take out rallies opposing the BJP is hit with sticks,” news agency PTI quoted the CM as saying.Also read | ‘Barbaric attack’: TMC says Sushmita Dev, party workers assaulted in Tripura, alleges collapse of law and orderShe also claimed that the BJP did not allow the injured TMC members to receive medical care in hospitals following the attack. Also, she said that one of the party workers, who was assaulted, had to be rushed back to a hospital in Kolkata.“They don't even allow the injured TMC workers to be treated at a hospital. A young party worker was thrashed and he had to be rushed to the SSKM Hospital (in Kolkata),” she said. Banerjee’s remarks came during a rally in Siliguri in Bengal.The TMC is trying to expand its national footprint by announcing to contest elections in Goa and Tripura among other states. Goa is scheduled to go to polls early next year while in Tripura the elections are slated for 2023.Earlier on Friday, the party had shared videos of the alleged attack on its delegation in Tripura in which two to three men could be seen thrashing another man. Also, it shared pictures of a damaged campaign vehicle used by Dev and other party workers. Party leader Abhishek Banerjee had also condemned the attack and blamed Tripura CM Biplab Kumar Deb’s men for the assault, which he described was “beyond shameful” and “political terrorism.”(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/look-at-your-state-mamata-banerjee-blames-bjp-for-attack-on-tmc-workers-in-tripura-says-no-violence-in-bengal-101635088189920.html

The letter comes on a day when a witness in the Aryan Khan case has filed an affidavit levelling several allegations against Wankhede and NCB, including getting his signature on blank papers.The arrest of Aryan Khan in connection with a cruise rave party early this month has become a politically sensitive issue with the Maharashtra government questioning NCB's actions against Bollywood personalities while drugs of much more quantity are being recovered from elsewhere in the country. The affidavit of Prabhakar Rohoji Sail, the former driver and bodyguard of private investigator KP Gosavi, brings forth gravest charges against Sameer Wankhede as Prabhakar indicated that "NCB official demanded ₹25 crore from Shah Rukh Khan to release his son Aryan Khan". Sail claimed he heard KP Gosavi telling some D'Souza over the phone about a demand of ₹25 crore and to settle at ₹18 crore as they "have to give ₹eight crore to Sameer Wankhede".Aryan Khan case: NCB replies to 'extortion' allegation, Nawab Malik says SIT should probeWhile Sameer Wankhede has refuted these allegations, the central agency has issued a statement saying that the witness needs to submit his prayer to the court instead of social media as the matter is subjudice. "...there are certain vigilance-related allegations against certain persons in the affidavit which are based on overhearing," the NCB said referring to the purported ₹25 crore conversation.Sameer Wankhede writes to Mumbai top cop seeking protection from legal actionSameer Wankhede, the zonal director of the Narcotics Control Bureau Mumbai, has written to the Mumbai Police commissioner seeking protection from precipitate legal action against him, framing him falsely.As part of his continuous jibe at the NCB, Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik recently threatened Nawab Malik in a public address and said that Wankhede will be put behind the bars. Without naming the minister, Wankhede wrote in his letter that the threat of jail and dismissal have been issued against him on public media by highly respectable public functionaries."Hence, you are requested to kindly ensure that no such precipitate legal action is carried out to frame the undersigned falsely with ulterior motives," Wankhede wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sameer-wankhede-writes-to-mumbai-top-cop-seeking-protection-from-legal-action-amid-fresh-row-over-aryan-khan-case-101635085979346.html
24-10-2021||India||Kerala newborn kidnapping case: Anupama’s parents file anticipatory bail||Six days after police filed a case in connection with the alleged kidnapping of a newborn baby last year, parents and four relatives of former leader of the Students Federation of India (SFI) Anupama S Chandran (23) moved the district court in Thiruvananthapuram for anticipatory bail.The court will take up their pleas on October 28 and directed the police to file a reply. Though they were booked under non-bailable sections of the Indian Penal Code, including 367 (removing baby from lawful guardian), they were not arrested by police. Complainant Anupama said she lost faith in the police and will move the court soon. In her complaint, Anupama alleged that her father PS Jayachandran, a CPI(M) leader, took away her newborn three days after she gave birth last October and abandoned the baby in an orphanage run by the Kerala State Council for Child Welfare. Later, the baby was reportedly given to a family from Andhra Pradesh for adoption, allegedly flouting all rules and regulations. She alleged that her parents opposed her relation with husband K Ajith since he belonged to a Dalit family. Her one-day fast before the state secretariat on Saturday attracted national attention and many senior leaders of the party, including politburo members Brinda Karat and MA Baby, decried inaction on her complaint. “The party and the government say they are with me but it should reflect in their actions as well. I never thought my father is so powerful, nobody dares touch him. I have lost faith in the police and I will move the high court soon,” she said. She reiterated that the party was aware of the whole issue and it was shedding tears now after it hit national headlines. The 23-year-old has been knocking on many doors for the last six months to locate her child who was forcibly separated by her parents. She formally lodged a complaint with the police on April 19 and approached the CM and then police chief Loknath Behra. She said police failed to take any action due to political pressure and she was forced to come out on media after all attempts failed. Former minister PK Sreemathi, also a party central committee member, said two days ago that she tried her best to help Anupama and even approached the CM’s political secretary Puthalath Dinesan but failed. “In fact, Brinda Karat told me about her case and I immediately called the CM’s political secretary. He promised action but nothing happened,” said Sreemathi.Many leaders like her have expressed regret over the way the government and the party have handled the sensitive issue. After the issue snowballed into a big controversy her father said since the baby was born out of wedlock they decided to shift to the government-run children’s home in the state capital with the consent of his daughter. He said she signed on stamp paper but Anupama later said she signed under duress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-newborn-kidnapping-case-anupama-s-parents-file-anticipatory-bail-101635085383233.html

He further said J&K was better off when governed by chief ministers before being turned into a Union territory.Azad’s comments came hours after Union home minister Amit Shah spoke about how Jammu & Kashmir has been developed over the years under the Narendra Modi government and how changes were visible since the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution that granted special status to the now-divided Union territory.“So, we are a great loser. We are a great loser after the state has been divided into two. We have been a great loser ever since the Assembly has been dissolved,” the former Rajya Sabha MP was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Also read | Delimitation will happen, J&K statehood to be restored: Amit Shah in Srinagar“We were told the scenario in J&K will change after the abrogation of Article 370. Growth, hospitals, unemployment will be taken care of. But that has not happened at all. As a matter of fact, we were far better when it was being ruled by various CMs,” Azad said.Addressing a rally earlier in the day, Shah had hit out former chief ministers for not doing enough for the erstwhile state.Speaking about delimitation and statehood, “They would like to have delimitation first. I think they would like to have the election first and then statehood. Our demand still today is that first statehood should be granted and that should be followed by elections,” the former chief minister said.“I had requested both PM (Narendra Modi) and HM (Shah) that we're thankful to them that statehood is being granted and the state should not have been divided into two. But having been divided, now you've agreed to give statehood, but don't make the mistake of doing delimitation first and then going ahead with statehood.”He said he had demanded the same even during the meeting of political leaders from Kashmir with the PM at his residence. “Other parties also demanded. The home minister had assured us that statehood will be granted and delimitation commission will give a report,” Azad said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/were-a-great-loser-j-k-better-off-when-governed-by-cms-ghulam-nabi-azad-101635083685894.html

The recommendation has been submitted to the department of revenue, which is the nodal authority of the NDPS act. The department had asked several ministries to suggest changes to the law if any.Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan has been charged under the sections of this Act and his bail plea has been rejected by an NDPS court. Section 27 of the Act has been imposed on Aryan Khan, which prescribes imprisonment of up to a year or a penalty of up to ₹20,000 or both for consumption of any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance. The section does not make any distinction between an addict, a recreational user or a first-time user.‘NCB wants to make this an extraordinary case...’: Top defense lawyer on Aryan Khan caseAn accused can avail immunity of this penalty or prison term only if he or she volunteers for rehabilitation. Apart from this, there is no provision for relief or exemption under the NDPS Act. The social justice and empowerment ministry suggested that this rehabilitation should be given to those who are caught with a small quantity of drugs instead of a jail term, PTI reported quoting an official.Aryan Khan was arrested on October 3 and was sent to judicial custody on October 7. All his bail pleas have been rejected though he was not found with any drugs. The NCB has brought the charge of ‘conscious possession’ against him claiming that he was aware that his friend Arbaaz Merchant was carrying 6 gram charas. The agency has also linked him with a drug network based on his WhatsApp chats. Several experts have pointed out that it is difficult to get bail under the NDPS Act.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-imprison-small-time-drug-offenders-ministry-suggests-change-in-ndps-act-101635082361679.html

Tewari, one of the group of 23 Congress leaders who had called for a reorganisation of the party, quoted a recent interview by another senior leader Harish Rawat to a business newspaper and said that he had “never seen such chaos and anarchy” in the Congress.“However in my 40 years plus in @INCIndia I have never seen such chaos and anarchy as what is playing out in @INCPunjab today,” Tewari said, referring to the recent events surrounding the party’s state unit.Respected @harishrawatcmuk ji Since you referred to me in this interview👇🏾I also have great regard & respect for you going back to days when I headed @nsui & you @CongressSevadal.However in my 40 years plus in @INCIndia I have never seen such chaos 1/2https://t.co/GcE6Mw0niK“Repeated open defiance of AICC by a PCC President, colleagues squabbling publicly with each other like children. Guttural language against each other that even fish wives would not use,” Tewari further said.Rawat, in his interview to the Financial Express, said that former CM Amarinder Singh had failed to address the issues raised by the Punjab MLAs. Further, Rawat also said that Tewari should understand the “ground situation” in Punjab and noted that the government’s stability was at stake amid the revolts by MLAs, during the interview.Also read | Congress’ Manish Tewari ties attacks in J&K to rise of Taliban, says ’should've anticipated blowback’Responding to this, Tewari asked where was the progress on issues that had initially agitated the MLAs. In addition, he also called the Mallikarjun Kharge-led panel set by party’s interim president Sonia Gandhi “a serious error of judgement.” Earlier in May this year, Gandhi had set up a three-member committee led by Kharge in view of the infighting in the party’s Punjab camp. The panel had suggested a revamp of the organisation to accommodate all sections, castes and regions, HT had previously reported.“Where is progress on the issues that agitated these MLA’s & other eminences- Bargari,Drugs, Power PPA’s, illegal sand mining. Has there been any movement forward,” Tewari said. “History would record that the appointment of the Committee that ostensibly heard perceived & real grievances was a serious error of judgement,” he added.Taking a swipe at the Punjab Congress Committee (PCC) chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, Tewari said that Sidhu has openly defied the All India Congress Committee (AICC) repeatedly. He also called out the war of words between the leaders of the party and former CM Singh, however without the mention of any names. “Repeated open defiance of AICC by a PCC President, colleagues squabbling publicly with each other like children. Guttural language against each other that even fish wives would not use,” he said.“For the past 5 months it is @INCPunjab vs @INCPunjab. Do we think that people of Punjab are not disgusted by this daily soap opera?Irony is that those who complained loudest of transgressions & aberrations were unfortunately & continue to be worst offenders themselves,” he added.Meanwhile, Sidhu too had earlier in the day tweeted that Punjab must focus on “real issues” that concerned the state. “Punjab must come back to its real issues that concern every punjabi and our future generations … How will we counter the financial emergency that stares upon us ? I will stick to the real issues and not let them take a backseat,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/never-seen-such-chaos-cong-s-manish-tewari-on-crisis-in-party-s-punjab-unit-calls-out-infighting-101635080623157.html
24-10-2021||India||Around 100 Indians, including their children and spouses, yet to be evacuated from Afghanistan: NGOs write to PMO, MEA||Nearly 100 Indian nationals, including their children and spouses, and more than 200 Afghans are yet to be evacuated from Afghanistan – which fell back in the hands of Islamist militant group Taliban two months ago. In a letter addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Office and senior officials of the Union external affairs ministry (MEA), the India world forum (IWF) and many other humanitarian NGOs sought evacuation of stranded Hindu and Sikh citizens from Afghanistan’s capital Kabul, news agency ANI reported.“Sikh leaders and NGOs including Gurudwara are receiving multiple distressed calls from Kabul from Indian nationals and Afghan nationals of India origin,” former president of Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGPC) Manjit Singh wrote in the letter dated October 20.A majority of these people await e-visas despite having valid visas in the past, and travel history in India, the letter further stated.Notably, the MEA in August, amid the turmoil of US and foreign forces pulling out of Afghanistan, had cancelled all previously issued visas to Afghans who were not in India and announced that they can travel to the country only on e-visas. Additionally, the ministry had introduced a new category called “e-Emergency X-Misc Visa” of electronic/e-visa in order to fast track applications of Afghan citizens wanting to enter India."This is in regard to our earlier requests addressed to the Government of India for issuance of visas to Afghan nationals belonging to Hindu and Sikh community i.e., minorities,” a letter of president of Guru Singh Sabha Karte Parwan, Kabul, read.The ANI report added that as many as 208 applications submitted by the Hindu and Sikh community members of Afghanistan are yet to be processed by the Indian government. Furthermore, details of charter flights for the evacuation of these minorities from Kabul, submitted by an Iran-based private travel and logistics company to the MEA, are also under review.Last month, Hindustan Times reported citing people familiar with the development that the Taliban have been urging India to resume commercial flights. The Afghanistan Civil Aviation Authority, which is now controlled by the interim Taliban government, had sent a formal letter to India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on September 7 regarding the matter. The formal communication was signed by Taliban acting aviation and transport minister Hameedullah Akhunzada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/around-100-indians-yet-to-be-evacuated-from-afghanistan-ngos-write-to-pmo-mea-101635078915046.html

In a no-holds-barred attack, Ranjan claimed Mamata's party TMC and the BJP seem to have settled on an agreement called ‘Delhi yours, Kolkata ours’.“Mamata Banerjee is helping BJP by opposing Congress. She is becoming a middleman of PM Modi. Looks like they had an agreement that 'Delhi yours, Kolkata ours' otherwise she wouldn't have spoken useless things about Congress,” news agency ANI quoted Ranjan, who is also the president of the West Bengal Congress, as saying.The two parties have been at loggerheads ever since the TMC in its mouthpiece ‘Jago Bangla’ said that its party chief Mamata Banerjee should be the face of the opposition against PM Modi, and not Congress's Rahul Gandhi. The editorial claimed Congress has become irrelevant, branding the TMC as the “real Congress”.The relationship between the Congress and the TMC were further strained after Mamata Banerjee's party took a dig at Rahul Gandhi's defeat in Amethi in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, wondering whether the Congress can erase the loss through a Twitter trend.On Wednesday, TMC mocked the Congress over its decision to field 40 per cent women candidates in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, and hoped that the move to “emulate” the ruling party in West Bengal is not mere “tokenism”.

The three countries intend to hold the second meeting of a trilateral working group to discuss the joint use of Chabahar port on Iran’s Makran coast for trade and transit, Uzbekistan’s deputy foreign minister Furkat Sidikov said on the sidelines of a roundtable here on foreign policy issues. He indicated that the recent developments in Afghanistan would not have any impact on the plans of the three countries. “India is one of our strategic partners and this is an important project,” Sidikov said. The first virtual meeting of the trilateral working group on the joint use of Chabahar port was held last December, and the three sides will set the date for the second meeting, he said. Bakhtiyor Mustafayev, deputy director of the state-backed International Institute for Central Asia, said the government of landlocked Uzbekistan believes it is strategically important to diversify efforts to enhance access to the oceans. Almost 80% of Uzbekistan’s exports and imports move through northern routes passing through Central Asian states and Russia and it would be beneficial for the country to gain access to the Persian Gulf, Mustafayev said. At the same time, the countries in South Asia are developing fast, and represent a huge market with a population of about two billion, he said. “It would be more beneficial to try to combine South Asia and Central Asia,” Mustafayev said. Enhanced connectivity, he said, would also “open new doors to improve the security situation and deal with terrorism and extremism” across the region. The takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban in mid-August has triggered speculation about the viability of Chabahar port. India developed the Shahid Beheshti terminal of Chabahar as part of its efforts to access Afghanistan while bypassing the territory of Pakistan. The US granted the port a special waiver from sanctions imposed on Iran in view of its strategic importance in shipping supplies to Afghanistan. During a virtual summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 11 last year, Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev – who is widely anticipated to retain his position in presidential elections held on Sunday – first proposed a trilateral dialogue between India, Iran and Uzbekistan to promote connectivity through Chabahar port. The Indian side welcomed the proposal and responded with alacrity. The first meeting of the trilateral working group on the joint use of Chabahar was held just three days later on December 14, 2020. During the virtual summit last year, India and Uzbekistan also reiterated their commitment to enhancing connectivity between the two countries and in the larger Central Asian region to bolster trade and investment. The Indian side had said at the time that Chabahar port could be “a fulcrum of connectivity to Central Asia”. Speaking at the roundtable of foreign policy issues that was held on Saturday as part of the campaign for the presidential elections, Sidikov described the situation in Afghanistan as “difficult” but said that the country could not be isolated. Uzbek foreign minister Abdulaziz Kamilov visited Kabul on October 7 for talks with the Taliban leadership, and Uzbek officials and Taliban representatives held a working meeting in the border city of Termez on October 16 to improve cross-border connectivity, especially for shipping humanitarian aid. The Uzbek side is also interested in moving forward with a project to extend the existing railway line connecting Termez and Hairatan in Uzbekistan to Peshawar in Pakistan. The line currently terminates at Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan. “This railway project is not related to governments and is for the benefit of the people… We have discussed the project with the provisional government of Afghanistan… We are ready to support such projects,” Sidikov told the roundtable. People familiar with the matter said the thinking on the Uzbek side is that any isolation of Afghanistan could lead to an economic collapse and more chaos across the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uzbekistan-to-push-ahead-with-joint-efforts-with-india-to-promote-connectivity-via-chabahar-port-101635078961422.html
24-10-2021||India||Breast cancer awareness month: All about breast cancer||October is observed as Breast Cancer Awareness Month across the globe. Breast cancer, one of the most prevalent forms of cancer, is characterised by uncontrolled growth of cells, which results in formation of lumps within the breast. It is one of the treatable forms of cancer. But it can be a life-threatening disease, if not detected early, as it can spread to other parts of the body. Read on to learn more about the disease and how you can prevent it from affecting you and your loved ones. Breast cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer. It is characterized by uncontrolled growth of cells, which results in formation of lumps within the breast. It is one of the treatable forms of cancers. If not detected early, it can be a life threatening disease as it can also spread to other parts of the body.Risk factorsWhile there are some risk factors that you can’t change such as your age and genes, a rise in the number of breast cancer cases also points towards some lifestyle related factors. “There are a number of reasons, starting from late marriages to birthing children late. Also, not breastfeeding one’s newborn. In some cases, it’s also attributed to hormonal replacement therapy,” says Dr Shelly Singh, a senior gynaecologist at Delhi’s Rosewalk Hospital. Breast cancer is caused when the DNA in breast cells mutate or change, disabling specific functions that control cell growth and division. In many cases, these mutated cells die or are attacked by the immune system. But some cells escape the immune system and grow unchecked, forming a tumour in the breast.“Lack of exercise, obesity, alcohol consumption and smoking greatly adds to the rise in the number of cases,” opines Dr Deepak Kr Jain, who with wife Dr Shraddha Jain through Umeed NGO has established C4U (Comprehensive Cancer Care & cure) Cancer Centre at Vaishali , Ghaziabad that provides free OPD consultation, low cost diagnostic facilities and rehabilitation services by a team of highly qualified oncologists.“We provide chemotherapy treatment to all patients at around 70-80% cheaper than any private hospital. We don’t want an economically weaker section of the population to die standing in government hospital queues,” Jain adds.Excess body fat increases the estrogen levels in a woman’s body and hence increases the risk of getting breast cancer. “Estrogen makes hormone receptor positive that in turn helps breast cancers to develop and grow. Even increased insulin levels in obese women have been linked to breast cancer . Moreover, increased plasma cholesterol in obese women leads to accelerated tumor formation. Obesity also leads to chronic low-level inflammation - a process by which the body’s immune function malfunctions and causes DNA damage and leads to breast cancer,” elaborates By Dr Neha Khandelwal, senior gynaecologist, Madhukar Rainbow Hospital. SymptomsDifferent people have different symptoms of breast cancer. Some people do not have any signs or symptoms at all. Dr Jain points out the warning signs, “The usual first sign is a painless lump/mass in the breast. Also, changes in the size or shape of a breast. A dimpling or thickening of some of the skin on a part of a breast is a sign too.”A swelling or lump in an armpit is also experienced by people who have battled the dreaded disease. “Inverted nipple and scaling of the breast, it starts to get an appearance like an orange peel. Also, a nipple discharge other than breast milk, including blood are other symptoms,” says Dr Singh.MYTHS Myth: Finding a lump in your breast means you have breast cancer“Every lump is not cancer. Get yourself seen by oncologist for correct opinion,” says Dr Jain.Myth: Breast Cancer is contagious“None of the cancer is contagious, it does not spread by touching , eating food or sharing things” says Dr Jain.Myth: Antiperspirants and deodorants cause breast cancer“Some people believe it is because perspirants, that hasn’t been proved,” says Dr Singh.Prevention is better than cureEat healthyBeing overweight can increase the risk of many different cancers, including breast cancer, especially after menopause. “Eating healthy and eating mindfully helps in controlling weight and reducing the risk in turn. Obesity is an important but completely preventable cause of not only breast cancer, but a variety of other diseases,” says Dr Khandelwal. A healthy diet can help lower the risk of breast cancer. Try to eat a lot of fruits and vegetables and keep alcohol at moderate levels or lower (a drink a day or under)Avoid too much alcoholWhile moderate drinking can be good for the heart in older adults, even low levels of intake can increase the risk of breast cancer. If you don’t drink, don’t feel you need to start. If you drink moderately, there’s likely no reason to stop. But, if you drink more, you should cut down or quit.Being awareFor most women, regular mammograms can begin at age 40, but specific recommendations vary by age and risk. “Self-examination is required for all girls in the age group of 25-39 years. Preventive mammograms should be encouraged in women in the age group of 40- 55 years once in every 2 years,” Dr Singh.Breastfeed, if possibleBreastfeeding for a total of one year or more (combined for all children) lowers the risk of breast cancer. It also has great health benefits for the child.Don’t smokeSmokers and non-smokers alike know how unhealthy smoking is. On top of lowering quality of life and increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and at least 15 cancers – including breast cancer – it also causes smelly breath, bad teeth, and wrinkles. Now that’s motivation to stay smoke-free or work to get smoke-free.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/breast-cancer-awareness-month-all-about-breast-cancer-101635078301613.html

24-10-2021||India||‘India aims at $101 billion capital goods manufacturing by 2025’: Piyush Goyal||The national capital goods policy aims to increase domestic capital goods manufacturing output to $101 billion by 2025, a 225% jump from $31 billion in 2014-15, which will also help the Indian textiles machinery sector to become a global player, commerce and industry and textiles minister Piyush Goyal said on Sunday while interacting with textile machinery manufacturers in a video conference. The minister asked various arms of the government – textiles, heavy industries and digital innovation – to synergize and help the sector gain technical efficiency and become cost-competitive across the manufacturing value chain. The National Capital Goods Policy was approved by the cabinet in May 2016. The policy plans to ramp up capital goods production capacity from ₹2.3 lakh crore in 2014-15 to ₹7.5 lakh crore in 2025 and raise employment in the sector from 84 lakh to 3 crores. It addresses issues such as availability of finance, raw material, innovation and technology, productivity, quality and environment-friendly manufacturing practices, promoting exports and creating domestic demand.“The objectives of the policy will be met by the Department of Heavy Industry in a time-bound manner through obtaining approval for schemes as per the roadmap of policy interventions,” a government statement issued in May 2016 after the cabinet meeting said.Goyal urged the textile industry to focus on “speed, skill and scale” and set a target for developing 100 textile machinery champions. Textile machinery manufacturers should get out of a “command-and-control mindset” and work through “plug and play” to make the textile sector vibrant, a textile ministry statement said on Sunday quoting Goyal. “India should be looking to become a global player in producing textiles machinery, producing at scale, producing with quality and quantity the machinery of choice that the world requires,” it said quoting the minister.Goyal said India is “not averse to imports” but it must reduce import dependency of the textile machinery by concerted effort between the textile engineering industry and government. Focus on quality will help capture bigger markets and higher productivity, he added. A modern and upgraded textile machinery ecosystem would have a cascading impact on the unorganised Indian textile industry. This would set the momentum for continuous advancement and innovation resulting in ever-evolving and enhancing competitive capabilities along the value chain, he said.Referring to India’s recent achievement of 100 crore vaccines, the minister said that the historic achievement was the result of a collective effort of 130 crore Indians and a proof of India’s ‘Atmanirbharta’. He also cited the example of Mission Chandrayan, a breakthrough in India’s space programme and asked textile machinery manufacturers to make similar efforts. Goyal said India is on a mission of transformational change and the government has set a target of $100 billion for textiles and garment exports over the next five years. Indian Textile Engineering Industry (TEI) is at the cornerstone of moving up the manufacturing excellence wherein the domestic R&D, entrepreneurial spirit and exploration of Joint Ventures have ushered in new opportunities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-aims-at-101-billion-capital-goods-manufacturing-by-2025-piyush-goyal-101635077042085.html

The project was developed on Iruvazhinji river without disturbing the fragile eco-system, the CIAL said in a statement.The CIAL said it purchased five acres of land from 32 residents after giving them enough compensation and total project cost was ₹52 crore. The powerhouse will generate around 1.08 lakhs unit a day during peak flow days and it is estimated that the plant can operate at full capacity for 130 days a year and generate 14 million units annually, said CIAL, adding it was its largest project after achieving power neutrality in 2015.“Despite the pandemic threat we completed the project in estimated time. We are sure that this will impart further momentum to projects across the state which has 44 rivers and numerous streams, ”said CIAL managing director S Suhas.Also Read: Kerala graduate level common preliminary exam dates changed, check new schedule“The potential of renewable energy is immense.

24-10-2021||India||Shiv Sena rues ‘attempts’ to malign Savarkar, BJP accuses it of hypocrisy||In the backdrop of state energy minster and Congress leader Nitin Raut and Union defence minister Rajnath Singh's recent statements over Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, Shiv Sena has contended that there has been a deliberate attempt to malign Savarkar’s name and portray him as a villain. The party has also stated that Savarkar’s mercy plea was a tactical move so that he could continue his freedom fight further.Shiv Sena’s member of parliament (MP) in Rajya Sabha Sanjay Raut, contended in his weekly column ‘Rokthok’ in party mouthpiece Saamana on Sunday that the impression that Savarkar filed a mercy plea during the British rule to secure his freedom was totally wrong as he fought against the British rule his entire life.During a book launch on Savarkar,Union minister Rajnath Singh had recently said that Mahatma Gandhi persuaded Savarkar to file a mercy plea.“Lies are spread about Savarkar repeatedly. It was spread that he filed many mercy petitions seeking his release from jail. It was Mahatma Gandhi who asked him to file the mercy petitions...” the defence minister had said. More recently, Maharashtra’s energy minister Nitin Raut, a Congress leader, deleted his tweet on Savarkar that was considered offensive.Raut said it was a conspiracy to focus on Savarkar’s clemency petition while overlooking his contribution in the freedom struggle and the long time he spent in prison for it. “A French intellectual told our delegation that had a person like Savarkar been born in France and struggled for their independence, they would have made him the Head of state of France after independence,” Raut said, recounting his visit to France as part of a delegation in the ‘80s .Raut cited historian Y D Phadke’s research on Savarkar to say that the clemency plea was a tactical move by Savarkar to come out of the prison and continue with his revolutionary activities. “Y D Phadke has stated that we cannot take the language used in the clemency petition as true. The political conditions prevailing in India at that time along with the British ruler’s reaction to his plea all point to how Savarkar planned to get out of the prison. There was no point in rotting for 50 years in the Andaman jail (where Savarkar was kept between July 4, 1911 and May 2, 1921). Savarkar played the British till 1937 assuring them he was cooperating while continuing with his activities,” said Raut.Also Read: Hindutva faces threat from ‘neo-Hindus’, says UddhavRaut said that Savarkar had spent 10 years in jail and there was an overwhelming concern about his condition. Barrister Jamnadas Madhavji Mehta had formed an outfit to secure his release and the Congress party too had passed a resolution demanding his release. “The then Home Department official J A Shilidi was OK with Savarkar’s release but warned that Savarkar was a revolutionary and he was unlikely to cooperate with the British government. He will not change and will continue with his revolutionary activity,” Raut said about Shilidi’s opinion of Savarkar’s clemency.Savarkar was linked to the murder of AMT Jackson, the district magistrate of Nashik. He was extradited from England to India and for his alleged role in the assassination of Jackson and for waging war against the King, sentenced to two terms of 50 years to the Andamans, infamous as Kala Pani. He arrived in Port Blair on July 4, 1911. Here he was subjected to horrific conditions like being yoked to the oil mill.Raut rued that during the freedom struggle Savarkar was a hero but after independence, consistent attempts were made to malign him.The BJP has criticised the Shiv Sena accusing it of having double standards on Savarkar. “When Congress leader Rahul Gandhi made objectionable remarks on Savarkar two years back, the Sena kept mum, and now with elections approaching, the Sena wakes up to Hindutva and [expresses] love for Savarkar,” said BJP legislator Ram Kadam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-rues-attempts-to-malign-savarkar-bjp-accuses-it-of-hypocrisy-101635072480501.html
24-10-2021||India||‘9 new medical colleges, new pan-India health scheme’: Here’s what PM Modi will launch in UP on Oct 25||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate as many as nine medical colleges in Uttar Pradesh on Monday during his visit to Siddharthnagar district in the state, a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said. Besides, he will launch the Pradhan Mantri Atmanirbhar Swasth Bharat Yojana (PMASBY) – a pan-India health scheme to boost the healthcare infrastructure of the country.On October 16, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath mentioned PM Modi inaugurating multiple medical colleges in the northern state, including the newly constructed Siddharthanagar Medical College named after Jan Sangh founder leader Madhav Prasad Tripathi.According to the PMO release, apart from Siddharthanagar, the remaining eight medical colleges will be inaugurated in Hardoi, Pratapgarh, Fatehpur, Ghazipur, Mirzapur, Jaunpur, Etah and Deoria districts on Monday.The Centre said that eight medical institutions have been sanctioned under the centrally sponsored scheme, which aims to set up colleges attached with district or referral hospitals, while one institution to be inaugurated in Jaunpur on Monday has been made operational by the Adityanath-led state government using its own resources.Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel and Union minister of health and family welfare Mansukh Mandaviya will also be present at the event. Furthermore, PM Modi will also inaugurate many development projects worth more than ₹5, 200 crore in Varanasi.For institutions established under the centrally sponsored scheme, preference is generally given to “underserved, backward and aspirational districts.” Its agenda is to increase the availability of health professionals in these regions, rectify the “geographical imbalance” in the distribution of medical institutes, and effectively utilise the existing infrastructure of district hospitals.“Under three phases of the Scheme, 157 new medical colleges have been approved across the nation, out of which 63 medical colleges are already functional,” the PMO statement read.As far as PMASBY is concerned, the statement explained that it aims to fill “critical gaps in public health infrastructure, especially in critical care facilities and primary care in both the urban and rural areas.”Notably, the nationwide health scheme, which is an additional benefit available for Indian citizens to avail of, was first announced in Union Budget 2021-22 on February 1. An outlay of about ₹64,180 crore over six years (till financial year of 2025-26) has been sanctioned for the scheme.Here are some of the key objectives of PMASBY:1.     To provide support to a total of 17,788 rural health and wellness centres in 10 high focus states of India.2.     Setting up of integrated public health laboratories in all districts of 11 high focus states along with 3,382 block public health units.3.     Establishing critical care hospital blocks in more than 600 districts and 12 central institutions.4.     Strengthening the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), its five regional branches and as many as 20 metropolitan health surveillance units.5.     Establishing up to 15 health emergency operation centres and two mobile hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-inaugurate-nine-new-medical-colleges-during-visit-to-up-on-monday-101635071350682.html

A video of Prabhakar has come to the surface while he has filed an affidavit on the same issue, according to reports.Here is what Prabhakar Sail said in his affidavit:1. On October 1, Gosavi called Sail and asked him to be ready by 7.30am the next day. Gosavi apparently left for Ahmedabad. On October 2, Sail was sent a location in the evening which was the NCB office and was asked to come the next day. On October 3 (after the raid), Sail reached the NCB office when Gosavi was inside with an NCB officer. Both of them left and instructed him to wait.2. After some time, Gosavi came back and met one person named Sam d'souza 500 metre away from the NCB office. They spoke for five minutes, Prabhakar said.Sanjay Raut shares a video of Aryan Khan, Nawab Malik says 'Satyamev Jayate'3. After the 5-minute meeting Gosavi was back with Prabhakar and they were on the way to someplace. Gosavi was talking to Sam over the phone. "...you put a bomb of 25 crore and let's settle at 18 final because we have to give 8 crore to Sameer Wankhede," Gosavi said, as claimed by his driver.Watch: Aryan Khan's new video, claim by witness Gosavi's 'ex-aide' spark new storm4. Shah Rukh Khan's manager Pooja Dadlani came and met Sam, Gosavi and the three talked inside a car.5. Gosavi apparently asked Sail to collect 50 lakh cash from a spot which he did and handed over the money to Gosavi, Sail said. Then the driver was asked to give the money to Sam.

Sail was called at the NCB office as a witness too where he saw Aryan Khan. "When I reached inside the NCB office Sameer Wankhede instructed the staff to take my signature and one, Salekar from NCB told me to sign on 10 blank papers. NCB officer asked me for Aadhaar details but I was not carrying an Adhar card so I told him to send a soft copy on WhatsApp," he said.The revelations have created a stir in the ongoing case of Aryan Khan as Maharashtra ministers have been alleging that the NCB is only after the celebrities. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut shared a video of Aryan Khan at the NCB custody and raised questions over NCB's functioning.

CRPF said an area domination party of the force was targeted by suspected terrorists just outside the 178 battalion camp.“Preliminary information is that a camp party outside the 178 battalion camp was fired upon and they retaliated. We are ascertaining the details,” said CRPF spokesperson, Junaid Khan.Police said Rather was killed in cross firing. Shopian superintendent of police Amritpal Singh said around 10:30am unidentified militants attacked a checkpoint search party of CRPF’s 178 Battalion at Babapora in Shopian.“CRPF retaliated and one unidentified person was killed in the cross firing. Further details are being ascertained,” Singh said.This is the second such death in Kashmir this month. On October 7, Parvaiz Ahmad Bokad, a tribal, was killed when CRPF opened fire on a vehicle, allegedly charging at a checkpoint at Monghal Bridge in south Kashmir’s Anantnag district.Also Read: Mehbooba Mufti hits out at CDS Rawat’s warning of further curbs in KashmirPolice then said that the vehicle without number plate was signalled to stop by CRPF’s Naka-party, however, it instead sped towards the CRPF party, prompting the troops to open fire.Bokad’s family had protested his death and said he didn’t deserve to be killed irrespective of whether he jumped a naka (barricade) or not.Sunday’s incident comes amid a heightened security environment in Jammu and Kashmir following suspected terrorists killing 11 civilians including non-locals and minorities this month. Home minister Amit Shah has been reviewing the security situation during his first visit to the Union Territory (UT) since the abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019 and splitting of the region into two UTs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/youth-killed-in-crossfire-between-crpf-and-terrorists-in-south-kashmir-101635068819965.html

Addressing a meeting of party workers at Nashik in Maharashtra, Raut also alleged that not more than 23 crore doses were given to eligible beneficiaries so far, news agency PTI reported.Further, the Shiv Sena leader also claimed that he would provide proof that the ‘billion doses administered’ claim was wrong, the PTI report further showed.“How much will you lie?” Raut asked without specifying any names. “In the last fortnight, 20 Hindus and Sikhs have been killed, 17 to 18 soldiers have been martyred, China is creating problems in Arunachal Pradesh and Ladakh, but we are celebrating 100 crore vaccination, which is not true,” PTI quoted him as saying during the meeting. “Who has counted these numbers?,” he further asked.Meanwhile, reacting to the claims by Raut, Maharashtra BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said that the Shiv Sena leader’s comments were “laughable.” He also said that the party leaders are used to making baseless claims.“Raut's comment on 100 crore vaccination, when the figures are clearly seen, is nothing but laughable,” PTI quoted Upadhye as saying.Earlier this week, on October 21 the cumulative doses administered under the Covid-19 vaccination drive in the country achieved a major milestone by crossing the one-billion mark. The Centre celebrated the achievement through several events, especially by illuminating 100 landmarks across the country in the Tricolour.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya and several political leaders conveyed their wishes on the occasion. In addition, countries like the US, Israel and global bodies like the World Health Organisation (WHO) also lauded the achievement.From the opposition, the Congress party has also criticised the government for the celebrations and the party’s national spokesperson Pawan Khera said that it was an “insult” to the people and families that are suffering from the effects of the pandemic to credit the government for the vaccination record. Karnataka Congress leader Siddaramaiah also questioned the celebrations and said that the percentage of people fully immunised in the country was still low.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-are-celebrating-100-crore-vaccination-but-shiv-sena-s-sanjay-raut-says-claim-about-vaccinations-false-101635066985300.html

Stating that Jammu was earlier facing much discrimination, Shah said the administration was now ensuring there was equitable development of the Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh.The Union home minister is on a three-day visit to the Union territory, his first since the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution on August 5, 2019 that granted special status to the erstwhile state. He said justice was done to all, including the Valmikis, Paharis, Gujjars, Bakerwals, refugees of West Pakistan and women.Shah inaugurated a new campus of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Jammu earlier in the day, following which he headed to address a public rally at the Bhagwati Nagar ground.Also read | Delimitation will happen, J&K statehood to be restored: Amit Shah in SrinagarHe said that while some wanted to derail the era of development in the region, the government had ensured that did not happen. Several laws were introduced, including the Forest Rights Act, to ensure justice for all sections of society.“It is the land of temples, of Mata Vaishno Devi, of Prem Nath Dogra, the land of sacrifice of Syama Prasad Mukherjee. We will not allow anyone to sabotage and scuttle this journey of development."“I came to Jammu today to say that the time of injustice to the people of Jammu is over, now no one can do injustice to you,” Shah said.“Some people are raising questions about security. Between 2004 and 2014, 2,081 people lost their lives -- 208 people were killed every year. From 2014 to September 2021, 239 people lost their lives. But we are not satisfied. We want to create an atmosphere where no one loses life to terrorism,” Shah said, adding those living along the International Border were given reservations. "Gujjars will also get it shortly,” he added.Also read | Amit Shah says August 5 for J&K will be written in 'golden letters'Hitting out at the former rulers of the erstwhile state, Shah said, “Three families that have ruined J&K were questioning our agenda. May I ask them that you ruled for so long, what have you done? People of J&K want you to explain what did you do for them for all these years?”“Today is the birth anniversary of Prem Nath Dogra. People of India can't forget him. He along with Shyama Prasad Mukherjee gave the slogan that in a country two ‘vidhan’, two ‘nishan’, two ‘pradhan' will not work,” he said."Earlier, there were four to five medical colleges. Now, plenty are being opened. Earlier, there were 500 doctors. That has now gone up to 5,000. Today, we saw the most advanced IIT in Jammu. Talked to IIT, IIM directors to explore satellite campuses in J&K for admissions of the UT’s youth.”Shah said 25,000 jobs were given to the UT’s youth recently. “Today alone 7,000 people got jobs. Our new industrial policy was mocked by the three families, but already there is investment worth ₹12,000 crore. As many as five lakh youth will get jobs out of investment worth ₹51,000 crore by 2022,” the home minister said, adding the administration would ensure nobody remained without LPG, electricity and water.The home minister further said a metro network would come up after two years in Jammu and Srinagar, while airports were being upgraded at the moment.He said the coronavirus pandemic wreaked havoc across the world, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi did everything possible to contain its spread and kept the number of deaths to minimal. “J&K Was the first UT to have achieved 100 per cent vaccination in the country,” he added.(With inputs from bureau)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wont-let-anyone-derail-development-amit-shah-says-in-jammu-101635066351186.html
24-10-2021||India||'Will stick to real issues': Navjot Sidhu amid Aroosa Alam row with Congress||Amid the ongoing row over Pakistani journalist Aroosa Alam, Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Sunday attacked his own party, reminding them to come back to its "real issues" that concern every Punjabi and future generations. Refraining from mentioning the issue directly, Sidhu said he will not let the "real issues" take a backseat.Sidhu's remarks come in the backdrop of the ongoing war of words and personal attacks on former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh over his friendship with Pakistani journalist Aroosa Alam. Deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa has questioned Alam's apparent links with Pakistan ISI, adding a probe will be carried to ascertain the same. Reacting to it, Captain called the speculations “baseless" and accused the deputy CM of resorting to personal attacks.“Punjab must come back to its real issues that concern every punjabi and our future generations...How will we counter the financial emergency that stares upon us? I will stick to the real issues and not let them take a backseat!,” Sidhu said in a series of tweets.In another tweet, Sidhu said the choice was clear between irreparable damage and the last chance for damage control. He further asked, “Who will bring back state’s resources to the state’s coffers, instead of letting them go to private pockets”."Who will lead the initiative for the resurrection of our great state to prosperity!,” he added, in what could be a reference to illegal mining of sand and its transport in Punjab."Let the mist clear, reality shine like the sun upon the roadmap for revival of Punjab, shunning those who protect the selfish vested interests and focus only on the path that will lead to Jittega Punjab, Jittegi Punjabiyat and Jittega Har Punjabi (triumph of Punjab, Punjabiyat and Punjabis)!” read his third tweet on Sunday.On Saturday, Amarinder Singh released purported photos of former Punjab DGP Mohammad Mustafa's wife and daughter-in-law with Aroosa Alam through his media adviser Raveen Thukral. "Mixing politics with friendship! Aroosa Alam personally cherishes these and many more such memories with your family," Captain tweeted. The former DGP replied on Twitter and said even during bitter fights “we draw a line”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-stick-to-real-issues-navjot-sidhu-amid-aroosa-alam-row-with-congress-101635062246763.html

They will do anything to disturb peace in Jammu and Kashmir," Rawat said. He added that whenever Pakistan finds a semblance of peace happening here, it will create a situation that creates fear-mongering among people.Mufti, who is the former chief minister of Jammu & Kashmir, tweeted on Sunday that 'repression' is the Centre's only method to deal with the situation in the Valley. “It also contradicts their official narrative that all is well here,” Mufti said.The PDP president also questioned what more was left to do in Kashmir after ‘stringent and harsh measures’ like mass arrest, suspending internet services at will and setting up new security bunkers etc were already implemented.After taking such stringent, harsh & repressive measures like mass arrests, suspension of internet at will, frisking people (not sparing even kids), seizing bikes plus two wheelers & setting up new security bunkers all over what is left to do? pic.twitter.com/qMlCV8pDixIn October, terrorists killed 11 civilians in Jammu and Kashmir and most of these were from other states. Security has been further tightened in the valley, especially in Srinagar and the police detained and questioned hundreds of people as a part of their investigation in these targeted killings. Two weeks back, the police said that 13 terrorists had been killed.Meanwhile, Rawat assured on Saturday that there is nothing to fear and the security forces are capable of dealing with such situations."There is a proxy war. They will try and perpetrate an action that causes fear amongst the people. Our thing is to bring back confidence in the people that you should not get worried about, your security forces, police forces, anybody who's operating the civil administration, are capable of dealing with the situation. And, therefore, they should not get worried. We will ensure that these are not allowed to happen continuously and that your safety and security is our prime concern," he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehbooba-mufti-hits-out-at-cds-rawat-s-warning-of-further-curbs-in-kashmir-101635062376133.html
24-10-2021||India||PM Modi stresses on unity while lauding India’s capability in Mann ki Baat||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday credited healthcare workers for making India’s Covid vaccination programme a success and crossing the milestone of administering one billion vaccine doses earlier this week.Addressing the 82nd edition of his monthly radio programme ‘Mann Ki Baat’, the PM said the success of the vaccination drive demonstrated India’s capability and the power of joint effort.“Our healthcare workers through their hard work and determination have set a new example. I knew that they would leave no stone unturned in vaccinating people…After administering 100 crore vaccine doses, the country is moving ahead with a new energy and vigour,” Modi said. He made special mention of the Uttarakhand government and its healthcare workers for inoculating 100% of the adult population with the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine despite the challenges due to difficult terrain in the hilly state.PM also cited Manipur’s example where vaccines were delivered via drone to an island and said that Telangana had held trials for vaccine delivery using drones.Talking about the government’s new drone policy, the PM said, “Earlier, there were so many rules, laws and restrictions in this sector that it was not possible to unlock the real potential of a drone. The technology that should have been seen as an opportunity was seen as a crisis.”With the introduction of the new drone policy, the PM said, the foreign and domestic investors have invested in many drone start-ups. “We have to become a leading country in drone technology…Many companies are also setting up manufacturing units. The army, navy and the air force have also placed orders worth more than ₹500 crores with Indian drone companies.”As the country gears up to celebrate 75 years of independence next year, the PM paid tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.“Sardar Patel used to say that we can take the nation to new heights if we are united. With national unity, the nation gets stature and development,” said the PM.On Patel’s birth anniversary on October 31, also celebrated as the National Unity Day, the PM said the Union ministry of culture will launch three competitions for writing patriotic songs, rangoli design and lullabies.“It is essential that these creations reflect the thought of new India, inspired by the current success of the country, it should be such that it fuels the country’s resolve for the future… In lullabies, there should be a reference to modern India, the vision of 21st century India and its dreams,” he said.Also Read: PM Modi highlights ‘big role’ of Indian women in UN during 82nd Mann Ki BaatHe also remembered iconic tribal leader and freedom fighter Birsa Munda, whose birth anniversary is on November 15. On the occasion of the United Nations Day on Sunday, Prime Minister Modi said India’s women played a big role in enhancing UN’s power and influence.“In 1947-48, when the universal declaration of UN human rights was being prepared, it was initially written that ‘All men are created equal’. But a delegate from India, Hansa Mehta objected to this and it then got changed in the declaration to ‘All human beings are created equal’ . This was in line with India’s old-age tradition of gender equality,” the PM said. Citing the Bureau of Police Research and Development, the PM said that women representation in police forces has more than doubled between 2014 and 2020 from 1.05 lakh to 2.15 lakh. He said women were now getting trained as specialised jungle warfare commandos.“They will be a part of our Cobra Battalion. Friends, today when we go to airports, metro stations or see government offices, brave CISF women personnel are seen guarding every sensitive place,” he said.The PM, once again, urged people to promote locally manufactured items during the festive season. “If you buy local, then your festival will also be illuminated and the house of a poor brother or sister, an artisan, or a weaver will also lit up. I am sure that the campaign which we all have started together will be stronger this time during the festivals,” said Modi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-stresses-on-unity-while-lauding-india-s-capability-in-mann-ki-baat-101635066059848.html

24-10-2021||India||United Nations celebrates climate action in India on founding day||The United Nations (UN) in India commemorated the 76th year of its founding with a celebration of climate action in India, highlighting its enduring partnership with the government and the people of India. The commemoration also showcased the incremental role young people are playing in India achieving its climate ambition.Speaking at the in-person commemoration, Union minister of state for new and renewable energy, Bhagwanth Khuba, said, “Over the years, India and the UN have cooperated closely on our shared objectives of world peace and the guarantee of sustainable development. The Decade of Action for the Sustainable Development Goals is upon us. And unprecedented actions are needed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. I believe the UN Day theme of climate action is timely.”The first-ever solar-powered UN Day, organised in partnership with the International Solar Alliance, highlighted India’s pioneering leadership on climate action. Surya Bhavan – which hosts the ISA secretariat – was illuminated in the colours of the Sustainable Development Goals to underscore India’s ambition on renewables and commitment to the Agenda 2030.“India has already scripted history by halving poverty and by rapidly bringing lighted homes, safe sanitation, and clean fuel to millions. India has made tremendous gains in accelerating progress towards the SDGs. Now, India is about to script history on climate action. And we look forward to its contribution,” said Yasmin Ali Haque, on behalf of the UN in India.India’s partnership with the UN spans all seven decades of its life. India signed the founding Charter of the United Nations in San Francisco on June 26, 1945. The Charter came into force on October 24 of the same year, an anniversary commemorated worldwide as UN Day.“The values that have powered the UN Charter for the last 76 years — peace, development, human rights, and opportunity for all — have no expiry date. As we mark UN Day, let’s unite behind these ideals, and live up to the full promise, potential and hope of the United Nations,” said the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in his video message on UN Day.India has taken a global leadership position in combating climate change with its strategic and timely climate policies. Currently, India is on track to meet its climate goals. India stands fifth in overall renewable energy installed capacity, which stands at more than 141 gigawatts, about 37 per cent of the country’s total capacity.Ajay Mathur, director-general, International Solar Alliance, said, “Solar already provides the cheapest electricity in many parts of the world, but only when the sun is shining. At the upcoming CoP, we need to create international collaboration that enables cost-effective round-the-clock solar electricity. And collaboration to enable the ideas of young people to take root into concrete products and processes.”The UN Day event also marks the culmination of the UN in India’s #WeTheChangeNow campaign, which showcases innovative and equitable climate solutions pioneered by young Indians. On the occasion, the UN in India organised a dialogue between some of India’s climate trailblazers — Garvita Gulhati, Nidhi Pant and Sanju Soman and policymakers Khuba and Mathur — on the role of young people in advancing climate action in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/united-nations-celebrates-climate-action-in-india-on-founding-day-101635065100759.html

We have to keep an eye on who's coming from outside, checking should be done.”Also Read | China’s foray into South Asia, Indian Ocean not in India’s interest: General Bipin RawatGeneral Bipin Rawat said that while it is true that the locals and tourists in Jammu & Kashmir may have to face the burden of heavy checking as a result of the high level of alert, they should understand that it is for their own safety and security. In a similar vein, the defence chief said that every citizen in India should get themselves educated about internal security.“Nobody will come to our defence, we have to defend ourselves, defend our people, and defend our property,” he said. “Internal security is very much a concern for us and in order to defend, I think we must actually educate our people about internal security.”Not only must citizens get themselves educated on the subject, but also fulfil their duties towards internal security, General Rawat posited.“If every citizen plays his and her part, you can deal with the situation,” he said, adding, “People come and live in your neighbourhood; you must know who lives in your neighbourhood. No terrorist can stay in our neighbourhood if we are agile. Every citizen should question if they feel suspicious about anyone and inform the local police about it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/must-prepare-defence-chief-gen-bipin-rawat-says-afghanistan-crisis-can-overflow-into-kashmir-101635048427255.html

In February 2020, the accused executed an agreement and made the victim deposit ₹20 lakhs in the official account of ITDC, maintained at Delhi, but also took ₹30 lakhs in cash as facilitation fee. However, when the victim did not get any communication from ITDC Ltd., he realised that he had been duped. He subsequently suffered a stroke and was paralysed, losing his speech and memory,” said the DIG.Also Read: Odisha former tourism minister urges direct flights from Bhubaneswar to DehradunAfter the victim’s wife lodged a complaint with the Economic Offences Wing of Odisha police, Sahu was arrested from Cuttack and charged under different sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) including 419, 420, 467, 468 and 471.Main accused Chandan Akash Mohanty, was arrested last month in a separate case while posing as a self-styled godman.

A police officer aware of the developments in the case said Sahu on Wednesday confessed to have strangulated woman teacher Mamita Meher in his car on October 8 to prevent her from exposing his extramarital affairs.Meher worked as a teacher in Sunshine English medium school in Mahaling village of Kalahandi district. The school is one of the three educational institutes started by Sahu in the area.NCPCR said Gobinda Sahu was accused of tempting schoolgirls and boys, often promising them good marks in return for sexual favours. The child rights body also took note of allegations that the BJD minister was a frequent visitor to the school and allegedly patronised Sahu, the lynchpin in the case.The Bolangir SP has been asked to submit a detailed probe report including the age and number of girls and boys in the school and school authority and officials’ role in the case within 5 days. The NCPCR has asked the SP to furnish copies of FIR, medico-legal reports, statements of the victims, orders of Child Welfare Committee and action taken against the accused. The SP has also been directed to ensure that identity of the victims is not disclosed during the process of investigation or its reporting.Also Read: Odisha former tourism minister urges direct flights from Bhubaneswar to DehradunVanathi Srinivasan, the national president of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Mahila Morcha, demanded that chief minister Naveen Patnaik sack Mishra for his alleged involvement in the case.“It has emerged that Gobinda Sahu has a record of running a sex racket and has been accused of luring girl students from his school into flesh trade, promising them good marks in exams. There are reports about the Odisha minister spending a lot of time in the private school’s premises and there were clear efforts on his part to protect and shield the accused who is his close associate,” she said, alleging that even the family members of the deceased teacher have raised serious charges against the minister in the case.Senior Congress leader Narasingha Mishra has offered to fight the case on behalf of the family of the deceased woman teacher . “If the family wishes and gives me the charge of the case, I will take it up and fight in the courtroom to deliver justice to the family,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-minister-accused-of-shielding-man-who-allegedly-sexually-exploited-school-kids-101635047637722.html

According to news agency ANI, a multitude of fossils hunted at the site, dating as far back as 252 million years ago, were displayed at the workshop. However, one of the key attractions of the day was the evidence of the world's first tsunami lying buried at the site in Khanmoh.This is a global heritage & for almost 20 years a constant work is going on to save it. Mass extinction of marine & plant lives that occurred 252 million years ago destroyed 95% of marine life which is a huge loss: Archaeology Professor GM Bhat said yesterday pic.twitter.com/G0x5fjdHTYWhat is the Permian–Triassic extinction event?Also known as the End-Permian Extinction or, colloquially, the ‘Great Dying’, the Permian-Triassic extinction event marked the boundaries between the Permian and Triassic geological periods, as well as between the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras approximately 251.9 million years ago.It was one of the major extinction events that the planet ever saw, when biodiversity decreased rapidly and across wide stretches. According to the National Academy of Sciences, in the End-Permian Extinction event, as many as 57% of the world's biological families, including 83% of genera, 81% of marine life, and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species went extinct. It was also the largest known mass extinction of insects.Significance of the Guryul Ravine fossil site in KashmirThe Guryul Ravines in Kashmir, geologically known as the Vihi district, are a repository of fossils that hold evidence of the Permian–Triassic extinction event, dating as far as back 260 million years, one of the oldest of its types in the entire world. Most importantly, the world's first-ever recorded tsunami event is well preserved in the rocks of Guryul Ravines.Owing to immense evidence from the Permian/Triassic boundary that the Guryul Ravine rocks preserve, scientists and geologists from all over the world – especially from the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, China, Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Austria, and Scotland – have been visiting this area for furthering their research studies.Speaking to ANI, archaeology professor GM Bhat said, “This is a global heritage and for almost 20 years there is a constant work is going on to save it.”Kashmir fossil site “much larger” than the one in ChinaThe Khonmoh P-T section of 3 metres is “much, much larger” than 27 cms of the Meishan Section in China, according to experts cited by the news agency, who added that this makes the fossil site in Kashmir attract millions of tourists every year. Nadeem Ahmad, a local resident, told ANI that the three-meter fossil in Khonmoh is “much more” than what is available in China. This is what makes the site special, he added."The site preserves all evidence on how evolution and extinction occurred here. For zoologists this a treasure and as a local I want is to preserve it," he was quoted as saying.Khanmoh District Development Council (DDC) member Aijaz Hussian, who was present at Saturday's workshop, thanked government officials for their efforts and initiative.“I thank the administration who have initiated this workshop,” Hussain was quoted as saying. “We have been told by the scientists that this is the one oldest heritage site in the world. We should develop this for our coming generations, too.”“The government should focus on workshops like this, to attract more attention to the site,” he added. “This can add Khanmoh another great tourist spot on the map.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/252millionyearold-fossil-site-in-j-k-s-khanmoh-preserves-world-s-first-tsunami-101635035588177.html

Speaking about vaccine hesitancy, he said while this was a problem in many developed countries, but the administering of 100 crore doses reveal this was not an issue in India.In his last ‘Mann Ki Baat’ address, Modi urged the people to follow the principles of Mahatma Gandhi, who, he said worked towards making cleanliness a mass movement, and urged the people to keep the rivers in our country clean.

The Congress has a nexus with the BJP. I have concrete evidence to prove it. Let them condemn it, I will reveal the proof,” KTR, as chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s son is called, told reporters.He pointed out that even former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, who recently quit the Congress, said the party would give a lot of priority to those with RSS background.He said BJP candidate in Huzurabad Eatala Rajender had recently met Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president A Revanth Reddy to conspire against the TRS. “Rajender is a common candidate for the Congress and the BJP,” he said.Rajender was a cabinet colleague of KTR till recently, and he had the health portfolio. He was sacked from the Cabinet on May 1, on charges of land encroachments. He later resigned from his assembly membership and joined the BJP.The TRS working president pointed out that in the past too, the Congress and the BJP had a secret understanding to defeat the TRS in Karimnagar and Nizamabad during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.“Similar attempt was made in the by-election to Nagarjunasagar assembly seat in April this year. Former Congress MP Vishweshwar Reddy openly appealed to the people to vote for Rajender in the Huzurabad bypolls.

Rajender, who was campaigning in Huzurabad, said it was true that he had met the PCC chief after coming out of the TRS, but before joining the BJP.“Not just Revanth Reddy, I had met scores of leaders from across the political spectrum, including those from CPI, CPI (M) and Telangana Jana Samithi to seek their support for my fight against the TRS.

In fact, Godse’s new avatar is now resting in Pragathi Bhavan (the official residence of the chief minister),” Ali said.He pointed out that the Congress had been fighting against the BJP across the country. “But it was TRS which has been supporting the BJP government at the Centre on various issues, right from demonetisation to controversial farm laws,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktr-alleges-congress-bjp-nexus-in-run-up-to-bypolls-for-huzurabad-assembly-seat-101635023571410.html
24-10-2021||India||Everyone is goal oriented, says PM Modi; draws football analogy to praise Goa govt||Prime Minister Narendra Modi used a football analogy to take a dig at political opponents, comparing them to a team that lacked ‘team spirit’ and added that it was selfishness that was at the forefront in the political sphere. Interacting with the people of Goa involved with the ‘Atma Nirbhar Bharat, Swayampurna Goy (Goa)’ the localised version of the Atma Nirbhar campaign, the Prime Minister was all praise for the work done by the BJP-led government in the state which he said had brought stability. “In football, whether it is defence or forward, everyone is goal-oriented. Someone has to save a goal while others have to score goals. The feeling of achieving each other’s goal has never been short in Goa, but the earlier governments lacked team spirit, they could not create a positive environment. For a long time, political selfishness has been taking a toll on good governance,” the Prime Minister said, adding that it was not possible to separate Goa from football since “the passion for football in Goa is something else altogether”. “Political instability also damaged the prospect of progress in Goa. But, in the last few years, the smart people of Goa turned this instability into stability. My friend late Manohar Parrikar put Goa on the path of fast progress and Pramod Sawant and his team is scaling new heights now. Today, Goa is moving ahead with new self-confidence,” the PM said. “I had said from the ramparts of the Red Fort on August 15 that we should take these schemes to saturation point to ensure 100 per cent coverage. Pramod Sawant and his team are playing a leading role in achieving these objectives,” he said. He mentioned that the Goa government was able to reach 100 per cent of the open defecation free objective, 100% electrification objective, 100% piped water supply target and 100 per cent coverage of providing free ration to the poor.“I am pleased to say about the schemes initiated by the central government for providing safety and respect for women, Goa has implemented them successfully on ground, whether it is toilets, Ujwala gas connection or the Jan Dhan bank account. Goa has done great work on this count,” the Prime Minister said. “That is why during the lockdown, thousands of women got free gas cylinders, money could be credited to their bank accounts,” he added. During the interaction, the Prime Minister spoke to a cross section of government officers who coordinated the outreach programme, some among the people who benefited from it as well as local elected representatives on their experience of rolling out the programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/everyone-is-goal-oriented-says-pm-modi-draws-football-analogy-to-praise-goa-govt-101635020211071.html
24-10-2021||India||Ahead of Goa visit, TMC chief Mamata Banerjee urges political parties to unite against BJP||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday urged political parties to unite against the Bharatiya Janata Party and its ‘divisive agenda’ ahead of her maiden visit to Goa next week even as her nephew Abhishek Banerjee attacked the Congress. “As I prepare for my maiden visit to Goa on 28th, I call upon all individuals, organisations and political parties to join forces to defeat the BJP and their divisive agenda. The people of Goa have suffered enough over the last 10 years,” Banerjee tweeted. Election to the 40-member Goa assembly is likely to be held early next year. The TMC after returning to power for the third consecutive time with a sweeping victory in the recently held West Bengal Assembly polls has made inroads in BJP-ruled Goa and Tripura. “Together, we will usher in a new dawn for Goa by forming a new govt that will truly be a govt of the people of Goa and committed to realising their aspirations! #GoenchiNaviSaka,” she tweeted. In September, the TMC had sent a team of senior leaders, including Rajya Sabha MP Derek O’Brien and Lok Sabha MP Prasun Banerjee to Goa, to assess the political situation before taking the plunge. Former Goa chief minister and veteran Congress leader Luizinho Faleiro has already joined the TMC. On Friday, the TMC had appointed Faleiro as its vice president less than a month of his joining the party. Earlier this month, boxer Lenny Da Gama and footballer Denzil Franco joined the party. Political strategist Prashant Kishor has been working with members of the Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC) to boost the party’s footprint in the western state and help the party gain ahead of assembly elections. “Political parties are uniting against Mamata Banerjee. So she must fight that first before asking political parties to unite against the BJP,” said Rahul Sinha, senior BJP leader. Even as Mamata Banerjee was trying to unite the opposition her nephew Abhishek Banerjee upped the ante against the Congress while addressing a political rally in West Bengal. “For the last seven years Congress has been losing against the BJP. The TMC is winning against the BJP. The Congress sometimes made settlements with the BJP to defeat the TMC, while sometimes it formed alliances with the CPIM and Indian Secular Front. The party has no ideal and hence has no place in Bengal,” he said. The Congress, however, lashed out saying that the TMC should keep the electoral arithmetic in mind before taking on the BJP. “The TMC should keep in mind the national electoral arithmetic in which the Congress still holds 20% of the vote. Without the Congress the TMC, which just has around 4% votes, won’t be able to fight the BJP. Attacking the Congress would strengthen the BJP. It seems that the TMC doesn’t want to actually fight the BJP,” said Adhir Chowdhury, leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha. Abhishek Banerjee, who was appointed the party’s national general secretary earlier this year, announced that the TMC party will expand its base in at least five states other than Goa and Tripura and set up working units in 15 other states ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-goa-visit-tmc-chief-mamata-banerjee-urges-political-parties-to-unite-against-bjp-101635017031050.html

24-10-2021||India||Marriage being used for unlawful conversion: UP||Marriage is increasingly being used as an instrument of coercion to convert individuals from one religion to another and also for fuelling terrorist activities, the Uttar Pradesh government has told the Allahabad high court while defending a contentious new anti-conversion law that, it claimed, will guarantee all individuals “an equal moral membership in the society”.In an affidavit responding to a clutch of public interest litigations (PILs) challenging the 2021 UP Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act, the state government has emphasised that when the “marriage is one of the instruments being abused for unlawfully converting individuals”, the state cannot abdicate its responsibility to regulate the alliance of two adults.“To love is to live better but the agency of an individual to love cannot be eroded by exercising undue influence on them and forcibly converting them to a different religion under the garb of a better lifestyle. The institution of marriage forms the bedrock of any individual’s most profound hopes and aspirations. To discount such an institution and use it as a soul instrumentals conversion goes against the very ideals of our constitution which is premised on the idea of individual autonomy,” maintained the affidavit.Contesting the issues relating to possible breach of privacy of individuals by regulating something as personal as a marriage, the UP government said that while an individual’s agency and capacity to love may unequivocally fall within the sphere of privacy, “this does not mean that a welfare state should abdicate responsibility to ensure that such agency is not threatened by extraneous factors such as coercion, fraud etc which are very much contagious to the society and are a matter of great concern.”According to the affidavit, the Act aims to ensure that the decision of an individual to convert to another religion is “theirs and theirs alone” since forcible conversions strike at the heart of personal autonomy and devalue the sense of identity and dignity of an individual.The UP government passed the law, commonly referred to as the “love-jihad” law in February this year, following enacting the ordinance on the same subject in November 2020. The law prescribes a jail term up to 10 years and fine up to ₹50,000 for conversion under marriage, fraud, coercion or enticement.The ordinance had come into force days after chief minister Yogi Adityanath promised to fight against “love jihad”, a term used by some right-wing groups to describe relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women.Several activists and legal experts have argued that the law could be used to target Muslims and infringe on the fundamental rights to equality, freedom of religion, and life and personal liberty.But the state, in its affidavit filed on Friday before a bench led by justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari, maintained that although the 2021 law is on unlawful conversion and marriage is simply incidental, there are first information reports (FIRs) as well as a report of the Uttar Pradesh anti-terrorism squad to demonstrate that the social fabric in the state is threatened by a spurt in forcible conversions.The statistics submitted by the state showed a total of 79 prosecutions had been launched on charges of unlawful conversion between January 1, 2020 and July 6, 2021. The ATS report of August 2021 claimed that there is a syndicate running in UP to unlawfully convert men and women to Islam and hawala transactions were involved in funding such activities.“There is a compelling state interest in preventing the disproportionate forcible conversions of women in the state. Forcible conversion strikes at the heart of personal autonomy and individual agency. This compelling state interest is also furthered when it is revealed that such conversions are being used as an instrument for terrorist activities and have been probed from a national security angle,” claimed the affidavit.If the impact of the legislation is tested, the state contended, it would be found that the legislation has a direct impact on terrorists and terror organisations which have been probed by the state’s ATS.“There is ample data in public record which shows that forcible conversions have in fact created fear- psychosis in the state which in turn has warranted the need for such a legislation...The impugned act seeks to restore the autonomy of all those individuals who have been forcefully and unlawfully converted from one religion to another. By restoring them with religion that they practice voluntarily and freely, then Act delivers on the promise of equal citizenship and equal moral membership,” stated the affidavit.Through the impugned law, the government said, the state seeks to safeguard freedom of conscience in the interest of public order, health and constitutional morality by ensuring that an individual’s choice to marry and subsequently convert to another religion is an informed one.Adding that the legislation of identical nature is in existence at least in eight other states including Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttarakhand and Haryana, the affidavit said that the law prescribes the “least restrictive measure” available with the state to prevent unlawful conversions, especially since the community interest must always prevail over the individual interest.“There are no fetters which had been placed under the Act to take away the freedom of conscience of an individual and the individual is only required to follow the procedure prescribed under the law while exercising the liberty to change belief and faith to worship. This exercise is necessary as there has to be an inquiry at some stage and the law has been settled that the best inquiry in such kind of matters can be done at the level of the executive,” held the affidavit.The UP government clarified that any voluntary conversions by an individual made out of their own free will not attract the provisions of the impugned act but the burden of proof as to whether a religious conversion was not affected from misrepresentation or fraud or coercion or by marriage has to be placed on the person who has caused the conversion.“Conversion being one of the cases that might not usually get reported due to power asymmetry, for socio-cultural and institutional factors, devaluation of self-identity or general fear of societal backlash, the reverse onus clause is a solution that aids in coming to the rescue of the victim and punishing the accused,” said the affidavit.It also defended the provision giving right to the family members under the law to register FIRs in such cases. “By reiterating an already codified law that the relatives have a power to file An FIR against such conversions, the impugned Act in fact ensures that every individual is granted an equal moral membership in the society and the diminished autonomy of the coerced individual it does not let them be a part of a relationship or a religion which they would not voluntarily choose,” underscored the state.The high court is expected to take up the batch of matters on November 15 after the petitioners file their replies to the state government’s stand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/marriage-being-used-for-unlawful-conversion-terror-activities-uttar-pradesh-defends-love-jihad-law-in-allahabad-high-court-101635014812324.html

Some will visit Lord Ram’s temple while some will visit other temples. These people are neither going to be blessed by the voters nor by God,” Naqvi said according to news agency ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal-to-visit-ayodhya-on-october-26-101635014454640.html
24-10-2021||India||Ellenabad bypoll: 200 farmers booked after protest in Haryana’s Sirsa||Rohtak: Police in Haryana’s Sirsa district have booked over 200 farmers for allegedly blocking the road in protest against the visit of leaders from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its ally Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) to Talwara Khurd and Kotli villages to campaign for the upcoming Ellenabad assembly bypoll, police said on Saturday, adding that two first information reports (FIRs) have been lodged against farmers. According to the police, Haryana assembly’s deputy speaker Ranbir Gangwa, state minister Ranjit Chautala, JJP chief Ajay Chautala, Sirsa MLA Gopal Kanda and BJP candidate for the October 30 bypoll, Gobind Kanda, were scheduled to visit the two villages on Friday when farmers blocked their route and showed black flags in protest.Kanda is contesting the Ellenabad bypoll against Indian National Lok Dal (INLD)’s general secretary Abhay Singh Chautala and Congress’s Pawan Beniwal. Chautala is seeking a fourth consecutive term from Ellenabad, which will go to bypoll on October 30.Police said a resident of Mithi Surera village in Ellenabad, Sheshpal, in his complaint, said nearly 150 farmers obstructed the path of BJP-JJP leaders and tried to stop them from canvassing. In another FIR, police have booked 50 farmers for sealing the boundaries of Kotli village to stop entry of BJP-JJP leaders.Sub-inspector Tara Chand of Ellenabad police station said they have booked the farmers under sections 147(punishment for rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly) and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The farmers, who have been protesting against the three central agri laws for nearly 11 months, also took out a rally by carrying the ashes of the four farmers and a journalist who were among the eight people killed in Lakhimpur Kheri violence in Uttar Pradesh on October 3. The ‘ashes yatra’ was taken out in Ellenabad f5rom October 21 to 23. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha has already announced to campaign against Kanda.

24-10-2021||India||Nation functions on rights and not on individual’s will, says Uddhav||In an apparent jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said that the nation runs on rights and not on the will of an individual. Thackeray reiterated the issue of sovereignty of the states and sought guidance from legal luminaries on the rights of the Centre and state. Thackeray was speaking in Aurangabad at the inauguration of the two wings of the annexe building of Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court, where Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, Union law minister Kiren Rijiju, minister of state for finance Dr Bhagwat Karad, supreme court judge DY Chandrachud, chief justice of Bombay high court Dipankar Datta, were also present.The chief minister added that while we celebrate the Amrut Mahotsav (75th year) of independence, there needs to be a “brainstorming” on what has been achieved in these seven and a half decades after independence. Raking the issue of federalism in India for the second time in eight days, Thackeray said the celebration of freedom should not be limited to 75 years, but freedom is to be maintained permanently.Speaking in front of the legal experts on Saturday, the CM asked, “What is our country’s democracy and is there a federal structure in it. What has been written in the Constitution about Centre and states’ rights? At the time of making the Constitution, the questions were raised by some experts on the powers of states and the Centre. Babasaheb Ambedkar had clearly said that except few rights, the states too are sovereign like the Centre. Are these rights being encroached upon?”He further said that he was speaking what was in the minds of the common man. “If we feel that slavery should not be our destiny again, then I humbly request that all the legal experts should discuss and guide the nation on the issue. What does freedom mean? Who has how many rights? Yes, you hold an office, but being in office does not mean that your will can become your right. Your authority is separate, and your will is different. Someone should tell us.”“I am confident that the legal experts will soon throw light on these matters and everybody will get to know the framework of the constitution,” he added.Last week, in a speech during the Dussehra rally of Shiv Sena — the party he heads — Thackeray had said that the architects of the Constitution gave equal sovereignty to the State and Centre under the federal structure. He had also that if the Centre interfered in the workings of the State then it is “unconstitutional” and “cannot be tolerated”.Thackeray on Saturday also took a jibe at former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh, who remains absconding in the money laundering and Antilia bomb scare case. Justice Chandrachud during his speech had referred to a case from 1958 where an accused was absconding.“Chandrachud saheb, you mentioned that one accused has been absconding since 1958, and his case is still pending. Here (Maharashtra), the complainant is missing, but the case is still going on. Nobody knows where the complainant fled away after levelling the allegations. But, the allegations are dug up, inquiries and raids are conducted. There is a need to bring in some framework for such methods,” he said.Stating that crime against women has now become a major issue in the country, Thackeray said that the government has decided to build shelters for the safety of homeless women and orphan children. “As part of the decision, a survey has stated in Mumbai for the shelter of homeless and orphaned women and children that will help prevent injustice to such vulnerable groups,” he added.Thackeray said that his government will work to give justice to the people as providing justice is not one man’s job but teamwork. The chief minister said that the government will soon allocate land for a new building of the Bombay high court. He asked CJI to remain present for the foundation laying ceremony. “We will try to inaugurate the building in our term only,” the chief minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nation-functions-on-rights-and-not-on-individual-s-will-says-uddhav-101635013550901.html
24-10-2021||India||Targeted killings in Punjab also on NIA radar: Says official||Recent killings of civilians in Jammu and Kashmir has brought back into focus similar methods used by Khalistani terrorists to destabilize Punjab. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has this month initiated probes in two such cases – firing on a priest, Kamaldeep Sharma, and sewadar (volunteer) Simranjit Kaur – on January 31 this year in Phillaur, seriously injuring them, and killing of a dera follower Manohar Lal in Bhatinda on November 20 last year. In both the cases taken over on October 8 by the federal probe agency, it looks to investigate a pattern behind targeted killings in both Kashmir and Punjab. In Punjab, the gunmen were given pistols on the directions of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, the Canada-based chief of banned outfit Khalistan Tiger Force, investigators suspect. The shooters, identified as Lovepreet alias Ravi, Kamaljit Sharma and Ram Singh, targeted prominent persons of other faiths “to create a sense of fear and disharmony in the society,” the home ministry said while handing over the two cases to the NIA.Earlier, the federal agency had investigated and filed charges in eight targeted killings of Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) volunteers, Shiv Sena leaders and Christian pastors in Punjab in 2016-17. It claimed in one of the charge sheets that “Khalistani outfits have been targeting members of specific communities, so as to polarize the society in Punjab on communal lines.” In April, the agency filed charges against eight members of another outfit called Khalistan Liberation Force for the murder of Balwinder Singh Sandhu, a Shaurya Chakra bravery award winner, in Tarn Taran in October 2020. “Islamic or Khalistani outfits in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab, operating with the help of Pakistan army and the ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence, the Pakistani spy agency), have found this modus operandi more useful to them,” an official said, requesting anonymity. “The local operators, who act as hitmen, are provided with guns easily available within India or smuggled from across the border, for which money is paid through Western Union money transfer or hawala (informal money transfer). The specific targets are selected by handlers and these operatives are asked to attack and flee.” “Using this modus operandi, Pakistan-based outfits aren’t spending lakhs in training terrorists and then risking their capture during infiltration,” the official said. “Increased use of drones to send small arms and ammunition is part of this strategy, and if we don’t have a robust plan soon, things will go out of hand in Kashmir and Punjab.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/targeted-killings-in-punjab-also-on-nia-radar-says-official-101635013370823.html
24-10-2021||India||Global coalition plans to help small island states mitigate climate crisis||The Coalition of Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), a global partnership of 27 countries initiated by India, will launch a programme to help small island states boost climate resilience at the United Nations climate summit in Glasgow starting October 31. CDRI was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York in 2019. The programme – Infrastructure for Resilient Island States – will be implemented between 2022 to 2030 in 58 countries three geographical regions: the Caribbean, the Pacific, and the Atlantic, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean and South China Sea.India, Australia and the UK are likely to pledge 10 million dollars each for the project and other CDRI initiatives. Other countries may also contribute. Japan and the US have offered technical expertise.The small island nations suffer losses to as much as 10% of their GDP due to natural disasters, according to a World Bank report. They account for two-thirds of the countries in the world that suffer the highest relative losses due to disasters. Overall, these nations also have the highest hazard risks relative to the size of their capital stock, as per the 2017 UN Global Assessment Report.For instance, Fiji was ravaged by Cyclone Winston in February 2016, claiming 44 lives, damaging 40,000 homes and hundreds of schools, and destroying much of the island nation’s infrastructure and transport systems.“When you consider losses as proportion of GDP, these countries are the hardest hit. Some countries have lost 80% to 90% of their GDPs in single disaster events in the past. Because of modest sea-level rise there is an increase in wind and water disasters,” said Kamal Kishore, Indian co-chair of CDRI’s executive committee. “So, since February this year we started consultations with governments and organisations in these countries,” Kishore said. “For example, we have consulted countries in the South Pacific; CARICOM (Caribbean Community); partners like Asian Development Bank, United Nations Environment Programme, etc.” In Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Suriname, Tuvalu and the Maldives, 60% to 100% of the population lives only 5m above the sea level, which are rising due to global warming.“These regions also face development challenges that constrain their economic prospects such as remoteness to global markets, poor connectivity, lack of economies of scale, inadequate labour mobility, low levels of development combined with rapid population growth and limited capacity to adapt,” a concept note by CDRI said. CDRI will provide technical assistance and develop capacity in these countries. “Even in ongoing projects, we are trying to ensure they are built in a way that they are resilient and bankable,” Kishore said. “That will also ensure investment in these islands. For example, many island nations don’t have building codes. National building codes have to be context specific and hence they have to be developed with local organisations. We want a bottom-up approach to this project, not a top-down model. Locals should be involved.” “In the context of climate negotiations, this is an important move by India because we are a developing country and yet we are looking to collaborate on infrastructure development in small island countries,” a CDRI official said, requesting anonymity. “It’s exemplary that we are stepping up and playing a global role. This is a positive story for India.”India will support the stand of least developed countries or countries most vulnerable to climate change impacts. Loss and damage due to climate change in vulnerable nations need to be compensated. There is no agreement among nations on this issue. “Floods, unseasonal rains, severe cyclones have increased in frequency and severity. There is 1.2 degree rise in global temperature and we are already seeing this. Island countries and all vulnerable nations need to be compensated for such events,” an official of the environment ministry said, declining to be named. “We will support the least developed countries on loss and damage because we are also suffering. It needs to be resolved how this money will come.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/global-coalition-plans-to-help-small-island-states-mitigate-climate-crisis-101635013010848.html
24-10-2021||India||Centre announces 2 new rules to increase investments in renewable energy||To increase investments in renewable energy, the central government on Saturday announced two new rules to ensure renewable utilities recover generation costs on time and are assured of regular energy purchase by states and power distribution companies.“The new rules would help create an investment-friendly environment in the country,” the power ministry said in a statement on Saturday.The rules are significant because several renewable energy pacts have been stuck in states such as Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Rajasthan and Gujarat over inordinate payment delays and issues in land acquisition and regulatory clearances, a ministry official said.“The rules will help investors because the cost of solar modules has been at an all-time high since 2019. This reason for the hike in module price is because almost all of them are imported from China, and the manufacturing there has been largely affected as their factories are run on limited days due to a power crisis. So, the ongoing issue of renewable power generators not getting paid on time in India was aggravating the situation and prohibiting growth in the sector,” he said on condition of anonymity. “So now, a formula has been provided to calculate adjustment in the monthly tariff due to the impact of change in law.”The notified rules mandate that a must-run renewable energy plant will not be subjected to curtailment or regulation of generation or supply of electricity. “The electricity generated from a must-run power plant may be curtailed or regulated only in the event of any technical constraint in the electricity grid or for reasons of security of the electricity grid,” the ministry statement said.The move comes when India has set a target of installing 450 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030. It is aiming to invest ₹1 trillion every year till 2030. India has so far invested about ₹4.7 trillion in renewable energy over the past six years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-announces-2-new-rules-to-increase-investments-in-renewable-energy-101635012952584.html
24-10-2021||India||Loan waiver, 2 million jobs among Cong promises for 2022 UP polls||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Saturday flagged off “pratigya yatras” from Uttar Pradesh’s Barabanki with multiple promises, including loan waiver for farmers and jobs to 200,000 people if voted to power in next year’s Assembly polls. She also promised a separate manifesto for women in a week and stressed that their participation in politics is necessary.Her other promises on Saturday included a minimum support price of ₹2500 per quintal for wheat and paddy, state advisory price (SAP) of ₹400 per quintal for sugarcane, bringing down power bills to half, waiving dues of the Covid-19 period and financial assistance of ₹25,000 to Covid-19 affected families.“We waived loans of ₹72,000 crores earlier. We will waive loans of farmers again and bring down power bills to half. The Chhattisgarh government is buying paddy for ₹2500 per quintal. We will buy paddy at the same rate. We will also give SAP of ₹400 per quintal to sugarcane growers,” she said on Saturday.Earlier this week, Priyanka promised 40% party tickets to women for the assembly polls, smartphones to class 12 pass girls and scooters to women graduates.“We will not be able to bring about development and resolve some issues unless the women make progress and participate in the government. Congress wants to give 40% tickets to women to ensure they are capable of fighting their battles. We are bringing out a separate manifesto for women, and the announcement of smartphones and electric scooters for girls is one of the promises made in the manifesto for women to be released in a week,” said Priyanka.She said several contractual workers met her in the past two years, and the party, when voted to power, would regularise their jobs.“I have come here to understand their problems and the state of affairs here,” she said.Before making the promises, Priyanka had a brief interaction with a group of women in a paddy field in Barabanki. The women were seen offering her jaggery and food.Priyanka also slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the “bad” state of affairs of farmers and failure to dismiss Union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni, whose son Ashish Mishra has been arrested in connection with violence in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3. The minister and his son have repeatedly denied the latter’s alleged involvement in the incident.“You are aware how farmers got killed by the son of a minister of the Narendra Modi government. This incident speaks of how the Modi government treats the farmers. The father of the accused continues to be a minister in the Modi government,” Priyanka said.Reacting to Priyanka’s promises, BJP’s Uttar Pradesh vice president Vijay Pathak said, “Congress has named poll promises as its pratigya. The people will take a call as the party has not been able to keep its promises in the past.” Priyanka spoke briefly at the launch of the pratigya yatra, which was flagged off from Harakh Bazar in Barabanki, with the slogan “Hamari saat pratigyayen, hum vachan nibhayenge (Our seven promises, we will fulfil our commitment).”The other two yatras began from Varanasi and Saharanpur on the same day. The yatras will cover major cities, towns and villages across the state till November 1. The party’s fourth yatra will be launched from Gorakhpur after Diwali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/loan-waiver-2-million-jobs-among-cong-promises-for-2022-up-polls-101635012530707.html

Adityanath asserted that his government is working to employ the youth without discrimination.“To equip the youth of Uttar Pradesh with the latest technology, the state government will start providing tablets and smartphones from the last week of November so that they are not deprived of the benefit of online studies,” he said. He announced while laying the foundation stone of a government medical college, to be built for ₹271 crores in Sultanpur. The chief minister also launched 126 other development projects worth ₹46.33 crores in Sultanpur and 99 projects worth ₹334.24 crores in Ambedkarnagar.Hitting out at the Congress and Samajwadi Party governments in the state, he said, “The benefits of development schemes were confined to one family only. One family in Delhi and one family in Lucknow used to grab the money of the poor. People used to die due to hunger and lack of basic amenities.”Adityanath also said the previous SP government was selfish and supported the mafia. “Today, no mafia or criminal can threaten anyone, nor can they play with the faith of people,” he said.Samajwadi Party state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary reacted to Adityanath’s statement, saying: “The previous Akhilesh Yadav government is known for its revolutionary development works. World-class metro, expressway, or parks. None can match Akhilesh Yadav’s laptop scheme. All this government did in four-and-a-half years of its tenure is change names and re-inaugurate Akhilesh Yadav government’s works.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tablets-and-smartphones-to-be-distributed-among-youngsters-by-nov-cmyogi-101635012352106.html

Late on Friday, the 46-year-old is suspected to have poisoned the food of his four children -- three daughters aged 19, 16 and 11; and a son (8) -- and then consumed the same meal, an official added.On Saturday, neighbours alerted the police and the relatives after no one from the family could be reached.The victim’s cousin said she spoke with him around 9 pm on Friday. “He asked me if I had dinner and even said goodnight before going to bed. There were no indications that he was going to take such a step,” she added.“He and his children often used to tell us that they cannot live without his wife,” the relative told reporters.Police said they were probing into the matter.In August this year, a couple was found dead in their residence in Baikampady near Mangaluru, allegedly fearing complications after showing symptoms of Covid-19.(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)

24-10-2021||India||Promote e-shopping for festivals: Govt to states||Ahead of the festival season, the Centre on Saturday asked states and Union territories to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour is strictly followed, listing measures like promoting online shopping and avoiding unnecessary travel to stop infection rates from spiralling.“With continued and collaborative efforts of the Central and state governments, India has achieved the landmark of administering over 100 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses. While vaccination is one of the prime interventions against Covid-19, the honourable prime minister has emphasised that we must continue to exercise precaution by following Covid appropriate behaviour to prevent the risk of future resurgence,” Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said in a letter to states and UTs.The billionth shot of Covid-19 vaccines was administered on October 21, nine months and five days after the country’s Covid-19 immunisation programme kicked off on January 16. The vaccines were administered in roughly 430,000 centres and a total of at least around 2 million health workers were directly involved in the process.The states have also been asked to disallow mass gatherings in areas identified as containment zones and in districts reporting more than a 5% positivity rate – the proportion of samples that return positive. “There should be strict adherence to limits on public gatherings taking into account availability of space to ensure effective physical distancing,” the Centre said.The letter also asked states and UTs to explore and promote various modalities for online modes of celebrations, online shopping and discourage unnecessary travel. States must continue to diligently follow the five pillars of Covid-19 management — test-track-treat-vaccinate and adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour, it added.The guidelines come ahead of major festivals such as Diwali next month, and amid a worrying spike in coronavirus cases in many countries such as Russia, UK and China where schools are being closed and renewed lockdowns are being announced.The Centre has also urged states/UTs to focus on those beneficiaries waiting for their second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine after their interval period has been over.“So far, 71.24 crore (712 million) first doses, covering 76% of the eligible population, and 30.06 crore (300 million) second doses, covering 32% of the eligible population, have been administered the Covid vaccines,” Bhushan said.States have also been requested to access the line list of due beneficiaries from Co-WIN portal. The detailed line-lists of due beneficiaries can be utilised for preparing district-wise second dose administration plan involving district magistrates for execution in a time-bound manner, he added.The states/UTs were also advised to identify and prioritise the districts having low coverage for focused action and explore requirements for mobilisation efforts, addressing local challenges, need for additional Covid vaccination centres and improving access in rural areas, the letter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-curb-covid-spread-centre-tells-states-to-encourage-online-shopping-ahead-of-festivals-101635012172246.html
24-10-2021||India||5 held for killing 2 sex workers in ‘human sacrifice’: MP Police||Five people, including a couple and an occultist, have been arrested for allegedly killing two sex workers in human sacrifice rituals in the past 10 days in Gwalior and Morena districts of Madhya Pradesh, police said on Saturday. Police said the accused have been identified as Bantu Bhadoria (40), his wife Mamta Bhadoria (36), his sister Meera Rajawat (45), her live-in partner Neeraj Parmar (35), all residents of Gwalior, and occultist Girvar Yadav (62) from Datia. According to the police, Bantu and Mamta got married 17 years ago and have been trying for a baby. But Mamta failed to conceive and so the couple decided to approach an occultist, police said. Gwalior superintendent of police Amit Sanghi said, “Girvar Yadav asked the couple to sacrifice a human. Bantu discussed it with Meera and Neeraj. They made a plan of killing an orphan. Neeraj told the couple that he saw in a Bollywood movie a man kills a sex worker and doesn’t get arrested as nobody files any complaint of her missing.” Bantu and Neeraj first killed a sex worker in Sarai Chola area of Morena on the intervening night of October 13 and 14, the SP added. “They showed the body to Yadav, who he rejected it, saying the woman was not killed properly and had injury marks on the body. He asked for another body. Neeraj then hired another sex worker on October 20. He took her to Bantu’s house in Purani Chhawni area, where they killed her by strangulating,” said the SP. The double murder first came to light after the body of a 23-year-old sex worker was found near the Indian Institute of Information and Management Technology (IIITM) on Thursday. “When police investigated, the woman was identified as a resident of Hazira area. Tracing the call details and CCTV footage, police nabbed Neeraj Parmar. During the interrogation, he confessed to the crime,” said the senior police officer. “Neeraj told us that after killing the woman, he along with and Meera were taking the body of the second woman to Yadav’s house on a bike, when the body fell down near IIITM,” the SP said, adding that scared of getting caught, the two fled. Police got the information of the murder of 25-year-old woman from Morena while checking the call details of the woman, who was killed in Gwalior. The call details revealed that Neeraj contacted the woman with a number registered in the name of another woman, police said. “When police tried to trace the woman, they found that she was a sex worker from Morena and missing since the past 10 days. When they interrogated Neeraj, they found that she was also killed by them for the ritual,” said the police officer. Based on Neeraj’s confession, police arrested the five accused on Friday and booked them under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Bantu and Neeraj have been sent on police remand for three days. Police said Bantu used to drive a school bus, but lost his job during the Covid-19 pandemic, while his wife is a house maker. Meera, who is a divorcee, lives with Neeraj, a property broker. Police said they are interrogating Yadav to find out if he had asked others for similar acts before. Further probe is on, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-held-for-killing-2-sex-workers-in-human-sacrifice-mppolice-101635011990745.html
24-10-2021||India||Mamata’s Goa plan highlights a shift in TMC expansion strategy||Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress is eyeing the Goa election in what might be the West Bengal-based party’s biggest foray into the national political theatre.The party has inducted two popular Goan leaders -- former CM Luizonho Faleiro and Prasad Goankar -- and is in talks with several outfits and local leaders. The Trinamool, which defeated the BJP in May 2021 in what was the former’s most challenging assembly election in Bengal, is also in talks with many independent leaders and plans to contest 40 assembly seats in Goa.The Goa plan also reflects a strategic shift in Trinamool’s expansion strategy. “Earlier, the party was fighting in various states such as Assam or Arunachal Pradesh for the odd one or two seats,” said a senior Trinamool leader.*But now, after Abhishek Banerjee became the national general secretary of the party, we are focusing on states where we can form the local government.”While the Trinamool’s plan for Tripura is seen as a natural expansion of the party into another Bengali-speaking state, Goa reflects the strategy to try to find the space between the BJP and the Congress after the death of Manohar Parrikar, the tallest Goan leader.Trinamool has already despatched Derek O’ Brien, the party’s Catholic face who spends nearly two weeks in the state. It has opened its office in Panjim and rented accommodation in a rural area near the state capital.Trinamool leaders are unsure about a tie-up with independent legislators and want committed people for a long-term political relationship, party insiders said.The party is trying to reach an agreement with Goa Forward party leaders. “We also need a strong Hindu face as nearly 60% of Goan population is Hindu. We are hopeful to induct a popular face to enhance our appeal to Goan voters,” said a Trinamool leader.Mamata Banerjee’s party has not yet made up its mind for an alliance with the AAP, another probable candidate in the next Goan election.“ Kejriwal’s key focus is Punjab and Haryana. We don’t think we will benefit from an alliance with the AAP in Goa,” said another senior Trinamool leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamatas-goa-plan-highlights-a-shift-in-tmc-expansion-strategy-101635011935400.html
24-10-2021||India||Modi meets 7 vaccine makers on way ahead||The world is looking up to India for its vaccination drive, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at a meeting on Saturday as he praised pharma industry executives manufacturing Covid-19 vaccines.Modi’s comments come days after India delivered the billionth dose of coronavirus vaccines, more than any other country in the world except China. As on Saturday evening, at least 1.02 billion doses have been given to people, covering a little over 76% of the 940 million adults eligible for inoculation.Modi credited vaccine makers for having played a “big role in the success story of India” and the country’s reaching the 1-billion milestone, according to an official statement. Vaccine makers should continuously work together to be ready to face future challenges, Modi told top executives of seven vaccine manufacturers.“The Prime Minister discussed the government’s roadmap for the future with the companies. He also congratulated them and discussed how the vaccination of those not yet inoculated needs to be sped up,” said a person aware of the discussions, asking not to be named.There is need to institutionalise the best practises learnt during the last one-and-a-half years, Modi said, adding that “this is an opportunity to modify our practises, in tune with the global standards”, according to the government statement.Among those that attended the meeting were executives from Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech, the makers of the vaccines mostly in use at present; Zydus Cadila, Biological E, Gennova Biopharma, Dr Reddy’s Lab and Panacea Biotec. After the meeting ended, the executives praised the government’s role in easing hurdles and said the discussions covered how India’s vaccine capacities can be enhanced. “All over the world, countries will invest in vaccine manufacturing and India needs to stay ahead and we discussed how to do that together with the industry and the government… This is a great milestone. We were able to achieve it because of the vision of the Prime Minister and the industries working with the government,” said SII CEO Adar Poonawalla. During the meeting, Poonawalla’s father and SII managing director, Cyrus Poonawalla, appreciated the leadership of Modi and the way he has led the country, the government statement said. “Had it not been for him and the health ministry, today India would not have been able to make a billion doses. When he came in November (last year) to the plant in Pune, I assured him. And, today he is very happy that our assurance has been fulfilled that we will make India self-sufficient, [and] like all other vaccines, at the lowest possible cost in the world… The Prime Minister went out of his way and made all the regulatory people move very fast… which is why we have been able to cover a huge population,” Cyrus Poonawalla said after the meeting.Other than the vaccine manufacturers, health minister Mansukh Mandaviya and junior health minister Bharati Pravin Pawar were present at the meeting. Cadila healthcare chairman Pankaj Patel too thanked Modi. “One of the biggest factors in our scientists developing the first DNA vaccine is the Prime Minister. He encouraged us a lot since the beginning. He said that the government was with us and would support us for any of our needs. That is the reason we have been able to do it,” he said, adding that Modi also mentioned the vaccine at the UN, which was a matter of pride for the company. Bharat Biotech’s Krishna Ella thanked the Prime Minister for having taken Covaxin. Biological E’s Mahima Datla commended Modi’s “vision that helped the country attain the vaccination milestone”, the government statement said. While Gennova’s Sanjay Singh talked about the importance of innovation and backward integration in the field of vaccine development, Dr Reddy’s Labs’ Satish Reddy appreciated the collaboration between the government and industry. Panacea’s Rajesh Jain praised the government’s ceaseless role during the pandemic, the government statement said. India is likely to become the second-largest manufacturer of Covid-19 vaccines by volume by the end of the year, experts said. India is likely to edge past United States to produce a little under 1.5 billion doses by December, second only to China, according to an October 21 projection by science analytics firm Airfinity. The government is expected to allow companies to resume exports of Covid-19 vaccines, a step likely to significantly ease vaccine inequity that has left doses out of reach for many poorer nations, especially in Africa. Experts said India must now focus on encouraging full vaccination. “Now, there is a need to reduce the gap between the two doses of Covishield -- which is administered to a majority of the people -- to ideally eight weeks. There is a huge gap between the people who have received the first dose and those who have received a second dose. A high complete vaccine coverage will prevent future surges in infections and deaths. This is especially necessary during the festive season because the people are out and about, which increases transmission,” said Dr Suneela Garg, professor in the department of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College and a member of the Lancet Commission on Covid-19 in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-meets-7-vaccine-makers-on-way-ahead-101635011871322.html
24-10-2021||India||Double engine govt will ensure continuation of development in Goa, says PM Modi||Goa should continue with a “double engine” government to ensure it stays on the path to self-reliance, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday, referring to the Bharatiya Janata Party administrations both at the state and the Centre. Modi also took a dig at opposition parties, saying that they were like a football team that lacks team spirit, as he sounded the bugle for next year’s assembly elections in the coastal state.“In football, whether it is defence or forward, everyone is goal-oriented. Someone has to save a goal, while others have to score goals. The feeling of achieving each other’s goal has never been short in Goa, but the earlier governments lacked team spirit,” Modi said. “They could not create a positive environment. For a long time, political selfishness took a toll on good governance.”Interacting with beneficiaries of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Swayampurna Goa programme, an extension of the central government’s Aatmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) initiative via videoconferencing, Modi praised the good work done by the state government.“Political instability damaged the prospect of progress in Goa,” he said. “But, in the last few years, the smart people of Goa turned this instability into stability.”“My friend late Manohar Parrikar put Goa on the path of fast progress and Pramod Sawant and his team are scaling new heights now,” Modi said. “Today, Goa is moving ahead with new self-confidence.”Goa can become self-sufficient only when it makes full use of the developmental avenues and possibilities, Modi said, while calling Swayampurna Goa a means to fulfil the aspirations of the common people. The scheme began on October 2 last year.“Swayampurna Goa is an assurance of well-being and health of our mothers and sisters,” the Prime Minister said. “Swayampurna Goa will provide employment and self-employment opportunities to youth and unemployed people.”Swayampurna Goa was not just a programme of five months or five years, but the first phase of the vision for the next 25 years, he said. “That is why Goa needs a continuation of development by double engine government. Goa needs clear policies like the way they are today and a stable government.”Listing out Goa’s achievements in effectively implementing various schemes initiated by the Centre, Modi said, “India set the goal of being free from open defecation. Goa achieved this target 100%. The country has set a target of providing electricity connection to every household. Goa got it 100%. In Har Ghar Jal Abhiyan, (campaign to provide tap water in every household), Goa was first with 100%. In giving free ration to the poor, Goa achieved 100%.”“I am pleased to say that the schemes, initiated by the central government to provide safety and respect for women, Goa has implemented them successfully on ground, whether it is toilets, Ujwala gas connection or the Jan Dhan bank account,” Modi said.Goa has a key role to play in the country’s tour, travel and hospitality industry, he said.States that depend on tourism such as Goa were front runners in the national vaccination drive. “When the country crossed the 100 crore (1 billion Covid-19 vaccine) doses, Goa was the first state to achieve 100% vaccination of the first dose for its eligible population,” he said.The rapid vaccination drive has built confidence among both the people and tourists. “Now when you are preparing for Diwali, Christmas and New Year, during these vacations, we will be able to see new energy in the tourism sector of Goa,” he said.During his interaction he spoke with a differently abled tea seller by recalling his past as a chaiwala.“You are also a tea seller like me,” Modi told Rurki Ahmad Rajasaheb, a differently abled businessman and table tennis player from Vasco town. He runs a tea stall outside the Kadamba Transport Corporation’ bus stand.The government is working towards providing a life with dignity to the differently abled. “The government is with you. If you progress, the country will progress,” the Prime Minister said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/double-engine-govt-will-ensure-continuation-of-development-in-goa-says-pmmodi-101635011810733.html
24-10-2021||India||‘All parties must unite against BJP’: Mamata Banerjee ahead of visit to Goa||Political parties must unite against the divisive agenda of the Bharatiya Janata Party, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Saturday ahead of a visit to Goa next week.“As I prepare for my maiden visit to Goa on the 28th, I call upon all individuals, organisations and political parties to join forces to defeat the BJP and their divisive agenda” Banerjee said in a tweet. “The people of Goa have suffered enough over the last 10 years.”Goa will elect a new 40-member assembly early next year. Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress party is trying to make political inroads in Goa after retaining power in West Bengal for the second time on a huge mandate.“Together, we will usher in a new dawn for Goa by forming a new govt that will truly be a govt of the people of Goa and committed to realising their aspirations! #GoenchiNaviSaka,” she tweeted on Saturday.In September, the TMC had sent a team of senior leaders, including Rajya Sabha MP Derek O’Brien and Lok Sabha MP Prasun Banerjee, to Goa to assess the political situation before taking a plunge.Former Goa chief minister and veteran Congress leader Luizinho Faleiro joined the party on September 29 this year. On Friday, the TMC appointed Faleiro as vice president. Earlier this month, boxer Lenny Da Gama and footballer Denzil Franco joined the party.Political strategist Prashant Kishor has been working with members of Indian Political Action Committee team to boost the party’s footprint in the coastal state and help it gain footprints ahead of the assembly elections.The state opposition was critical of Banerjee’s move in Goa.“Political parties are uniting against Mamata Banerjee. So she must fight that first before asking political parties to unite against the BJP,” state BJP leader Rahul Sinha said.Even as Mamata Banerjee was calling for opposition unity, her nephew Abhishek Banerjee attacked the Congress party on Saturday at a political rally in West Bengal.“For the last seven years Congress has been losing against the BJP. The TMC is winning against the BJP. The Congress had sometimes made settlements with the BJP to defeat the TMC, while sometimes it had forming alliances with the CPI(M) and Indian Secular Front. The party has no ideal and hence has no place in Bengal,” he said.The Congress lashed out, saying that the TMC should keep electoral arithmetic in mind before taking on the BJP.“The TMC should keep in mind the national electoral arithmetic in which the Congress still holds 20% of the vote. Without the Congress, the TMC, which just has around 4% votes, won’t be able to fight the BJP,” said Adhir Chowdhury, leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha. “Attacking the Congress would strengthen the BJP. It seems that the TMC doesn’t want to actually fight the BJP.”Abhishek Banerjee, who was appointed as the TMC’s national general secretary earlier this year, announced that his party would expand its base in at least five other states, besides Goa and Tripura, and will set up working units in 15 other states ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. He didn’t elaborate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-parties-must-unite-against-bjp-mamata-banerjee-ahead-of-visit-to-goa-101635011690620.html
24-10-2021||India||BJP’s position strong in Goa... will come back with majority: CM Pramod Sawant||Goa has boosted infrastructure and health care services in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, and has taken steps to improve governance and revive the economy, chief minister Pramod Sawant said. These will ensure that the Bharatiya Janata Party retains power in the 2022 state assembly elections, he said in an interview.His government is making sure that all schemes are fully implemented and problems are resolved on the spot through the Swayampurna Goa scheme and the Sarkar Tumchya Dari (government at your door) programme, Sawant said during an interaction on a visit to Delhi on Friday. These are game changers that will ensure his party’s success at the polls. Edited excerpts:What gives you confidence that you will return to power?We have already achieved 100% first dose vaccination. We have had the best Covid-19 and financial management, the best infrastructure and human development. Under the Swayampurna or self-reliant Goa scheme, all the government officials are mandated to visit the gram panchayats (village councils) every Saturday. They have to hear the grievances of the people and resolve the problems that prevent the effective implementation of government schemes.The government has earmarked 10 areas of focus. We have planned for electricity, sanitation, housing and water for all; economic, financial and social security for all, and 100% coverage of services such as free equipment for all divyang people (persons with disabilities). Now we are promoting dairy, agriculture and horticulture.We started the Sarkar Tumchya Dari scheme when we realised that people were finding it hard to resolve small problems. So, we decided to send officials of all 42 departments in the state to a particular taluka (sub-district) with the mandate to solve their problems on the spot. Problems like getting an income or a caste certificate, a Kisan credit card or a soil health card are resolved there and then.What steps has the government taken to ramp up health infrastructure and oxygen supply?Under the PM CARES Fund, seven pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants have been set up. Each and every hospital is fully equipped with an oxygen bed and tank. We are not dependant on anyone for oxygen. An expert committee and a task force have been meeting regularly to set up care facilities for children. We are fully prepared for the third wave.What steps did your government take for economic revival?Tourism is our main economic activity. After 100% vaccination (of first doses), we have allowed tourism to resume. We have mostly Indian tourists now, but with the aid of the government of India, chartered flights and international flights are now allowed. In the Covid-19 period, we did whatever we could to offer help to industries, such as pharmaceuticals and manufacturing.There is a lot of churn among the smaller parties in the state. The Aam Aadmi Party and the Trinamool Congress have also thrown their hat in the ring.The BJP’s position on the ground is strong. Currently we have the support of 27 MLAs and an independent (the assembly has 40 members). There are other parties like MGP (Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party ) and Goa Forward Party. But there will be some developments, and I think there could some mergers. The Congress is a strong opposition party and will be our main opponent. As for the others, the TMC and AAP are only showing off. They have no base on the ground. In the last election, AAP could not even open its account.We are confident of crossing the halfway mark. We will come back with a majority. This election we are confident of 22 mein 22 paar (winning 22 plus seats in 2022).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjps-position-strong-in-goa-will-come-back-with-majority-cm-pramod-sawant-101635011570602.html
24-10-2021||India||Shah takes stock of security situation on 3-day J&K visit||On his first visit to Jammu and Kashmir since the nullification of Article 370 and at a time when civilian killings have hit the region, Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday directed the chiefs of intelligence and investigative agencies, and security forces to make rigorous efforts to wipe out terror from the Valley, people familiar with the development said.Shah began his three-day visit to Jammu and Kashmir on Saturday amid tight security by chairing a security review meeting in Srinagar and inaugurating an international flight between Srinagar and Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates. He asked the country’s top police officers, present in a nearly four-hour-long meeting, about why, despite the heavy presence of troops in the Valley and the available resources, incidents of prolonged encounters with terrorists and radicalisation of local youth were taking place. A person aware of the matter said Shah specifically told the officials that the incidents of targeted killings of civilians were counter-productive when the government wants peace in the Valley and is looking to increase development activities.Among those present at the meeting were Dilbag Singh, director general of Jammu and Kashmir Police, Kuldiep Singh, chief of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and National Investigation Agency (NIA), director general of National Security Guard (NSG) MA Ganapathy, chief of the Border Security Force (BSF) Pankaj Kumar Singh, Intelligence Bureau (IB) chief Arvinda Kumar, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla, and other police and army officers. Lt Governor Manoj Sinha was also present at the meeting.Shah asked the forces to work in coordination with each other so that the civilian population doesn’t suffer, said an official, asking not to be named. At least 32 civilians have been shot dead by terrorists in Kashmir this year. Of these, 11 have been killed this month alone.After the meeting, Shah said in a tweet: “Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, we are committed to completely root out the terrorism and infiltration for the overall development of Jammu and Kashmir”. NIA has already been asked to put behind bars the terrorists and overground workers of various terror organisations.The security forces have stepped up operations after the targeted killings recently. J&K Police has said 17 terrorists have been “neutralised” in various encounters in the Valley in the last 22 days amid a spate of attacks on civilians. Five migrant workers were among the 11 civilians killed in the region this month.The government had the interests of the youth in Kashmir in mind when it imposed curfew and blocked access to the Internet after nullifying Article 370 of the Constitution that conferred special status to Jammu and Kashmir, and then bifurcating the state into two Union Territories in 2019, Shah told members of youth clubs in a speech.“That time, a plot was made to trigger the passions of people. Some foreign forces were also part of that ploy,” Shah told people at the Raj Bhawan in Srinagar. “Had we not imposed curfew, we don’t know how many parents would have had to give shoulder to coffins of their young children. Only youth of Kashmir got saved by imposing the curfew. Internet was snapped, only youth of Kashmir got saved.”“We have initiated a new era in J&K under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. I was thinking that only two and half years ago we used to hear news about stone pelting and violence from here,” Shah said. “Today youth of J&K are discussing development, employment and scholarship for their education. This is a big change that has taken place here.”“Delimitation will happen, followed by elections and then restoration of statehood so that the youth of Kashmir get opportunities. I had said that in the parliament also. And, this is the roadmap. I came here to make friends with the Kashmiri youth,” Shah said.Some 70% of Kashmir’s population is younger than 35 years, he pointed out. They will be given all encouragement towards education, development and employment so that they can become brand ambassadors of Kashmir, the home minister said.Nobody can stop this change from happening, even by using force, he said. “This is the beginning of new era in Kashmir.” The situation in Kashmir is normal now, he said. “Everybody is seeking employment, they (youth) are studying, industry is coming,” Shah said. “Tourism is flourishing, there is no curfew now.”This is Shah’s first visit to the Union territory after the central government revoked Article 370, which bestowed special status to Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019. He had last visited J&K in June 2019 after the Bharatiya Janata Party led National Democratic Alliance swept to power at the Centre for a second term.Shah’s latest visit is part of the Centre’s outreach campaign in the region. He is expected to also review the implementation of development schemes. Last month, he held a review meeting on J&K with Sinha and security officials in New Delhi. Security was tightened in Srinagar ahead of Shah’s visit. Roads to Raj Bhawan and adjoining areas were closed to traffic. Drone cameras were deployed to increase surveillance. Shah also visited the house of police sub-inspector Parvez Ahmad, who was killed outside his house while he was on the way to attend evening prayers. “Visited the house of martyred Parvez Ahmad and paid tributes to him. The whole country and I are proud of his bravery. I met his family members,” Shah tweeted. Ahmad’s wife has been given a government job, Shah said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shah-takes-stock-of-security-situation-on-3-day-j-k-visit-101635011511138.html
24-10-2021||India||CJI NV Ramana says effective judiciary can help in economic growth||An inadequately supported judiciary not only impacts the gross domestic product (GDP) of a country but also costs it foreign investments, Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana rued on Saturday, as he implored the central government to ensure financial autonomy of the institution if a “different outcome” is to be expected from the judicial system.“An effective judiciary can aid in the effective growth of the economy. According to international research published in 2018, failure to deliver timely justice cost the country as much as 9% of annual GDP. Moreover, the impact of an under-supported judiciary is also seen on the foreign investments. Without adequate infrastructure we cannot aspire to fill this gap,” said the CJI, speaking at Aurangabad at the inaugural ceremony of two new wings of the annexe building of the Aurangabad Bench of the Bombay High Court.Justice Ramana laid emphasis on what he called “a deeper structural problem that has plagued judicial infrastructure development in our country since independence”, lamenting lack of good infrastructure has been making it difficult for the courts to effectively perform their function. “Judicial infrastructure is important for improving access to justice and to meet the growing demands of public that is more aware of its rights and is developing economically, socially, and culturally. It is baffling to note that the improvement and maintenance of judicial infrastructure is still being carried out in an ad-hoc and unplanned manner,” he said.Asserting that courts are essential for any society governed by the rule of law, the CJI pointed out that court buildings are not merely structures made of mortar and bricks, but they assure the constitutional guarantee of right to justice and assure all seekers of justice that they need not worry about the might of the state.“If we want a different outcome from the judicial system, we cannot continue to work in these circumstances... Good judicial infrastructure for courts in India has always been an afterthought. It is because of this mindset that courts in India still operate from dilapidated structures, making it difficult to effectively perform their function,” rued justice Ramana. Underlining that the courts in India have always stood up whenever individuals or society were at the receiving end of executive excesses, the CJI maintained that institutionalising the mechanism for improving judicial infrastructure is the best gift that the people and country should get in this 75th year of India’s Independence.The CJI has sent a proposal to establish the National Judicial Infrastructure Authority of India (NJIAI) to the law ministry. “I urge the Hon’ble minister of law and justice to expedite the process and ensure that the proposal to create NJIAI with statutory backing is taken up in the upcoming winter session of the parliament,” he said.Law minister Kiren Rijiju was present at the event. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Supreme Court judges Uday U Lalit, Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, BR Gavai and AS Oka and Bombay high court chief justice Dipankar Dutta also attended the function.In his address, the CJI appealed for removing the stigma attached with citizens approaching courts for redressal of grievances. “It is a common notion that only criminals or victims of crime approach the court. People take pride in stating that we have never seen a court building in our lifetime. But, it is high time that we make efforts to remove the taboo associated with approaching courts for the affirmation of their rights,” he said. Justice Ramana added that the common man deals with multiple legal issues during his lifetime and, therefore, she must never feel hesitant to approach the courts, as people’s faith in the judiciary is the biggest strength of a democracy. Statistics laid out by the CJI during his address* Sanctioned strength of judicial officers: 24,280 * number of court halls available: 20,143 (including 620 rented halls)* 26% of court complexes do not have separate toilets for women * 16% do not have toilets even for men * 46% of court complexes do not have purified drinking water facility* 95% of court complexes do not have basic medical facilities* 68% of court rooms do not have separate record rooms * 49% of court complexes do not have a library* 73% of court rooms do not have computer placed on the judge’s dais with video-conferencing facility||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cji-nv-ramana-says-effective-judiciary-can-help-in-economic-growth-101635011393594.html
24-10-2021||India||Basic right of citizens to know what goes on in the courts: SC judge||It is a basic right of citizens to know what goes on in the courts of the country, justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud said on Saturday, as the Supreme Court judge underlined the importance of live-streaming judicial proceedings in the interest of transparency and accountability.“We have formulated live-streaming rules so that cases can be live-streamed... the hearings before a court can be live-streamed for the rest of the country. Because I do believe that citizens are entitled to know what goes on in the courts. They are entitled to know why cases are adjourned. They are entitled to know whether judges sit from morning till evening in deciding cases. It is the basic right of the citizens to know,” emphasised justice Chandrachud.The judge was speaking at the inaugural ceremony of two new wings of a building of the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court when he mentioned how the Supreme Court e-committee, of which he is the chairperson, is on a mission to use technology to pave the way for moving into the future.Stressing the need to digitise the court records, including orders, judgments and filings, justice Chandrachud said that the Phase 3 document of e-courts project is going to focus on digitisation of 3,100 crore court documents while simultaneously laying emphasis on e-filing of cases.The judge added that the government being the largest litigant in India, he has written to all high court chief justices recently that by January, 2022, all cases of the Centre and state governments must be e-filed in district courts and high courts. “Let the government of India and state governments make the beginning,” appealed justice Chandrachud.He said that the e-committee is looking into data privacy and has provided access to the differently abled so that they can access the court website. “And finally, under the interoperable criminal justice system, we are linking every aspect of the administration of criminal justice, namely, prisons, courts, the police station and the forensic science laboratory,” said justice Chandrachud.Referring to the data available on the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG), justice Chandrachud said that while pendency of cases is indeed a reason of concern, there is also a reason to celebrate some achievements of the judiciary.“Four crore cases are pending, but we have 11 crore cases on the NJDG which have been disposed of and of which orders are available. The high courts have 56.02 lakh cases pending, but 3.17 crore cases have been disposed of. During the Covid-19 pandemic, 2.18 crore cases were registered in India and 1.48 crore cases were disposed of by the district judiciary in India,” he added.Justice Chandrachud also highlighted the “flip side” of the work judges do. “Sitting in the Supreme Court, you are confronted with the extent of justice and the extent of injustice all over the country when citizens come to us. A convict who has been in prison for 35 years has not been released, an undertrial who is in jail for 12 years and against whom charges have not been framed. These are some of the realities of the Indian judiciary which we have to confront,” he pointed out.Talking about the homogeneity between the judges and the lawyers, justice Chandrachud said that they both dress in black and white because they represent one mission, which is the mission to achieve justice to the common citizen.“The human relations which we unravel as judges and lawyers are deeply influenced by our social ethos; by the cultural traditions of the work that we do; of the historical ethos; of the histories of discrimination which many of our people, not just in the state, but across the nation have suffered. So, it is in this quest for justice that we unify today as judges and lawyers,” said the judge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/basic-right-of-citizens-to-know-what-goes-on-in-the-courts-justice-dy-chandrachud-101635011390872.html
24-10-2021||Today's||How Palestine is distinct, de-linked from India’s Israel policy||There was a notable absence in external affairs minister (EAM) S Jaishankar’s five-day schedule in Israel: Palestine. Becoming the fourth EAM to visit Israel since the normalisation of relations in 1992, he met a range of interlocutors in the government and outside. The emerging West Asian Quad also steered clear of the Palestinian question. Even a reference to the peace process or the right of a Palestinian State coexisting peacefully and side by side with Israel was missing during Jaishankar’s trip. But should this be surprising?
24-10-2021||Today's||The story of challenges, the story of resilience||At a time when the world was caught up in the maelstrom of World War I and the Spanish flu, young men from India were forced to go and fight on the frontlines in Europe and Africa in support of the British Empire. Indian soldiers wrote a new chapter of bravery on all fronts. At that time, The New York Times wrote: “The world must pay India in whatever India wants, for without Indian products, there would be greater difficulty in winning the war.”As a nation, we tend to be apprehensive. This is the case with the battle against Covid-19. We may now have crossed the billion-dose mark in vaccinations. But we seem to have forgotten how difficult the journey has been.Until eight months ago, the government machinery itself was sceptical about how the vaccination campaign could be moved to a decisive stage. One concern was where we would get the quantities of vaccine needed. Wealthy nations were quick off the block to reserve vaccines for themselves.When Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi reviewed vaccine manufacturing units in pharma companies of Hyderabad and Pune, an ugly round of political mud-slinging began, ignoring the importance of this in the challenging battle against the virus. They easily forgot: A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.Then there was the issue of creating an effective cold chain for the vaccines across the country. India has a vast and diverse landscape with villages in remote mountain areas, near deserts and isolated islands. In addition, there were inclement weather conditions to consider. Health workers overcame all these challenges.I visited some primary health centres in villages both in the hills and plains to see for myself the situation on the ground. When I was in a village in Uttar Pradesh, a dust storm was on and there was no electricity. Two health workers were seen storing vaccines in a bucket full of ice cubes. I asked them if the vaccines were safe and I was told that this “cold chain” was totally effective. Meanwhile, the second wave of the pandemic set in. The health workers persevered. It is in these moments of crisis that a unique sense of unity and zeal develops in Indians.All attempts by naysayers to debunk the efforts undertaken in the battle against Covid-19 fell flat. India is used to large vaccine campaigns such as the one against polio, so there wasn’t any major resistance to the Covid-19 vaccine.Let us look at some examples from around the world. Russia is lagging behind with only around 34% of people having been administered the vaccine. Similarly, the average immunisation rate in key Bible Belt states in the United States (US) is much less than that in India. Distrust of the leadership in Russia and religious superstitions in the US are proving to be obstacles.At the beginning of the pandemic, there were very few laboratories in India which could test for the virus effectively. Health is a state subject in India. Given this, even if there was a magic wand available, the central government could not do anything in a hurry. India is a country beset by political animosities. There are many states where the parties which are in Opposition at the national stage are in power, and they are bitterly opposed to the Centre on many issues. It was difficult to get them all on the same page with regard to the vaccination drive.The Union government left no stone unturned to address the concerns of these states and arrive at a common ground. The PM and home minister Amit Shah repeatedly spoke to many chief ministers to impress upon them that this was a challenge for all Indians, irrespective of political affiliations.Apart from the pandemic, India was and is facing challenges on several fronts. In the midst of the fight against pandemic, China created unrest on the borders. So, it was only natural that New Delhi was distracted. The incident at Galwan Valley on June 15, 2020, in which 20 of our soldiers lost their lives, took place when the first wave of pandemic was still raging. It came as a huge shock to India at a time when all energies were directed towards the fight against Covid-19. But the government and the nation stood firm and refused to back down despite China’s sabre-rattling. Once again, we were in a similar situation to the time when we had to combat the Spanish flu and lose our soldiers in battle in World War I, but we didn’t blink an eye.But in our moments of pride, we must not lose sight of the fact that the battle is far from over despite crossing the billion-dose mark. The third wave could well be upon us if we are not careful. The economic downturn in the wake of the pandemic has broken people’s backs. The real test of the collective spirit we have demonstrated in the fight against Covid-19 is yet to come.Shashi Shekhar is editor-in-chief, HindustanThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-story-of-challenges-the-story-of-resilience-101635073920190.html
24-10-2021||Today's||What is nuclear China up to?||On October 17, Financial Times reported that China had conducted a test of a hypersonic glide vehicle that circled the earth in low-orbit space before cruising onto its target. Earlier in the summer, through multiple media reports, we learnt that China is constructing at least 250 long-range missile silos at three different locations. In addition, we know from the 2020 United States (US) department of defense report that China intends to move to a launch-on-warning posture for its missile forces. To this end, Beijing is reportedly working on a space-based early warning system. Moreover, experts such as Austin Long and officers such as US Navy Admiral Charles Richard have pointed towards potential shifts in Chinese no-first-use policy.

The programme, Infrastructure for Resilient Island States, will be implemented between 2022 and 2030 in 58 countries in three geographical regions: The Caribbean; the Pacific; and the Atlantic, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean and South China Sea. India, Australia, and the United Kingdom are likely to pledge $10 million each for the project and other CDRI initiatives. Japan and the United States have offered technical expertise.
24-10-2021||Editorials||It’s time for regulation||With each passing week, the magnitude of the real problem with social media companies becomes clearer. The latest revelations include more unseen details of how Facebook knew about misinformation and hate spreading through its network, and a study of unprecedented scale by Twitter in which the company found its service to be disproportionately amplifying Right-wing political messages. In both cases, the findings are based on internal research and experiments, although there is a significant distinction: Twitter carried out the research with academics and owned up to the findings, while the information from Facebook comes from a whistle-blower after the company kept its assessments secret and dithered on acting, alarming its own staff.
