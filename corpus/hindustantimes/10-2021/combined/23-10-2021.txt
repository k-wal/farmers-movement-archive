Anyone flouting this rule will face stern action. District judge Survesh Kumar has issued an order prohibiting carrying of arms or fire arms on the court campus and warning of stern action for violation of the order. Issuing the order on Friday, the district judge directed the district magistrate, commissioner of police, chief judicial magistrate, officer incharge of court security, officer incharge of Central Nazarat and station house officer, Wazirganj police station to enforce the order. The order clearly states that no one will be allowed to carry any type of arm or fire arm on the district court campus, north block, south block, multi-story court complex and old high court campus. The district judge has also instructed to paste the copy of the order at every entry point of the court. He has also ordered police outpost in charge, district court, to enforce the order strictly.

23-10-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad health dept to conduct Covid tests ahead of festivities||The Ghaziabad health department said on Saturday that it will conduct targeted Covid-19 testing of different groups ahead of the upcoming festive season. However, officials said that they are not expecting any major spike in Covid-19 cases during or after the festival season as the district has a good coverage of Covid vaccination, along with a high rate of seroprevalence. Dr RK Gupta, district surveillance officer, said that the department will conduct survey for targeted groups, such as auto-rickshaw drivers, street vendors, staff of malls and sweets shops, among others, in order to find out suspected cases of Covid infection. “But it is unlikely that the mixing of people during the festival season will result in any high number of Covid cases. It is because we have been conducting Covid tests on daily basis and the positivity rate has considerably declined since July. Besides, our vaccination coverage is increasing day by day, and the rate of seroprevalence is also high in the district,” Dr Gupta said. According to official records of the Ghaziabad health department, about 72% of the total 2,758,526 people eligible for Covid-19 vaccine have got their first dose. So far as Covid-19 cases are concerned, the district has reported 55,669 Covid cases till October 23 and these include only three active cases which are in home isolation at present, the officials said. According to the health department’s data, till July 31, the district had total 55,609 cases which indicate that only 60 new cases were added during the period from August 1 to October 23. According to the last seroprevalence survey conducted by the Uttar Pradesh government in July this year, about 80% people in Ghaziabad have developed antibodies against Covid-19, said an officer from the health department, wishing anonymity.“This means that a major portion of the population has developed immunity against the infection. So, it is unlikely that mixing of population during festivals may lead to spike in Covid cases,” said the officer. The records indicate that the overall positivity rate for Covid-19 cases is 3.24% since March last year, while the rate is just 0.01% this month till date, the lowest so far. “With the high rate of seroprevalence, it is expected that there will be no third wave in near future. Further, the Covid vaccination coverage has also provided protection to senior citizens and other age groups. So, the chances of immediate spike during or after the festivals are slim,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter). “Although the situation is encouraging, it does not mean that people shun the use of face mask and other Covid protocols. The preventive measures must continue,” he added. According to the Co-WIN portal figures on Saturday, the district has completed administration of 3,196,508 Covid-19 doses, which include 998,587 second doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-health-dept-to-conduct-covid-tests-ahead-of-festivities-101635012291273.html

Addressing a gathering at an event that Youth Akali Dal president Parambans Singh Romana had organised, Harsimrat said, “The Congress government is incapable of delivering on its promises and people of the state should not rely on it. First, one of their CMs surrendered rights of farmers and now another has surrendered half the territory of Punjab to the Border Security Force (BSF),” she said. She said that Congress has failed to develop a sense of security among the people of Punjab, so how the state will prosper? “Every individual is fearing insecure. Gangsters are openly giving threats of extortion and there are attempts to disturb the communal harmony of the border state. This government has not helped anyone,” she added. “During Badal Sahib’s tenure, our leadership was always present at the ground to solve problems of common people. We have always kept Punjab’s interests first. The people of Punjab must choose a regional party instead of people pulling strings from Delhi. We don’t want Begana (stranger) Kejriwal or Looteri Congress,” she told the gathering. “In West Bengal, the BJP lost the elections as the women of West Bengal stood with their didi (Mamata Banerjee) and made their regional party victorious. This is the power of women. I want my sisters to use their power and make their own government in Punjab,” she said. Romana alleged corruption is rampant in this Congress government. “Instead of providing any new benefits to people, this government has taken away all the good work the Akali Dal had done,” he said. While talking about the condition of minorities in Afghanistan she told the media that since the takeover by the Taliban, minorities, whether Sikhs or Hindus, are under serious threat there. “The Centre must make efforts to bring Sikhs and Hindus, who want to leave Afghanistan, to India as soon as possible,” she added, also assuring traders that their interests will be taken care of.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/congress-indulging-in-politics-of-deceit-to-divert-attention-from-failures-harsimrat-101635011874064.html
23-10-2021||Lucknow||Crop damage: UP govt may have to compensate farmers liberally||Lucknow: A large number of farmers in Uttar Pradesh are all set to be compensated for their crop losses caused by recent widespread downpour as well as floods in several districts, with the state government ready to go the extra mile to please peasants before the coming assembly polls, people in the know of things said. The government, according to them, may announce a relief package for affected farmers once it received the actual estimates of crop losses from districts where the teams of the revenue and agriculture departments are currently conducting surveys. They are expected to submit their findings to the government by early next week. According to people in the agriculture department, the extended monsoon rain and floods are believed to have caused extensive loss to the standing and ripe crops in almost all the districts, requiring a heavy compensation to farmers. “The paddy and the groundnut crops that were ready for harvesting, apart from many vegetables, were washed out by the incessant downpour in most of the districts in September and October and floods in the terai and the eastern parts,” a senior official said. “This poses a big challenge to the government which has to liberally compensate farmers not only by giving them cash but also several other concessions in terms of recovery electricity bills, land revenue etc to preempt the issue falling into the Opposition’s hands in the poll year” he added. Additional chief secretary, agriculture, Devesh Chaturvedi said that agriculture and revenue departments were making assessment of crop damages in all the affected districts. “Based on the loss assessment reports that we expect to receive very soon, the revenue department will give compensation to all the affected farmers while the agriculture department will compensate farmers covered under the crop insurance scheme,” he revealed. He said around 25 lakh farmers were insured for kharif. The government, it is said, will soon write to the Centre demanding financial assistance under the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) after the actual crop damages assessment is received. However, not all farmers who have lost their crops to rains in September and October may get the compensation from the government since many of them may not qualify for relief under the norms, despite the crop damages that may look to be considerable to them. “For a crop loss to be compensated due to a natural disaster such as drought, heavy rain, flood etc, the damage should be more than 33% and any damage assessed to be below that will be compensated for as per the Centre’s existing guidelines,” a revenue department official pointed out. “But the state government is free to find ways to help such farmers, if it wants to and can afford, from its own resources,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/crop-damage-up-govt-may-have-to-compensate-farmers-liberally-101635011813596.html

The flooring needs to be changed, the roof needs repair because there is leakage, washrooms were in filthy conditions and fans are also required,” Warring said.The minister added that the state transport department had been reporting ₹54 lakh daily profit under his change. “If we multiply ₹54 lakh with 15 years, this is the extent of the loot under previous regimes. Officials under such regimes wasted ₹2,700 crore of the department and the money went into the pocket of the transport mafia,” Warring said, adding, “The previous regime ruined Punjab and coined the word mafia.

23-10-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Kaushambi highly polluted, says govt survey||The second round of monitoring Kaushambi’s air pollution, carried out by the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board on the directions of the National Green Tribunal between October 6 and 9, has revealed that the particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and PM10 were much higher than the standard limits. The special monitoring was carried out at three locations in the township. According to data obtained during the second round of special monitoring, the PM10 levels at the three locations-- Kaushambi police post, near Meenakshi Hospital and Panchmani Apaartments--ranged between 161.59 micrograms per cubic metre (mpcm) and 372.58 mpcm. The standard limit for PM10 is 100 mpcm. Likewise, the PM2.5 levels at the three locations also ranged between 63.10 mpcm and 92.51 mpcm, well above the standard limit of 60 mpcm. “Both PM10 and PM2.5 levels were found to be high at all the three locations. We compared our figures with the pollution levels prevailing on the same days at Anand Vihar monitoring station in Delhi, which is nearer to Kaushambi, and found the PM10 and PM2.5 levels of the township were lower.We will now submit the data of both rounds of the special monitoring to the National Green Tribunal,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB. “The present issue with Kaushambi is that due to farmers’ protest at UP Gate, a majority of vehicles are getting diverted through the Kaushambi-Anand Vihar border. So, the PM 2.5 and PM10 will remain high due to higher vehicular movement. The measures under the environmental management plan and the traffic management plan are being implemented to keep the pollution levels under control,” he added. The UPPCB also monitored the noise pollution levels at the three locations and found that the noise levels were high during the day as well as night Kaushambi Apartments’ Resident Welfare Association (Karwa), the umbrella body of Kaushambi high-rises, had moved court in 2015 and filed several petitions, in which they contended that the township was high on pollution levels as the ISBTs of Anand Vihar and Kaushambi were right opposite to the township and the Sahibabad Site IV Industrial Area and Ghazipur landfill site are also in the vicinity. “It has almost taken us six years of legal battle to get the agencies to take measures against the pollution sources. After we moved the Supreme Court last year, the agencies started implementing the traffic management plan and the environmental management plan for our township,” said V K Mittal, president of Karwa. “We have already stated our position that Kaushambi suffers high pollution levels. The work done by agencies are underway. There has to be both short-term and long-term monitoring to know if the measures have been able to control pollution or not,” he added. The first round of monitoring the pollution levels was carried between September 17 and September 21. During the first special monitoring, the township was found high on noise pollution and PM10 levels. However, due to rainy days, the correct picture of pollution levels could not be ascertained and a second special monitoring was carried out. UPPCB officials said they will submit the data of the two rounds of monitoring before the tribunal and will conduct more studies if directed by the tribunal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-kaushambi-highly-polluted-says-govt-survey-101635011210583.html

23-10-2021||Noida||Noida traffic cops launch drive against modified silencers in vehicles||In a bid to check noise pollution, the Gautam Budh Nagar traffic police have launched a drive against illegally modified silencers that are attached to motorcycles. The police are issuing fines and also seizing vehicles for the violation, officials said. Ganesh Prasad Saha, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Gautam Budh Nagar, said that in the last one week 700 vehicles have been penalised, while 166 others seized for the violation. “Each such vehicle is being fined ₹10,000. Only those vehicles having modified silencers and no registration papers are seized,” he said. Saha also said that some people drive such vehicles on internal roads in the sectors. “We urge the residents welfare associations and local people to share information about such vehicles to the traffic police helpline – 9971009001. We will take action against the violators and also withhold the identity of the informer,” he said. Meanwhile, Prashant Tiwari, assistant regional transport officer (enforcement), Gautam Budh Nagar, said that a similar enforcement drive is undertaken by the transport department. “We are taking action against vehicles for modified silencers and pressure horns. On Thursday, we seized nine vehicles and issued challans to 42 others. We have also asked the local mechanics to not modify silencers of two-wheelers and cars, which is against the Motor Vehicle Act,” Tiwari said. Velmurugan S, chief scientist, Central Road Research Institute, Delhi, said that enforcement against modified silencers is a good move. “The Motor Vehicle Act prohibits any such modification. The modification leads to endangering safety of other road users as they are mostly caught off guard due to loud noise. In a regular traffic, up to 55 decibel is allowed, while the modification leads to 80 decibel, which is also bad in terms of noise pollution,” he said. On October 7, the district administration had written to the traffic police department to ensure enforcement of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) to check pollution during the winter season. The traffic police were also asked to impound diesel vehicles older than 10 years and petrol vehicles older than 15 years. The DCP said that the traffic police are also conducting drives against old vehicles which have failed the permit norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-traffic-cops-launch-drive-against-modified-silencers-in-vehicles-101635010610838.html
23-10-2021||Noida||Gzb: UPPCB receives plaints over proposed relocation of air monitoring station||The UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) has started receiving objections over the proposed relocation of the air quality monitoring station located at the building of Loni Nagar Palika office to the forest area in Ghaziabad. The Ghaziabad municipal corporation on October 12 proposed relocating the Loni station, stating that Loni’s high levels of pollution affect the overall air quality index (AQI) reading of Ghaziabad. “We have now started receiving objections from residents of Loni. We will route these objections to our headquarters at Lucknow. Once the objections are disposed of, the UPPCB will take a call on whether to relocate the station or not,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB, Ghaziabad. “The relocation of an air monitoring station cannot be taken up at the local level. It can be relocated only after the UPPCB gives the go ahead,” Sharma added. The corporation officials said that they had written to the Ghaziabad Development Authority for a no-objection certificate for relocating the Loni station to the city forest near Karhera. “We have received the NOC and forwarded it to the UPPCB. Now, the relocation activity will be taken up by the pollution board,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner. The UPPCB regional officer said that the NOC received by the corporation will also be sent to the UPPCB headquarters at Lucknow. The issue has also drawn flak from environmentalists who said that the proposed relocation would hide the correct pollution figures of Loni. “I have given a complaint to the Central Pollution Control Board, UPPCB, divisional commissioner and district magistrate against the proposed relocation. It is just an attempt to hide the correct picture of the pollution in the city. I have also demanded that more monitoring stations should come up in the city, especially in industrial areas,” said Sushil Raghav, a city-based environmentalist. “If no action is taken up on my complaint, I will move the National Green Tribunal against the relocation of the Loni station,” Raghav said. Currently, Ghaziabad has four monitoring stations at Vasundhara, Loni, Sanjay Nagar, and Indirapuram. According to records of the CPCB, the monitoring station at Loni recorded the highest levels of PM2.5 and PM10 among all four stations during the years 2019 and 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-uppcb-receives-objections-over-proposed-relocation-of-loni-s-air-monitoring-station-101635010190591.html

Officials said Noida authority vendors in Sectors 104, 76, 77, 79, 73, 58, 54 and 2 failed to take measures to check the spread of dust and contributed to air pollution. The pollution board recommended slapping a penalty of ₹50,000 on each of them to the district administration.“All the violations were related to dust pollution at the construction sites or other civil works. These are not very big violations, hence a nominal penalty of ₹50,000 was recommended. So far, there have been no incidents of waste burning ever since the GRAP came into effect,” said Utsav Sharma, environment engineer and regional officer (Acting) UPPCB Noida.“Since most of the violators were vendors of Noida Authority, officials of respective department were told over a phone call to tell the vendors on the steps to be taken to control dust pollution,” he added. Earlier this month, the district administration, on the recommendations of UPPCB, spotted eight pollution hotspots in the city including Sector 7X, where the maximum environmental violations were found and penalties imposed. The pollution board had suggested a slew of measures to control the air pollution under GRAP that came into effect this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-12-fined-50-000-each-for-failing-to-control-dust-pollution-101635010011149.html

Rajiv Jain, superintending engineer and nodal officer of the SDMC’s Swachh Bharat mission, said that there are four administrative zones under SDMC and each zone has been directed to set up these facilities in at least seven wards. “Bartan banks, toy banks, old book banks, neki ki diwar (wall of good deeds) and centres where plastic containers and old tyres can be reused for various purposes such as gardening have been finalised under this project. A bartan or crockery bank is a unit where people can borrow steel utensils for a social gathering. It reduces the amount of single-use plastic crockery in use. The onset of the pandemic has reduced the reutilisation of old books, which will be promoted through common book banks. The zonal administration can also set up toy banks, plastic container reuse units and neki ki diwar-- a common covered wall where people can leave clean old clothes and blankets, which can be used by people in need,” Jain explained.A neki ki diwar was opened in the C5A block of Janakpuri on Friday and similar units were set up in Hari Nagar and Subhash Nagar.The preparation for Swachchta Survekshan 2022 has commenced and municipal commissioner Gyanesh Bharti undertook a review meeting on Saturday to finalise the action plan for SDMC. The survey is scheduled to be held in January-February 2022.The reutilisation of materials can help SDMC bag 50 points in the national cleanliness rankings, an official said.The civic body has also decided to initiate online training programmes for its sanitation staff. “The new survey methodology also states that all sanitary workers will have to be provided training courses in waste segregation, waste collection from quarantined homes, and handling of Covid-19 waste. We will first train sanitary inspectors and then sanitation workers in the second phase,” a senior SDMC official said.The lack of proper waste segregation (dry and wet waste) at the household level has been a major hurdle in achieving better rankings for Delhi’s civic bodies. “As an initial target, all deputy commissioners have been asked to start processing at least 60 TPD (tonne per day) wet segregated waste in each zone,” the official said. The civic body also plans to release the sanitation rankings of schools, markets, colonies and hotels during November.The Swachh Survekshan is an annual national survey to assess cleanliness and sanitation conditions in cities and towns across India. It was launched in 2016 as a part of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. Barring the 2018 survey, when the south corporation had fared relatively well, Delhi’s three municipal corporations have consistently fared poorly in these rankings. During the Swachh Survekshan 2020, EDMC was ranked 46th among the 47 local bodies in its category, the SDMC ranked 31 and the north DMC was at the 43rd position.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/swachchta-survekshan-prep-delhi-s-south-civic-body-to-set-up-material-reutilisation-facilities-101635009170721.html

This led to the continuous flight of cadres and leaders from the party,” said Sharma.The Congress got the test of RJD’s ‘uncompromising’ approach in 2009 when it made a hard bargain with the former party and offered only three seats out of 40 in the Lok Sabha to contest. In 2005, the Congress had fielded four candidates in the Lok Sabha elections and had won three —Aurangabad (Nikhil Kumar), Madhubani (Shakeel Ahmad) and Sasaram (Meira Kumar). “The party was left with no option but to part ways, as the RJD was unwilling to let us contest the four seats, it had fought earlier. Congress contested the following assembly polls without an alliance with the RJD,” said Congress chief spokesman Rajesh Rathore.A section of party leaders said that the vote share of the party had declined to 6.66% in 2015, as it remained in the coalition with the RJD and the Janata Dal (United), from 8.37% in 2020 when the party had decided to go it alone at the last minutes. “Congress had a vote share of 16.54% in 1995. But it receded to 6.09% in the 2005 assembly elections. Congress’s credibility among the electors suffered as it relied heavily on the RJD,” said AICC member Kishore Kumar Jha.AICC media panellist and MLC Prem Chandra Mishra said that it was a well-thought decision that has infused fresh energy among the party leaders and cadres. “The party has made a start, after analyzing the fallout. Bihar in-charge Das demonstrated a bold step and he is determined to re-invigorate the organization at the grassroots level,” said Mishra.A professor of Patna Science College and political observer, Shakar Kumar, feared that Congress’s decision to opt out of the RJD was taken impulsively. “Both the RJD and the Congress broke up only to team up together. Though it is good that the Congress thought to go for it alone, however, to win the seats it needs to strengthen the organisation at the grassroots level. The party will achieve sustainable growth only if it relied on committed leaders instead of depending on borrowed players,” said Kumar..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-cong-leaders-hail-break-up-with-rjd-others-feel-it-s-temporary-101635008930553.html

23-10-2021||Patna||Bihar State Pollution Control Board asks DMs to ban firecrackers in four cities||The Bihar State Pollution Control Board has sent a letter to the district magistrates (DMs) of four cities, including Patna, Gaya, Muzaffarpur and Hajipur, seeking a complete ban over the sale and use of firecrackers on Diwali. In the letter sent on October 21, the pollution control board informed that during a survey after Diwali last year, even the contents of arsenic, lead and nickel were found to be much higher than the general standards in the air in these cities apart from the high level of Coarse Particulate Matter (PM 10), Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5), Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and Sulphur dioxide (SO2). These contents are very harmful to human health as these cause diseases like bronchitis and breathing problems. The letter says that as the National Green Tribunal (NGT), a special tribunal created by the Union government to handle the expeditious disposal of the cases related to environmental issues, has directed that the sale and use of firecrackers be completely banned in the cities where air quality index is poor and very poor and that the licence for the sale of firecrackers also be cancelled, the local administration should ensure effective implementation of the ban. Except for the four cities, the pollution board has allowed all other cities in Bihar to use only green crackers for two hours from 8 pm to 10 pm on Diwali. “This year no new licence for the sale of firecrackers will be issued in Patna, Muzaffarpur, Gaya and Hajipur and even the licences issued earlier would remain cancelled, as per the directions of the NGT. The step is taken considering the poor air quality found in these cities last Diwali,” S Chandrashekhar, member secretary, BSPCB, said. Last year also firecrackers were completely banned in Patna, Gaya and Muzaffarpur. This year, there are four cities on this list, he added. The member secretary said all the DMs and SPs have been sent the letter to ensure effective implementation of the ban. “We have also asked the DMs and SPs to provide the board the action taken report on the licences issued earlier and the number of cancelled licenses, raids made on the shops selling firecrackers and the number of shops sealed for illegally selling firecrackers,” he said.Dr Ashok Ghosh, chairman, BSPCB, said that a complete ban on firecrackers is far more important this year. “In fact, the Covid-19 pandemic mainly affected the lungs and respiratory system of the people. Though people have recovered, they are still at the risk because of weak lungs,” he said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-state-pollution-control-board-asks-dms-to-ban-firecrackers-in-four-cities-101635008637366.html

23-10-2021||Patna||Lalu set to return to Patna after almost 4 years, may campaign for bypolls||Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav is all set to come to Patna on Sunday after almost six months of recuperating from his illness in New Delhi following release from jail on bail post-conviction in fodder scam-related cases in April this year.Since his incarceration on December 23, 2017, Prasad has been away from Patna for over three-and-a-half years and briefly visited Patna for five days on parole in May 2018 to attend his elder son Tej Pratap Yadav’s wedding on May 12.After his release from jail while undergoing treatment at AIIMS, New Delhi on April 30, Prasad had been staying put and recuperating from various illnesses at his eldest daughter and Rajya Sabha MP Misa Bharti’s residence in New Delhi.“I, along with my mother and former chief minister Rabri Devi, will be accompanying my father back to Patna on Sunday. We are planning to take the afternoon flight tomorrow,” Misa Bharti told HT on phone from New Delhi.She said the doctors attending to the 74-year former railway minister would examine him in the evening again. Several tests related to Lalu’s health condition were conducted on Friday, she said.The RJD chief has been ailing from kidney, heart and other ailments for the last many years and his condition had deteriorated during his incarceration since December 2017 post-conviction in fodder scam cases. In total, Prasad has been convicted in four fodder scam cases and got released on bail after completion of formalities on April 30 while undergoing treatment at AIIMS, New Delhi.Earlier, the RJD chief stayed in Rajendra Medical College hospital, Ranchi for medical treatment during his incarceration period of over three years before he was shifted to AIIMS, New Delhi in January this year.While Prasad, during his incarceration, executed a slow transition of power in the party to his younger son and heir apparent Tejashwi Prasad Yadav by projecting him as the chief ministerial face in the 2020 assembly polls, the RJD chief continues to call the shots in the party as national president and is facing the challenge of containing growing rivalry between elder son Tej Pratap and Tejashwi.Tej Pratap, of late, has caused much embarrassment to the party by his outburst against senior leaders including state president Jagdanand Singh and had even alleged that his father was being kept ‘hostage’ in New Delhi by a handful of people in the party who were dreaming of becoming the next party national president, which was seen as an attack on younger sibling Tejashwi and his loyalists.However, the ailing RJD chief has tried to dispel such notions and held several meetings in the last few weeks to address party workers from New Delhi virtually and also said to have cautioned Tej Pratap to refrain from making controversial statements.“I will be with you all soon in Patna and tour every district in the state in the coming days. Doctors have asked me to take little water and there are certain restrictions,” the RJD chief said, adding that he was much better in health than previously.However, last week, there were indications that the plans of Prasad to return to Patna had been stalled as Rabri Devi had told media that the RJD chief would not be coming to the state capital soon on health grounds.Admittedly, Prasad’s arrival in Patna is likely to give a morale boost up to the party workers who are expected to give a rousing welcome at Patna airport tomorrow. “We are excited about Lalu’s return. Given the Covid situation, there will be a small gathering at Patna airport to welcome him. His return is a big morale boost up for workers,” said Chittaranjan Gaggan, party’s state spokesperson.A new room equipped with all medical facilities has been constructed at the main quarters of the sprawling 10 Circular Road bungalow where Prasad along with his family has been staying since 2006 after RJD lost power in the state. The bungalow is allotted in name of Rabri Devi incapacity of the leader of the opposition in the state legislative council.People familiar with the matter said there is a possibility that Prasad along with his family might celebrate Chhath in Patna this time after a long gap as wife Rabri Devi has not been celebrating the festival for the last few years.Incidentally, the RJD chief’s return to Patna has raised hopes among the party that the party’s campaign for the by-polls being steered by younger son and leader of the opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav would get more momentum and could help in influencing the voters’ mood. The RJD is putting all strength to win the two seats where the contest is multi-cornered with ruling JD(U) and Congress fielding their candidates.People cited above also said there is still no conformity as to whether the RJD chief would be visiting the two constituencies next week by helicopter but a plan could be drawn up depending on Prasad’s health. “We are not sure whether the RJD chief would visit the two constituencies. Everything will depend on his health once he returns to Patna,” said Bhola Yadav, a senior party leader and former MLA.Meanwhile, the ruling BJP and JD(U) have downplayed Prasad’s expected return to Patna stating that it would not make much impact to help the RJD in getting any advantage in the by-polls. Chief minister Nitish Kumar, while talking to reporters at a public event in Patna on Saturday, did not comment on the RJD chief’s expected return to Patna and also asserted he had no interest in the ongoing hostility between RJD and Congress in the grand alliance. “I have no interest in it,” he said.The BJP’s state spokesperson Prem Ranjan Patel said that Prasad’s return may be an occasion of jubilation for the RJD and its workers but would not give an advantage to the opposition party in the by-polls for two seats. “RJD workers and leaders may be excited about Lalu’s return to Patna but it will have no impact on the by-polls. People of Bihar have lost faith in the RJD chief and they have not forgotten the old days of RJD rule,” said Patel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/lalu-set-to-return-to-patna-after-almost-4-years-may-campaign-for-bypolls-101635008631039.html

In the other incident, a 25-year-old man was arrested from Rajasthan for allegedly cheating a retired person on the pretext of circulating his obscene video on the internet. The accused has been identified as Nasir, a resident of Bharatpur in Rajasthan. On October 2, a complaint was received from a retired person that he was receiving extortion calls from different numbers and the caller introduced themselves as officials of a social media platform. They were demanding money by stating that they have received a complaint from a woman that he was exploiting her and they have his video. They further instructed him to contact the persons of social media to remove his video from being uploaded on the internet.The fake officials of that social media platform demanded money from him for not uploading his video. Out of fear of his social reputation, he transferred around ₹4 lakh as they told him to pay the money or else, he will be falsely implicated in a rape case and his video will be uploaded on various social media platforms, police said.During the investigation, the extortionists were using more than 100 mobile phones and more than 1,000 SIM cards issued on fake IDs. On October 13, information was received that the kingpin of the gang will visit Nagar in Bharatpur, Rajasthan. Police conducted raids and Nasir was apprehended from Nagar in Bharatpur, Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Alok Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/2-held-from-rajasthan-for-making-obscene-videos-of-online-friends-extorting-them-101635008510419.html

To eradicate this, we introduced biometric machines. As this system required the official concerned to physically touch it, we decided to remove it following the coronavirus outbreak as it could potentially spread the virus,” Khattar said in his speech.Khattar said that the government was also alerted about officials tampering with fingerprints in the biometric machines and getting their attendance marked.“We will be introducing smartwatches that will only track the official it is assigned to. The watch would stop working if somebody else wears it.

23-10-2021||Lucknow||Smartphones, tablets will be distributed among youths from November end: Yogi Adityanath||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday announced his government will begin the distribution of tablets and smartphones among the youths by November end.He made the announcement while laying the foundation stone of a government medical college to be built at a cost of ₹ 271 crore in Sultanpur.Yogi Adityanath asserted that his government is working to provide employment to every youth of the state without discrimination.“To equip the youth of Uttar Pradesh with the latest technology, the state government will start providing tablets and smartphones from the last week of November so that they are not deprived of the benefit of online studies,” he said.Yogi Adityanath also launched 126 other development projects worth ₹46.33 crore in Sultanpur and 99 projects worth ₹334.24 crore in Ambedkarnagar.Hitting out at previous non-BJP governments, he said, “The benefits of development schemes were confined to one family only. One family in Delhi and one family in Lucknow used to grab the money of the poor. People used to die due to hunger and lack of basic amenities.”When Narendra Modi became PM, he gave the slogan of sabka saath, sabka vikas, ensuring that benefits of schemes reached all without discrimination, Yogi Adityanath said. Accusing the previous government of spreading anarchy, the chief minister said there used to be frequent riots during festivals earlier, curfew used to be imposed and people could not celebrate.“Now, no riot has taken place in UP in the past four-and-a-half years because the rioters are aware of the consequences,” he said.“If anybody indulges in such designs, his seven generations will have to pay for their acts,” he warned.Yogi Adityanath also gave a warning to members of the mafia, saying, “If you try to flex your muscles, then the bulldozer is ready.”He targeted the previous government for being selfish and supporting the mafia.“Today, no mafia or criminal can threaten anyone, nor can they play with the faith of people,” he said.He further said Sultanpur was getting the maximum benefit of the Purvanchal Expressway and farmers have got four times compensation for their land here.With the industry clusters coming up, the youths of Sultanpur will get employment locally, he noted.

One has to be alert about those who mislead people over the vaccine,” he said.He also said had there been governments of the Congress, the Samajwadi Party (SP) or the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), the construction of the Ram temple would not have started in Ayodhya.“They used to say that Ram is imaginary. Now, these people say that Ram sabke hain’(Ram belongs to everyone),” he addedUttar Pradesh BJP Swatantra Dev Singh, Uttar Pradesh finance and parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Khanna, BJP MP Maneka Gandhi and state minister Sandeep Singh were also present at the event.Reacting to the chief minister’s allegations, Samajwadi Party state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said, “The previous Akhilesh Yadav government is known for its revolutionary development works. World-class metro, expressway, or parks. None can match Akhilesh Yadav’s laptop scheme. All this government did in four-and-a-half years of its tenure is change names and re-inaugurate Akhilesh Yadav government’s works.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/smartphones-tablets-will-be-distributed-among-youths-from-november-end-yogi-adityanath-101635005030351.html

An editorial in Saamana said that “neo-Hindutva” of BJP was the “biggest farce”.The Sena mouthpiece further slammed its former ally, stating that the double standard of the BJP is visible as people are attacked over beef in one state, and its sale is allowed in another state.“Hindutva should not be used and thrown for political gains. Attacking people over beef in one state while allowing the sale of beef in another state shows the BJP’s double standards. The BJP’s neo-Hindutva is the biggest farce we can see,” the editorial said.In a response to the editorial, the BJP said that the piece showed “poverty of thoughts”, and that they don’t give much importance to it. BJP legislator Ashish Shelar said, “The editorial in Saamana shows their poverty in thought. With Diwali approaching, they are repainting themselves as Sena’s saffron colour has faded.”The editorial said those who joined the BJP for power are talking about Hindutva and are giving hollow lectures on Shiv Sena that has abandoned Hindutva. “The Hindus are tired of the game of polarising the Hindus for votes, playing the game of dividing the Hindu-Muslims and creating an atmosphere of tension to gain the votes,” it added.The editorial further said, “Those who say that Shiv Sena abandoned Hindutva, have they forgotten the marriage for power with Mehbooba Mufti in Jammu and Kashmir? Instead of advising on what Shiv Sena should do, they should focus on the anger of the Hindus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjps-neo-hindutva-is-the-biggest-farce-shiv-sena-101635002210320.html

23-10-2021||Pune||SRA survey of Patil Estate slums to begin October 25, decks cleared for more carpet area for dwellers||PUNE: The Pune Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) has initiated a survey of the Patil Estate slums at Shivajinagar, scheduled to begin on Monday, October 25. The SRA officials held a meeting with the residents of the Patil Estate slums and the management of the College of Engineering Pune (COEP). The survey is the first step towards the pending slum redevelopment project.Rajendra Nimbalkar, chief executive officer of SRA Pune, said, “We want to complete the redevelopment of the Patil Estate slums in the next four years. From Monday, we are starting a survey of all the shanties in the area. A plan will be prepared thereafter. We are aiming to float tenders for the developers in January 2022 and start the development work by April 2022.”The land on which the slums have come up was allotted to the COEP in the late 1980s but could not be brought to use because of the encroachments. Gradually, the number of shanties on this land has increased substantially, prompting the COEP to approach the SRA to implement the redevelopment project. The actual picture with regard to the redevelopment project will be clear once survey data is obtained, according to the COEP authorities.B B Ahuja, director of the COEP, said, “That land belongs to the COEP. SRA is conducting this survey. Through the survey, we will get to know how many shanties are there and how many people are eligible for the redevelopment scheme. Also, we will get an idea about the availability of land for the COEP. Once data from the survey is obtained, the picture will be clear.”Comparing the upcoming survey with an earlier one carried out by the COEP through a private NGO, Mr Ahuja said, “The SRA is now conducting the survey and the data obtained from it will be authentic as it has been carried out by a government agency.”The state government approved the Pune SRA’s new development policy on September 23, clearing the decks for the slum dwellers to get more carpet area as desired by them. Developers too are set to get some benefits as free sale will be allowed and they will be less dependent on the transfer of development rights (TDR). Under the new policy, a timeframe of 18 to 48 months has been assigned to the developers depending on the number of homes. This decision is expected to benefit the approximately 600 slums in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.Nimbalkar said, “Residents in this area were demanding a carpet area of 300 sq ft. It will now be possible as we will be able to implement the new development policy.

The footpath alongside the lake has now been repaired and the illegal hutments have also been cleared by the encroachment department of NMMC.“The bigger problem now is the plantation of chestnuts in the lake. We are demanding the removal of the same from NMMC. The volunteers and activists have also decided to have a plantation drive on Sunday alongside the lake to protect it,” Patole said.NMMC commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, said, “We have repaired the footpath and the encroachment is also cleared. The chestnut issue is still pending and we will clear that as well. It is important to stop the access to the lake in order to avoid any kind of dumping and encroachment near it. A solution will be figured out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-municipal-corporation-clears-encroachments-around-lotus-lake-in-nerul-101635000234397.html
23-10-2021||Pune||Filthy Katraj upper lake irks residents||PUNE Once a top attraction in the city, Katraj upper lake is in a filthy condition and daily morning walkers and citizens have expressed anger for the sorry state of the lake.Despite enough rains, the lake doesn’t have enough water and plastic and other waste can be seen floating on water in large quantities.Upper Katraj lake had become one of the attractions in the city due to the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj statue, highest Indian flag, Phool rani train for kids and unique structure of Patil wada along with walkway around the lake.Ravindra Mane, who used to visit the lake frequently, said, “It is sad that citizens throw plastic waste in the garden. Not only the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), but citizens are also responsible for it.”“People from the neighbouring slum throw waste in the lake. The waste is spread all over on both the sides of walls,” he said.Sarika Patil, another resident in the area, said, “It is one of the identities. Our friends and relatives used to always visit the garden but now we avoid it.”Despite good rains, there is not enough water in the lake.Askok Ghorpade, head, PMC garden department, said, “The gardens are maintained by the garden department and water body and drainage is maintained by the health department. It is true that there are some issues, but I would ensure that the plastic waste and other garbage in the water body and around the garden would be cleaned soon.”Ghorpade said, “As gardens were closed, many gardens have a maintenance issue. As the train for kids was closed, there are chances that the track and other areas might get damaged. We would rectify it soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/filthy-katraj-upper-lake-irks-residents-101635000050350.html
23-10-2021||Lucknow||Covid deaths: Uttar Pradesh government issues guidelines for compensation||Days after chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced that ₹ 50,000 compensation would be given to the families of each person who died due to Covid, the revenue department of the Uttar Pradesh government released detailed guidelines regarding the ex gratia to the next of kin for Covid deaths. As many as 22,898 people have died of Covid in the state.“The list of Covid victims is updated till October 18,” read an order issued by Manoj Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary, on Saturday.To avail the compensation for Covid deaths, it would be mandatory to get “death due to Covid-19” listed in the death certificate. A Covid death ascertaining committee (CDAC) comprising the additional district magistrate, chief medical officer, additional chief medical officer, principal or head of the department of medicine in medical college and a subject expert would be set up at the district level. This committee would ascertain the cause of death and testify the same.All applications received at the office of the district magistrates would have to be uploaded on the relief commissioner’s website rahat.up.nic.in after which, on completion of all the necessary formalities, the ex gratia would be electronically transferred to the account of the kin of the Covid victim. To avail ex gratia, an application in the prescribed format, along with death certificate stating Covid as the cause of death, would have to be made before the district magistrates who would be required to set up a cell to receive such applications. In his detailed order, Singh also said that the state government is paying ₹30 lakh each to those employees on panchayat election duty who died of Covid. “Additionally, ₹50 lakh each for the kin of those who died while being deployed on Covid-19 duty too has been sanctioned,” Singh’s order said while making it clear that the ₹ 50,000 ex gratia order won’t be applicable on them. Earlier this week, Yogi Adityanath had said that the state government will soon issue guidelines for rolling out compensation and that each district will have a committee under the district magistrate to execute the scheme.“Make sure that no potential beneficiary is left out,” Yogi Adityanath had directed the officers after the Supreme Court approved the Central government’s proposal of paying ₹50,000 to the next of kin of those who died due to Covid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/covid-deaths-uttar-pradesh-government-issues-guidelines-for-compensation-101634999810164.html

Private hospitals say they have not been reimbursed for the past two months, with dues climbing up to ₹15 crore to date. The AB-SSBY scheme was among the Congress’ poll promises before the 2017 assembly elections. Punjab has enrolled 55 lakh families in the scheme and offers an insurance cover of ₹5 lakh to beneficiaries at empanelled public and private hospitals. It has also announced the extension of the insurance cover to include 15 lakh more families.Nirmaljeet Singh, 58, of Moga, said, “I had visited the Mittal Hospital and Heart Centre for treatment of hernia on Saturday. They told me that they are not providing treatment under health insurance under the AB-SSBY, claiming that they were protesting against the state government.”Sources said private hospital owners had met Punjab health minister OP Soni and officials of the insurance company a week ago. Then too, hospitals had warned the state government of their decision to boycott poor beneficiaries, if their dues were not cleared, but to no avail. Dr Kuldeep Singh Arora, state president, Indian Medical Association (IMA), said, “All empanelled private hospitals have boycotted the treatment of patients under AB-SSBY from Saturday. This is a collective decision of all private hospitals and the IMA is with them. The state government has not cleared any claim of private hospitals under this health cover, since its collaboration with SBI General Insurance Company. For two months, no claim has been passed and dues have gone up to ₹15 crore.” “We are not willing to halt the scheme, but have been compelled to do this, as meetings with the health department yield no results. Pending payment is leading to derailment of health infrastructure and facilities at hospitals. The insurance company is also harassing us with unnecessary inspections and audits,” he added. Dr Sanjiv Mittal, owner of Mittal Hospital And Heart Centre, in Moga, said, “We are struggling to run our hospital. We do not have money to buy medicines and to give salaries to staff with dues piling up.” Punjab health department principal secretary Vikas Garg said, “I have spoken with the representatives of IMA on the issue. Now, we are releasing payment to private hospitals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/citing-15-cr-dues-punjab-private-hospitals-refusing-care-to-poor-under-ayushman-scheme-101634998670036.html
23-10-2021||Mumbai||Nation functions on rights, not on individual’s will, says CM Uddhav Thackeray||In an apparent jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said that the nation runs on rights and not on the will of an individual. Thackeray reiterated the issue of sovereignty of the states and sought guidance from legal luminaries on the rights of the Centre and state. Thackeray was speaking in Aurangabad at the inauguration of the two wings of the annexe building of Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court, where Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, Union law minister Kiren Rijiju, minister of state for finance Dr Bhagwat Karad, supreme court judge DY Chandrachud, chief justice of Bombay high court Dipankar Datta, were also present.The chief minister added that while we celebrate the Amrut Mahotsav (75th year) of independence, there needs to be a “brainstorming” on what has been achieved in these seven and a half decades after independence. Raking the issue of federalism in India for the second time in eight days, Thackeray said the celebration of freedom should not be limited to 75 years, but freedom is to be maintained permanently.Speaking in front of the legal experts on Saturday, the CM asked, “What is our country’s democracy and is there a federal structure in it. What has been written in the Constitution about Centre and states’ rights? At the time of making the Constitution, the questions were raised by some experts on the powers of states and the Centre. Babasaheb Ambedkar had clearly said that except few rights, the states too are sovereign like the Centre. Are these rights being encroached upon?”He further said that he was speaking what was in the minds of the common man. “If we feel that slavery should not be our destiny again, then I humbly request that all the legal experts should discuss and guide the nation on the issue. What does freedom mean? Who has how many rights? Yes, you hold an office, but being in office does not mean that your will can become your right. Your authority is separate, and your will is different. Someone should tell us.”“I am confident that the legal experts will soon throw light on these matters and everybody will get to know the framework of the constitution,” he added.Last week, in a speech during the Dussehra rally of Shiv Sena — the party he heads — Thackeray had said that the architects of the Constitution gave equal sovereignty to the State and Centre under the federal structure. He had also that if the Centre interfered in the workings of the State then it is “unconstitutional” and “cannot be tolerated”.Thackeray on Saturday also took a jibe at former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh, who remains absconding in the money laundering and Antilia bomb scare case. Justice Chandrachud during his speech had referred to a case from 1958 where an accused was absconding.“Chandrachud saheb, you mentioned that one accused has been absconding since 1958, and his case is still pending. Here (Maharashtra), the complainant is missing, but the case is still going on. Nobody knows where the complainant fled away after levelling the allegations. But, the allegations are dug up, inquiries and raids are conducted. There is a need to bring in some framework for such methods,” he said.Stating that crime against women has now become a major issue in the country, Thackeray said that the government has decided to build shelters for the safety of homeless women and orphan children. “As part of the decision, a survey has stated in Mumbai for the shelter of homeless and orphaned women and children that will help prevent injustice to such vulnerable groups,” he added.Thackeray said that his government will work to give justice to the people as providing justice is not one man’s job but teamwork. The chief minister said that the government will soon allocate land for a new building of the Bombay high court. He asked CJI to remain present for the foundation laying ceremony. “We will try to inaugurate the building in our term only,” the chief minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nation-functions-on-rights-not-on-individual-s-will-says-cm-uddhav-thackeray-101634998430142.html

He also predicted that in the upcoming bypolls Trinamool will make a 4-0 sweep.“Winning BJP candidates Jagannath Sarkar and Nisith Pramanik resigned as MLAs even after being elected by people. They dishonoured the verdict of people to retain parliamentary berths. The BJP is seeking votes again in those two seats. They will be rejected by people,” Banerjee was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.He pointed out that the bypolls in Gosaba and Khardah were necessitated due to the deaths of Trinamool Congress leaders but the bypolls in Shantipur and Dinhata were thrusted upon the electorates.He also attacked the BJP by saying that the party is trying to win the Shantipur bypolls riding on the issue of recent communal violence in Bangladesh. “The BJP state president (Sukanta Majumdar) has said that his party will win by-elections in Shantipur because of the violence in Bangladesh. Isn't he ashamed? You (Majumdar) are trying to gain political mileage out of communal violence in Bangladesh where Hindus were tortured,” Banerjee said.He also applauded West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee claiming that she has risen as the ‘undisputed leader’ all over the country. Banerjee expressed confidence that the TMC will defeat the BJP government in Tripura in the upcoming elections and condemned the alleged attack on Rajya Sabha MP Sushmita Dev when she was on a visit to Agartala. He said that with the TMC making forays into Goa and Tripura, the party is rising as an alternative to the PM Modi government in the Centre.He also took a jibe at the Congress and Left Front saying that voting for these parties is akin to pressing the NOTA (none of the above) button in the EVM machine. He said voting for them will also strengthen the ‘hands of the BJP’.Bypolls will be held in Gosaba, Dinhata, Khardaha and Shantipur on October 30. Dinhata seat will go into polls as Lok Sabha MP and Union minister Nisith Pramanik vacated it. He won by 57 seats in a close contest earlier this year during the polls. Jagannath Sarkar also did not quit his Lok Sabha seat despite winning from Shantipur. The deaths of Kajal Sinha and Jayanta Naskar necessitated the bypolls in Gosaba and Khardaha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/40-abhishek-predicts-scoreline-ahead-of-bengal-bypolls-101634997375550.html

23-10-2021||Lucknow||Priyanka flags off yatras, promises farm loan waiver, halving power bills in Uttar Pradesh||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Saturday flagged off three pratigya yatras and made five more promises, including farm loan waiver and halving power bills, ahead of the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly election.The promises also include 20 lakh government jobs in Uttar Pradesh, minimum support price of ₹2500 per quintal for wheat and paddy, state advisory price (SAP) of ₹400 per quintal for sugarcane, bringing down power bills to half, waiving dues of the Covid-19 period and financial assistance of ₹25,000 to Covid-19 affected families if the Congress comes to power in the state.With this, the Congress has made seven promises in the run-up to the assembly polls so far. Earlier this week, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra promised 40% party tickets to women for the assembly polls, smartphones to class 12 pass girls and scooties to women graduates.“We will not be able to bring about development and resolve some issues unless the women make progress and participate in the government. The Congress wants to give 40% tickets to women to ensure they are capable of fighting their battles. We are bringing out a separate manifesto for women, and the announcement of smartphones and electric scooties for girls is one of the promises made in the manifesto for women to be released in a week,” said Priyanka Gandhi while speaking briefly at the programme in which one of the pratigya yatras was flagged off from Harakh Bazar in Barabanki, about 40 km from the state capital.The pratigya yatras have been given the slogan “Hamari saat pratigyayen, hum vachan nibhayenge (Our seven promises, we will fulfil our commitment).”The two other yatras began from Varanasi and Saharanpur. The yatras will cover major cities, towns and villages of the state till November 1. The Congress’ s fourth yatra will be launched from Gorakhpur after Diwali.Priyanka used the occasion to target Prime Minister Narendra Modi for what she described as the “bad” state of affairs of farmers and not dismissing union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni whose son Ashish Mishra has been arrested in connection with violence in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3.The minister and his son have repeatedly denied the latter’s alleged involvement in the incident.“You are aware how farmers have been killed by the son of a minister of the Narendra Modi government. This incident speaks of how the Modi government treats the farmers. The father of the accused continues to be a minister in the Modi government. We waived loans of ₹72,000 crore earlier. We will waive loans of farmers again and bring down power bills to half. The Chhattisgarh government is buying paddy for ₹2500 per quintal. We will buy paddy at the same rate. We will also give SAP of ₹400 per quintal to sugarcane growers,” she said.She said a number of contractual workers have met her in the past two years and the party, when voted to power, would regularise their jobs. Before making the seven promises, Priyanka had a brief interaction with a group of women in a paddy field in Barabanki. The women were seen offering her jaggery and food there.“I have come here to understand their problems and the state of affairs here,” she said.Reacting to the Congress’s promises, Uttar Pradesh BJP vice-president Vijay Pathak said, “The Congress has named poll promises as its pratigya. The people will take a call as the party has not been able to keep its promises in the past.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/priyanka-flags-off-yatras-promises-farm-loan-waiver-halving-power-bills-in-uttar-pradesh-101634997170107.html
23-10-2021||Mumbai||291 hectares of forest land to be diverted for Kondhane dam||Just over 291 hectares of forest land (equal to 32 Oval Maidans) in Raigad and Pune districts are likely to be diverted for the controversial Kondhane Dam project which is proposed to be built across the Ulhas River and will provide 245MLD (millions of litre per day) of water a day to emerging localities in the southern end of Navi Mumbai. The City Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco), which is executing the project, applied for stage-1 forest clearance on October 16, official documents show. The project’s total land requirement (including non-forested area), is 400 hectares. At a per capita water requirement of 135 litres per day, the dam is expected to benefit a population of 1,850,000 people. Construction work is estimated to take five years, though it is yet unclear when construction will resume.Ganesh Phadke, executive engineer (Kondhane-Balganga), Cidco, did not respond to calls seeking comment on Saturday. However, a senior official in Cidco’s environment office said, “The project is very much on the cards, but it is starting with a clean slate. The earlier contractor has been blacklisted, and even the detailed project report was prepared afresh by Cidco. Some portion of the water will be used for irrigation, but the majority will go to the Navi Mumbai Airport Influence Notified Area (Naina) region and also Pushpak Nagar, which are expected to see a big boom once the Navi Mumbai International Airport is constructed.”The Kondhane dam was the first of several irrigation projects sanctioned during the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) regime and had come under the scanner for alleged corruption and cost escalations during the Maharashtra irrigation scam. The Konkan Irrigation Development Corporation (KIDC) was to initially build the dam at a height of 39 metres at a cost of ₹56.16 crore. The first detailed project report was prepared in 2006-07.The state water resources department had tried to push the project twice earlier with a much higher cost of ₹443.94 crore and a height of about 71 metres, but could not pass the scrutiny of government agencies. Within months of the KIDC taking up the project, its scope was widened and the cost escalated. Construction began in 2011, and by 2012 the project cost climbed to ₹614 crore from ₹56.16 crore, as per an investigation by the anti-corruption bureau (ACB). The previous contractor had completed about a quarter of the work, as per previous design specifications. The cost of the revived project, Cidco submitted to the forest department, now stands at ₹155,000 lacs ( ₹1,550 crore).The subsequent Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in 2017 revived the project and handed it over to Cidco, this time as a drinking water project for the 644 sq km Naina, which is located 35kms away from the proposed dam. In 2017, Cidco paid ₹99 crore to the water resources department to acquire the project. Presently, the rest of Navi Mumbai draws water from the Hetawane Water Supply Scheme MJP’s Patalganga Project, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation’s Morbe Dam and MIDC’s Barvi Dam. “The ultimate saturated water demand of present Cidco and Naina area in 2034 is likely to be 1275MLD,” Cidco said in a project brief submitted to the forest department.As per current specifications, the Kondhane Dam project “envisages construction of 80m high dam across River Ulhas at Kondhane Village with a full reservoir level at EL (elevation). Around 140.0 metres and corresponding storage of 115.98 million cubic meters (MCM)”, the project note clarifies. The dam will displace two villages, Kondhane and Chochi, and 118 families are proposed to be relocated to about 8kms away. Other villages affected include Udewai, Kune and Nandgaon. As per information submitted to the forest department by Cidco, the process for settlement of rights under the Forest Rights Acts (2006) has been completed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/291-hectares-of-forest-land-to-be-diverted-for-kondhane-dam-101634995909797.html
23-10-2021||Mumbai||One Avighna Park fire: Short-circuit likely cause, says Mumbai Fire Brigade||A day after a fire incident killed one person in a 60-storeyed One Avighna Park, Currey Road, the Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) has said that the preliminary cause of the fire is likely to be a short circuit on the 19th floor and the subsequent fire caught by wooden furniture. The MFB, has said that had the firefighting system in the building got operational automatically, the fire would have come under control much earlier. However, the fire brigade had to manually activate the system leading to losing crucial time, said MFB officers.The MFB has allowed residents of both the wings of the high-rises to go back to their apartments and have also restored electricity, except on the floor that caught fire.The MFB has said the primary cause of the fire is a short-circuit and subsequently the furniture on the 19th floor of the B wing catching fire, however, the exact cause will be known after a thorough investigation, said MFB officials.Hemant Parab, chief fire officer of the MFB said, “We went in 15 minutes after the call and activated the firefighting system manually. But had the system activated on its own automatically, the fire would have been brought under control much earlier.”Parab added, “We are investigating further and the final cause of the fire will be out only when our investigation is concluded. For now, a short circuit is expected to be the reason behind the fire. We have also submitted our statement to the police. Also, we have not traced the form B, which is a six-monthly fire compliance report to be submitted by the builder yet.”On Friday, a level four fire was reported at One Avighna Park, in which dozens of citizens were rescued safely. However, a 30-year-old security guard lost his life.A viral video surfaced on Friday of one of the residents, Rohit Rathod, whose apartment caught fire alleged that the fire-fighting system did not work efficiently. Rathod could not be reached for his comment on Saturday.Kailash Agarwal, chairman of Avighna Group denied all allegations to be true. Agarwal said, “There is a possibility that due to fire everyone was in shock and the pump operator due to shock could not manage to look for starting the system. The fire officers have also said that the firefighting system was operative but the pressure was low, though it was increased later.”On Form B or fire compliance reports, Agarwal said, “I have submitted Form B both in January and July 2021 via online platform. There is no scope of us not complying with the rules and regulations.”A letter shared by Agarwal claiming to have been submitted to the Mumbai Police reads, “While as developers we have provided the best quality fire-fighting equipment and the system even within the flat premises if the internal/ interior work carried out by the residents is not in compliance with the installed system, the system can malfunction due to the disruption during the interior work. Ensuring the functioning of internal equipment like sprinklers is the responsibility of the flat owners and in this case, it must be investigated if any interior work carried out by the 19th floor resident has tampered with the functioning of the installed sprinklers. Similarly, it should also be investigated if the excessive wooden interior work which is non-resistant to fire was instrumental in increasing the intensity of the fire.”Meanwhile, Swapnaja Kshirsagar, assistant municipal commissioner of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said, “We do not have any concerns relating to the structure at the moment considering it was legal and an occupation certificate was issued in 2018. However, the municipal commissioner will take a call on Monday regarding a further course of action. It will also depend on the investigations by the fire brigade and the Mumbai Police.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/one-avighna-park-fire-short-circuit-likely-cause-says-mumbai-fire-brigade-101634995731435.html

If you do find such water, drain it, replace it or cover with a small layer of oil. Together, let us all make Delhi dengue-free," Kejriwal said."We all have to work together to stop mosquito-breeding. We all have to do this for 10 weeks, and defeat dengue," he added.The chief minister’s comment comes amid a sudden spike in the daily tally of dengue cases since the beginning of October. Delhi has been reporting 20 to 30 dengue cases everyday since this month began. The national capital has recorded 723 dengue cases and one fatality this year, government data collected till October 16 shows, of which 382 cases were recorded in this month alone, reported PTI.On October 21, the Aam Aadmi Party-led Delhi government had announced an increase in the number of dengue beds in hospitals and a reduction in the number of beds reserved for coronavirus patients, due to the rising number of dengue cases.“The dengue situation in Delhi is completely under control. There is an adequate number of beds in the hospitals of Delhi. Not only that, patients from outside Delhi are also being treated in Delhi hospitals. At present, 25% of the total dengue patients present in Delhi hospitals are from outside Delhi,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had said.“Things are still the same as they were in 2019. The number of coronavirus cases was high in 2020. People were at home. Because of this, dengue cases came down rapidly. But this year, the situation is expected to remain the same [as it was in 2019],” he added.The government has brought down the percentage of beds earmarked for coronavirus patients from 30% to 10% in private hospitals, while reducing the number of reserved beds in government hospitals like Lok Nayak to 400 from 700, claiming that the rest of the beds will be kept aside for dengue patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-very-close-to-winning-the-battle-against-dengue-says-arvind-kejriwal-101634993700754.html

But today we have a case where the complainant is missing,” Thackeray was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.The Sena chief made the remark at the inauguration of two wings of the annexe building at Bombay High Court’s Aurangabad bench. Emphasising his apparent dig at Singh, Thackeray said that the complainant made “serious allegations, but is now missing.” “We do not know where he is. This is something that also needs to be looked into,” he added, according to PTI.The event was attended by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, Supreme Court Judge DY Chandrachud, and Union law minister Kiren Rijuju, among others.Singh has been untraceable since May when he went on leave, citing health reasons. A lookout notice was issued against him in July for his continued absence in the police summons pertaining to the allegations he levelled against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh in the money laundering case. He has also named dismissed Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze in the case.Also Read | Param Bir Singh untraceable; not inclined to continue no coercive action statement, state tells HCNotably, Singh was removed as the Mumbai Police chief following his handling of the Antilia bomb scare case and the subsequent murder of Thane trader Mansukh Hiren.Last week, law enforcement agencies in Maharashtra said that they have no hint regarding Singh’s whereabouts. This development came after a Maharashtra Crime Investigation Department (CID) team visited Singh’s known addresses, including his official residence in Mumbai, family home in Chandigarh and a house in Haryana’s Rohtak, among many other venues.Earlier, reports suggested that Singh may have fled India either by using a forged passport or before the lookout notice was issued against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thackeray-takes-jibe-at-param-bir-singh-with-complainant-is-missing-remark-101634992236017.html
23-10-2021||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai sees drop in daily Covid cases by 15%; testing down by 8%||Navi Mumbai has seen a decline in per-day Covid cases by 15% over the last two weeks while the testing has declined by 8% in the same period.Till two weeks ago, the average daily Covid cases reported was around 55. This came down to 48 last week and currently is at 47. At the same time, the testing done two weeks ago was 7,895, which came down to 7,005 last week while it has risen to 7,253 this week.“The Urban Health Primary Centres (UHPC) and the labs are doing the tests in full capacity. The minor decrease seen would be due to the decrease in cases. Since around 33 contact tracing is done against one positive case, as the cases decrease, the overall number of targeted testing also decreases, which reflects on the total number of tests,” said a medical officer from Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC).The active cases currently in Navi Mumbai are 493, which is 0.46% of the total number of cases – 1,08,023 –in the city till date.The average recovery of patients daily is about 37 and till date, 1,05,585 people have recovered. The recovery rate of cases under NMMC is 98% while case fatality rate is 1.80%.Currently, the doubling rate of cases is 1,983 days. Two weeks back, the doubling rate was 1,812 days with active cases being 481.“Targetted testing and contact tracing has played an important role in stabilising the daily Covid cases. During the festival season, it is expected that people maintain all Covid protocols strictly and not take the pandemic lightly yet. Those yet to be vaccinated with both the doses are also urged to come forward and get the vaccination done,” NMMC commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, said.In October, there were more than 10 days with zero deaths reported while it was 12 days in September, which is an indication of the mortality rate going down. “With low number of cases, the health facility too does not have any pressure on the oxygen beds and the ventilators,” Bangar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-sees-drop-in-daily-covid-cases-by-15-testing-down-by-8-101634991591904.html
23-10-2021||Mumbai||One Avighna Park fire: Firefighting system didn’t work efficiently, says fire brigade in FIR||The in-built firefighting system of One Avighna Park, Currey Road, did not work efficiently, hence the fire could not be doused in time, leading to the unfortunate incident, the fire department has said in the first information report (FIR) registered by Kalachowkie police, late Friday night against the owner of the high-rise and the contractor responsible for maintaining its firefighting system. However, no specific person has been named in the FIR. On Friday morning, a level four (serious emergency call) fire was reported in the 60-storey high-rise at Currey Road, claiming the life of a security guard. The guard, Arun Tiwari, who had rushed to rescue residents, fell to his death from the 19th floor as fire and smoke engulfed apartment no. 1902 on the floor. The fire brigade rescued 16 residents trapped in smoke-filled corridors. After dousing the fire, the fire department carried out a preliminary inquiry, based on which a police complaint has been filed. The complainant, assistant fire officer Charandas Pawar, in his statement to the police, said that the firefighting system of the building didn’t work on time, and when it started to work, the force of the water was not enough. As a result, the fire could not be controlled in time, said the police. “Based on the fire department’s complaint, we have lodged an FIR under sections 304A (causing death by negligence) and 336 (act done rashly or negligently as to endanger human life or the personal safety of others) of Indian Penal Code and 3(1) and 3(3) of Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act against the owner of the building and the agency, which was given the responsibility of fire safety and system maintenance,” said Vijay Patil, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), zone 4. The police have so far recorded the statement of seven to eight witnesses including the elder daughter of the owner of flat 1902 and his maid. “From the statements of the witnesses that include the residents as well as the security staff, it is not yet clear when and how security guard Arun Tiwari went inside the flat no. 1902 where the fire erupted. He got trapped inside the smoke-filled flat and later in an attempt to go to the lower flower from the balcony of the flat, he lost grip of the ledge and fell,” said Anand Mulay, senior inspector of Kalachowki police station. “We would also check if the fire safety alarm system of the building worked or not at the relevant,” said DCP Patil. Kailash Agarwal, chairperson of Nish Developers, which constructed One Avighna Park, on Friday had said, “The building’s fire safety is one of the best in the world. We have procured the system from Norway by spending around ₹10 crore. We have also been regularly conducting fire drills and submitting fire audit reports to the competent authorities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/one-avighna-park-fire-firefighting-system-didn-t-work-efficiently-says-fire-brigade-in-fir-101634991350033.html
23-10-2021||Lucknow||BJP’s Baby Rani Maurya asks women not to visit police station after 5pm||Former Uttarakhand governor and BJP national vice president Baby Rani Maurya has advised women not to visit police stations after 5 pm and after it gets dark. Maurya said this while addressing a group of women in Bajardiha area of Varanasi on Friday about the steps taken by BJP government in state to improve security of women.“A woman officer and a sub-inspector definitely sit (at the helpdesk) in the police station. But I will definitely say one thing that never go to a police station after 5 pm and after the dark. Go (to police station) next morning and take your brother, husband or father along, if it is necessary.”She said a number of steps have been taken for the safety and security as well as development of women.The senior BJP leader also asked people to lodge a complaint with district magistrate or chief minister if the ground level officer didn’t listen to them. Citing an example, she said recently a farmer called her to complaint that he was not getting fertilizer. “After I spoke to the officer concerned on mobile and asked him to address the problem, the official said the matter will be sorted out immediately. However, next day he refused to give fertilizer to the farmer,” she said.Her comment was criticized by opposition saying that this exposed the state of affairs in Uttar Pradesh.Aam Admi Party’s Uttar Pradesh in-charge and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh attaching news related to this topic, said in a tweet, “Beti Bachao” (save the girl child).” AAP UP spokesperson Mukesh Singh said “Maurya has exposed the reality of the state. The BJP government in UP has failed in controlling crime. Everyone knows how cops behave with ordinary citizens when they visit a police station with a complaint. Maurya is acquainted with this reality.” However, Maurya defended her comments and said: “I was in a Dalit settlement in Banaras recently on the occasion of Valmiki Jayanti. There were Dalit and Muslim sisters in that programme. I was giving them information about chief minister Yogi ji’s and PM Modi ji’s government schemes. I also told that there is also a system of fast track courts where women get quick justice. Yogi government and PM Modi-led government are working continuously for women’s safety and self-reliance. The opposition simply twisted my statement,” she added.

KDMC, however, has appealed to citizens to follow the necessary precautions during the upcoming Diwali festival.KDMC saw the highest peak of Covid cases in April this year with around 2,500 cases and had the highest progressive cases in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), crossing the one lakh mark.“The daily cases are below 50 now. This means fewer cases are reported. However, it is our appeal to the people to not avoid precautionary measures like maintaining social distance or wearing masks, especially when they visit crowded markets during the festival,” said Dr Pratibha Panpatil, epidemic officer, KDMC.KDMC also claimed that the testing has reduced from around 2,500-3,000 to 1,500-2,000 daily. “The testing will naturally come down as the cases have reduced a lot. Even if we do a contact tracing of 30 people for one infected person, the positive cases reported are less. The testing will increase even if there is a slight rise in the low or high-risk contacts,” added Panpatil.The positivity rate in KDMC has been fluctuating in the last two weeks. Sometimes, the positivity rate has crossed 3% while at other times it is under 2%. With only 31 cases recorded on October 18 and 2,077 tests conducted, the positivity rate was 1.49%, while on October 22, 49 positive cases were recorded and 1,593 tests conducted to give a positivity rate of 3.07%.“Even if the cases have come down, KDMC should ensure the crowding at the markets and public places are under control. There is a need to take extra efforts to control it. The civic body should also emphasise on precautionary measures to avoid a surge post Diwali. At the same time, citizens should follow all the norms as a responsible citizen,” said Sreeniwas Ghanekar, founder of Alert Citizen Forum, Kalyan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kalyan-dombivli-report-drop-in-covid-cases-fewer-people-go-for-testing-101634989915285.html

She is contesting her fifth election from Mandi, which Virbhadra Singh represented four times, hoping to win over voters with the promise to carry forward his legacy. Also read: 3 dead, 1 injured in Jammu and Kashmir after tent comes under landslide debrisQ. Which three issues will be priority if you are elected? A. The three issues that the masses are facing is inflation, unemployment and autocratic policies of the Narendra Modi-led central government. I will work to provide relief to the public from rising prices and unemployment. I will also raise my voice against the Modi government’s anti-people policies at every possible platform. Were you willing to contest this election or was it forced on you as the Congress lacks a formidable face in Mandi? Nobody forced me. I respected the sentiments of party workers and the decision of the high command, who chose me to represent Mandi. My objective is to carry forward the legacy of my late husband and former chief minister Virbhadra Singh and realise his dreams that have been left unfulfilled. Mandi was his workplace. He represented this constituency four times and I have been an MP from here twice. Your opponents say that you were a failure during your previous tenure as MP and now you are seeking votes in the name of your husband. The BJP runs such false propaganda against opponents. As an MP, I allocated the MPLAD fund equally across the parliamentary constituency. Whatever proposals were submitted from whichever assembly constituency or panchayat was approved without any discrimination. I have every right to seek votes in the name of Virbhadra Singh. The credit for whatever development has taken place in Himachal goes to him. So, I have every right to seek votes in the name of his achievements. People of Mandi will vote for the Congress to pay homage to Virbhadra Singh. The Rohtang tunnel project was sanctioned when I was the Lok Sabha member. There are many projects that were sanctioned for Mandi during my tenure whether it was the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) or water supply scheme for the town. Your remark on the Kargil War and army has not gone down well with people. It is the BJP and chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, who are trying to cash in on army sentiments. They are banking on the army’s valour in the Kargil War. It was the chief minister’s statement that the BJP candidate had won the Kargil War and will also win the Mandi byelection. So, they are comparing the Mandi byelection with the Kargil War for political gains. I salute the BJP nominee for his bravery as an army officer. However, it is the chief minister who is trying to present the Kargil War victory as his and his party’s achievement. Kargil War was fought on our soil, in which many of our soldiers sacrificed their lives. I pay my tributes to them. Don’t you think the real issues have been put on the backburner amid the controversy? The BJP is running away from the real issues. It is serving its political interests by creating a divide in society on the basis of region, religion, caste and creed. They deliberately create controversy to divert attention from the failure of its government at the Centre and the state. But these nefarious designs will not succeed and people will give the BJP a befitting reply in the elections. Will the Virbhadra family continue to dominate the Congress party politics in Himachal? Now, that Virbhadra Singh is no more among us, not only me but every person in the state who loved him is also hurting. My family will remain dedicated to the service of the masses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-byelections-will-carry-forward-virbhadra-s-legacy-says-wife-pratibha-101634987810978.html
23-10-2021||Mumbai||Thane man arrested for attempting to murder hotel owner||The Rabodi police have arrested a 38-year-old Thane resident for allegedly stabbing a hotel owner over a petty reason earlier this month. A video of the attack, where the drunk accused is seen slashing at the victim more than 20 times with a dagger, had gone viral after the incident last week.According to the police, the accused, identified as Ashok Marsale, is a driver by profession and stays on Amberkar Road in Thane. Police said that on October 15, Marsale, under the influence of alcohol, went to Ruchi Chinese Center near Castle Mill in Rabodi and ordered food.“Marsale asked the hotel owner, Prashant Pujari (39), to serve him his order on a concrete ledge outside the hotel instead of at a table inside like everyone else. Due to the ongoing restrictions placed in the city in light of the pandemic, Pujari refused and this angered Marsale,” police inspector Ramchandra Valatkar of Rabodi police station said.A furious Marsale allegedly whipped out a dagger from under his shirt and slashed at Pujari 24 times. As Pujari reflexively raised both his hands above his head to shield himself, he sustained most of the injuries to his arms and only a few to his head. The entire incident was captured on a nearby CCTV camera and a clip found its way to WhatsApp.The police have registered a case of attempt to murder against Marsale under the IPC and launched a manhunt for him. On Thursday evening, the police received a tip off that Marsale had returned home after being on the run for several days. He was picked up from near his residence and placed under arrest.“Inquiries have established that Marsale and Pujari had a similar argument in the past, and on the day of the incident, Marsale had gone to Pujari’s restaurant armed with a dagger intending to teach him a lesson. Marsale has been remanded in our custody for 10 days,” Valatkar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-man-arrested-for-attempting-to-murder-hotel-owner-101634987089447.html
23-10-2021||Patna||Lalu set to return to Patna after almost 4 years, may campaign for by-polls||Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav is all set to come to Patna on Sunday after almost six months of recuperating from his illness in New Delhi following release from jail on bail post-conviction in fodder scam related cases in April this year. Since his incarceration on December 23, 2017, Prasad has been away from Patna for over three-and-a-half years and briefly visited Patna for five days on parole in May 2018 to attend his elder son Tej Pratap Yadav’s wedding on May 12. After his release from jail while undergoing treatment at AIIMS, New Delhi on April 30, Prasad had been staying put and recuperating from various illnesses at his eldest daughter and Rajya Sabha MP Misa Bharti’s residence in New Delhi. “I, along with my mother and former chief minister Rabri Devi, will be accompanying my father back to Patna on Sunday. We are planning to take the afternoon flight tomorrow,” Misa Bharti told HT on phone from New Delhi. She said the doctors attending to the 74-year former railway minister would examine him in the evening again. Several tests pertaining to Lalu’s health condition were conducted on Friday, she said. The RJD chief has been ailing from kidney, heart and other ailments for the last many years and his condition had deteriorated during his incarceration since December 2017 post-conviction in fodder scam cases. In total, Prasad has been convicted in four fodder scam cases and got released on bail after completion of formalities on April 30 while undergoing treatment at AIIMS, New Delhi. Earlier, the RJD chief stayed in Rajendra Medical College hospital, Ranchi for medical treatment during his incarceration period of over three years before he was shifted to AIIMS, New Delhi in January this year. While Prasad, during his incarceration, executed a slow transition of power in the party to his younger son and heir apparent Tejashwi Prasad Yadav by projecting him as the chief ministerial face in the 2020 assembly polls, the RJD chief continues to call the shots in the party as national president and is facing the challenge of containing growing rivalry between elder son Tej Pratap and Tejashwi. Tej Pratap, of late, has caused much embarrassment to the party by his outburst against senior leaders including state president Jagdanand Singh and had even alleged that his father was being kept ‘hostage’ in New Delhi by a handful of people in the party who were dreaming of becoming the next party national president, which was seen as an attack on younger sibling Tejashwi and his loyalists. However, the ailing RJD chief has tried to dispel such notions and held several meetings in the last few weeks to address party workers from New Delhi virtually and also said to have cautioned Tej Pratap to refrain from making controversial statements. “I will be with you all soon in Patna and tour every district in the state in the coming days. Doctors have asked me to take little water and there are certain restrictions,” the RJD chief said, adding that he was much better in health than previously. However, last week, there were indications that the plans of Prasad to return to Patna had been stalled as Rabri Devi had told media that the RJD chief would not be coming to the state capital soon on health grounds. Admittedly, Prasad’s arrival in Patna is likely to give a morale boost up to the party workers who are expected to give a rousing welcome at Patna airport tomorrow. “We are excited about Lalu’s return. Keeping in view of the Covid situation, there will be a small gathering at Patna airport to welcome him. His return is a big morale boost up for workers,” said Chittaranjan Gaggan, party’s state spokesperson. A new room equipped with all medical facilities has been constructed at the main quarters of the sprawling 10 Circular Road bungalow where Prasad along with his family has been staying since 2006 after RJD lost power in the state. The bungalow is allotted in name of Rabri Devi incapacity of the leader of the opposition in the state legislative council. People familiar with the matter said there is a possibility that Prasad along with his family might celebrate Chhath in Patna this time after a long gap as wife Rabri Devi has not been celebrating the festival for the last few years. Incidentally, the RJD chief’s return to Patna has raised hopes among the party that the party’s campaign for the by-polls being steered by younger son and leader of the opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav would get more momentum and could help in influencing the voters’ mood. The RJD is putting all strength to win the two seats where the contest is multi-cornered with ruling JD(U) and Congress having fielded their candidates. People cited above also said there is still no conformity as to whether the RJD chief would be visiting the two constituencies next week by helicopter but a plan could be drawn up depending on Prasad’s health. “We are not sure whether the RJD chief would visit the two constituencies. Everything will depend on his health once he returns to Patna,” said Bhola Yadav, a senior party leader and former MLA. Meanwhile, the ruling BJP and JD(U) have downplayed Prasad’s expected return to Patna stating that it would not make much impact to help the RJD in getting any advantage in the by-polls. Chief minister Nitish Kumar, while talking to reporters at a public event in Patna on Saturday, did not comment on the RJD chief’s expected return to Patna and also asserted he had no interest in the ongoing hostility between RJD and Congress in the grand alliance. “I have no interest in it,” he said. The BJP’s state spokesperson Prem Ranjan Patel said that Prasad’s return may be an occasion of jubilation for the RJD and its workers but would not give an advantage to the opposition party in the by-polls for two seats. “RJD workers and leaders may be excited about Lalu’s return to Patna but it will have no impact on the by-polls. People of Bihar have lost faith in the RJD chief and they have not forgotten the old days of RJD rule,” said Patel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/lalu-set-to-return-to-patna-after-almost-4-years-may-campaign-for-bypolls-101634986971300.html

23-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM announces 1 cr grant for construction of stadium ‘in memory of farmers’ who lost their lives protesting farm l||Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi announced the construction of a sports stadium at Haripur village in “memory of farmers who sacrificed their lives during the agitation against farm laws”. Channi has approved a grant of ₹1 crore for this purpose, his office said on Saturday.Channi’s announcement comes weeks after Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni's son Ashish allegedly ran over protesting farmers in Tinkonia village in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3, killing eight. The farmers who were protesting the three farm laws had gathered in Lakhimpur that day to oppose Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya’s visit.More farmers have perished due to suicide, road accidents, and other causes while protesting the Centre’s three “black laws” for close to a year now. The Punjab state government had verified and reported deaths of 220 farmers and farm labourers till July 20 and provided ₹10.86 crore as compensation to their families. Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of over 40 farmer unions, has claimed that 400 farmers have died while protesting these laws.The Centre, however, said in Parliament in late July that it has no record of farmers dying during protests. In response to the Member of Parliaments asking for details on farmer deaths, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar had said that the government of India has "no such record".Channi has also announced the construction of a stadium and a memorial gate in honour of slain Naik Mandeep Singh who died in the line of duty during an anti-insurgency operation in Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-announces-1-cr-grant-for-construction-of-stadium-in-memory-of-farmers-who-lost-their-lives-protesting-farm-laws-101634986078176.html
23-10-2021||Pune||Startup Mantra: iCardin, a med-tech startup grassrooting neurocare||For a population of 1.4 billion, there exists 2,500 neurologists in India; one neurologist per 560,000 people, as against the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) recommendation of one neurologist per 100,000 people. Most neurologists are in tier-1 cities in India. This massive gap in neuro-care prompted Sameer More to launch iCardin, a healthcare discovery platform that offers end-to-end care for patients with any neurological disorder, such as epilepsy, Alzheimer’s, dementia, Parkinson’s, and migraine, among the many. iCardin (Nuclius Health) is now on a mission to build the maximum number of stroke-ready centres as part of a patient-centric neuro-care programme across Maharashtra and India.In the beginningSameer More comes from an IT background with core experience in software product building, marketing and business development. After a short stint in some software companies, More founded Teevra Infosystems which helped early-stage startups and mid-sized tech companies with product marketing, sales enablement and design services. Says More, “I was consulting with a couple of healthcare companies in the US and one of my friends there was looking for second opinion on paediatric neurology for his baby’s treatment. I could connect him to one a neurologist from the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences (NIMHANS) in India. During that time, I felt, a ‘second opinion’ is a critical aspect which is sought by people.”Second opinion, firstBeing from a non-medical background did not deter More from starting a medical-services company. He says, “Neurology, cardiology and cancer are chronic critical illnesses which usually lead to disability or death. So, in June 2020, we started a company providing the ‘second opinion’ to patients or their families for cancer, neurological and cardiological problems. We were doing consultations in five countries – South Africa, Dubai, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and India. In seven months, we did 5,000 second opinion consultations. We realised during this period that 65% to 70% of consultations were about neurological disorders or problems, and most of these were from India. Further analysis of the calls revealed that more than 50% of neurological consultations were related to ‘strokes’ (commonly referred to as paralysis) by people who were suffering from it. This analysis helped us realise that besides a ‘second opinion’, there is a bigger problem that is largely unaddressed.”The Second Opinion was purely an online model. It was successful due to aggressive digital marketing, especially during Covid.“We could manage and control the medium and hence, we could create a good level of awareness. Our multilingual call centre got maximum calls from Mumbai, Kolkata, NCR Delhi region, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai within India. We had an eight-member team and tied up with several consultants and pathology labs,” More added.PivotMore and his team were primarily focussed on cardiology and neurology. Hence, their startup was named iCardin - Card stands for cardiology, N stands for neurology and i stands for online/remote operations. While the bigger problem of cardio-neuro consultations (second opinion) still exists, More had to make a hard choice. While he was deliberating his strategy and future plans, the Covid-19 pandemic had also forced some changes in mindsets. A lot of hospitals and doctors had started offering consultation services online and hence, the second-opinion problem was being addressed to a certain extent. Says More, “We observed that nobody talked about paralysis prevention. So, we started reinventing the wheel and we brainstormed about ways in which we can prevent paralysis. We started studying this problem in December 2020 and in next two months we realised that the ‘paralysis prevention’ aspect is missing. Although a lot of neurologists and hospitals are suggesting that paralysis can be prevented if the patient is attended to within the first four hours, almost none were working rigorously on that aspect and there was no ecosystem built around it.”Problems identifiedMore and his team identified three main problems while working on the paralysis issue. First, that people were not aware of the medical conditions and primary steps to be taken if a person suffers from stroke. Even if the patient is taken to a physician or a small hospital, a lot of time is lost and there was lack of medical infrastructural facilities to diagnose and treat. Says More, “Usually, the first call is made to a physician and by the time he checks and advises treatment a lot of crucial time is lost. Staff in smaller hospitals and their setup is inadequate to treat patients suffering from stroke since there are no dedicated neurologists and CT Scan facilities in case of critical or emergency cases. Statistically speaking, In India, of 20 people suffering from paralysis strokes, only one gets proper treatment in time, which means only five per cent get treatment on time. Hence, we thought of venturing into this space dedicatedly.”Building an ecosystemWith just 2,500 neurologists in India, they simply don’t have the reach to cater to patients, especially in tier 2, 3 cities like Satara. Emphasising this point, More says, “Paralysis prevention is a core aspect and comprehensive neurological care is our vision. We are trying to build an ecosystem around paralysis prevention and comprehensive neurological care. Not only we lack neurologists in numbers, but we lack awareness about medical conditions like epilepsy, migraine, Alzheimer’s, shaky hands... At our call centre, three-to-four of 10 complaints are about such conditions which only a neurologist can treat properly.”Stepping his game up, More also observed that big hospitals have a dedicated setup, but they don’t have geographical reach for paralysis prevention. Sensing a business opportunity here, he decided to tie-up with boutique hospitals. Collaborating with boutique hospitals, iCardin started expanding its network of stroke-ready and neurological care facilities. iCardin partners with leading neurologists, neurosurgeons and physicians in India to provide emergency care as well as other services for patients dealing with neurological disorders. ‘Incubating’ neurology centresMore and his team met experts with the Maharashtra Neurology Association and 30 hospitals from December 2020 to February 2021. Says More, “At any hospital in India, the average yearly occupancy is not more than 70%. So the remaining 30% remains unused. Although dedicated neurologists are not available in smaller cities and hospitals, they have the required infrastructure and healthcare to cater to neurological patients. We came up with a business model in which we use the vacant infrastructure and healthcare staff at such facilities and we provide them with dedicated neurologists, physicians, investigation, awareness and marketing activities. Small 100-bedded hospitals, which usually get their business through one specialty, can easily get additional revenues with this model. “Now we are extremely laser focussed on paralysis prevention. When people call on our numbers, our physicians’ guide them and become their care managers. We call them ‘Care Buddy’. The treatment for patient is then suitably decided. This way we ‘incubate’ our own neurology centres. We started our first centre in Lokmanya Hospital, Nigdi, on March 17, 2021. The second and third centre was started in Pune city in June and September 2021, respectively,” More added.Asset-light, but operations heavyNeurologist Dr Amitkumar Pande, with 15 years of experience as a practising doctor, was closely involved in iCardin from its initial days. It was Dr Pande’s suggestion to focus on paralysis or stroke patients that More picked up on. Says More, “He is now a co-founder and heads clinical operations and neurological research. Dr Pande brought in a very strong clinical background and iCardin had strong marketing and medical operations. We have an asset-light business model, but we are operations heavy. Apart from our core team of eight members, we have another seven-member team of medical experts on our panel, including three neurologists and two neurosurgeons. We are also talking with the Maharashtra Neurology Association as some of members have shown interest to be on our panel.”“We are closely associated with Boehringer Ingelheim, a pharma company with strong presence in Europe and Asia and manufacturer of an injection called TPA for thrombolysis on stroke patients,” adds More. iCardin plans to go pan-India within three years. “Big and small hospitals from Indore, Gwalior, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad are already approaching us. In next five years, we are aiming to build a full-stack healthcare organisation in neurology, where patient experience is an extremely important aspect,” More claims.“The hospital where we run our centres provides us with requisite medical infrastructure, healthcare professionals (intensivists in ICU, RMOs in casualty) and other healthcare staff. iCardin is responsible for arranging neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuropathy, physicians trained under neurologists at the centre,” More says.What the docs say“Electromyography and Nerve Conduction Velocity - EMG NCV is an extension of a clinical examination when clinicians, physicians and neurologists need any confirmation for their clinical observations of a stroke patient. In both, neuropathy (nerve degeneration) and myopathy (muscle degeneration), we detect abnormal sounds and waveforms through EMG machine which indicates worsening muscles and nerves connection. The accuracy of this machine can be around 95 per cent. Nowadays portable machines are available due to which patient need not be shifted for merely conducting this test,” says Sudarshan Wankhede, Neuro Intervention Specialist; NIMHANS, Bengaluru.Advisor speak“iCardin is aiming to address a very relevant area in healthcare, the severity of which is unknown to a majority of the population. I am happy to be a part of the iCardin story where we are targeting the neurology space in order to create a meaningful and sustained impact in peoples’ lives, says Madhurjya Lahkar, advisor, iCardin.FundingMore primarily comes from a B2B background. Commenting on his experience about venture capital funding, More says, “Right networking helped me a lot. Initially I was talking to healthcare professionals, doctors, neurologists who had the domain expertise from clinical and patient perspective. However, venture capital is very important for a B2B2C business model like iCardin.”“VCs are someone who could trust our vision and team at this early-stage. I also spoke to Anand Deshpande of Persistent Systems, who is one of my mentors. In April 2021, I met Madhurjya Lahkar, who is an investment banker and also an investor in early-stage start-ups with special interest in tech. We had discussions over three months and then in July 2021 he introduced iCardin to our investor Jitendra Patel. Patel is an UK-based investor and operates the Grandbydale drugstore business in Liverpool. We pitched him and we signed our termsheet in the next 1.5 months,” More says.•Bootstrapped (till September 2021) – Rs30 lakh•$100k invested by Jitendra Patel||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/startup-mantra-icardin-a-med-tech-startup-grassrooting-neurocare-101634986009527.html

Despite the lack of adequate amenities, Darbhanga airport is getting busier. On Friday, the airport handled 2240 passengers onboard 14 flights. The total number of passengers travelled to and from Darbhanga airport to date since flight operation was launched here is 4,91,199. Likewise, as many as 3402 flights were operated since its launch with the inaugural flight on the Bengaluru-Darbhanga route.Darbhanga airport is connected with Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Ahmadabad, Hyderabad, Kolkata sectors and has become the best performing RCS airport across the country. Low-cost carrier SpiceJet is the selected airline operator under the UDAN scheme. Later on, another popular airline, IndiGo, also started flight operations from here a couple of months ago.Meanwhile, former professor in the department of social science and humanities at IIT Madras, Shreesh Choudhary, a Darbhanga native, said, although there is a lack of passenger facilities, yet new employment opportunities have been created in North Bihar either directly or indirectly. However, some small things need to be changed quickly. “Passengers are now stopped on the road outside and from there, they have to walk about several hundred meters on foot to reach the terminal. This road inside is not even walkable, dragging luggage on it, bringing wheelchairs for disabled passengers to the terminal, keeping them standing at the gate till then could be a terrible experience for passengers,” he asserted.It is unfair to stop them on the road itself, obstructing the traffic there, he quipped further adding, Darbhanga experiences high rainfall, scorching summer and chilly winter which affects sick people and senior citizens who also travel by air for treatment. When contacted, Darbhanga district magistrate (DM) Thiyagrajan SM said the district administration is conscious of the rapid development of issues with regard to the airport and adjoining areas. “We also understand the priorities of state government in this regard”.The DM informed that the state government has sanctioned a significant project to directly link NH-527B with a 60ft wide gate of the airport to provide access to the current civil enclave. The work on the new project has already been taken up and construction is likely to be completed by the year-end. The measure will obviate the need for entry to civil enclave through Air Force gate no. 2. Thus, passengers no longer will have to depend on a long walk to reach the civil enclave.The DM also pointed out that upon the personal instruction of the chief minister, work on raising the boundary wall of the airport in view of security reasons is about to start within 15-20 days. The view cutter will be installed. On the other hand, to do away with the menace of blue bull, the state government has also sanctioned a scheme for erecting chain link fencing around the runway stretching up to 10 kms. The work on this score will start in November for which the tender process is on.The DM asserted that the land acquisition issue has been accorded top priority and efforts will be made to complete the process in the shortest possible time frame. Early this month, the state cabinet gave a budgetary fillip to the proposal for the construction of a permanent terminal building for the civil enclave at Darbhanga airport by giving its nod to the expenditure of over ₹336 crore for the acquisition of 78-acre land. The acquired land is to be handed over ‘free of cost’ to the AAI for setting up a permanent civil enclave at Darbhanga airport, which is under the control of the Indian Air Force....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/darbhanga-airport-nearly-5-lakh-air-travellers-take-udan-flights-101634962909058.html

He pointed out that the Ramayana tells society about the ‘dharma’ of each and every person in the world.Kejriwal also said that his government has been providing financial assistance to people who wanted to celebrate the day in their colonies across Delhi, PTI also reported.“We started doing this in the last three-four years. But for the first time at a central level, we are celebrating it on behalf of the Delhi government,” he said and urged people to participate in Saturday’s ceremony in maximum numbers.Maharishi Valmiki is worshipped by sections of the Dalit community. The call to hold celebrations is interesting because Kejriwal often commences AAP’s campaigns ahead of polls from Mandir Marg in the national capital.Assembly elections are due in many states next year, including Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, and AAP is looking to strengthen its base outside Delhi by launching poll campaigns in some of these states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-to-celebrate-valmiki-jayanti-on-grand-scale-at-thyagaraj-stadium-today-101634948740590.html

He said the number of sensitive assembly constituencies and booths will be increased after analysing the situation.He briefed about Garuda App, which has been designed to capture the information of polling stations. Raju said due to the pandemic, the number of polling booths has been enhanced to 24,659. He said through the app, officials would be able to upload photos and location of the polling stations from their registered mobile numbers. He said that app would also minimise the paper works and officials would be able to add, delete or modify voters’ names and addresses. Raju added that in the next three days, the election commission would complete the entire process in Ludhiana. He instructed the officers concerned to run extensive awareness activities in their areas under Systematic Voters’ Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP) to encourage the voters to participate in the polls besides deleting dead voters and omitting other logical errors. On the issue of deployment of paramilitary forces, Raju said the commission was keeping a close watch on the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-chief-electoral-officer-reviews-poll-preparedness-101634945625495.html
23-10-2021||Chandigarh||Sukhbir slams Channi for ‘surrendering federal structure of Punjab’||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Friday said Punjab and Punjabis were being penalised for standing up against the mighty Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre on the issue of controversial farm laws. He accused the Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi for surrendering the state and its autonomy. “First Channi timidly agreed to the extending the jurisdiction of central forces to 10 districts of Punjab and now accepted the discrimination being done unto Punjab by reducing the status of Punjabi to a minor language for classes 10 and 12,” Sukhbir said.The SAD chief, who was here to convene meetings with his party workers, traders and various factions of the society, was visiting the house of senior lawyer and SAD leader Parupkar Singh Ghuman to hold a dialogue with advocates.Sukhbir said it was shocking that the chief minister was refusing to even register a forceful protest against the Centre which was striking against Punjab one after another.He criticised Channi for the “rampant corruption and deteriorating law and order situation” in the state. “Police officials are offered plum postings in lieu of kickbacks. We will reveal the names of such cops at an appropriate time,” he added. Claiming that former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had colluded with the BJP, Sukhbir said, “We have been maintaining since Day 1 that Amarinder is hand in glove with the BJP. This is the reason why the BJP always remained soft with him and never targeted him on any issue. He also returned the favour by giving the go-ahead to the draft of the three farm laws as a member of the committee of chief ministers. Now, Captain is talking of getting the farm law issue resolved. What stopped him from doing this earlier and preventing the loss of 800 lives?”The Akali Dal president also asserted that it did not suit home minister Sukhjinder Randhawa to project himself as a “saviour of the state” when everyone knew that he had been the blue-eyed boy of Amarinder Singh. “Randhawa had also gained the most during the Captain’s regime as he was given top portfolios. Scams done by him including the seed scam were overlooked. He was also not taken to task for allowing jails to be used as extortion dens by gangsters,” Sukhbir alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukhbir-slams-channi-for-surrendering-federal-structure-of-punjab-101634945385362.html

23-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi may get rain today: IMD||The India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast light to moderate showers over the Capital on Saturday and Sunday. Intense rain in parts of Punjab will keep stubble burning smoke from deteriorating the city’s air, forecasters said.Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi on Friday was 170, in the moderate category. On Thursday, the overall AQI reading was 199, also in the moderate zone.An AQI reading between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.Forecasters said the air quality is likely to improve during the weekend as the winds blowing into the Capital will change from westerly to easterly from Saturday under the impact of a western disturbance. This will also cause light to moderate showers in parts of Delhi on Saturday and Sunday.“On Friday, Delhi received winds at moderate speed from the west. This led to an improvement in the pollution levels,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet.The IMD forecast also said that while the western disturbance will result in a slight rise in temperature over the weekend, from Monday, the temperature in Delhi-NCR will start reducing. The falling temperature and northwesterly winds carrying stubble smoke could lead to the Capital’s air quality worsening in the coming days.On Friday, the maximum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official marker for the city, was 33.4 degrees Celsius, two above normal. The minimum temperature was 17.7°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-may-get-rain-today-imd-101634944755068.html

Forty-one debit cards and two cars have been recovered from the possession of the accused, who were active in multiple cities and states. Those arrested are Naveen Kumar, Rakesh Kumar of Bhamian Kalan, Surinder Bansal of Tibba Road, Ajay Kumar of Jassian Road and Rocky of Moti Nagar. Their absconding accomplices are Paramjit Singh of Dera Bassi and Rakesh Kumar of Tajpur Road.ASI Surjit Singh, who is investigating the case, said they were nabbed near Old Ishwar Colony following a tip-off. “We had information that few persons involved in ATM frauds are coming towards Ludhiana from Chandigarh side in two cars,” he added. The ASI said the accused had multiple accounts in fake names and addresses in different banks. “The accused used to withdraw money through specially designed hooks which they would attach to the money dispensing tray of ATMs. When the cash was dispensed, they used to switch off the power supply to the ATM and withdraw the bills,” he added. “The accused then used to register an online complaint to the bank for a refund claiming that their money was stuck in ATM,” the ASI said. A case under sections 465, 467, 468, 471, 420 and 120-B of the IPC has been registered against them.

23-10-2021||Delhi||Delayed monsoon exit may mean ‘severe’ smog: Report||Intense and heavy monsoon spells this season have helped Delhi breathe relatively cleaner air this October compared to previous years, an air quality analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has shown. However, the analysis also warns that the late withdrawal of monsoon in north India could also lead to “severe peak in smog” during winter as farmers rush to burn crop remnants in the shorter window they will now have to clear their fields.The findings are in line with remarks by other experts, who said they fear a last-minute spike could push Delhi’s air into severely polluted category, as reported by HT on Thursday.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), CSE, said the pre-winter air this year has been relatively cleaner, primarily because of the impact of intense and prolonged monsoon. “The objective was also to understand the starting line of the onset of the winter pollution season or pre-winter levels in this region, and also to understand the longer-term trends in seasonal variations,” she said.“While winter pollution cannot be predicted at this moment, the evidence of rising summer pollution in 2021 despite the lockdown and the evidence of a synchronised effect of winter pollution across the Indo-Gangetic Plain add to our concern. How soon and intensely the winter pollution will hit us will depend on the scale and speed of action across the region and leveraging it for more sustained air quality gains.”The analysis warned that while the prolonged and intense monsoon might have temporarily averted the city’s annual air emergency, this could also cause more intense smog episodes.“This winter we may get a much severe peak in smog, as farm stubble fire counts may get more concentrated due to the delayed effect of the rains. To counter this, action must be scaled up right away,” said Avikal Somvanshi, programme manager at the urban data analytic lab, CSE.The report said that normally, the first phase of winter smog is triggered by large-scale stubble burning in the agrarian states of Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh. It said that the peak contribution of stubble smoke this year was registered on October 16 when 14% of Delhi’s PM2.5 was attributed to stubble fire smoke.“Heavy rains in the following days washed out the first build-up of the season. The smoke season generally peaks around the cusp of October and November, with contribution spiking to over 40% on the worst days,” said Somvanshi.In 2020, during the stubble burning season October 1-November 29, an average 12.2% per day of Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution came from farm stubble fire smoke. This was considerably higher than in previous years – in 2019, contributions stood at 8.9% per day, while it was 10.9% per day in 2018. The findings of the report showed that the city-wide PM 2.5 average for the monsoon this year stood at 41ug/m3, with 96 days meeting the 24-hour standard. There was a progressive increase in the number of cleaner days with an average 6% annual improvement since 2018.“In Delhi, Dr Karni Singh Shooting Range recorded the lowest seasonal average of 33ug/m3, while the National Stadium had 100 days that met the daily standard. Anand Vihar, with a seasonal average of 61ug/m3 had 54 days meeting the standard and was the worst hotspot in the city,” the report read.It added. “The start of the monsoon’s retreat date almost perfectly coincides with the start of bad air days in Delhi—when the daily PM2.5 average breaches the standard and mostly remains above for rest of the season.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delayed-monsoon-exit-may-mean-severe-smog-report-101634944498014.html

23-10-2021||Delhi||After nat’l landmark, Delhi to touch 20mn vax doses today||The national capital is on the cusp of administering 20 million jabs of the Covid-19 vaccine to its residents, according to government data, an important landmark for the city in its fight to overcome the pandemic, even as daily vaccinations have slowed down over the past month.As of 10pm on Friday, according the Centre’s CoWIN dashboard, Delhi had administered 19,972,789 jabs to its residents, just 27,211 doses short of the 20-million mark, a difference the city is likely to cover on Saturday.Of the three Saturdays this month so far, the city administered 137,466 shots on the first (October 2), 154,364 on the second (October 9) and 112,435 on the third (October 16), and if the trends continue, Delhi will on Saturday become the 18th state or Union Territory to surpass the 20-million figure for Covid-19 jabs.Of the total shots administered in the city, over 5.7 million have taken the first jab of the shot, and 7.1 million have been fully vaccinated.Delhi has an adult population of around 15 million, according to January 2021 electoral data.This means that 38.2% of the city’s adults have been partially vaccinated, while another 47.1% have received both shots. The national average for both these statistics is 44.1% and 31.8% respectively.The landmark figure for Delhi will come two days after the country completed administering the billionth vaccine dose on Thursday morning, just over nine months after the country began a massive inoculation programme to protect all its adults against Covid-19.In a statement, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office said on Friday evening said, “As a responsible and sensitive, the Kejriwal government rapidly working on vaccinating the entire population of Delhi and will leave no one behind in this drive. The Delhi government is about to touch the two-crore [20 million] mark thanks to our highly motivated front line workers and our rigorous infrastructure, which helped accelerate our efforts even when we had low vaccine stocks.”However, despite hovering close to the 20 million milestone, Delhi’s vaccination rate has dropped through October, which is particularly evident against a substantial spike in the pace of shots administered through September. The seven-day average of daily jabs in Delhi touched a peak of 166,545 for the week-ending September 26, has dropped nearly 55% in the past weekTo be sure, Delhi is not an outlying region to have witnessed such a drop – it is visible at the national level as well. The seven-day average of daily vaccinations in India, which touched a peak of 9.7 million for the week ending September 23, has dropped nearly 60% in the past week.The Capital has so far in October handed out 2,093,202 doses of Covishield, Covaxin or Sputnik V – the three shots currently on offer across the country, at a monthly average of just over 95,000 shots a day.This vaccination rate is a sharp drop from the 4,360,224 jabs in September that came at an average of over 145,000 doses every day.However, the Covid-19 infection numbers in Delhi continue to persist at record lows, levels not seen since late-March last year, which was just weeks after the pathogen set foot in the Capital.The city added an average of 27 cases each day over the past seven days, a sharp fall from the average of 25,294 cases it added in the seven days ending April 23. Delhi endured its most brutal wave of Covid-19 between April and May this year.“For a city like Delhi, we can say the pace of vaccination has been satisfactory,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/after-nat-l-landmark-delhi-to-touch-20mn-vax-doses-today-101634944032017.html
23-10-2021||Chandigarh||Hero Women’s Pro Golf Tour: Amateur Avani walks away with title, Amandeep finishes second||Amateur Avani Prashanth won her second title of the season as she held off the seasoned Amandeep Drall by a shot to win the 11th leg of the Hero Women’s Pro Golf Tour at the Panchkula Golf Club on Friday. Avani and Amandeep played even par rounds, which helped Avani stay ahead to emerge the victor. Avani totalled 2-under 214, while Amandeep aggregated 1-under 215.Three players, Pranavi Urs (76), Jahanvi Bakshi (73) and Vani Kapoor (73) were tied for third place at 4-over 219. Seher Atwal (75) was sixth at 221 and Rhea Jha (73) was seventh.Saaniya Sharma, amateur Kriti Chowhan and Hitaashee Bakshi occupied the eighth to 10th places.Amateur Avani, who is playing both the Hero WPGT circuit and the amateur tours won the third leg in Mumbai and was also a runner-up at the DLF Golf and Country Club in Gurugram in the eighth leg and was again second in the 10th leg last week in Chandigarh. So, the win in the 11th Leg was even sweeter.Another piece of cheerful news was that Avani’s 66 in the second round, as also that of Saaniya Sharma were confirmed as the ladies scoring record at the Panchkula Golf Club.Starting the final day one shot behind Avani, experienced Amandeep bridged that narrow gap with a birdie on the second hole. However, a dropped shot on Par-5 fifth gave the lead back to Avani, who parred the first six holes.Avani landed her first birdie on the seventh, but gave away that gain on the next hole. So, when the players reached the turn, Avani was still one ahead. The others had been way behind, and the contest was now between Avani and Amandeep.On the back nine, while Avani birdied 11th and 12th, Amandeep birdied 11th and bogeyed 12th. That meant Avani was now three shots clear.There was another twist as Avani dropped shots on Par-3 13th and Par-4 15th, while Amandeep birdied 15th to pull level with the young amateur.With two holes left, it was now about holding nerves. Amandeep bogeyed the 17th, while Avani parred the 17th and 18th and won the title.Pranavi had a disappointing final day as she bogeyed first and then double bogeyed Par-5 seventh. On the back nine she had three bogeys in a row on 15th, 16th and 17th. Her two birdies of the day were on fifth and sixth as she carded 76 and fell into a tie for third with Vani Kapoor and Jahanvi.Saaniya Sharma, who opened with 79 and then had a superb 66 in the second round to set a ladies course record jointly with amateur Avani, who also shot 66 in the second round, once again went to 78 in the final round to fall to eighth.Amandeep Drall continues to lead the Hero Order of Merit, while Vani Kapoor remains second.Amandeep has now won ₹15.01 lakh, while Vani has amassed ₹13 lakh and Jahanvi became the third player to cross the ₹10 lakh mark as she has earned ₹10.67 lakh. Hitaashee, Seher and Saaniya are fourth, fifth and sixth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hero-women-s-pro-golf-tour-amateur-avani-walks-away-with-title-amandeep-finishes-second-101634939265655.html

The district has also lost 21 patients to the virus, transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The civil hospital had bought an apheresis machine at a cost of around ₹30 lakh three years ago, but has never been able to make use of it. The machine, if functional, can extract 30,000-40,000 platelets from a single unit of blood. Mohali civil surgeon Dr Adarsh Pal Kaur said a part of the machine has been damaged. “We have already informed the authorities concerned about it. An engineer will come next week and hopefully, it will be functional soon.” She further said, “We have one machine in Kharar, which is functional, and we get the platelets from there as and when we require. Also, for use of the machine, the kit has to be provided by the patients only. One kit costs around ₹8,000.” A senior official of the hospital said, “Most patients go to private hospitals for platelets, which is very expensive.” UT health secretary Yashpal Garg, had earlier issued a statement, which read, “The patient count in Chandigarh hospitals has increased manifold due to patients coming from adjoining areas. In the past one week alone, 80% of patients from adjoining areas who were suffering from acute fever were admitted at Government Medical College and Hospital in Sector 32. Most of the patients who are referred to our hospitals are non-critical and can be treated in their respective hospitals only.”What the machine does? An apheresis machine is a device which receives blood removed from a patient or donor’s body and separates it into its various components: plasma, platelets, white blood cells and red blood cells. Depending on the reason for apheresis, one of these components is isolated and collected by the instrument, while the others are returned to the body. The machine at the Mohali district hospital can extract 30,000-40,000 platelets from a single unit of blood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dengue-outbreak-lone-platelet-extracting-machine-at-mohali-dist-hospital-lying-defunct-101634938364238.html

23-10-2021||Chandigarh||Patiala man held for his fiancée’s murder turns out to be ‘serial killer’||A 40-year-old man from Patiala city’s Urban Estate Colony, who buried his fiancée in his house after allegedly killing her recently, has turned out to be a serial killer as he also confessed to have murdered his first wife last month, police claimed. The investigators are also probing a possible link of the suspect with a 2014 case of purported suicide wherein a woman residing opposite his house had allegedly set herself ablaze, officials familiar with the matter said. The accused, Navninder Preet Singh who is in police custody following his arrest on Thursday, was in a relationship with at least three women, they said. The matter came to light during investigation into the murder of Chapinderpal Kaur (28) of Bathinda who was asphyxiated to death on October 14. Chapinderpal was to marry Navninder on Wednesday (October 20) but he allegedly killed her and buried her body in his bedroom after she discovered that he was already married to another woman. Patiala senior superintendent of police (SSP) Harcharan Singh Bhullar said Navninder married Sukhdeep Kaur (39) of Sangrur in February 2018 and started staying with her in a rented accommodation. “The two started quarrelling after Sukhdeep in September came to know about his marriage with one Lakhwinder Kaur of Sangrur’s Bhawanigarh. Lakhwinder, who married the accused in October 2018, has been living near his residence,” the SSP said. Sukhdeep was expecting her first child, he added.“The accused hatched a conspiracy to eliminate Sukhdeep. On September 20, he brought home a nitrogen cylinder and told her that it contained oxygen inhaling which would help the foetus grow. She died as soon as she inhaled the gas,” Bhullar said. The accused, the SSP said, took Sukhdeep’s parents into confidence saying she died of cardiac arrest. “Believing Navninder’s claim, the family performed her last rites,” he said. Patiala crime investigation agency (CIA) incharge Shaminder Singh said that in the meantime Navninder got engaged to Chapinderpal. “She (Chapinderpal) didn’t know anything about his marriage to Sukhdeep but she discovered that he had tied the knot with Lakhwinder. On this, he planned to kill Chapinderpal and called her for wedding shopping on October 11. Three days later (October 14), he also asked her to inhale the poisonous gas from the cylinder saying it would make her face glow,” the CIA incharge said. The accused had already dug a four-foot deep pit in his bedroom and buried her body in it, he said. “He covered the pit with tiles and placed a couch on it,” he added. “The suspect has been residing with his elderly parents, aged 80 and 75. His father retired as a colonel from the army. Navninder is law graduate and a postgraduate in sociology and was taking online classes with a US-based institute. We are also probing whether his parents and second wife Lakhwinder had any knowledge of his crimes,” the SSP said. A case under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) has been registered in this connection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/patiala-man-held-for-his-fianc-e-s-murder-turns-out-to-be-serial-killer-101634936985697.html

Speaking at the Rampur assembly segment of Shimla district, which falls in the Mandi parliamentary constituency, he said, “The Congress cannot come to terms with the fact that the BJP has fielded an ex-serviceman and a war veteran from Mandi. Congress leaders call the Kargil a small conflict and say army personnel should not be in politics. However, we need people who will work with honesty and integrity and who better than a soldier?”Campaigning for Brigadier Khushal Thakur, who has been pitted against former MP Pratibha Singh, he said, “Our government has made a provision to provide pension to over four lakh elderly people and has provided free gas connections and stoves. Lakhs of people are being given free treatment under the Himcare Scheme. However, for the Congress only scams fall in the category of developmental work.” On the issue of inflation, he turned the tables on the Congress, saying, “The Opposition claims that whatever development has taken place in the state is because to them and so they must also accept that they were also responsible for inflation. They ruled the state for over five decades. What did they do to control inflation and unemployment?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hpbypolls-scams-are-developmental-works-for-congress-says-cm-jai-ram-thakur-101634936984466.html

The government owes ₹8,000 crore to the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) alone. Of this, ₹4,500 crore is on account of power subsidy for agriculture and ₹2,500 crore pending dues of government departments.” ₹1,505 crore is needed to waive power bills of people with a load of less than 2 kilowatt besides thousands of crores on other promises like increasing subsidy for scheduled caste (SC) and backward class (BC) power consumers, he said. “The government also needs ₹2,400 crore to clear the SC scholarship scheme backlog and ₹550 crore is to be paid to the landless labourers,” he added. On allegations levelled by deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Randhawa against former CM Amarinder Singh, Majithia said, “Randhawa enjoyed plum ministries under Amarinder and was never tired of praising his former boss and his associates. If he has issue with anyone he should recommend a central probe or one by a Supreme Court judge to look into the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/channi-failed-to-provide-real-benefit-to-people-majithia-101634936265041.html

Speaking at election rallies at Jayanagar, Dhundan and Karada, Thakur said , “The BJP nominee, Rattan Pal, has played an important role in the development of Arki. It is the work of a legislator to develop his assembly area. Former chief minister Virbhadra Singh could have developed the assembly segment if he wanted to, but did nothing. It was Rattan Pal who relentlessly raised the demands of people of Arki.” He also praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s handling of the coronavirus crisis. “The Covid pandemic brought most developed countries to their knees as their economies crumbled. However, under the strong leadership of the Prime Minister, not only did India bravely fight the virus, but also created history by vaccinating one billion people.”“The Centre had carved out a budget of ₹35,000 crore for vaccination and the vaccine was provided to the people free of cost,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-bypolls-virbhadra-singh-failed-to-develop-arki-says-anurag-thakur-101634935844111.html

The incident took place in Dainhat town. The chaos started before Majumdar and Ghosh reached the venue of the meeting.Majumdar and Ghosh, who is now a national vice-president, tried to calm the 30-odd local leaders and their followers. One of the factions owes allegiance to Krishna Ghosh, president of the BJP’s East Burdwan district unit, said local BJP leaders. Krishna Ghosh was allegedly slapped by members of the rival camp. Discontent has been brewing in the BJP’s East Burdwan unit ever since Trinamool Congress (TMC) swept the March-April assembly polls in the district. Sunil Mondal, the TMC’s East Burdwan Lok Sabha member who joined BJP along with Suvendu Adhikari in December last year, also distanced himself from the saffron camp after the ruling party demanded his dismissal as a member of Parliament under the anti-defection law.Majumdar and Ghosh are jointly touring Bengal’s districts to take stock of organizational weaknesses before the formation of new district and community block-level committees. They started the tour two days ago in the adjoining Birbhum district. “The quarrel started because many in the anti-Krishna Ghosh faction feel that they may not find a place in the new committees. Security personnel accompanying Dilip Ghosh drove them out of the hall where the meeting took place and locked the door,” a BJP leader from Katwa said on condition of anonymity. Since Krishna Ghosh was appointed by Dilip Ghosh, some leaders opposed to the district president shouted ‘go back’ slogans at the national vice-president. “If people have anything to say against me, they can always write a complaint to the new state president. They cannot breach discipline. A handful of people joined the BJP with high aspirations. After the poll defeat, they are feeling frustrated. There is nothing wrong with our organisation,” said Ghosh.Majumdar accused the TMC of engineering the chaos.“TMC was behind the chaos we witnessed. Dedicated BJP workers do not behave in this manner,” said Majumdar.The TMC was quick with its comeback.“You cannot expect anything more when a sheep is replaced by a goat,” TMC’s Birbhum district unit president Anubrata Mondal, who is also in charge of the organisation in East Burdwan, said, a remark seen to allude to the mid-September reshuffle in which Majumdar replaced Ghosh as BJP state president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/at-bjp-s-east-burdwan-unit-meet-rival-factions-hurl-chairs-at-each-other-101634935484098.html

Punjab minister for soil conservation and water resources Rana Gurjeet Singh said a comprehensive plan in the drip irrigation sector was direly needed as many blocks in the state fell in “dark zones” in terms of depletion of groundwater.

Farmers belonging to Scheduled Castes and marginal categories, besides women farmers, will get up to 90% subsidy, and others up to 80%.Singh said drip irrigation not only saved 40 to 60% water in agriculture sector, but also helped supply pesticides directly to the root zone of crops. ‘Plan sustainable projects’ Singh, who also holds the technical education and industrial training, employment generation and land conservation portfolios, also presided over a meeting of the Barnala district administration on Friday.Taking stock of ongoing developmental projects in the district, the minister said developmental projects conceived should be sustainable and in tandem with needs of masses.He said the local government ITIs and employment generation department should be in touch with industry heads to impart industry-specific skills and make local youth more employable.On the occasion, the minister also handed over government job letters to four kin of farmers, who have died during the farmers’ agitation against Centre’s agriculture laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/drip-irrigation-punjab-offers-up-to-90-subsidy-to-farmers-101634935372660.html

The direction came on the plea of New Deep Bus Service, a bus operator that approached the court with a plea that it had submitted an application to the government on October 12, but the Regional Transport Authority, Faridkot, had not taken a decision. In its representation, the bus operator company had said that it had not paid taxes for the period between January and October. It demanded that the dues be allowed to be paid in instalments and its buses impounded by the transport officials be released. It had cited reasons, such as less passengers due to Covid-19 restrictions and losses owing to free bus travel facility for women by the Punjab government, etc., in its application. The government in response had told the court that the October 12 representation had been rejected through an October 21 order. The government had claimed that 26 buses of the operator were impounded for not paying taxes and on account of other violations during the statewide drive against tax defaulters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-asks-punjab-to-convey-decision-on-release-of-buses-to-operator-101634935371349.html

The team, led by inspector Sikandar Singh, took a written statement of Lakhbir’s sister Raj Kaur, who told the police that she came to know about her brother’s death on October 16. Kaur, who had alleged that her brother was allured by some unknown persons and taken to Singhu, stated that she was not aware about who accompanied him.On Wednesday, Punjab director general of police (DGP) Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota had formed a special investigation team (SIT) for a “thorough and expeditious” inquiry into the matter. The team includes Varinder Kumar, additional director general of police (ADGP)-cum-director, Bureau of Investigating (BOI); Ferozepur deputy inspector general (DIG) Inderbir Singh and Tarn Taran senior superintendent of police (SSP) Harwinder Singh Virak. None of the team members had so far reached the village, but were expected to visit on Sunday, said police sources.Meanwhile, uncertainty remains over how Lakhbir reached the Singhu border. “We heard that one of the accused, Sarabjit Singh, who had surrendered after the murder, was seen in a village cowshed some days before the incident. But there is no evidence,” said Lakhbir’s brother-in-law Sukhchain Singh. Raj Kaur, however, said her brother was never in contact with any Nihang. Dilbagh Singh, head of the Dhan Dhan Baba Sheikh Brahm Peer Ji Gaushala, said, “A police team had visited us on Wednesday and collected the CCTV footage. We have nothing to do with Sarabjit.

Manpreet said the pharmaceutical park will serve the entire country, particularly the northern region, including Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, western Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. “Being a border state, Punjab must employ its youth productively to avoid them falling victim to sinister designs emanating from our hostile neighbours,” said Manpreet, while adding that the establishment of a pharmaceutical park at Bathinda will provide direct employment to around 100,000 people and indirect employment to nearly 200,000 people.He stressed that the presence of a fully operational “A” level railway station, availability of over 1,350 acres and proximity to the Bathinda Oil Refinery made this site ideal for establishing a pharma park. “134 acres of water bodies, lakes and ponds bolster the land cluster greatly, providing many additional benefits for establishing, maintaining and operating a pharma facility,” Manpreet said. He assured that the pharma industry here will receive substantial support from some of the largest USFDA-approved pharmaceutical companies, such as Sun Pharma, Centrient and IOL Chemicals. “Bathinda will also benefit from an R&D ecosystem comprising NIPER, IISER and Institute of Nano-Technology in Mohali, besides AIIMS and Institute of Microbial Technology at Bathinda,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-fm-meets-union-minister-seeks-pharma-park-in-bathinda-101634935366315.html
23-10-2021||Chandigarh||More powers to BSF: Punjab CM urges PM to restore status quo||Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Friday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to restore the status quo that existed before the central government expanded the Border Security Force’s jurisdiction in Punjab.In his letter, Channi also urged the Prime Minister to give him an appointment for a meeting on the issue. On October 11, the Union ministry of home affairs had amended the Border Security Force (BSF) Act, 1958, to extend the jurisdiction of BSF from 15 kilometres to 50 kilometres in areas along the international borders in Punjab, Assam and West Bengal. Channi wrote that while the BSF was trained to guard and secure the international border as the first line of defence, policing in the hinterland was the duty and responsibility of the state/local police. Moreover, the Punjab Police was a professional force fully competent to handle any law and order situation within the state. The chief minister shared that Punjab Police dealt with terrorism effectively in the past, which would not have been possible without effective coordination between Punjab Police and central agencies. He said joint operations had been conducted successfully against drug traffickers and terrorist modules because of excellent coordination between BSF and Punjab Police in the recent past. Making a strong plea to review the entire matter, the chief minister said there were no justifiable reasons for unilaterally changing the existing arrangements by the Government of India. He said authorising BSF to undertake search, seizure and arrest without consulting the state governments amounted to encroachment upon the powers and role of the state by the Centre and an attempt to disturb the federal structure of the Constitution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/more-powers-to-bsf-punjab-cm-urges-pm-to-restore-status-quo-101634935365173.html

Or are you alleging that both NDA and @INC India led UPA govts in this period connived with Pak ISI?” the former chief minister’s media adviser quoted him as saying on Twitter. The Congress has stepped up its attack on Singh after his announcement that he would leave the party, form a new one, contest the coming state elections, and have an understanding with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Congress first appointed Navjot Singh Sidhu as the president of its Punjab unit against Singh’s wishes, and subsequently forced him to resign as chief minister. Randhawa was not available for comment to clarify his tweet, although he also made a reference to Alam on Thursday in an interaction with the press, and pointedly said Singh has been raising concerns about drones from Pakistan dropping weapons and drugs across the border in Punjab. On Friday, Singh added, “So now you’re resorting to personal attacks @Sukhjinder_INC. One month after taking over this is all you have to show to the people. What happened to your tall promises on Bargari & drugs cases? Punjab is still waiting for your promised action.” He said instead of focusing on maintaining law and order, the deputy chief minister has put the DGP on a “baseless investigation”. Singh has repeatedly raised the security issue and said that Sidhu is a threat to the country’s security because of his close relationship with the ISI and Pakistan. This is not the first time that Alam’s name has been dragged into Punjab politics. In August this year, Sidhu’s then advisor Malvinder Singh Mali , too, did so in a Facebook post.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/randhawa-orders-probe-into-isi-link-of-capt-s-woman-friend-from-pak-baseless-says-excm-101634934104250.html
23-10-2021||Chandigarh||Harish Chaudhary replaces Rawat as Punjab Congress in-charge||The Congress on Friday appointed AICC secretary and Rajasthan revenue minister Harish Chaudhary as the in-charge of party affairs in poll-bound Punjab. Chaudhary, who replaces AICC general secretary and former chief minister of Uttarakhand Harish Rawat, has also been made in-charge for Chandigarh. Rawat had urged the party high command to be relieved off his duties in Punjab. His home state is also going to polls along with Punjab in less than four months. “Congress president has appointed Harish Chaudhary as AICC in-charge of Punjab and Chandigarh with immediate effect. Harish Rawat is being relieved from his current responsibility as AICC general secretary in-charge of Punjab and Chandigarh,” general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal said in a statement, adding that Rawat would continue to be a member of the Congress Working Committee. Rawat was made in-charge of Punjab about a year ago. His tenure was quite an eventful one as the state Congress was rocked by factional feud that saw Navjot Singh Sidhu, several ministers and MLAs revolt against then chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh. Sidhu was appointed the state chief despite strong opposition from Amarinder who was made to resign last month. However, the change of guard has failed to end the strife as the new chief minister, Charanjit Singh Channi, and Sidhu have not been on the same page on senior appointments, cabinet appointments and allocation of some portfolios. Chaudhary’s appointment was expected as he has been holding parleys with Channi, Sidhu and other party leaders for the past several days to resolve their differences. He had worked as Punjab affairs co-incharge in the past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/harish-chaudhary-replaces-rawat-as-punjab-congress-incharge-101634933743686.html

The protesters blocked the road from 9 am and continued protesting till the filling of the report.On the other hand, the police had a tough time in diverting the traffic and at several traffic lights and intersections, a massive traffic jam was witnessed.These teachers belong to specialised categories like BEd or Physical Training Instructors (PTIs). Before the 2017 state assembly polls, the Congress had promised ‘Ghar Ghar Rozgar’ (a job for every household). The president of the union, Gurlabh Singh, alias Bhola, said, “We were promised by Pargat Singh when he was an MLA to get our appointments regularised and said if he becomes a minister he will get it done at the earliest. But it is a sorry state of affairs that an honest politician like Pargat Singh also eats up his words as after being sworn in as a minister in the Punjab cabinet, he has forgotten what he promised. We have also presented a memorandum in this regard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/commuters-hassled-as-protesting-teachers-block-airport-road-101634933325936.html

23-10-2021||Mumbai||No irregularities in Jarandeshwar sugar factory auction: Ajit Pawar||Claiming that many of the cooperative sugar factories which were sold to private firms were sold for ₹3 crore - ₹8 crore during the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) regime but nobody questioned them about it, deputy chief minister (CM) Ajit Pawar said the Jarandeshwar cooperative sugar factory was auctioned after following all the set rules. Pawar and his firm, who have been facing allegations of irregularities in the Jarandeshwar cooperative sugar factory deal, said that at least in four court cases, the verdict was in their favour. “The [Jarandeshwar] sugar factory was bought by Guru Commodities for ₹66.75 crore and handed over BVG [another firm] to run, but they gave it to some other firm after a year. The Bombay high court had ordered a probe into the auction of the sugar factory. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is probing the auction and the truth will come out after it,” he said. “The auction of Jarandeshwar sugar factory was done as per the court order after the management failed to repay the debts despite two opportunities given to them. A special leave petition filed against the auction was struck down by the Apex and high courts,” he said. Pawar said though there are allegations levelled against the auction of the cooperative sugar factories, multiple agencies have already probed the deals and found nothing. There were 65 cooperative sugar factories of which eight were auctioned or given on lease by the respective banks or the state government. Many of these factories were sold during the BJP rule between 2015 and 2019 for paltry amount, but nobody is talking about it. Many agencies such as CID (crime investigation department), anti-corruption bureau, economic offences wing as well as a court-appointed committee have probed into these allegations, but found nothing,” he said. The deputy CM said that the major noise was being made only against selected few sugar factories to mislead the people. ED had attached the property of Jarandeshwar sugar mills worth ₹65 crore in July. BJP leader Kirit Somaiya has claimed that the factory was purchased by a firm owned by Pawar and his family. He had also alleged that the district cooperative banks give loans to the firm by flouting the norms. Reacting to the clarification given by Pawar, Somaiya said, “Pawar has tried to misguide the people of Maharashtra through his statement but he has not answered the questions raised by us. He has acquired Jarandeshwar as a benami property. He has been running the factory for the past 10 years. The Income Tax has been raiding the premises owned by him, his son Parth and sisters for the past 10 days. The agency has found [total] benami transactions worth ₹1,000 crore and benami transactions of ₹100 crore in Pawar’s accounts. We are not against the auction of the factories, but are raising questions over the corrupt and benami practices involved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-irregularities-in-jarandeshwar-sugar-factory-auction-ajit-pawar-101634933204946.html
23-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai records large variation in day and night temperatures||With the minimum temperature dropping to this month’s low at 22.6 degrees Celsius on Friday and the maximum temperature rising to 36.1 degrees Celsius, Mumbai recorded a significant diurnal variation in temperature of about 14 degrees Celsius. Officials with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) attributed this to a flux in meteorological conditions, which is typical as the city transitions from monsoon to winter.“As relative humidity drops and landward sea breezes start to have more influence in the late evenings, it causes night time temperatures to fall. But during the day, because there are clear skies after monsoon withdrawal, there is penetration of sunlight and the maximum temperature tends to be on the higher side,” said an official with IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai.Such a wide variation in temperature throughout the day can have health implications. Physician Dr Hemant Gupta said, “The body’s thermostat takes time to adjust when there is a wide temperature fluctuation throughout the day. We typically see a spurt in respiratory issues and viral infections during such periods. Some parts of the city have smog accumulation in the morning which triggers respiratory allergies and worsens existing asthma conditions.”According to Dr Gupta, the energy levels of people have gone down tremendously as many have been confined to their homes during the past several months due to the pandemic. “Along with viral infections, we are getting a lot of complaints of muscle cramps, low energy level and tiredness. People are finding it difficult to fight the fatigue, and the weather is making it worse for them to cope,” he said. As per IMD’s seven-day forecast for Mumbai, the minimum temperature is expected to drop even further, to 21 degrees Celsius, by Monday. With the onset of winter season approaching, maximum temperatures are also expected to drop significantly before the end of the month. Forecasts suggest that Mumbai will see a maximum temperature of 32 degrees Celsius by October 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-records-large-variation-in-day-and-night-temperatures-101634933203774.html
23-10-2021||Mumbai||Have we completed a billion doses: Shiv Sena questions vax numbers||As Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated the country on Friday for completing a billion vaccine doses, the Shiv Sena, expressing its doubts over the figure, asked if 100-crore doses have been administered. Stating that an “event” is being created over the vaccine administration, Sena’s chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said that there are contradictory figures about the country’s inoculation drive.Addressing the country a day after the cumulative vaccine doses against coronavirus crossed the landmark figure of 1 billion, Modi said our country has succeeded in its Covid-19 campaign and that 130 crore citizens are behind it. “It’s their success. I congratulate all,” he said.The Sena lawmaker said that so far only 33 crore people are fully vaccinated, while many have not got their second dose.“Have we administered 100 crore doses?” If we have done so, then it is a matter of joy. But contradictory figures are being spoken on this. Some people say only 33 crore [people] are fully vaccinated, some say many have not got their second dose,” Raut said on Friday.The Sena leader also criticised the celebrations organised to recognise the landmark figure. He said, “Some people are saying that we have not completed 100 crore [doses], [but] an event is happening... It has become a new tradition to celebrate [such things]. Therefore, all participate in Modi’s utsav [celebration]. If the government had decided to celebrate this, then let them, we will participate. It is our country after all.”Responding to the doubts raised by the Sena leader, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Atul Bhatkhalkar said if Raut has doubts over the vaccination numbers, then he must go and count the doses individually.Bhakhatkar added that the ruling coalition in Maharashtra has made it a habit to criticise the Centre. “Health minister Rajesh Tope in a press conference today said that 70% vaccination has been completed in the state. This means the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi’s allegation of not getting enough number of vaccines is untrue. He [Raut] should apologise to the people for making false allegations against the Central government,” he said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/have-we-completed-a-billion-doses-shiv-sena-questions-vax-numbers-101634933144944.html
23-10-2021||Mumbai||Theatres in Maharashtra witness lukewarm response on Day 1 of reopening||On the first day of reopening on Friday, theatres and multiplexes in Maharashtra witnessed less than 20% patrons, even as only 30% of the single-screen theatres opened their doors for movie goers, associations representing the cinema hall owners said. Maharashtra has 532 multiplexes and 470 single-screen theatres. Of these, 259 multiplexes and 65 single-screen theatres are in Mumbai.“Less than 20% of patrons visited theatres on the first day. Most single-screens were shut because no mega-star movie released on Friday. We expect the business to pick up during the Diwali weekend. However, we request the Maharashtra government to allow 100% occupancy inside the auditoriums,” said Nitin Datar, president of Cinema Owners and Exhibitors Association of India.On October 13, the Maharashtra government had issued guidelines for reopening of cinema halls, theatres and auditoriums from October 22 with 50% capacity. The guidelines allow access only to people with Covid-19 vaccination certificates or with the Aarogya Setu app showing their status as ‘safe’. Cinema owners also have to follow a detailed standard operating procedure (SOP) before allowing visitors inside the cinema halls. The associations have stated that the SOPs are stringent and following them would be difficult.“The SOPs are difficult to follow every time. We have been asked to check the temperature of visitors and report to the authorities in case a visitor has temperature. It is difficult to do everything manually,” added Datar. Multiplex owners are hopeful that people will visit cinemas during the weekend. “Until Friday evening, the business has been nearly 35% across all the halls. We are hopeful that people will visit cinema halls during the weekend,” said Manoj Desai, executive director of G7 Multiplex and Maratha Mandir Cinema.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/theatres-in-maharashtra-witness-lukewarm-response-on-day-1-of-reopening-101634933143803.html

The enthusiasm shown brings out the enormous research output of our institute. The past few years have seen a lot of us dive into Covid duties and battle the pandemic, but that hasn’t deterred meaningful research into this dreaded disease. This is exemplified by the high impact research put up by the faculty in the special Covid section this year,” said Dr Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER.Institute’s 3 best researches on Covid-19In the Covid-19 category, a total of 58 researches were concluded at the PGIMER, of which three were awarded for their excellence and for contributing in saving the lives of the people through clinical services.The three researchers included ‘Should anti-diabetic medications be reconsidered amid Covid-19 pandemic?’ conducted by Dr Sanjay Bhadada, head of the endocrinology department; ‘Drug targets for Coronavirus’ conducted by Dr Bikash Medhi, professor, department of pharmacology; and ‘Covid-19, diabetes mellitus and ACE2’ conducted by Dr Rimesh Pal, assistant professor, endocrinology department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/annual-research-day-pgi-awards-47-doctors-for-exemplary-work-101634933092379.html

23-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Process to provide financial aid to athletes set in motion||Acting on the directions of Punjab sports minister Pargat Singh, district sports officer Ravinder Singh on Thursday sought the names of athletes belonging to economically-weak backgrounds from local coaches by Monday.To promote the culture of sports in Punjab, the sports minister had held a meeting in Chandigarh with all DSOs from the state and the Punjab sports director and directed them to pay special attention to players belonging to economically-weaker sections. The minister has directed the DSOs to buy sports equipment for the players instead of giving them cash.“The minister has assured his support for budding players of Punjab. We have been directed to pay special attention to players who do not have adequate financial resources,” said Ravinder. He added, “Once we submit the list with the Punjab sports director, the budget will be allocated accordingly.”The minister has also asked the DSOs to provide sports equipment including playing kits and tracksuits to the needy players practising in private clubs, academies and schools and not only the sports centres affiliated with the government sports department.“If our coaches train players in a private academy or club or if they know players who take private training and need financial support, we have requested them to inform department about their requirements. The aim is to strengthen the foundation of the players, so that they can bring laurels for the country at the international level,” stated an official.Meanwhile, Ravinder chaired a meeting with coaches from the district at Guru Nanak Stadium on Thursday and sought a list of equipment required for games like football, hockey, baseball, cricket, athletics, handball, cycling, wrestling, judo, softball, gymnastics and shooting. Pargat has directed the DSOs increase the sports centres in the district at par with the coaches.An official said that there are total of 35 coaches in the district appointed by the sports department, but only 30 sports centres. The minister said that each coach should have a centre to run so that more players can benefit.As per the officials, the minister expressed concern over the diet of the players, following which DSOs have made it mandatory for coaches to provide morning and evening meals to the players. Ravinder also warned the coaches of surprise checks by him and the Punjab sports director at local sports centres.Meanwhile, a few coaches expressed uncertainty over the allocation of the budget for their sport requirements, citing the high cost. “A few required equipment for my sport costs in lakhs. I doubt that the government will allocate the budget for us,” said a coach, on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-process-to-provide-financial-aid-to-athletes-set-in-motion-101634932905101.html

On August 21, Mumbai had 2,988 active Covid-19 cases, which shot up to 4,583 on the same date in September and then to 5,328 on October 21. This comes at a time when the daily Covid-19 cases flat-lined to around 450-500 cases per day in October, with an exception of October 6, when Mumbai had reported 624 Covid-19 cases – the highest infections reported in a single day in over two months.On Friday, Mumbai reported 420 new Covid-19 cases and five deaths, taking the tally to 753,653 and the toll to 16,202. Of total deaths, 13,845 are of those among 50 years of age. The case fatality rate at present is 2.1%. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Thursday conducted 38,242 Covid-19 tests, and the positivity rate for the day is at 1%. The overall positivity rate in the city is 6.7% now. Positivity rate is the number of positive cases as a percent of the total number of Covid-19 tests. So far, BMC has conducted a total of 11,134,004 Covid-19 tests.The recovery rate in the city at present is 97%, and the overall growth rate of Covid cases is 0.05%.

23-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai high-rise fire: Challenges in firefighting||The fire at Mumbai’s Avighna Park that claimed one life has once again turned the spotlight on fire safety in high-rises buildings. In cases where a tall building’s internal firefighting system is not working, the Mumbai fire brigade has to rely on its own firefighting equipment. Experts say the major challenge in this is physically carrying the equipment to the top floors of the building. If the fire breaks out on higher floors which are not within the reach of the fire brigade’s turntable ladders, external support (from outside the building) to control a raging fire is non-existent, and rescue operations become tougher, according to them. The tallest turntable ladder available with the Mumbai Fire brigade is 90m long, which can access up to 30-32 floors of a high-rise. However, the city is rapidly seeing a spurt in 60-70 storey buildings. “In such cases, the building’s own robust internal firefighting system is the only way to effective fight fires, or prevent them,” said Hemant Dattatray Parab, chief fire officer of the Mumbai fire brigade. Another senior officer of the Mumbai fire brigade said, “The tallest firefighting ladder in the world is 112m long. This vehicle weighs 72 tonnes. Mumbai’s roads are not made to handle this weight. Even if they were, this is not tall enough for the tallest building in Mumbai. What can you do?” The 90-m ladder owned by the Mumbai fire brigade weighs 52 tonnes. Mumbai’s roads and flyovers are designed to handle a load of around 60 tonnes, as there are utility chambers under all of them, the officer quoted above said. Some roads in the island city have century-old arch drains under them. An officer of the Mumbai fire brigade told HT a few months ago: “When my 90m ladder is out on the field, parked under a building and in use for a rescue operation, I am constantly mindful that I do not know the condition of the road below. I have no time to assess this condition in the little time I have as a first-responder during a fire. What if it caves while my firemen or citizens rescued from a fire are still mounted on the ladder?” Velocity of wind is another challenge. “Even if the fire is at an accessible height from a turntable ladder, the wind displaces the water from a high-pressure hose-pipe,” another fire brigade officer said. Smoke detectors and sprinklers are the real first responders in case of high-rise fires, according to a fire official. Sprinklers, too, play a crucial role containing a local fire.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-high-rise-fire-challenges-in-firefighting-101634932783834.html
23-10-2021||Chandigarh||NGT directs Ludhiana authorities to ensure installation of rain water harvesting systems||With rising concerns over depleting groundwater level, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Punjab chief secretary and principal secretary of the local bodies department to comply with its bylaws and ensure installation of rainwater harvesting systems in public, commercial and industrial buildings with area above 100 square metres.Last month, the Council of Engineers had filed a petition with the NGT, slamming the municipal corporation (MC) and other development authorities for their failure in enforcing the bylaws.The Punjab chief secretary; principal secretary of the local bodies department ; principal secretary of department of housing and urban affairs, Ludhiana municipal commissioner; chairman of Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) and chief administrator of Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (GLADA) were made party to the petition.The petitioner claimed that the civic body charges a refundable fee of upto ₹50,000 while approving a building plan to ensure rainwater harvesting. However, the owners don’t bother to install it and the MC doesn’t take any action either. Ultimately, the fee is forfeited, but no steps are taken to ensure rain water harvesting. The petition added that only a few building owners in the entire city have installed the system and the authorities have even failed to install the system at their offices, including all four zonal offices of the civic body. President Kapil Arora stated that as per the information, around ₹50 crore has been charged by the civic body from residents for rainwater harvesting, but those funds have been diverted for some other work. No steps are being taken to ensure rainwater harvesting and it is against Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, as well as sustainable development.Vice-president Kulwant Singh Rai stated that Ludhiana receives an average rainfall of 680mm in a year. If a roof top rain water harvesting system is installed in a building, more than 50,000 litres of water can be collected.Disposing of the petition in its orders dated October 18, the NGT ordered, “There is no denying the requirement for water harvesting systems to replenish groundwater. The matter having already been dealt with by this tribunal and directions having been made applicable throughout India, no further adjudication is required. The statutory rules of the state of Punjab acknowledge the requirement. Implementation has to be ensured by the authorities and citizens must cooperate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ngt-directs-ludhiana-authorities-to-ensure-installation-of-rain-water-harvesting-systems-101634932723556.html
23-10-2021||Mumbai||Made to seem drugs from whole world are in Maharashtra: CM Uddhav Thackeray||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday said that an atmosphere has been created as if drugs from the whole world have been brought only in Maharashtra and the attempts to discredit the reputation of Mumbai Police need to end. In a related development, state home minister Dilip Walse Patil ruled out any probe by state government against Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) zonal director Sameer Wankhede. Thackeray made the remarks while virtually inaugurating three fast-track DNA testing units under the Nirbhaya scheme to test human DNA samples, which will help in gathering concrete evidence and increase the efficiency of criminal investigations. He also launched the country’s first wildlife DNA testing laboratory in Nagpur.Since the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput in June 2020, the NCB has arrested many celebrities from the film industry in drug abuse cases. The central enforcement agency has recently arrested Aryan Khan, son of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, along with two others from a rave party on a cruise. “Nowadays, there is a wave of drug activities in Maharashtra. An atmosphere has been created as if drugs from the whole world have been brought only in Maharashtra and are being produced here as well. It is also not true that only the special team (NCB) can crack down on drug abuse cases. In Mumbai, four days ago, heroin worth ₹25 crore was caught by Mumbai police (anti-narcotics cell) but since it was just heroin and no name of any heroine (actress) was involved there is no news. No one knows about the names of those who took the action. But for us it is a matter of pride and they need to be felicitated. Maharashtra Police is the most efficient and competent force and attempts going on to disrepute its reputation, need to be destroyed,” Thackeray said.Walse Patil on Thursday said that there was no question of a probe against Sameer Wankhede, NCB zonal director. The statement came in response to an allegation made by Nawab Malik, chief spokesperson of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), that Wankhede has filed false cases against many people including celebrities. “There is no question of launching a probe against Sameer Wankhede. I will take information from my colleague Nawab Malik (skill development minister) about the NCB official,” Walse Patil told reporters in Nagpur late Thursday evening.A senior official from the home department also said that they will have to take legal opinion for taking action against Sameer Wankhede as he is working for a central government agency. On Friday when asked about Malik defending Aryan Khan, Walse Patil said both the issues are different. “It is more like a complaint on the functioning of a government department, minister or a government office. Malik too has complaints against NCB,” the home minister said.On Friday, Malik claimed to have received a threat call from Rajasthan for which an official complaint will be filed with the Mumbai police. Responding to this, home minister said he will take information and if Malik has received any threat call, a decision regarding his security will be taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/made-to-seem-drugs-from-whole-world-are-in-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-101634932663669.html

23-10-2021||Chandigarh||Paddy arrival finally picks up in south Punjab dists||BATHINDAAfter a delay of 10-12 days caused by unseasonal rains this month, harvesting of the non-basmati rice crop has finally started gaining momentum in southern Punjab. State agriculture department joint director Gurvinder Singh said on Friday 2.15 lakh metric tonne (MT) of paddy arrived in mandis of seven districts of south Malwa. From Monday, peak arrival of paddy is expected as harvesting is now in full swing across the region.A visit to mandi revealed that farmers have to wait for days for the government agencies to buy their produce due to a spurt in paddy arrival.Karamjit Singh, a marginal farmer from Bathinda’s Phoosmandi village said he has been waiting at the purchase centre since Sunday. “I harvested 30 quintals of paddy. After waiting for six days, I was assured on Friday that my crop would be bought tomorrow. I am keeping my fingers crossed for favourable weather in the coming days,” said Singh at the Bathinda grain market.According to the Punjab Mandi Board data, all seven districts of south Punjab have recorded slower arrival of paddy than the last season.Fazilka chief agriculture officer Hardev Singh said to date, only 30% area under paddy has been harvested in the district. “Untimely rains slowed down paddy harvesting entire southern Punjab. Fazilka will take another two weeks to complete kharif harvest season,” he said.On Friday, with the briskest arrival of 46,000 MT, Ferozepur registered season’s maximum purchase record of 5.45 lakh MT in the region. The district registered 20.4 lakh MT arrival till October 22 last year.Similarly, Moga’s total arrival data on Friday was 36,000 MT and the total arrival tally reached 1.57 lakh MT. In 2020, Moga had reported 16.75 lakh MT paddy in the corresponding period.Bathinda’s paddy arrival record reached 1.7 lakh MT after various mandis of the district reported 36,000 MT kharif crop on Friday. By October 22 in 2020, the district already had received 16 lakh MT paddy.Bathinda district mandi officer Preet Kanwar Singh Brar said to date 10 procurement centres in the district have recorded procurement of 1.42 lakh MT by various government agencies.“After a slow arrival for several days, the district witnessed peak arrival since Thursday. All facilities are in place for smooth procurement,” said Brar.Weather concerns“The ideal sowing time for wheat is between October 25 and November 15 after which the yield decreases. The prolonged harvesting schedule of the kharif crop may further delay the sowing of wheat in south Malwa districts. The metrological department has forecast light to moderate rain/thundershower activity at many places over Punjab, particularly Pathankot, Gurdaspur and Hoshiarpur districts. Any further unfavourable climatic condition in the southern region will have a direct impact on paddy as well as wheat,” said joint director Gurvinder Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/paddy-arrival-finally-picks-up-in-south-punjab-dists-101634932426234.html
23-10-2021||Mumbai||HC asks Saibaba Sansthan CEO to explain misconduct||Taking cognisance of a confidential report of the principal district judge (PDJ), who is heading the HC appointed ad-hoc committee which is overseeing the day-to-day affairs of the Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust, Shirdi, wherein the objectionable behaviour of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Trust has been highlighted, the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has called on the CEO to explain her behaviour and other actions attributed to her by the judge. The CEO will have to appear before the bench on October 25. A division bench of justice Ravindra Ghuge and justice Sanjay Mehare while hearing two public interest litigations filed by an activist Uttamrao Shelke and another which challenged the constitution of the new managing committee of the Saibaba Sansthan Trust by the state government in September was informed that the ad-hoc committee appointed by the HC in 2019 had submitted a confidential report. The report dated October 19 by the PDJ, Ahmednagar has highlighted the conduct of Bhagyashree Banayat, CEO of the Trust. The bench while noting the objectionable behavior of the CEO has referred to the specific instances mentioned in the report by the PDJ. “About 7 instances of her behavior and steps initiated which may amount to over bearing the authority of the Principal District Judge, are set out. Further instances are listed out which would indicate her actions to be contrary to the directions of this court dated October 14. He has also annexed a copy of the letter dated October 14 addressed by her to the PDJ and the last paragraph of the said letter amounts to taunting the judicial officer and showing disrespect to him,” reads the order. On October 14, the bench had restrained the new panel from taking charge of the Trust till October 19. However, before the new committee could take charge its composition was challenged and the bench asked the state to cure the defects in the composition and only allow it to take charge after approval from the bench. On the same day the PDJ wrote the confidential report to the bench. The bench observed, “We were inclined to direct the presence of the CEO Banayat in the Court so as to explain her behaviour.” At the request of advocate AS Bajaj for the Trust, the Court said that it will deal with the aspect of confidential report on October 25. The bench further allowed the state government to file a detailed affidavit in reply to the PILs till October 27. The state has sought to justify the nomination of the candidates who have been named by it in September. The affidavit will be heard on October 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-asks-saibaba-sansthan-ceo-to-explain-misconduct-101634932423616.html
23-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana police solve 7 snatchings with the arrest of three men||The CIA staff-1 solved seven snatching cases with the arrest of three men on Friday. Eight mobiles, a pair of gold earrings, a sharp-edged weapon and a motorcycle have been recovered from them. The accused have been identified as Shirja, 27, of Kasabad village, Salem Tabri; Shivam Parcha, 19, of Bhattian Colony and Gurdeep Singh, 27, of Bahadurke village. Deputy commissioner of police (DCP, investigation) Simratpal Singh Dhindsa said the accused are drug addicts and committed snatchings and robberies to meet their need for drugs. They were arrested from Bhattian following a tip-off.He added that they were active in areas like Moti Nagar, Jamalpur, Division Number 7, Daresi and Focal Point. They used to target labourers returning from factories and robbed them after threatening them with sharp-edged weapons. The motorcycle recovered from them had a fake number plate and the police found that the registration certificate had also been forged.“Shiraj and Shivam are already facing trial in two snatching cases. They were lodged in jail and had got bail in February and March, respectively. After coming out, they got involved in crime again and involved Gurdeep Singh also. The accused are school drop-outs,” said the DCP.A case under Sections 379-B (snatching using force), 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property), 467 (forgery for valuable security, will etc), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document), 473 (making or possessing counterfeit seal etc) , 34 (Act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) and 412 (dishonestly receiving property stolen in the commission of dacoity) of Indian Penal Code has been registered against the accused at Salem Tabri police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-police-solve-7-snatchings-with-the-arrest-of-three-men-101634932303786.html
23-10-2021||Mumbai||Powai Lake a wetland, needs to be conserved accordingly: Maharashtra forest department||The state forest department’s mangrove cell upheld the status of Powai Lake as a protected wetland, in line with previous orders of the Bombay High Court and the Supreme Court, in a letter to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) earlier this month. As such, the forest department voiced objections to MCGM’s proposal to build a cycle track within the boundary of the lake, which has come under fire from citizens and environmentalists. India is a party to the Ramsar Convention, an international treaty which pledges the country’s commitment to wetland conservation. The convention defines wetlands as “areas of marsh, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which, at low tides, does not exceed six meters”. Wetlands across India are known to be extremely diverse in terms of their origins (natural or man made), water source (freshwater or brackish) and the biodiversity they sustain. Powai Lake itself is a man-made wetland, planned as an anti-famine measure for Mumbai and sanctioned by the Standing Committee in November 1889. It was built in 1891. Since its creation, the water in Powai Lake has been severely polluted and has remained so despite several remediation measures. The water was declared unfit for drinking purposes in 1893. The lake continues to remain polluted due to entry of raw sewage and siltation, which has led to growth of invasive water hyacinths across the water spread. Activists said that this development is significant. “The forest department, which is entrusted with the conservation of wetlands, has confirmed on record for the first time that Powai Lake is indeed a wetland and needs to be protected as such. They have stressed on the importance of conserving its biodiversity and also said that work on the BMC’s cycle track should not proceed further,” said Stalin D, director of environment group Vanashakti, who obtained under the concerned letter (signed by Neenu Somraj, deputy conservator of forests (DCF), mangrove cell) via a Right to Information (RTI) request this week.Somraj’s letter was written to the collector, Mumbai suburbs and the MCGM’s assistant commissioner, S Ward, pursuant to a complaint from Vanashakti regarding the proposed cycle track, which allegedly flouts MCGM’s own development control regulations, in addition to the Centre’s Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017, and the Indian Wildlife Act (1972), seeing as it is also the habitat of the Indian marsh crocodile, a protected species.“According to the National Wetland Atlas of the Supreme Court, Powai Lake is an important wetland in terms of biodiversity and should be protected for the purpose of conserving wetlands,” Somraj’s letter states, translated from Marathi. “If the work is going on in this place, it should be stopped immediately,” Somraj has instructed, seeking clarity on the nature of the construction, which includes reclamation of the lake’s water spread area using a gabion structure (made of stones and not concrete). An official with BMC’s S Ward office said that the work has presently been halted, and that a BMC committee comprising independent experts has been formed to deliberate on the feasibility of the project. Responding to public outrage over these alleged violations, BMC on October 12 issued a clarification stating that “Powai Lake reservoir is demarcated as a Natural Area (NA) in the Development Plan for Greater Mumbai (2034). The repairs, remodeling and extension works around Powai Lake are in line with part VII of Regulation 3.7 of the DPR.”BMC has also clarified that the committee has “deliberated in detail the environmental issues of Powai Lake, assessed various technologies and upon weighing their respective pros and cons, considers the gabion wall technology as the most adaptable method of construction, one which will be least intrusive to the natural environment of the lake.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/powai-lake-a-wetland-needs-to-be-conserved-accordingly-maharashtra-forest-department-101634932245366.html
23-10-2021||Chandigarh||Don’t immediately rush to us if FIR not registered by police: HC||ChandigarhThe Punjab and Haryana high court said that on non-registration of a criminal case by police, an aggrieved person should not directly approach high court. He is first required to approach the superintendent of police (SP). If the grievance still persists, he should approach the magistrate instead of rushing to the high court, the HC said while dismissing a plea from an Amritsar resident terming it non-maintainable.The petitioner, Rajan Kumar, in this case had sought direction to local police for the registration of an FIR against a person, who as per the petitioner, forcibly threw his belongings out of a shop after breaking it open. Further, he submitted that the local police were approached but did not act in this case despite there being a stay from a civil court in his favour.The high court bench of justice Vikas Behl said that Supreme Court has time and again cautioned against the practice and held that the petition under Section 482 of CrPC (inherent powers of high court to issue order to secure ends of justice) should not be entertained for registration of the FIR as there are several alternative remedies available to the petitioner. The bench also referred to a matter in which upon directions from a high court for registration of FIR, the Supreme Court had set aside the order passed by the high court observing that in case, such like petitions are entertained then the high courts will be flooded with such petitions and will not be able to do any other work except dealing with such petitions. The HC bench referred to the provisions of the CrPC, which says if a person has a grievance that his FIR has not been registered by the police station his first remedy is to approach the Superintendent of Police under Section 154(3) CrPC (upon non investigation of a complaint, powers of superior officer to launch probe on a complaint) or other police officer referred to in Section 36 CrPC (powers of a superior officer in police). If despite approaching the superintendent of police or the officer referred to in Section 36 his grievance still persists, then he can approach a magistrate under Section 156(3) CrPC (under which a magistrate can take cognizance of a complaint on failure on the same by police).The magistrate has very wide powers to direct registration of an FIR and to ensure a proper investigation, and for this purpose he can monitor the investigation to ensure that the investigation is done properly (though he cannot investigate himself). The high court should discourage the practice of filing a petition under Section 482 CrPC simply because a person has a grievance that his FIR has not been registered by the police, or after being registered, proper investigation has not been done by the police. For this grievance, he should approach a superior officer and in case still dissatisfied a magistrate or by filing a criminal complaint under Section 200 CrPC (examination of a complaint by a magistrate) but not the high court, the apex court judgment had said while dealing with the issue at hand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dont-immediately-rush-to-us-if-fir-not-registered-by-police-hc-101634932244173.html

23-10-2021||Mumbai||Fire at 60-storey in Mumbai; 1 dead||A Level Four (serious emergency call) fire in the 60-storey One Avighna Park at Currey Road in central Mumbai claimed the life of the building’s security guard on Friday morning. Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) announced an administrative probe following residents’ complaints. A 30-year-old man, identified as Arun Tiwari, fell to his death from the 19th floor as fire and smoke engulfed an apartment on the same floor. A fire was reported in an apartment on the 19th floor at 11.51 am on Friday. No other casualty was reported. The Mumbai fire brigade rescued 16 residents trapped in smoke-filled corridors, gave each of them breathing apparatus, and brought them to safety using the building’s staircase. A video of Tiwari falling to his death was shared multiple times on social media on Friday. In the video, shot by an unknown person and shared on WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook, Tiwari is seen clinging onto the parapet outside the 19th floor window as smoke billowed from an adjoining balcony. He lost his grip over the concrete and, according to eye-witnesses from the Mumbai fire brigade, Tiwari fell on the fire truck parked below, and then fell on the ground. He was rushed to the nearby KEM hospital in an ambulance, where he was declared brought dead. “At 12.55 pm, we clinically evaluated the casualty, conducted an electrocardiogram, and declared the person dead. His body was handed to the police,” said Pravin Bangar, chief medical officer of KEM hospital. Tiwari’s death occurred a few minutes after fire engines and equipment, including a turntable ladder, reached the spot. The turntable ladder entered the premises from the main gate, which was parallel to where Tiwari fell from. A fire truck was stationed on the side Tiwari was trying to escape the fire from. By the time the fire brigade directed the turntable ladder for this rescue, Tiwari fell off the building onto the fire truck, a fire officer said. Another senior officer from the fire brigade said, “It is unclear why Tiwari went up to the 19th floor during or immediately after the fire, or whether he was already there before the fire broke out. It is also unclear if he went to rescue any trapped residents, or went to check if the floor was clear, and then got stuck there due to smoke.” The fire was fanned further by the high wind speed on the 19th floor, and thick smoke had engulfed the corridor. “This may have compromised his visibility, and made breathing difficult. Imagine the state of the person trapped in such a space,” the fire official said. As there is no other eyewitness, it is also unclear how he accessed this area. The senior fire official quoted above said, “The fire was reported in apartment 1901, which was occupied. The security person is seen at the window of this flat itself. It is likely he went to check if there were any residents still trapped in the flat. More details are awaited.” Another security person from the building said, “The window on the floor below was open. It looks like Tiwari must have thought he could access that window from the parapet, jump into the flat below, and escape. But he missed and fell to the ground.” Tiwari hails from Prayagraj (earlier Allahabad) in Uttar Pradesh, and had worked as a security guard with Stealth Management Solutions for more than six years. Tiwari’s brother-in-law Jitendra Tripathi said, “Tiwari’s father died a few years back. His mother lives with his elder brother in UP. The family is poor, and this forced Arun to pick up a security job in Mumbai. It’s an unfortunate incident. The security company and the (residential) society should help his family.” Tiwari’s uncle Dinesh Pandey said, “Tiwari supported his family which won’t be able to take the body to his home town. It’s the security firm and local administration’s responsibility to help the family get his body,” said Dinesh Pandey. A colleague of Tiwari said that he was a good human being and was hard working. “It’s a very sad and unfortunate event. Our security firm said they are helping the grieving family and relatives, and ensuring that they are not harassed over paperwork.” The relatives after post mortem report will take the body to the native place for final rituals. Hopefully his family gets some compensation,” the guard said. Kalachowki police station’s senior police inspector Anand Muley said, “The police have not received any complaint against anyone. Therefore, an accidental death report is being registered. To ascertain the exact sequence of events, our officers are recording statement of colleagues of the deceased person.” One Avighna Park has two wings, A and B; the fire was reported in the latter. According to a member of its maintenance and management team, the building has approximately 60% occupancy. Each floor has two to four flats. “The fire alarm went off after the fire, and residents vacated the building,” he said. “Some were trapped due to smoke, and were rescued by the fire brigade.” The firefighting system of the building was functional, but was not operational as soon as the fire occurred. The fire brigade manually started the fire fighting system, which helped douse the fire. The senior fire brigade officer quoted above said, “Fortunately, the fire was on the 19th floor. The fire brigade’s 90-metre ladder was used to contain the fire with a high-pressure hose pipe. This allowed us early entry and to fight the fire from within. Due to wind velocity at that height, it is difficult to match the speed of the spread of fire with our firefighting operations. Had the fire been on any floor higher than the 25th, it would have been challenging.” Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, and Mayor Kishori Pednekar visited the building. Chahal said, “I have ordered an administrative probe into the fire, following complaints from residents. Based on the report of this probe, appropriate action will be initiated.” Pednekar said, “Arun Tiwari, one of the security person’s jumped out of a window and tried to save his life after a fire broke out on the 19th floor of One Avighna Park. Unfortunately, this led to his death. Tiwari’s life could have been saved if the building’s security or similar personnel had provided emergency assistance before the fire brigade arrived.” Pednekar also said residents of the building have complained to the developer that there is a lot of work pending due to non-transfer to the society residents and this has led to the fire. The mayor directed the administration to take necessary action after conducting a proper inquiry into the complaint. Kailash Agarwal, chairperson of Nish Developers, the company that constructed One Avighna Park, said, “The building’s fire safety is one of the best in the world. I had procured the system from Norway by spending around ₹10 crore. I have also been regularly conducting fire drills and submitting fire audit reports to the competent authorities.” Chief Fire Officer Hemant Dattatray Parab said, “The most recent fire safety compliance documents (form B) of the building, which is supposed to be submitted between January and July each year, cannot be found in the fire brigade’s records at present.” However, a fire drill was conducted in the building in the first week of October this year. Aaditya Thackeray, state cabinet minister and guardian minster for Mumbai suburbs, also visited the spot. He tweeted, “Visited the spot of the unfortunate fire incident at One Avighna Park and met with the rescued residents of the building. Fire has been doused and cooling ops are underway. I met and thanked the brave jawans of the Mumbai Fire Brigade for their swift response.”In another tweet, Thackeray said, “This incident in a high rise building only reiterates how important fire safety drills, fire safety norms like sprinklers, fire refuge areas are in every building.” At the time of going to press, Kalachowkie police had registered a case of negligence against those concerned under relevant sections of IPC and Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act. Unverified video surfaces on social mediaIn a video doing the rounds on social media on Friday night, a man named Rohit Rathod identified himself as the owner of flat 1902 at Avighna Park, one of the houses affected by the fire. In the video, that originated from an unknown source, Rohit said, “There was a fire in my house of Friday. My daughter called and informed me of the fire in our house. I returned home from my store, and saw that the entire entrance was engulfed by the fire. We tried to extinguish the fire with an extinguisher but that did not help.” Rohit added, “We tried to use the firefighting system of the building, and thought only water will douse the fire. But the system did not work and there was no water in it. The sprinklers were not working. None of the firefighting systems in the building worked and the fire rapidly spread - to the kitchen, bedrooms, everywhere. My neighbours saved my children. The fire alarm did not go off.”Reacting to it, Kailash Agarwal, Chairman of Avighna Group said, “He (the one who alleged) is protecting himself as fire was in his house and he left his house, asked facility team on ground floor to assist and went out of building and came back at 5pm. He is saying there was fire at the gate, when the fire was in the house. The basic question is that if the fire system didn’t work, how was the fire doused?

23-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjabi, all other regional languages kept in minor subjects category: CBSE||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Friday clarified that all regional languages have been kept in the category of minor subjects for first term exams for class 10 and 12.The clarification by the CBSE came following objection by Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi to keeping Punjabi out of the main subjects. “I firmly oppose the CBSE’s authoritarian decision to keep Punjabi out of the main subjects. This is against the federal spirit of Constitution, violating the right of Punjabi youth to learn their native language. I condemn this biased exclusion of Punjabi,” Channi had tweeted. Responding to his objection, a senior board official said, “As it is known, the CBSE has declared the date sheet of the major subjects of classes 10 and 12 for term – I examinations. It is clarified that the classification of subjects has been done purely on administrative ground for the purpose of conduct of first term exams based on the number of candidates appearing in the subject and in no way reflects the importance of subjects as major or minor.”“Every subject is equally important from academic point of view. Punjabi is one of the regional languages being offered. All the regional languages have been put under the minor category for the purpose of administrative convenience in relation to the logistics required for the conduct of examinations,” the official added.The board had on Monday announced that the first term board exams for class 10 will begin from November 30, while the exams for class 12 are scheduled from December 1.While the exams for minor subjects for class 10 will be conducted from November 17 to December 7, those for class 12 will be conducted from November 16 to December 30.Bifurcating the academic session, holding two term-end exams and rationalising the syllabus were part of the special assessment scheme for class 10 and 12 CBSE board exams for 2021-22, which were announced in July in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjabi-all-other-regional-languages-kept-in-minor-subjects-category-cbse-101634931943547.html

23-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ellenabad bypoll: Sunaina Chautala starts canvassing for INLD nominee Abhay||Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) women wing general secretary Sunaina Chautala, who is wife of Abhay Chautala’s cousin Ravi Chautala, has started a fierce campaign for party nominee Abhay Chautala, who is seeking a fourth consecutive term from Ellenabad which will go to polls on October 30.Ravi, son of INLD supremo Om Prakash Chautala’s younger brother late Partap Singh Chautala, has always had a bittersweet relationship with cousins Ajay and Abhay, claim experts.After JJP was formed, Ravi and his wife Sunaina have been showing loyalty towards OP Chautala and Abhay.When Naina Chautala contested from Dabwali constituency in 2014, Ravi had campaigned for her as her husband Ajay was in jail at that time.Sunaina, is the second bahu of the Chautala clan after JJP’s Naina (Badhra MLA and mother of Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala), to enter active politics.Ahead of the Ellenabad bypoll, Sunaina is holding regular village-level meetings to mobilise the female voters in favour of Abhay.After farmers began protesting against Centre’s three farm laws, JJP’s women face Naina Chautala has been missing from the public scene while Sunaina is making all efforts to strengthen her party which was reduced to one seat from 19 in the 2019 assembly polls.With folded hands, the family’s second bahu was spotted urging voters to support Abhay, who had resigned from the state assembly in favour of the farmers protesting against the three farm laws.“I am seeking votes for the man who sacrificed his MLA’s post to strengthen the farmers’ protest. This election is a referendum to the three farm laws and farmers will elect Abhay with a huge margin,” she said.“The BJP-JJP leaders are struggling to enter villages and are unable to visit even a single village without a security cover. This shows the huge resentment among the farming class against the BJP-JJP coalition,” she added.While canvassing in Ellenabad, Sunaina said, “The voters are enthusiastic to see bade saab (OP Chautala). He is working as a centripetal force for the party as well as for the family. I am doing my duty by holding meetings in village chaupals and close-door meetings with women.”“The women voters have a clear view regarding the three farm laws and are all set to teach the BJP and Congress nominees a lesson in the bypoll,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ellenabad-bypoll-sunaina-chautala-starts-canvassing-for-inld-nominee-abhay-101634930743443.html
23-10-2021||Chandigarh||Dengue cases on the rise in Haryana, patients accuse private hospitals of fleecing||Dengue cases have been increasing significantly in many parts of Haryana, especially Sonepat and Hisar districts, raising concerns for public health. As many as 117 cases of dengue have been reported from Hisar, 75 from Jhajjar and 273 from Sonepat, so far.‘Prescribing unnecessary tests, overcharging’Amid this rise, many patients are complaining that private hospitals and diagnostic centres are seeing this as an opportunity of fleecing.These institutions are prescribing unnecessary tests for blood platelet count even for patients suffering from viral and normal fever, they claimed.A 32-year-old patient from Sonepat, pleading anonymity, said he visited a private hospital in district for dengue test.“After checking my body temperature, the doctor prescribed tests for dengue, malaria and chikungunya. They charged ₹5,000 for these tests. Later, the doctor told me that my platelets are declining and if I do not get single-donor platelets (SDP), I will be in trouble,” the patient added.Jyoti, of Jhajjar, said a private hospital charged ₹4,000 from her when she went there for dengue confirmation.“The doctors performed many tests, apart from the dengue confirmation one. Fortunately, my platelets were at 2.30 lakh,” she added.Senior doctors from Hisar and Sonepat districts also claimed that private hospitals and clinics are collecting exorbitant amounts for admitting dengue patients.“Some are even creating panic among kin of the patient by stating that the patient will die if they are not admitted to the hospital immediately for recovery of platelets count. These hospitals are charging hefty amounts from the families of patients to inject platelets. Also, there is a shortage of kits needed for blood transfusion,” they added.Hospitals overcrowded: Two patients on one bedA senior doctor posted at Hisar civil hospital, requesting anonymity, said cases of dengue are on the rise and hospitals are overcrowded.“Two patients are sharing one bed. There is a shortage of kits required for blood transfusion,” the doctor added.Jhajjar chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Dahiya said a healthy person has 1.5 lakh platelets and during the dengue, the number drops.“There is no shortage of platelets. We are getting platelets from four hospitals. As per guidelines of the government, private blood banks have been directed to provide single-donor platelets (SDP) at ₹11,000 and random donor platelets at ₹400 per unit. If any hospital or blood bank is found violating these guidelines, we will take strict action against them,” he added.Dr Ramesh Punia, in-charge of dengue and malaria of Hisar, wrote to Haryana health minister Anil Vij and other senior officials asking them to reduce the prices of single-donor platelets, which cannot be afforded by a common man.“The government should create a special ward for dengue patients at Maharaja Agrasen Medical College in Agroha. The government should issue guidelines to private hospitals as well so that patients are not overcharged,” he added.Dr Anvita Kaushik, nodal officer of dengue and malaria at Sonepat, said 273 cases have been reported and they are issuing notices to owners of the premises where mosquito larvae are detected.“We are yet to receive any complaint that private hospitals are fleecing patients. The health department has established a special micro plan to detect mosquito larvae in district,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dengue-cases-on-the-rise-in-haryana-patients-accuse-private-hospitals-of-fleecing-101634930443548.html

When my brother got admitted to ITI, all I could think of was joining ITI while IIT was out of question,” said Anju Dohan from Rohtak, whose father works as a driver. “I urge Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar to provide support with my fee,” added Anju, who is part of the Super-100 programme of the Haryana government.“My family could not support my coaching,” said Hari Kishan, hailing from Mewat. His father polishes and mends shoes on the roadside. Hari has two sisters. “It was my headmaster who asked me to appear for an exam to qualify for free coaching. Now, I can fulfil my family’s dream,” said Hari.“I want to become a civil servant. My teachers took extra effort to coach me and now I have cleared JEE,” said Sahil, of Government Senior Secondary School, Rewari.During the event, CM Khattar announced free education for those with verified family income of less than ₹1.80 lakh per annum under the state government’s ambitious ‘Parivar Pehchan Patra’ scheme.Boosting the morale of 29 students coming from poor backgrounds who have cracked JEE Advanced 2021, the CM said, “These children as a great example of the fact that if you have talent, nothing and no one can stop you from achieving your dreams.”Khattar said as per the New Education Policy-2020 such educational institutions are being set up in state where education will be provided from kindergarten to postgraduate level.“Initially, we are going to make an arrangement of imparting education from KG to PG in four universities.

23-10-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A Ram temple in Mianwali||The Ram Mandir has three shikhar, or spires. Each spire is topped with a series of kalash, the filial. Scores of sculpted pigeons are installed (see photo) in almost every landing spot along the surface of these spires. The 1pm breeze is making these motionless birds look helpless, as if they were imprisoned in invisible cages and couldn’t fly. The birds appear to be of grey stone. Suddenly, these dozens of sculptures stir together in a synchronised movement, and fly into the air.The birds are real.Just to cherish this sight is a good reason to come all the way to Mianwali. No, not the town in the Punjab of Pakistan but the township in the Gurugram of Haryana. The cool October is the most idyllic time to aimlessly wander about this cosy habitat.Mianwali Colony is said to have got its name owing to a large number of people here who were obliged to leave their hometown of Mianwali as refugees during the partition. Walking along its lanes is suspenseful for the history-minded. Are there still people living here who lived through Partition? You’ll have to knock on every gate to find that out, but Mianwali Colony for sure continues to be the address of at least one woman with vivid memories of her pre-partition youth—the spirited Meera Sachdeva, 94, has already been profiled on these pages.There is no knowing to what extent Gurugram’s Mianwali resembles its original namesake. This afternoon the place is as calmly as dry fallen leaves lazily drifting along the footpath. In this peaceful world of double-storeyed bungalows, the balconies and porches are inadvertently staging scenes of quotidian domesticity. A pair of blue salwar kurta is hanging on a wash-line, three pickle jars are lined up on a window sill, a white-haired couple are sitting face-to-face with newspapers and chai, a man is engaged with a subzi walla, a woman is holding a jhadoo in one hand and a mobile phone in another. These sights are accompanied by unrelated sounds. A laughter emanates out from one of the houses, a pressure cooker whistle from another. And is that a mobile phone tune, or someone is playing Mozart on a piano? The locality’s primary music, however, is of the twittering of birds.The alternative to walking the lanes is to sit in the neighbourhood’s park, just beside the Ram Mandir. A woman is knitting socks on a bench. A couple of kids are playing about a dinosaur-shaped slide.Meanwhile, one wonders how this same afternoon must be unfolding in the other Mianwali, in Pakistan. To which Ram Mandir do the pigeons there go to when they are tired of flying?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-ram-temple-in-mianwali-101634928780027.html
23-10-2021||Lucknow||Yogi Adityanath distributes appointment letters to technical assistants||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday distributed appointment letters to newly appointed technical assistants in the state agriculture department. A total of 1863 technical assistants (Group-C) got the appointment letters. He hoped the newly appointed technical assistants would help farmers update their technical know-how about agriculture methods.Yogi Adityanath said 4.50 lakh youths had got government jobs through a transparent recruitment process in the state in the last four and a half years of his regime. His government had established an honest, fair and transparent work culture because of which the state was progressing fast, Yogi Adityanath added. The chief minister said the youths recruited through a transparent process were devoting themselves wholeheartedly to the development of the state. “UP’s economy that was on the 6th position in the country four and a half years is India’s second biggest economy today,” Yogi Adityanath pointed out. “Similarly, UP also improved its ease of doing business rank from 14th four years ago to 2nd in 2021,” he added.The chief minister said that his government had taken a lot of measures for the welfare of farmers helping them enhance their income.Agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi said UP was on top in food grain production in the country, adding that the state government had also broken all previous records of wheat and paddy procurement at the minimum support price (MSP) from farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-adityanath-distributes-appointment-letters-to-technical-assistants-101634928222892.html
23-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police arrest man with 1,115kg firecrackers in Rohini||In one of the largest seizures of banned firecrackers this year, the Rohini district police on Friday said they recovered 1,115 kilograms of non-green and green firecrackers from a warehouse in Sector 24, Rohini on Thursday. The owner of the warehouse was arrested for stocking the banned crackers for illegal sale during Diwali, the police said.This is the fifth such seizure of illegal firecrackers in Delhi since September 15, when the Delhi government announced a “complete ban” on the sale, use, and storage of firecrackers in the Capital this Diwali. This pre-emptive ban was imposed in view of the city’s deteriorating air quality over the past three years, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said.Deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Pranav Tayal said that on Thursday, the district’s special staff received information regarding a stock of illegal firecrackers in Rohini’s Sector 24. Accordingly, a raid was conducted and the team arrested Amit Mittal, 44, while he was unloading the banned crackers at his rented warehouse.“The total weight of the seized crackers was 1,115 kilograms. Mittal failed to provide us with any legal document and valid license authorising the possession and storage of the firecrackers. He was storing the crackers in a residential area, which could be hazardous to the local residents,” said DCP Tayal.According to the DCP, Mittal’s interrogation revealed that he ran a firecracker business and had an expired license, which could not be renewed because of the government’s ban on firecrackers in Delhi last year and well as this year.“The warehouse where the crackers were being stored also did not have a license for storage. We are now trying to trace the source of crackers,” he added.Between October 7 and 13, the north district police conducted two operations, seized nearly 900 kilograms of banned firecrackers, and arrested three persons. Earlier this week, the Shahdara district seized 68 kilograms of illegal crackers while the central district police seized 90kg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-arrest-man-with-1-115kg-firecrackers-in-rohini-101634927863684.html
23-10-2021||Delhi||East Delhi corporation reduces construction waste dumping sites||Trying a new approach to tackle illegal dumping of construction and demolition waste, the East Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to reduce the number of designated notified spots where the debris can be dumped.This is in contrast to the approach taken in the last few years wherein civic bodies have attempted to expand the number of such sites.Vikas Anand, the east corporation commissioner, issued directions on Friday to reduce the number of such designated spots from 61 to just 17. A senior municipal official, who was part of the review meeting, said that the civic body will focus on round-the-clock monitoring and vigilance at the 17 sites. He said expanding the number of such sites has not led to the desired result in the last year.“In the last few years, we noticed that it is difficult to man so many sites, which leads to even more illegal dumping of construction waste. In many cases, the owners and builders dump the debris 100-200m away from a designated site, which increases the problem. The idea behind the new order is to push the bulk generators of construction waste to directly deposit the C&D waste in the Shastri Park processing plant. There will be round-the-clock monitoring of the limited number of sites,” the official said requesting anonymity. The two administrative zones under the jurisdiction of EDMC-- Shahdara North and Shahdara South-- generate 750-800 tonnes of C&D waste every day, and the civic body operates a 1,000 TPD (tonne per day) construction waste processing plant in a 2.5-acre facility in Shastri Park.The north corporation has 104 designated sites for C&D waste collection (one per ward), and the south corporation has 65 such sites. The New Delhi Municipal Council has 25 sites and the Delhi cantonment board has one C&D waste dumping station.After the east corporation’s order on Friday, Delhi will have 212 notified construction waste dumping sites. The city is estimated to generate 3,711 TPD construction waste and has four processing plants in Jahangirpuri, Shastri Park, Mundka, and Bakkarwala. The plants utilise construction waste to create recycled materials such as interlocking tiles, kerbstones, and other construction materials.On October 6, 2021, the civic body announced punitive action will be taken against developers and builders who fail to deposit the construction waste at the Shastri Park facility, adding that their approved building plans could be cancelled. Each area’s Junior Engineer will visit major construction sites fortnightly to collect and check C&D waste deposition slips.Rakesh Gupta, the spokesperson of the EDMC, said that separate inspection teams have been deployed for dedicated monitoring of biomass burning, unauthorised dumping of C&D waste, and polluting industries. “Unlike previous years, these teams will be deployed in two shifts for round-the-clock for monitoring and penalisation of defaulters. Special attention is being paid to pollution hotspot areas of Anand Vihar and Vivek Vihar,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/east-delhi-corporation-reduces-construction-waste-dumping-sites-101634927802857.html

The tender has been floated, once it is finalised it will be taken forward,” said Manoj Jhawar, Pune railway division spokesperson.Generally, the practice is to scrap old train coaches, however, this initiative will give the Railway a chance to make money off old coaches.Every coach refurbished into the “Restaurant on Wheels” is expected to bring in Rs2.5 to Rs3 lakh per month.In Mumbai, the first restaurant on wheels at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) was opened on Monday. It has 10 tables and its interiors have been painted with a suburban railway theme and images of local trains and the city’s suburban railway network.The restaurant has been from a retrofitted discarded rail coach and can accommodate 40 people.The Eastern Railway division was the first to start a restaurant on wheels in February 2020 at Asansol railway junction in West Bengal.“The coach will be completely renovated with tables and chairs replacing berths. Once service starts at the four stations we will involve other stations as well ,” said another official from Pune railway division, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-railway-s-restaurant-on-wheels-to-open-at-baramati-chinchwad-akurdi-miraj-101634927744269.html
23-10-2021||Delhi||After two years, panel reviews all parking plans in Delhi||Two years after the Delhi Maintenance and Management of Parking Places Rules were notified in the city, the Apex Monitoring Committee, mandated under the policy, held its first meeting on Friday. The committee reviewed all area parking plans prepared by municipal corporations and discussed new ideas, such as the inclusion of parking spaces for electric vehicles (EVs).The parking policy, aimed to decongest Delhi and reduce pollution by charging a higher fee for surface/on-street parking and peak-time parking and a lower free for multilevel and off-peak parking, was first proposed in 2017 and notified on September 25, 2019.The committee is headed by Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot.Senior officials, who attended the meeting, said the government is unlikely to hike the parking fee anytime soon as people are financially hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.They said the minister advised the transport department and enforcement agencies to be sensitive to the plight of the public due to the pandemic. “It is likely that some amendments will be made to the rules regarding hefty penalties for parking. Overnight parking was also discussed and authorities were directed to share data on major roads to optimise checks and enforcements,” said an official, requesting anonymity.He said the minister directed authorities to identify parking spaces so that buses and goods vehicles do not park along roads at night and add to the city’s congestion. According to the transport department, there are 7,624 buses and 44,533 goods vehicles with valid permits on Delhi roads.On Friday, the government, in a statement, said that area parking plans prepared by civic agencies will be notified soon. They will be published on the municipal corporations’ respective websites after the Apex Monitoring Committee approves the plans. A few area parking plans have already been prepared by the MCDs for locations such as Kamala Nagar, Lajpat Nagar markets, and a few other commercial areas. The remaining plans are being prepared based on guidelines from the transport department, in consultation with residents’ welfare associations, and market associations (to take into account last-mile connectivity). Gahlot also directed South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) to compile all the plans and expedite the process of procuring no-objection certificates (NOCs) from enforcement agencies and the police.A senior south corporation official said that parking management plans of 16 areas have been prepared and added to the municipal corporation’s website for public feedback. The parking plan for Lajpat Nagar has been implemented, he added. The official said the pandemic has slowed down the implementation of the parking management plans in some areas and added that the support of local RWAs is crucial for successful implementation. The 16 areas include Anand Lok, Aurobindo Marg, Geetanjali Enclave, Green Park Extension, Gulmohar Park, Kailash Colony, Kailash hills, Malviya Nagar, Neeti Bagh, Nizamuddin, SDA, Soami Nagar and Siddharth Extension. A north corporation official said that the implementation of the plan prepared for Kamla Nagar has been delayed due to lack of financial resources.In the meeting, Gahlot said area parking plans are not just about parking vehicles, but also about improving the public’s quality of life and making their life easier. “Vendors, non-motorised transport, parks, and recreational spaces find a crucial place in these plans. The focus is on decongesting our roads and increasing walkability, and I’m sure that once all stakeholders start working towards this shared goal, we will have a more breathable Delhi that belongs to motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians alike,” he said.“I also urge citizens to park responsibly and try to switch to EVs, and most importantly use more public transport, which will address a lot of these issues from the grass-root level,” the minister added.On Friday, the government decided to tweak parking rules to accommodate more facilities for EVs. It asked authorities to ensure reserved parking for EVs in a push to promote EVs in the Capital. The Delhi EV policy 2020 also mandates that 5% of parking space in all new construction sites will be reserved for electric vehicles.Another senior official said the government is also considering inserting a provision for the reservation of EV parking spaces in existing buildings.“The MCDs informed the minister that about 200+ EV charging points at various locations are already being made operational across Delhi. The possibilities of using geospatial data to map EV user coordinates, and plot influence area with owner coordinates to develop private charging clusters was also discussed,” the government said in its statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/after-two-years-panel-reviews-all-parking-plans-in-delhi-101634927743002.html
23-10-2021||Lucknow||With rise in dengue cases, Lucknow hospitals forced to increase beds||LUCKNOW: With rise in dengue cases, hospital beds reserved for patients are getting fully occupied and some hospitals have been compelled to increase the number of beds. “We had reserved 30 beds for dengue patients in early September but with rise in the number of patients in need of admission, we increased the beds. At present we have 45 patients in the dengue ward,” said Dr Ajay Shankar Tripathi of Lok Bandhu Raj Narayan Hospital. The state capital has reported over 700 dengue cases till now, with about 620 reported since September 1 onwards or in the past 7 weeks. On Friday, Lucknow reported its single day highest of 32 fresh cases. On Thursday, there were 29 fresh cases. At least 100 patients in the OPDs of different hospitals are being suspected of having dengue daily and an average of 20 patients testing positive. Over a dozen are getting discharged daily from hospitals. Doctors said the threat of dengue would lurk for the next 15 days due to the recent rain. “Preventing mosquito bite is the ultimate precaution. Using mosquito net protects at night and wearing clothes that cover the body well is another precaution. If the surroundings are free of stagnant water, there is little chance of getting dengue,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general, Association of International Doctors. At present, dengue patients are admitted to Balrampur hospital, Lok Bandhu hospital , King George’s Medical University and Civil hospital. The most serious once are admitted to the KGMU. Platelet demand goes up The demand for platelets has gone up, particularly in the past three days. Doctors say most of the attendants who are panicky, want to get platelet transfusion done for their patient. “Platelets are lifesaving but very few dengue patients need transfusion. However, in panic, attendants are forcing medical staff for platelet transfusion and hence the demand has gone up,” said Prof Tulika Chandra, HoD, transfusion medicine at the King George’s Medical University. The KGMU blood bank is issuing over 100 units of platelets every day for the past three days. The normal demand here remains between 25 and 35 units per day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/with-rise-in-dengue-cases-lucknow-hospitals-forced-to-increase-beds-101634927504754.html
23-10-2021||Delhi||HC seeks Delhi govt response after plea challenges jabs for school staff||The Delhi high court on Friday asked the city government to respond to a plea challenging a decision making it mandatory for all teachers and school staff to be vaccinated to attend school. Justice Rekha Palli issued notice to the city government, its education and health departments and the school on the plea by a teacher who sought exemption from the rule, pointing out that an earlier allopathic treatment to cure a hand disorder had led to impotency.The Delhi government’s circular made it mandatory for all teachers and school staff to be vaccinated by October 15 to be allowed to attend school. It warned that their absence would be treated as on leave.The Delhi government, on the last date (October 12), had told the court that they recently received requests from parents of primary school children too to reopen the school at the earliest and if due precautions are not taken then it may lead to the spread of Covid-19.The petitioner said that in 2015, he started encountering the problem of hand dystonia and was diagnosed in 2018. The plea said that he took allopathic treatment for the same but his condition worsened due to medication. It said that due to the allopathic way of treatment, he started showing symptoms for impotence. It further said that his condition improved through meditation and ayurvedic medicines.The matter would be heard in February 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hcseeks-delhi-govt-response-after-plea-challenges-jabs-for-school-staff-101634927445940.html

23-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: As dengue cases rise, North civic body’s chemical stocks plummet sharply||At a time when Delhi is ramping up the drive against mosquito breeding to combat the uptick in dengue cases, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation is running abysmally low on larvicide and insecticides needed to control vector populations, a status report from the civic body has said.The report, filed by the public health department on October 21, shows that the corporation has run out of several insecticides used in anti-mosquito drives. According to the report, the civic body uses seven types of insecticides — diflubenzuron, BTI, mosquito larvicidal oil (MLO), alpha-cypermethrin, cyphenothrin, temephos granules, and malathion technical — for its mosquito control measures. Of these, the corporation has no more stocks of diflubenzuron, BTI, mosquito larvicidal oil (MLO), alpha-cypermethrin, the report said. Even the three insecticides available with the corporation are fast depleting, with only 20kg of temephos granules, 890kg of cyphenothrin and 500 kilos of malathion technical left, the report stated.According to a civic report on vector-borne diseases, released this Monday, Delhi recorded one dengue death and 723 dengue cases till October 16, 2021, which is the highest count the city has seen since 2018. Of the 723 dengue cases, the north corporation has registered 166 cases till the week ending October 16, which is the highest the municipality has seen in the last four years. The civic body had 109 dengue cases during the corresponding period in 2020, 60 cases in 2019, and 62 cases in 2018.Data submitted by the public health department shows that since April 2021, diflubenzuron stock has gone down from 5,500kg to nil, BTI from 2,100kg to nil, and MLO from 6090kg to nil while cyphenothrin stock has reduced from 2,330kg to 890kg. A senior public health official said these insecticides are used to kill larvae and adult mosquitoes in various stages of development by mixing the chemicals in stagnant water and spraying them in high mosquito density areas using sprinklers and fogging machines. “While insecticides like diflubenzuron, BTI and MLO are used as larvicides (in water), a pyrethroid insecticide agents like alpha-cypermethrin are mixed with petrol/diesel and then sprayed through high pressure nozzles to create “the fog” during the fogging drives,” the official said, asking not to be named. The public health department said it is trying to procure the insecticides and the tender process is currently on. “In case of diflubenzuron, the testing of the drug is being carried out and the results are expected in the next couple of days,” the department said in a report to the house.Jogi Ram Jain, standing committee chairman, north corporation, said anti-mosquito drives have not been affected so far as the zonal level staff have enough insecticides. “The matter has been duly noted by us. The figures represent the situation of the central stock. We can continue the drives for another two weeks with locally available chemicals. The anti-mosquito drives will not be affected by any shortage,” he said.Vikas Goel, leader of the opposition, however, said drives have been affected at the local level due to shortage of insecticides. “The corporation is facing a shortage of drugs and insecticides while officials keep saying that the matter is under process. Why is the tendering process being carried out now when dengue cases are on rise? This should have been done in April,” Goel said. He alleged that a similar shortage is being faced in the case of basic medicines such as paracetamol tablets as well. But the hospital administration report states that the medicine stocks are adequate to serve its hospitals, dispensaries and clinics. According to the report, the north corporation has a stock of 8,900 chloroquine tablets, 500 chloroquine syrup units, 1,095 paracetamol injections and 350 paracetamol tablets.This stock is meant for the north corporation’s five major hospitals of Hindu Rao Hospital, Kasturba Hospital, Rajan Babu Hospital, MVID hospital, and Girdharilal Hospital as well as its dispensaries and clinics, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-as-dengue-cases-rise-north-civic-body-s-chemical-stocks-plummet-sharply-101634927142976.html
23-10-2021||Delhi||‘Pink booths’ in vulnerable areas in Delhi to curb crimes against women||For the first time, the Delhi Police have introduced ‘pink booths’ in the most crime-prone areas of the central district to curb crime against women and ensure policewomen patrol more actively.DCP (central) Shweta Chauhan, said that earlier, only men were deployed in traditional policing beats but now the central district will deploy more women in such beats. “Prashakti beat staff” and “veera squad” comprising policewomen will be deployed to control street crime, crime against women and children, she said. “They will perform intensive and visible patrolling in sensitive areas on ERVs, QRTs, motorcycles, and scooties to control crime and make streets safer.“Apart from this, a pink booth manned by women staff has been set up at the Karol Bagh police station. This booth will cater to women’s grievances and the policewomen will take immediate legal action on their complaints. The booth is an attempt to provide a safe complaint redressal mechanism for women in a busy marketplace instead of them needing to visit a police station. The purpose is to sensitise citizens about crime and obtain their feedback. The policewomen will also motivate women and girls to report cases of violence against them,” said DCP Chauhan.The aim of this initiative, police said, is to bring women officers to the forefront in traditional policing roles. “Traditional policing roles of crime prevention and detection, which were earlier considered male bastions, will see increased participation of women officers at every level. They will play an important role in crime prevention, detection and investigation of crimes such as robbery, snatching, pickpocketing, burglary and organised crime,” DCP Chauhan added.She said that earlier women officers were deployed mainly for tackling crime against women, but now, they will also tackle hardcore crime and criminals, as well as participate in community policing. Women staff has also been posted to Cyber Cell and Special Staff of central district.“We are hopeful that with the successful implementation of this new initiative in the central district, residents of Delhi will feel more secure, and these women cops will become role models for women and girls,” added the DCP.This initiative comes four months after ‘Tejaswini’, an initiative centered around women empowerment and their safety, was launched in northwest district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pink-booths-in-vulnerable-areas-in-delhi-to-curb-crimes-against-women-101634926902742.html
23-10-2021||Delhi||DDMA to take a call on Chhath Puja celebrations in Delhi on October 27||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) is scheduled to meet on October 27 to take a call on Chhath Puja celebrations in the Capital and regarding the phased reopening of classes for students in classes 8 and below.The official notice for the meeting issued on Friday, which HT has seen, said: “the agenda/discussion points for the meeting are... considering of opening of classes below 9 in school. Decision on celebration of Chhath Puja festivities.” Other items in the agenda include review of Covid-19 numbers in the Capital, management strategies concerning the viral disease, vaccination drive and awareness programme campaigns.The ban on Chhath Puja celebrations in the Capital had turned into a political slugfest between the BJP and the AAP. The BJP accused the Delhi government of singling out Chhath Puja even as it allowed other celebrations including Durga Puja and Dussehra in the city. While chief minister Arvind Kejriwal initially justified the ban and hit out at the Opposition for “playing dirty politics”, it later changed its stance, and claimed that the decision was taken by the DDMA which is headed by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal. Kejriwal even wrote to Baijal on October 14, urging him to allow Chhath Puja celebrations in Delhi, in adherence to Covid-19 protocols.Regarding schools, in-person classes are only allowed for students of classes 9 to 12 in Delhi. At its last meeting on September 29, the DDMA said that schools in Delhi are likely to open after the festive season. Festivals in the coming days include Diwali (November 4) and Chhath Puja (November 10).The October 27 meeting of the DDMA will take place through video conference facility at 12.30pm, said the notice. The meeting will be attended by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, who is also the DDMA chairperson; chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, the vice chairperson; revenue minister Kailash Gahlot, a DDMA member; and chief secretary Vijay Dev, who is the chief executive officer. The meeting will also be attended by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana, and Delhi’s divisional commissioner Sanjiv Khirwar, in addition to a group of medical experts, including Niti Aayog member Dr VK Paul, AIIMS director Dr Randip Guleria, and Indian Council of Medical Research director-general Dr Balram Bhargava.“The meeting was supposed to take place this week, but it got postponed. However, it can’t be postponed much as drafting protocols for school reopening is likely to take some time, and, if Chhath Puja is allowed, the government will need time to make the ghaats (riverbed areas) ready,” said a senior DDMA official.On September 30, DDMA issued an order prohibiting the celebration of Chhath Puja at riverbanks, near water bodies, open grounds, in temples, and other public spaces, even as it imposed limited restrictions on other festivals like Durga Puja and Dussehra.Chhath Puja in public spaces was prohibited last year too because of the pandemic. The festival, which falls on November 10, involves collective dips in water bodies and worshipping the Sun. It is a major festival for Purvanchal community from Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh, who have a sizeable presence in Delhi.According to migration data from Census 2011 records, 40% of Delhi’s population (recorded at 16.4 million then) were migrants. Of the migrant population of 6.56 million, roughly two-thirds were from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand.The Bharatiya Janata Party, led by MP Manoj Tiwari, has protested against restrictions on Chhath Puja celebrations and organised several protests in the last three weeks.On October 9, Kejriwal said the DDMA prohibited the celebrations because of the inherent risk of transmission in the rituals which involve gathering in large numbers.On October 12, Tiwari organised a protest outside Kejriwal’s residence in Civil Lines. Three days later, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia wrote to Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya, urging the Centre to draft protocols and issue necessary orders with regard to the festival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ddma-to-take-a-call-on-chhath-puja-celebrations-in-delhi-on-october-27-101634926785402.html
23-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh 2020 Road Safety report: Zebra crossing most common offence, speeding saw 250% increase||Stopping on the Zebra crossing and speeding were the top two traffic violations that motorists indulged in last year, according to the Road Safety in Chandigarh 2020 Report. Overall, there was a decrease in the number of challans, which can be attributed to lower traffic during the pandemic year. The report adds that 55,255 challans were issued for zebra crossing violations and 32,497 challans were issued for speeding. In total, 2020 saw 1.77 lakh challans over 2.7 lakh challans issued in 2019. The number of impounded vehicles saw an increase to around 16,870 from the 2019 figure of 15,723. Vehicles impounded for curfew violations added to the load. Challaning on zebra crossing is usually done through an online fine receipt issued by the cameras in use by the traffic police or people who click pictures of the infraction and send it to the traffic police through the social media.Data shows that such surveillance has had a positive effect. Twelve pedestrians lost their lives in 11 fatal accidents in 2020, but none of them were on a zebra crossing. There were only three minor incidents with pedestrians on zebra crossing as compared to 31 total incidents including grievous injuries on roads with no pedestrian infrastructure in 2019.Challans for speeding zoomed from 8,814 in 2019 to 32,497 in 2020. The increase came after the traffic police started issuing Traffic Violation Information Slip (TVIS) challans for speeding using Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) systems.National Road Safety Council member Kamaljeet Soi said, “There is a perception among people in Chandigarh now that if we break the traffic rules we will get caught. The new camera system being installed at intersections will further bolster this perception.”Officials claim results are visible. The number of challans issued for some infractions, including jumping red lights, and dangerous driving have greatly reduced over previous years. Challans for drunken driving dipped in 2020 over 2019, as the traffic police weren’t too keen on using breath analysers with the Covid-19 pandemic a grave threat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-2020-road-safety-report-zebra-crossing-most-common-offence-speeding-saw-250-increase-101634925582926.html
23-10-2021||Gurugram||Entire Gurugram will have to be demolished: Haryana govt on ‘forest’ land||Every building in 11 districts of Haryana, including Gurugram and Faridabad, will have to be demolished if the authorities were to remove all structures from “forest land” as defined and mandated by a 2018 Supreme Court judgment, the state government said on Friday, cautioning that such an exercise could create a “serious and unparalleled law-and-order problem”. Expressing its inability to implement a July order by the top court to raze structures from forest land, the Manohar Lal Khattar-government said that “the task is beyond its capacity” because nearly 40% of land in the state is considered forest land in the terms of the Supreme Court’s 2018 judgment. Therefore, carrying out this exercise, the state said, will lead to a mammoth demolition of buildings, schools, colleges, government offices and residential buildings in 11 districts, which includes all of Gurugram and Faridabad. On July 23, a bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari, directed the Haryana government to ensure that all unauthorised structures standing on Aravali forest land should be cleared. “Our direction to remove all structures on forest land applies to all structures without any exception,” stated the directive. Abiding with this direction, state authorities demolished the slum colony of Khori Gaon, and issued show-cause notices to owners of 129 farmhouses, banquet halls, schools, religious institutions, and commercial structures. Several among these 129 owners claimed that their properties fell outside forest area, but the state forest department dismissed the objection on the ground that these lands were notified under the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA), 1900, and had to be considered forest land. The decision of the forest department was based on the September 2018 judgment of the Supreme Court which declared that land falling under PLPA was to be treated as forest land. It was on this reasoning that the top court in 2018 ordered the demolition of all buildings in Kant Enclave, a residential colony in Faridabad. Submitting its affidavit, the state on Thursday contended that all land under PLPA cannot be treated as “forest land”, taking a stand different from what it told the court in 2018. The state said that a total of 1,739,907 hectares of land in the state has been notified under PLPA, and this accounts for 39.35% of the geographical area in the entire state, including the whole of 11 districts – Gurugram, Faridabad, Palwal, Panchkula, Ambala, Yamunanagar, Rewari, Bhiwani, Charki Dadri, Mahendergarh, and Mewat. It further stated: “In terms of the September 2018 decision and July 23 order, all areas notified under Sections 3,4,5 of PLPA are forest land. The land included under PLPA includes both government and private land and structures that have come up on these lands include schools, colleges, hospitals, police stations, roads, transmission lines, government buildings, defence establishments, infrastructure and residential houses.” The affidavit added: “The demolition required is on a massive scale and beyond the capacity of the state government and is bound to create serious and unparalleled law and order problem… Besides, it raises a very pertinent issue regarding constitutional rights of the people to such land, particularly where construction have been undertaken after taking requisite approvals in accordance with law.” The state informed the court that it has declared forest land under the Indian Forest Act, 1927 and this covers over 1.46 lakh hectare, accounting for about 4% of the state’s territory.In the 2018 Kant Enclave case, the Supreme Court said in its judgment: “We have no doubt that land notified by Haryana under provisions of PLPA must be treated as ‘forest’ and ‘forest land’ and has in fact been so treated for several decades by the state of Haryana. There is no reason to change or alter the factual or legal position.” The court placed reliance on an affidavit filed by the state authorities treating PLPA land as forest land. In its latest affidavit, though, the state took a stand that land notified under PLPA was for the purpose of conserving and restoring erosion of soil, and was applicable for a limited period and not in perpetuity. During this period, when the notification is in force, there is prohibition of specified non-forest activities and that prohibition ceases once the notification expires, it explained. “Intention of PLPA has never been to create or convert notified land into forest land in any manner. The closure or prohibition which is sought to be enforced as a temporary measure solely as a measure to regulate, restrict or prohibit certain activities during the period of such closure which is lifted upon the expiry of the said period,” the state forest department’s affidavit said. During the proceedings on Friday, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the state, argued that the 2018 judgment of the court has gone “slightly wrong”. The bench, however, asked Mehta: “Is this argument now available to you after the 2018 judgment? This judgment (Kant Enclave matter) was the final word on this, unless you are asking us to set it aside.” Lawyers appearing for Khori Gaon residents and owners of properties served with show-cause notices sought time to file response to state’s affidavit. The court posted the matter for hearing on November 15. The Haryana government’s affidavit mentioned that, in 2014, the state government approached the Supreme Court in the MC Mehta batch of cases where the Court was considering protection of Aravali forest land. The state moved an application seeking clarification that land notified under expired notifications or orders passed under Section 4, 5 of PLPA should not be treated as forest. This plea is still pending consideration of the top court. In February 2019, following the Kant Enclave judgment, the Haryana assembly passed an amendment to PLPA by excluding certain land out of the ambit of PLPA notification for purposes of construction. But this law was stalled by the Supreme Court, on March 1, 2019, and seen as an attempt to override its decisions to protect forest land. “No action is to be taken by the Haryana government in furtherance of the the PLPA (Amendment) Act, 2019,” the court said at the time, and the matter is also pending before it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/entire-gurugram-will-have-to-be-demolished-haryana-govt-on-forest-land-101634925042131.html
23-10-2021||Lucknow||None would have dared to fire at Ram bhakts in 1990 if BJP had been in power: Yogi Adityanath||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath again played up the issue of firing on “Ram bhakts” (kar sevaks) in Ayodhya during the Samajwadi Party (SP) rule in 1990 at one of the two caste outreach meetings that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) organised in Lucknow on Friday. “Remember the Ayodhya firing on Ram bhakts in 1990s? Had a BJP government been there then, none would have dared to do so,” Adityanath said at a meeting featuring Dalits.“Will you forgive those who opened fire on Lord Ram devotees?,” the chief minister asked. Yogi Adityanath was referring to the police firing on kar sevaks gathered in Ayodhya on the saffron outfits’ call in 1990 when SP leader Mulayam Singh Yadav was the Uttar Pradesh chief minister.Now, with the BJP in power at the Centre and the state, a grand Ram temple is being constructed in Ayodhya, he said, adding it is an opportunity for 135 crore Indians to hold their heads high before the world.On Thursday, too, Adityanath had raised the same issue during a caste outreach meet. While Adityanath played up the firing issue during a meeting of the Loniya Dalit community, the other caste outreach meet featured Yadavs, a dominant Other Backward Classes (OBC) group considered loyal to the main opposition Samajwadi Party. The BJP has named these caste outreach meetings as samajik pratinidhi sammelan (social representative meeting). At the second meeting, UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh presented the party’s state secretary Subhash Yaduvansh as a leader of the future. “He is a young turk and a community leader of the future,” the UP BJP chief said at the meeting reflecting party’s plan to groom Yaduvansh, a former youth BJP chief, now promoted to the party’s main state body. “We have few leaders from the community but in Yaduvansh, who has featured in the party’s scheme of things in the regime of three successive party chiefs shows the party’s desire to groom home grown young Yadav community leadership,” a party leader said. On his part, Yaduvansh targeted the Samajwadi Party claiming that Yadavs believe in ‘roti-beti’ (bread-daughter) connection, something which the SP leadership has failed to do.“They are five-star people, cut off from us,” Yaduvansh said in his speech.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/none-would-have-dared-to-fire-at-ram-bhakts-in-1990-if-bjp-had-been-in-power-yogi-adityanath-101634922822611.html
23-10-2021||Lucknow||No politics in chance meeting between Akhilesh, Priyanka on flight: Samajwadi Party, Congress leaders||Samajwadi Party (SP) and Congress leaders have said there are no political overtones in the chance meeting between SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on a flight from New Delhi to Lucknow on Friday, ahead of the 2022 assembly election in Uttar Pradesh.Those aware of the matter said besides the brief encounter on the plane, Akhilesh Yadav and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra exchanged pleasantries after deboarding the flight.Samajwadi Party spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary said leaders do have chance meetings and no political significance should be attached to the exchange of pleasantries.“Akhilesh Yadav was sitting in business class while Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s seat was a few rows behind him in the economy class. As a courtesy, Yadav stopped for a while after de-boarding and both of them exchanged pleasantries. We did not get what transpired between the two leaders in the brief meeting. Before leaving the airport, Akhilesh Yadav, however, said ‘let’s meet’ and Priyanka replied ‘sure, we will meet’,” said an eyewitness.Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) spokesman Ashok Singh also said this was only a chance meeting. He said Priyanka Gandhi Vadra arrived here on Friday to launch the Congress Pratigya Yatras in Barabanki on Saturday.Congress Legislature Party leader Aradhana Mishra ‘Mona’ said there was nothing political about the meeting. Exchange of pleasantries is obvious when two leaders meet, she added.On the other hand, political observers have been left guessing about the significance of the meeting.“A chance meeting should not be ignored in politics as sometimes such an encounter may lead to serious business. It will be in the interest of the state if the Samajwadi Party and the Congress come close. Uttar Pradesh needs a strong opposition and aligning with smaller political outfits does not serve any purpose. Both the parties should explore the possibilities of an alliance,” said Professor SK Dwivedi, former head of the department of political science, Lucknow University.The Samajwadi Party and the Congress contested the 2017 UP assembly election in alliance with each other but parted ways soon after the polls in which the BJP won power. The SP lost power as it won only 47 seats and the Congress got just seven.Later, the SP aligned with the BSP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections after good results in by-polls in 2018 but the alliance between the two former political rivals ended soon after the parliamentary election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/no-politics-in-chance-meeting-between-akhilesh-priyanka-on-flight-samajwadi-party-congress-leaders-101634920602750.html
23-10-2021||World||Singapore to permit entry of travellers from six countries, including India||Singapore will on Wednesday begin allowing the entry of travellers from six countries, including India, from which travel was barred, a move that is expected to benefit thousands of Indian students and professionals. The decision follows a review of Singapore’s Covid-19-related travel restrictions and is aimed at further opening up the country to international travellers. Singapore’s recent decision to open “Vaccinated Travel Lanes” for 11 countries, including Brunei, Germany, France, Italy and the UK, while excluding India had not gone down well with many Indians living and working in the city state. A statement issued by Singapore’s health ministry on Saturday said that, following a review of the Covid-19 situation in India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, all travellers with a 14-day travel history to these countries “prior to departure to Singapore will be allowed to enter and transit through Singapore” from October 27. Travellers from these six countries will still be subject to strict border measures, including a 10-day “stay-home notice” period at dedicated facilities.Singapore’s health minister Ong Ye Kung was quoted by the local media as saying at a news briefing that the situation in the six countries had stabilised for some time, and there was no longer a need for strict rules that barred travellers from these nations.Earlier, some Indians living and working in Singapore were irked that India had not been included in the list of countries with Vaccinated Travel Lanes. Indians living in Singapore had been unable to travel home for months. At the same time, Indians who had returned home in the early stages of the pandemic were unable to return to their jobs or educational courses because of the bar on travel from the six countries. The authorities in Singapore were aware of the growing anger on this count and had begun taking steps in recent weeks to address the matter, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. Singapore will allow necessary workers and students to enter its borders in a safe and calibrated manner from November 1 on the condition that they are fully vaccinated before arrival. It will also facilitate the entry of more domestic workers to meet urgent domestic and caregiving needs of local households, while regulating the numbers carefully as the global situation evolves. Travellers from India and the five other countries will have to undergo pre-departure PCR tests within 48 hours, and an exit PCR test at the end of their “stay-home notice” (SHN) period. The charges for the 10-day SHN at a dedicated facility is $1,450.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-to-permit-entry-of-travellers-from-six-countries-including-india-101634996809942.html

This was the third jailbreak in the country this year. The authorities could not immediately ascertain the number of people who escaped the prison following the attack.The attack took place on late Friday night and the ongoing investigation into the incident is yet to reveal the extent of the damage.A handful of such attacks took place last year as well, with many raising alarm about the safety of detention facilities in the West African nation.“I can't ascertain the number of people that escaped or that were recaptured but I am telling you that the security has been beefed up around the custodial center and the town,” Olanrewaju Anjorin, a spokesman of the Oyo correctional centre in Oyo state, told the AP.With jailbreaks becoming more frequent recently, it has become difficult for the police to capture inmates who escape. Lagos-based online newspaper TheCable reported in July this year that at least 4,307 inmates had escaped from prisons since 2017, based on compiled media reports, according to the AP report.In 2021 alone, more than 2,000 inmates were freed in two earlier jailbreaks: on Sept 13 when 240 inmates were freed after gunmen attacked a detention facility in north-central Kogi state with explosives and on April 5 when at least 1,800 were freed in the southeast Imo state when another facility was also blown up.Even though the recent jailbreaks in the country seem to have no connection to each other, all of them have been carried out using explosives, said the AP report. Authorities succeeded in rearresting some escaped inmates, others reportedly returned willingly.(With AP inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/third-jailbreak-in-nigeria-this-year-dozens-of-inmates-escape-101634979598850.html

23-10-2021||World||Pakistan asks TV channels to ban 'hug scenes', says 'disregard to culture': Reports||The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) has asked local television channels to censor caress and hug scenes as the authorities have received several complaints against such elements in television dramas. The list of such objectionable content includes 'indecent dressing, caressing, bed scenes and gestures, sensitive or controversial plots and unnecessary detailing of events which are highly disturbing, distressing for the viewers and against the commonly accepted standards of decency," the order issued on Friday said. It comes in continuation of earlier directions from the authority issued from time to time, it said.Explaining the reason behind this move, the authorities said that they are not only receiving complaints from the general public but are also being chastised on WhatsApp groups. "A considerable stratum of the society believes that dramas are not depicting the true picture of Pakistani society. Hugs/Caress scenes/extramarital relations, vulgar/bold dressing, bed scenes and intimacy of married couple are being glamourised in utter disregard to Islamic teachings and culture of Pakistani society," it said."Forgoing in view, all satellite TV licensees are required to stop airing such content in dramas, henceforth, and ensure compliance of PEMRA laws in letter and spirit," it added.

The agreement, once formalised, would see American forces use Pakistan’s airspace for operations in the neighbouring Afghanistan, the report stated.Islamabad wants a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to be signed in exchange for assistance with its own counter-terrorism efforts, CNN reported citing sources, adding that the terms of the deal, though not finalised yet, could still change. Discussions on the agreement are reported to have taken place during a recent visit of some US officials to Islamabad, though it is not yet known what Pakistan wants or how much is Washington willing to concede.Currently, the said airspace is used by American troops for their ongoing intelligence operations in Afghanistan. However, Washington needs a formal deal to ensure continued access to a critical air corridor within the airspace which is necessary for its forces to reach Afghanistan. The importance of this stretch is highlighted by the fact that it would become even more critical as and when the United States resumes its flights into Afghan capital Kabul to evacuate its Americans and others still left in the country.In the absence of any formal agreement, the US faces the possibility of Pakistan denying entry to the former’s military aircraft and drones moving towards Afghanistan.The exit of the US troops from Afghanistan brought to an end their 20-year-long military presence there. The Taliban, which seized power in Kabul on August 15, is ruling the nation for a second time.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-nearing-deal-with-pakistan-to-use-airspace-for-military-operations-in-afghanistan-report-101634979591095.html

In capital Beijing, people living in some higher-risk areas of the Changping district, have been asked not to leave their residential compounds. Physical classes in schools close to these areas have been suspended, while nearby business areas have been directed to halt operations. This week itself, six local cases, including some due to the highly transmissible Delta variant, were detected in the Chinese capital.(2.) In the nearby Gansu province, long-distance bus services have been suspended in nearly a dozen cities. Trains connecting the provincial capital, Lanzhou, to Beijing have been halted, while only a single flight between the two cities is allowed. Some tourist attractions here have also been closed.(3.) Tourism destinations have also been suspended in provinces such as Qinghai and Ningxia. In the former, officials at an airport have halted services for passengers transferring flights. (4.) Travellers arriving from foreign countries, who have stayed in China for less than 28 days, will have to undergo tests for Covid-19 before entering Ningxia. Additionally, they will have to stay indoors for a week so that officials can monitor their health.(5.) In Xinjiang, railway authorities have halted the loading of cargo destined for some regions in the province till the end of the month. (6.) The latest outbreak was traced to an elderly couple, who were in a group of several tourists. The group started in Shanghai and, later, moved to different parts of the country. This led to the cluster spreading from north and north-western China to other areas, including Beijing.(7.) On October 22, there were 50 fresh Covid-19 cases, including 38 locally transmitted infections, the National Health Commission said, adding that a day ago, 28 people tested positive. The new cases were from Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Beijing, Ningxia and Yunnan.(8.) The total tally of cases detected in the country, since the pandemic first broke out in December 2019, stands at 96,715. With no new fatality, the death toll remains unchanged at 4636.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-announces-curbs-to-control-fresh-covid-19-outbreak-all-you-need-to-know-101634970068482.html

The government is also drawing up rules for businesses with 100 or more employees to require vaccines or test unvaccinated staff at least once a week. The White House is set to issue additional guidelines in the near future.Adobe, the maker of Photoshop and Illustrator, said in a statement Friday that 94% of its U.S. workforce is “or will soon be fully vaccinated.” The San Jose, California-based company said it will consider accommodation requests for employees who aren’t vaccinated for religious or medical reasons.IBM issued a similar warning to staff earlier this month.

He also noted this is having “a dramatic impact on the human rights of the people inside the country", reported AP.North Koreans are facing food shortages and collapses in their livelihoods with the most vulnerable lot being children and elderly people who are at risk of starvation, Tomás Ojea Quintana told the General Assembly's human rights committee. He also highlighted the extent of hunger in political prison camps.For the unversed, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea -- the North's official name -- has closed its borders to prevent the pandemic. Other draconian steps taken by the government to prevent the spread of the viral disease in the nation include a policy of shooting individuals who attempt to enter or leave the country, Quintana said.The UN investigator further noted the closing of borders would have “a devastating impact” on the people's right to health as DPRK's health infrastructure suffers from underinvestment and a critical shortage of supplies caused by underlying human rights issues, according to the AP report.In his final report to the General Assembly after six years as the UN special investigator on human rights in the DPRK, Ojea Quintana added that “increased restrictions on freedom of movement and the shutting of national borders has choked market activity that has become essential for people's access to basic necessities, including food.”Even though North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has recognized the “grim” food situation and is investing in efforts to prevent starvation in the country, the border closure has put the lifesaving humanitarian work of the United Nations and other international actors on halt. The UN investigator said there are no United Nations international staff currently in the country and diplomats are continuing to leave.The UN investigator, in his report to the General Assembly, has recommended that in light of the pandemic, the Security Council committee monitoring sanctions against the DPRK over its nuclear program “should re-evaluate the sanctions regime under these circumstances, and when necessary ease those sanctions.” While humanitarian aid to the DPRK is exempt from sanctions, Ojea Quintana said sanctions have had unintended consequences on ordinary people.As one example, he said, UN sanctions against the export of textiles and seafood -- industries where women are the predominant workers -- have resulted in women who are family bread-winners losing their jobs.In his report, Ojea Quintana also recognised the paradox of deteriorating social and economic rights in the DPRK while the government continues to test missiles, “probably diverting resources that should be allocated in those areas.”(With PTI, AP inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-koreans-facing-food-shortages-collapses-in-livelihoods-un-investigator-101634970710813.html

On Friday, the country saw a record surge in its cases and deaths at 37,141 and 1,064 respectively. Russia's Covid-19 death toll is currently the highest in the whole of Europe.The country has also recorded infections with a new variant (AY.4.2) which is said to be even more contagious than the Delta variant.In order to curb the rising number of cases, President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday ordered a week-long paid holiday from October 30 till November 7, in order to keep people away from their offices and public transportation. Local authorities have been told to strengthen their own restrictions during this 7-day period.In some places where the pandemic situation is worrisome, Putin said the non-working week can start as early as Saturday and go on beyond November 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-authorises-simultaneous-vaccination-against-covid-19-influenza-101634964119007.html
23-10-2021||World||FDA says Pfizer Covid vaccine looks effective for young kids||Federal health regulators said late Friday that kid-size doses of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine appear highly effective at preventing symptomatic infections in elementary school children and caused no unexpected safety issues, as the US weighs beginning vaccinations in youngsters.The Food and Drug Administration posted its analysis of Pfizer's data ahead of a public meeting next week to debate whether the shots are ready for the nation's roughly 28 million children ages 5 to 11. The agency will ask a panel of outside vaccine experts to vote on that question.In their analysis, FDA scientists concluded that in almost every scenario the vaccine's benefit for preventing hospitalizations and death from COVID-19 would outweigh any serious potential side effects in children. But agency reviewers stopped short of calling for Pfizer's shot to be authorized.The agency will put that question to its panel of independent advisers next Tuesday and weigh their advice before making its own decision.If the FDA authorises the shots, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention will make additional recommendations on who should receive them the first week of November. Children could begin vaccinations early next month -- with the first youngsters in line fully protected by Christmas.Full-strength Pfizer shots already are recommended for anyone 12 or older, but pediatricians and many parents are anxiously awaiting protection for younger children to stem infections from the extra-contagious delta variant and help keep kids in school.The FDA review affirmed results from Pfizer posted earlier in the day showing the two-dose shot was nearly 91% effective at preventing symptomatic infection in young children. Researchers calculated the figure based on 16 COVID-19 cases in youngsters given dummy shots versus three cases among vaccinated children. There were no severe illnesses reported among any of the youngsters, but the vaccinated ones had much milder symptoms than their unvaccinated counterparts.Most of the study data was collected in the US during August and September, when the delta variant had become the dominant Covid-19 strain.The FDA review found no new or unexpected side effects. Those that did occur mostly consisted of sore arms, fever or achiness.However, FDA scientists noted that the study wasn't large enough to detect extremely rare side effects, including myocarditis, a type of heart inflammation that occasionally occurs after the second dose.The agency used statistical modeling to try to predict how many hospitalisations and deaths from COVID-19 the vaccine would prevent versus the number of potential heart side effects it might cause.In four scenarios of the pandemic, the vaccine clearly prevented more hospitalisations than would be expected from the heart side effect. Only when virus cases were extremely low could the vaccine cause more hospitalisations than it would prevent. But overall, regulators concluded that the vaccine's protective benefits “would clearly outweigh" its risks.While children run a lower risk of severe illness or death than older people, COVID-19 has killed more than 630 Americans 18 and under, according to the CDC. Nearly 6.2 million children have been infected with the coronavirus, more than 1.1 million in the last six weeks as the delta variant surged, the American Academy of Pediatrics says.The Biden administration has purchased enough kid-size doses — in special orange-capped vials to distinguish them from adult vaccine — for the nation's 5- to 11-year-olds. If the vaccine is cleared, millions of doses will be promptly shipped around the country, along with kid-size needles.More than 25,000 pediatricians and primary care providers already have signed up to get the shots into little arms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fda-says-pfizer-covid-vaccine-looks-effective-for-young-kids-101634958069978.html

However, the airline also clarified that the operations will commence once approvals are received from Indian authorities.“Flights from Sydney to Delhi would make stoppage in Darwin, while, in the reverse direction, the journey would be non-stop. The flights would be operational thrice a week on the Airbus A330 aircraft,” the Sydney-based carrier said in a statement on  Friday, adding that the frequency would be increased by the end of the year, thus making it a daily service.The flights between Australia's largest city and India's national capital would initially function till at least March 2022, with an option to continue if the demand is sufficient, Qantas further said.Speaking on the development, Alan Joyce, CEO, Qantas Group, said, “Given the strong ties between our two countries, flights on the Sydney-Delhi route have been on our radar for some time, and we think that there will be a strong demand from people waiting to reconnect once borders reopen.”Scott Morrison, the Australian Prime Minister, announced earlier this month that ban on international travel will be lifted in November.

23-10-2021||World||US Supreme Court takes up Texas abortion law case, lets ban remain||The US Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear on Nov. 1 a challenge to a Texas law that imposes a near-total ban on the procedure and lets private citizens enforce it - a case that could dramatically curtail abortion access in the United States if the justices endorse the measure's unique design.The justices took up requests by President Joe Biden's administration and abortion providers to immediately review their challenges to the law. The court, which on Sept. 1 allowed the law to go into effect, declined to act on the Justice Department's request to immediately block enforcement of the measure.The court will consider whether the law's unusual private-enforcement structure prevents federal courts from intervening to strike it down and whether the federal government is even allowed to sue the state to try to block it.The measure bans abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy, a point when many women do not yet realize they are pregnant. It makes an exception for a documented medical emergency but not for cases of rape or incest.Liberal Justice Sotomayor dissented from the court's deferral of a decision on whether to block enforcement of the law while the litigation continues. Sotomayor said the law's novel design has suspended nearly all abortions in Texas, the second most populous US state, with about 29 million people."The state's gambit has worked. The impact is catastrophic," Sotomayor wrote.The Texas dispute is the second major abortion case that the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has scheduled for the coming months, with arguments set for Dec. 1 over the legality of a restrictive Mississippi abortion law.The Texas and Mississippi measures are among a series of Republican-backed laws passed at the state level limiting abortion rights - coming at a time when abortion opponents are hoping that the Supreme Court will overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade that legalized the procedure nationwide.Mississippi has asked the justices to overturn Roe v. Wade, and the Texas attorney general on Thursday signaled that he also would like to see that ruling fall.Lower courts already have blocked Mississippi's law banning abortions starting at 15 weeks of pregnancy.The Texas measure takes enforcement out of the hands of state officials, instead enabling private citizens to sue anyone who performs or assists a woman in getting an abortion after cardiac activity is detected in the embryo. That feature has helped shield the law from being immediately blocked as it made it more difficult to directly sue the state.Individual citizens can be awarded a minimum of $10,000 for bringing successful lawsuits under the law. Critics have said this provision lets people act as anti-abortion bounty hunters, a characterization its proponents reject.Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing the abortion providers, said Friday's decision to hear their case "brings us one step closer to the restoration of Texans' constitutional rights and an end to the havoc and heartache of this ban."Alexis McGill Johnson, president of healthcare and abortion provider Planned Parenthood, said it is "devastating" that the justices did not immediately block a law that already has had a "catastrophic impact" after being in effect nearly two months."Patients who have the means have fled the state, traveling hundreds of miles to access basic care, and those without means have been forced to carry pregnancies against their will," she added.Kimberlyn Schwartz, a spokesperson for the Texas Right to Life anti-abortion group, praised the court's action, saying it "will continue to save an estimated 100 babies per day, and because the justices will actually discuss whether these lawsuits are valid in the first place."The Supreme Court only rarely decides to hear cases before lower courts have ruled, indicating that the justices have deemed the Texas matter of high public importance and requiring immediate review.The Justice Department filed its lawsuit in September challenging the Texas law, arguing that it is unconstitutional and explicitly designed to evade judicial review.Rulings in Texas and Mississippi cases are due by the end of next June, but could come sooner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-takes-up-texas-abortion-law-case-lets-ban-remain-101634949534981.html

I desperately hope that I am wrong," said UN Special Rapporteur on Myanmar Tom Andrews.More than 1,100 civilians have been killed in the country's bloody crackdown on dissent and more than 8,000 arrested since the coup, according to a local monitoring group.Andrews, who was presenting the findings of an annual human rights report on Myanmar to the General Assembly, said that he had received information that tens of thousands of troops and heavy weapons were being moved into restive regions in the north and northwest.The findings, he said, also indicated that the junta had engaged in probable crimes against humanity and war crimes."These tactics are ominously reminiscent of those employed by the military before its genocidal attacks against the Rohingya in Rakhine State in 2016 and 2017," Andrews said.About 740,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar's Rakhine state in 2017 after security forces launched a clampdown that the UN has said may amount to genocide.Andrews urged countries to deny Myanmar's military junta the money, weapons and legitimacy it desired, citing a prisoner release earlier in the week as evidence that pressure was working.On Monday, Myanmar's junta chief Min Aung Hlaing announced the release of more than 5,000 people jailed for protesting against the coup.The move came just days after the Association of Southeast Asian Nations delivered a major snub to the military regime, exclude the junta head from an upcoming summit of the 10-country bloc."ASEAN's announcement that the junta will not be welcome at its upcoming summit strikes at the heart," Andrews said.Andrews said that junta-controlled forces had displaced a quarter million people. Many of those who had been detained were tortured, he said, including dozens who had died as a result.Andrews added that he had received credible reports that children had also been tortured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-fears-mass-atrocity-crimes-in-myanmar-as-troops-gather-in-north-101634949207397.html

Some legislators will get pissy. And then in a few weeks they will move onto something else. Meanwhile we are printing money in the basement, and we are fine," Tucker Bounds, a member of Facebook's communications team, was quoted in the complaint as saying, The Washington Post reported.The second whistleblower signed the complaint on October 13, a week after Haugen's scathing testimony before a Senate panel, according to the report.Haugen told lawmakers that Facebook put profits over safety, which led her to leak reams of internal company studies that underpinned a damning Wall Street Journal series.The Washington Post reported the new whistleblowers SEC filing claims the social media giant's managers routinely undermined efforts to combat misinformation and other problematic content for fear of angering then US president Donald Trump or for turning off the users who are key to profits.Erin McPike, a Facebook spokeswoman, said the article was "beneath the Washington Post, which during the last five years would only report stories after deep reporting with corroborating sources."Facebook has faced previous firestorms of controversy, but that has not translated into substantial new US legislation to regulate social media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/another-whistleblower-accuses-facebook-of-wrongdoing-report-101634941508499.html

Argentina’s capital, Buenos Aires, last year went through 234 straight days of lockdown.In Melbourne, people were seen cheering and clapping from their balconies, while cars honked horns continuously at 11.59pm on Thursday when lockdown restrictions in place since early August ended.Many venues, including food outlets and even haircutters, opened at the unusual hour for the occasion.The reopening will be a boost for Australia’s Aus$2 trillion ($1.5 trillion) economy after recent lockdowns pushed it to the brink of a second recession in as many years.In China, the capital city of Beijing is planning to test tens of thousands of people after four new Covid-19 cases were found in a suburban district on Friday, as a new outbreak prompted school closures and flight cancellations across the country.China has maintained a staunch zero-Covid strategy with strict border closures, lengthy quarantines and targeted lockdowns. But the world’s most populous nation is now scrambling to tamp down dozens of infections in several provinces.The latest flare-up has prompted the grounding of hundreds of flights, the closure of scenic areas and schools and a flurry of stay-at-home orders in affected housing compounds.The outbreak was traced to an elderly couple who were in a group of domestic tourists who flew from Shanghai to Xi’an, Gansu province and to Inner Mongolia.

Of late we are witnessing a geo-strategic competition and huge investments by China in the region,” Rawat said while delivering the keynote address of the 1st Ravi Kant Singh memorial lecture. He mentioned that Bangladesh and Myanmar have been the largest recipients of Chinese military aid in the recent past along with significant investments in Nepal, Sri Lanka and Maldives to gain strategic foothold. “China’s foray into Bangladesh and Myanmar is not in India’s national interest and these are pearls in the string of pearls that is attempting to engulf India. There exists an omnipresent danger of regional strategic instability, threatening India’s territorial integrity and strategic cohesion,” said Rawat. The CDS mentioned that Pakistan’s continued sponsoring of cross-border terrorism by state/ISI and non-state sponsored acts against India are a major stumbling block to our peace process and called out China for its partnership with the western neighbour. “China’s partnership with Pakistan through provision of military hardware, supporting Pakistan at various forums in the geo-political arena and the insensitivity towards India’s territorial claims while pursuing the China-Pakistan economic corridor or CPC through Pakistan-occupied Jammu & Kashmir can be best described as an anti-India nexus,” he said. Rawat said that the uncertainty of the Taliban leadership in Afghanistan has plummeted the nation into political instability and turmoil making it a playground for future great Asian power rivalry. Later addressing reporters, the CDS blamed Pakistan of indulging in a proxy war with India and said they will do anything to disturb peace and tranquillity in Jammu & Kashmir. “The adversary will always try and do something. But if we start falling into the trap of the adversary, it will not be good for us. We should not fall prey to their propaganda and we should be shunning these activities,” said Rawat. He said that China was using money power and economics to gain popularity in India’s neighbourhood, but we have to continue with mission SAGAR (Security and Growth for All) and assure neighbours that we are their permanent friends and we want to engage with them on equal terms. “We need to be able to convince them that we will be your friends in the long term. In the short term, they may get monetary advantage from China. But at what cost?” questioned Rawat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinas-foray-into-south-asia-indian-ocean-not-in-india-s-interest-general-bipin-rawat-101635013310783.html

If necessary, take your brother, father or husband to the police station the next morning,” Maurya said.The former Uttarakhand governor also claimed that under the BJP government, a lot of work has been done for women and the system has changed.Meanwhile, BSP MP Kunwar Danish Ali targeted the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh government over Maurya’s statement.Sharing a video of Maurya’s statement on Twitter, he said, “Police stations have become so unsafe for women under (chief minister) Yogi Adityanath that former governor and BJP vice president Baby Rani Maurya is warning women to not visit police stations after 5 pm as it is not safe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/women-should-not-visit-police-stations-after-dark-bjp-vp-maurya-101635013190727.html

Expediting the investigation into the case, police filed the charge sheet in just six days in the POCSO Court.Chief minister Ashok Gehlot too welcomed the prompt court decision and swift police probe into the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-man-given-death-penalty-for-rape-murder-of-minor-101635012950793.html

Gandhi shared the video of the man on Twitter. “Samodh Singh, a farmer of Uttar Pradesh, had been running around mandis for the last 15 days to sell his paddy crop. When paddy did not sell, he in frustration put fire to it himself. Where has this system brought the farmers? The need of the hour is to rethink our agriculture policy,” he said. “There is no greater punishment that a farmer can inflict upon himself than setting fire to his own crops. We must all introspect as to why the system has pushed them to the edge for no fault of their own. It is a failure of all in the nation if we cannot protect those who feed us,” Gandhi added.Without making a direct attack, the BJP leader has been critical of the government’s handling of agri issues of late and has also sympathised with the farmers protesting against the three farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/varun-gandhi-posts-video-of-up-man-setting-fire-to-crop-urges-govt-to-rethink-our-agriculture-policy-101635012591974.html

Hence, we are awaiting orders from the Railway Board, after which we will accordingly make changes in our records, logbooks and computer system,” he said.Reacting to the BJP government’s latest decision, Samajwadi Party state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said, “In four-and-a-half years this government could do nothing but change names or take credit for the works done by Samajwadi Party government.

Citing rising costs and inflation, the matchbox industry announced the price hike from December 1.The matchbox may have been the only item that is being used in daily life which did not see a price increase in the last 14 years. The price of the matchbox was last hiked in 2007 from 50p to Re 1. Earlier, the cost of matchbox was increased from 25p to 50p in 1995, according to reports.The manufacturers of matchboxes highlighted that there are 14 items that are needed for making matchboxes. The price of a kilogram of red phosphorus, an important material required to make matchboxes, rose from ₹425 to ₹810, wax from ₹58 to ₹80, the outer box board from ₹36 to ₹55 and the inner box board from ₹32 to ₹58.The manufacturers also said that the rising costs in acquiring items like paper, splints, potassium chlorate and sulphur have also led to the rise in the price of the matchbox. Secretary of the National Small Matchbox Manufacturers’ Association, VS Sethurathinam while speaking to the Times of India said that manufacturers have decided to increase the selling price from our units 60% to ₹430- ₹480 per bundle which is excluding the 12% GST levied on them.Reports also highlighted that the manufacturers initially wanted to price a single unit at ₹1.50 but nixed the idea as shopkeepers would find it difficult to give back 50p change to customers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prices-of-matchboxes-soar-owing-to-inflation-to-cost-rs-2-from-dec-1-101635010188670.html

The game of cricket and the game of terror cannot be played at the same time". Queried on his statement that repatriation of black money will reduce fuel prices, Ramdev said he had suggested that the price of petrol should be in line with the prices of crude oil and proposed lower taxation. "The government has to continue with welfare programmes of the national interest and it has to also handle various financial challenges. Because of these factors, the government is not able to reduce taxes.

They need to take action on it,” she added, reported ANI.The accusation comes a day after deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa said Aroosa Alam's ISI links need to be probed."Captain Amarinder Singh is now saying that there is a threat from ISI. We will look into the woman's connection with it. Captain kept raising the issue of drones coming from Pakistan for last 4-5 years," Randhawa said, reported ANI. "Captain first raised this issue and later got BSF deployed in Punjab. We will ask the DGP to look into this matter," he added.Singh had responded to Randhawa’s claims, slamming what he called “personal attacks” and insisting the allegations against him were “baseless”.He released a statement and posed a question to Randhawa through his media advisor Raveen Thukral on Twitter."You were a minister in my cabinet. Never heard you complain about Aroosa Alam. And she had been coming for 16 years with due GOI clearance. Or are you alleging that both NDA and Congress-led UPA governments in this period connived with Pak ISI?" Singh asked Randhawa."What I am worried about is that instead of focusing on maintaining law & order at a time when terror threat is high and festivals are around the corner, you’ve put DGP Punjab Police on a baseless investigation at the cost of Punjab’s safety," his statement said.Alam, a Pakistani defence journalist and daughter of Pakistan politician Aqleem Akhtar, met Singh for the first time since 2004 during the latter’s visit to Pakistan, and according to her, the two have remained platonic friends since then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-punjab-police-posting-happened-without-payment-to-aroosa-alam-navjot-kaur-sidhu-alleges-101635007234027.html
23-10-2021||India||TMC to set up working units in 15 states in next one year: Abhishek Banerjee||The ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal will expand its base in five states other than Goa and Tripura, where the party has already begun building a presence, in the next three months and plans to set up working units in at least 15 states within the next one year, party chief Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee said on Saturday. “We have already reached Tripura and Goa. The party will expand its base in five other states, including Uttar Pradesh and Meghalaya, in the next three months. In the next one year, we will set up working units in 12 to 15 states. There will be a contest in Goa, Gujarat, Tripura and Uttar Pradesh,” said Abhishek Banerjee. He was addressing a campaign rally at Khardah in North 24 Parganas where by-elections will be held along with three other assembly seats in West Bengal on October 30. Earlier in the day he held another rally at Gosaba in South 24 Parganas. This comes just ahead of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s maiden two-day visit to the poll-bound state of Goa from October 28. “As I prepare for my maiden visit to Goa on the 28th, I call upon all individuals, organisations and political parties to defeat the BJP and their divisive agenda. The people have suffered enough over the last 10 years,” Banerjee tweeted. Earlier in June this year, after being appointed as the party’s national general secretary, Abhishek Banerjee announced that the party would expand its base in other states to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. The party has already made inroads into Tripura and announced steering and youth committees for its unit in the north-eastern state with an eye on the assembly polls scheduled for 2023. The TMC MP from Diamond Harbour in South 24 Parganas also upped the ante against the BJP ahead of the by-polls while playing the ‘outsider card’ once again, which had given them rich dividends during the assembly polls. “Amit Shah had made several promises while addressing a public rally at Gosaba in March ahead of the assembly polls. But after the BJP lost did you see a single BJP leader from Delhi and Madhya Pradesh? Did they come to help you after Cyclone Yaas hit? No, because they were outsiders,” he added. Though the BJP’s top leadership including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah had claimed that the party would win more than 200 seats in the West Bengal assembly polls, it was the TMC which returned to power for the third time in a row winning 213 out of the 292 seats. Later it won two more seats in by-polls. The party is now eying all the four assembly seats where by-polls will be held later this month. “Five BJP legislators have already joined the TMC. If we open our doors the BJP (in West Bengal) would be wiped out the next day. But we are not allowing any traitors to join the TMC. We have kept our doors shut. Those who have joined were allowed to do so after lot of atonement,” he added. The BJP, however, said that the TMC may embark upon political tourism but the BJP won’t call them ‘outsiders’. “They are acting like private companies and business houses and not like a political party. We have never heard any political party saying that they would open offices in other states. This is nothing but political tourism. They may go to any state to refresh themselves. The BJP won’t consider them outsiders as they are all Indians,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson in West Bengal. The TMC also attacked the Congress saying that it has no ideals left. This is, however, not the first time that Mamata Banerjee or Abhishek Banerjee had attacked the Congress even after Congress president Sonia Gandhi held a virtual meeting with 19 ‘like-minded’ non-BJP parties on August 20. Mamata Banerjee had attended the meeting. “The Congress sometimes made settlements with the BJP to defeat the TMC, while sometimes it formed alliances with the CPIM and the Indian Secular Front. The party has no ideal and hence has no place in Bengal. For the last seven years, the Congress has been losing against the BJP. The TMC is winning against the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-to-set-up-working-units-in-15-states-in-next-one-year-abhishek-banerjee-101635005210362.html

Aryan Khan's bail plea will be heard by the Bombay high court on October 26 which the central agency will oppose. And now the agency is working towards gathering more evidence against Aryan Khan.The probe team has already collected transaction records of some of the accused from whom `commercial' or large quantity of drugs (which attracts harsher punishment under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act) had been seized, the official said. The agency is also checking the accused persons' sources of income, PTI reported.Why Ananya Panday got an earful from NCB's Sameer Wankhede during interrogationThe investigating team is extracting deleted messages and WhatsApp chats from mobile phones, laptops and other electronic gadgets of the accused and checking if they used any other social media platforms for communicating with each other, the official said.Aryan Khan's WhatsApp chats are being used as major evidence in the case against him. In fact, based on his chats, Bollywood actor Ananya Panday has been summoned for interrogation in the case.

23-10-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: October 24, 2004 — Insurance sector opened up to private companies||New Delhi- The Insurance sector has finally been thrown open to private companies. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) on Monday issued the first batch of six licences to joint ventures with 26 per cent foreign equity. Six insurance joint ventures - three in life and three non-life - were granted licences by IRDA chairman N. Rangachari. Reliance General Insurance Co Ltd, HDFC Standard Life Insurance Company Ltd, Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Co Ltd which have already brought in the equity capital, have been given final clearances. Three other insurance joint ventures - ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co, Max New York Life Insurance Co Ltd and Iffco-Tokio General Insurance Co - were granted “in-principle clearance” for registration. Once these companies put in their equity, final licences would be accorded by the IRDA. Sources in the IRDA said that another six cases would be processed for insurance clearances in the next one month. With the grant of six licences, the monopoly of state-owned insurance companies, including Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), General Insurance Corporation (GIC) and its subsidiaries, has come to an end. According to indications, all the six firms would be vying to issue the first private insurance policy in the country. Grant of licences within a very short period after receiving applications has come as a “pleasant surprise” to several promoters who had experienced policy-related inordinate delays in the past three years. Statutory norms prescribed by the IRDA stipulate that companies in life insurance business will have to bring in ₹200 crore towards equity capital. For non-life insurance joint ventures the limit has been set at ₹100 crore.Along with the grant of the first batch of six licences, the IRDA on Monday also allowed setting up of 14 institutes for training insurance agents. However, none of them are located in the northern or eastern regions. Though 26 per cent foreign equity is allowed in insurance business, Reliance has no foreign partner in the general insurance business. According to industry sources, it may rope in a partner abroad for re-insurance business to reduce its own risks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-october-24-2004-insurance-sector-opened-up-to-private-companies-101634998071844.html

The home minister is on a three-day visit to Jammu and Kashmir, marking his maiden trip to the union territory since the abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019.“Delimitation will happen, followed by elections and then restoration of statehood...I want to be friends with the Kashmiri youth,” Amit Shah said at an event with members of Jammu and Kashmir's Youth Clubs in Srinagar. He said that the abrogation of Article 370 from the erstwhile state has brought democracy to grassroots level, which was earlier restricted to a few families.“People questioned the curfew and internet suspension (in J&K). Had there been no curfew, we don't know how many lives would have been lost. Kashmir’s youth have been saved due to curfew and internet suspension... three families ruled for 70 years...Why were 40,000 people killed,” Shah asked, launching a veiled attack on the Valley’s political leaders.He assured that strict action will be taken against those who want to ruin the peace in the Valley, adding that no one can obstruct development in the union territory. Over the past few days, several civilians have been killed in the terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir, sparking fear in the region.Delimitation of J&K is a contentious process that gathered momentum after Prime Minister Narendra Modi met members of 14 political parties in the region at a landmark event in Delhi in June this year. The Delimitation Commission has already started the process of redrawing assembly segments based on the 2011 census of the erstwhile state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delimitation-will-happen-j-k-statehood-to-be-restored-amit-shah-in-srinagar-101634995181277.html

Patole said the Narendra Modi government did not take adequate measures to stop the spread of coronavirus, adding it was "unfortunate the BJP is now celebrating the deaths of people", reported PTI.Patole also hit out at the Union government over other issues including unemployment, farm distress, inflation and the India-China standoff. He claimed China was intruding into our borders time and again but the Modi government continued to maintain a silence on these issues, PTI further reported.Patole claimed the Centre is trying to divert attention by using central agencies to raid ministers in Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra. But the Maharashtra government is “giving it back”. Few MVA ministers and their family members recently came under the scanner of the central agencies such as Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Income Tax, including Nawab Malik and Ajit Pawar."However, to divert attention, the Centre is using probe agencies like ED but the MVA government in Maharashtra is giving it back," the news agency quoted Patole as saying.Speaking about the cruise ship drugs bust case, in which film superstar Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan is an arrested accused, Patole said the ruling BJP was trying to "divide Hindus and Muslims".

23-10-2021||India||CDRI to launch infrastructure resilience project for small island nations at COP 26||The Coalition of Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), a global partnership of 27 countries initiated by India in 2019, will be launching a programme to help small island states develop resilience to climate crisis at the upcoming Glasgow climate change conference COP 26 (October 30 to November 12).CDRI was launched by PM Narendra Modi at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York in 2019. The programme titled “Infrastructure for Resilient Island States’ will be implemented between 2022 to 2030 in 58 countries located across three geographic regions: the Caribbean, the Pacific, and the Atlantic, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean and South China Sea.India, Australia and UK are likely to pledge 10 million dollars each for the project and other CDRI initiatives. Other countries are also likely to contribute. Japan and US have offered support in kind, mainly in technical expertise.These countries are highly susceptible to economic losses due to disasters with average annual losses ranging from 1% to 10% of the gross domestic product (GDP) according to a World Bank report titled ‘Climate and Disaster Resilient Transport in Small Island Developing States.’ They account for two-thirds of the countries in the world that suffer the highest relative losses due to disasters. Overall, these nations also have the highest multi-hazard risks relative to the size of their capital stock as per the UN Global Assessment Report (2017).“When you consider losses as proportion of GDP, these countries are the hardest hit. Some countries have lost 80% to 90% of their GDPs in single disaster events in the past. Because of modest sea-level rise there is an increase in wind and water disasters. So, since February this year we started consultations with governments and organisations in these countries. For example, we have consulted countries in South Pacific; CARICOM (of the Caribbean islands); partners like Asian Development Bank, United Nations Environment Programme etc,” said Kamal Kishore, Indian co-chair of CDRI’s Executive Committee.One of the examples of devastating disasters in island nations is when Fiji was ravaged by the Category 5 Cyclone Winston in February 2016. In total, the cyclone claimed 44 lives, damaged 40,000 homes, hundreds of schools, and ravaged much of Fiji’s infrastructure and transport systems.In Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Suriname, Tuvalu and Maldives 60 to 100% of the population lives within only 5m above sea level.“These regions also face development challenges that constrain their economic prospects such as remoteness to global markets, poor connectivity, lack of economies of scale, inadequate labour-mobility, low levels of development combined with rapid population growth and limited capacity to adapt,” a concept note by CDRI states adding that “their geography and natural resource base offer unique opportunities such as potential for growth of eco-tourism, expansion of fisheries sector, forestry amongst others. However, leveraging these opportunities requires significant investment in infrastructure development whether from national or international budgets. This includes investment in transport infrastructure, improved access to electricity in rural areas and outer islands, updated housing and building codes, tourism infrastructure, water and sanitation, and coastal protection infrastructure.”CDRI will mainly facilitate technical assistance and capacity development in these countries. “Even in ongoing projects, we are trying to ensure they are built in a way that they are resilient and bankable. That will also ensure investment in these islands. For example, many island nations don’t have building codes. National building codes have to be context specific and hence they have to be developed with local organisations. We want a bottom-up approach to this project not a top-down model. Locals should be involved,” Kishore added.“In the context of climate negotiations, this is an important move from India because we are a developing country and yet we are looking to collaborate on infrastructure development in small island countries. Its exemplary that we are stepping up and playing a global role. On the other hand, even the promised 100-billion-dollar fund promised by developed nations hasn’t been delivered. This is a positive story for India,” an official from CDRI said.The Infrastructure for Resilient Island States programme will be launched at a high-level event at COP 26 and is likely to have presence of leaders of states from various countries.On ‘Loss and Damage’ also India will support the stand of least developed countries or the countries most vulnerable to climate change impacts. Loss and Damage is a mechanism by which vulnerable nations will be compensated for irreversible impacts of climate change such as sea level rise, biodiversity loss or extreme weather events. The draft text on loss and damage was weak and couldn’t be finalised during COP 25 in Madrid. “The floods, unseasonal rains, severe cyclones have increased in frequency and severity. There is 1.2 degree rise in global temperature and we are already seeing this. Island countries and all vulnerable nations need to be compensated for such events. We will support the least developed countries on loss and damage because we are also suffering. It needs to be resolved how this money will come through insurance or trust fund etc,” a senior environment ministry official said on Friday. India is also willing to contribute to compensation based on its share but also expects to be compensated for damage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cdri-to-launch-infrastructure-resilience-project-for-small-island-nations-at-cop-26-101634987809541.html
23-10-2021||India||5 illegally migrated Myanmar nationals arrested in Assam’s Cachar||Five illegally migrated Myanmar nationals have been detained by Assam police at Lailapur inter-state border on Friday evening. According to the police, they were travelling without any valid document. During interrogation, they admitted that they are residents Chin district of Myanmar. They entered India through Mizoram and were attempting to move towards Delhi. The detained have been identified as Thang Khawm Pau (21), Khen Khan Kham (19), Pau Hawmliam Mung (23), Cin Aih Mang (23) and Pau Biak Muang (19). They all are residents of Tiddin village under Sezang police station of Myanmar’s Chin district, informed Superintendent of police of Cachar district Ramandip Kaur. She said, “Based on secret information, our officials searched a few vehicles coming from Mizoram at Lailapur border check-post where they detained these five. A 19-year-old lady named Dimdeihluni who claims to be a resident of Champai district of Mizoram has also been arrested for helping the migrants. Though she said, she is a resident of Mizoram, she couldn’t show any document to prove it. We are interrogating these people and trying to find out the reason for their arrival.”Officials from Cachar police opined that Mizos allow few tribes of Myanmar to enter into Indian territory because of a sense of brotherhood between them. “People residing in Myanmar’s Chin district use a route through Tiau River to enter Mizoram. A large border is left open for the Myanmarese refugees who are troubled by the country’s military. The Mizos consider them Raltlan (brothers) and they say that they belong to the same tribe, so there is free entry to the country. But this is not applicable for Rohingyas residing in Myanmar,” an official said. India’s Ministry of Home Affairs recently asked the Mizoram state to seal the border and prevent any attempt of migration from Myanmar. But few Mizo villages along the international border have refused to obey. They are welcoming refugees migrating from Chin province, a Cachar police official said. After a firing between the police of Assam and Mizoram at Lailapur inter-state border on July 26 this year, where six Assam police officials died, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sharma claimed that thousands of illegally migrated Myanmar nationals entered into Mizoram and are involved in encroaching Assam’s land. He also claimed that these Myanmar nationals are involved in illegal activities and are trained in using guns and other weapons. Mizoram government recently allowed the children of Myanmar refugees to get education in the state-run government schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-illegally-migrated-myanmar-nationals-arrested-in-assam-s-cachar-101634985650119.html

23-10-2021||India||CJI says judicial infrastructure improvement being done in ‘ad-hoc’ manner||Chief Justice of India NV Ramana on Saturday said that judicial infrastructure is important for improving access to justice but noted that it was baffling to see that the efforts to improve it are being carried out in an ad-hoc and unplanned manner in the country, news agency PTI reported.The CJI also said that an effective judiciary can aid in economic growth and courts are essential for any society which is governed by the rule of law. CJI Ramana was addressing the inauguration of two wings of the annexe building at the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court.“We are faced with certain hard facts like several courts do not have proper facilities. Some courts function out of dilapidated buildings. Judicial infrastructure is important for improving access to justice. It is baffling to note that the improvement and maintenance of judicial infrastructure is still being carried out in an ad-hoc and unplanned manner,” CJI Ramana was quoted as saying by the news agency.The CJI said that the building which was being inaugurated was envisioned in 2011 adding that the ‘success of today should not blind us to the issues that exist.’ “That it has taken 10 years for this vision to be implemented is extremely worrisome. This is a deeper problem that has plugged our judicial infrastructure planning in our country since Independence,” the CJI said.NV Ramana also highlighted that he sent a proposal to the Union law minister for establishing the National Judicial Infrastructure Authority. He said that he is hoping for a positive response and also hoped that the issue will be discussed during the upcoming winter session.He said that the prevalent mentality among the masses, which takes pride in saying that they have not visited a courthouse even once in their entire lifetime, needs to change. He said that it is a common notion that only criminals and victims approach the court.“It is high time we take the efforts to remove this taboo for the affirmation of a citizen's rights. The common man deals with multiple legal issues during his lifetime. One must never hesitate to approach the courts. After all, people's faith in the judiciary is one the biggest strength of democracy," the CJI said.CJI Ramana said that courts in India have always stood up whenever an individual or society is at the receiving end of executive excess. "It is an assurance that an individual, however weak, need not worry about the might of a state," he said.Meanwhile, Kiren Rijiju, the Union law minister, said that every effort is being made to ensure that the judiciary is given space to become more robust. “Judiciary isn't only being given full support but also they're being given space to become robust. To make our democracy successful, a robust judiciary is of utmost importance,” Rijiju was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Justice Chandrachud highlights pending casesSupreme Court judge Justice DY Chandrachud, who was also present at the function, said that the judiciary is confronted with the issue of addressing the issue of pending cases in the state and country.He pointed out that there are over 48 lakh cases pending in Maharashtra with around 21,000 cases being more than three decades old. “ These are some of the problems we have to face. This calls for some introspection,” he said.He also spoke about the importance of virtual courts which can help citizens across the nation gain access to court proceedings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cji-says-judicial-infrastructure-improvement-being-done-in-ad-hoc-manner-101634985052574.html
23-10-2021||India||Why Ananya Panday got an earful from NCB's Sameer Wankhede during interrogation||Bollywood actor Ananya Panday reportedly was pulled up bt Narcotics Control Bureau Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede on Friday, the second day of her questioning in connection with the Aryan Khan drugs case. An ANI report said that Wankhede gave the actor an earful for arriving late at the NCB office on both days. "You were asked to come at 11.00 am and you are arriving now. Officers are not sitting here, waiting for just you..... This is not your production house, this is the office of a central agency. Come at the time you are called at," sources quoted Wankhede as saying, the news agency reported. Ananya Panday says she never consumed drugs, chat with Aryan was joke: ReportsThe central agency summoned the actor on October 21 as it raided the actor's house and seized her laptop and mobile. The actor was asked to report at the NCB office at around 2pm. Accompanied by father, actor Chunky Panday, Ananya reached the NCB office at around 4 pm. The interrogation went on for two hours. According to reports, the questioning was not completed as there was a shortage of time and generally the central agency does not question a woman beyond 6pm. Ananya was asked to be present on Friday as well. While the central agency asked her to be present at 11am, the actor managed to reach the NCB office at around 2pm. On the second day, Ananya was questioned for four hours and was asked to be present again on Monday.Reports said Sameer Wankhede who has the reputation of being a taskmaster did not overlook the actor's lack of punctuality and told her off that she kept central government officials waiting for hours. NCB is not a production house, Wankhede reportedly told Ananya. Ananya's name has come up in the case as the NCB claimed that the actor might have arranged drugs for Aryan Khan on three occasions. The agency only has Aryan Khan's WhatsApp chats as evidence and no other proof against Ananya that she actually knows any dealer or consumes drugs. Ananya has reportedly refuted the allegation and told NCB that the chat was meant as a joke. She has never consumed drugs in her life, she reportedly said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-ananya-panday-got-an-earful-from-ncb-s-sameer-wankhede-during-interrogation-101634984539876.html

While US president Joe Biden has openly acknowledged the American commitment to defend Taiwan against China, the new Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida is also considering upgrading the security alliance with Washington.While PM Modi has been holding meetings on COP26 with concerned senior ministry officials, India is expected to push for climate finance, carbon trading mechanisms as well as pitch for compensation for developing nations including India which is also impacted by climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-call-on-pope-francis-at-vatican-before-attending-g-20-summit-101634983689001.html
23-10-2021||India||‘Child must be first priority for maintenance’: High Court||For a person, his own child must be the first priority when it comes to maintenance, said Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court on Wednesday while rejecting the appeal filed by a Nagpur-based school teacher questioning local family court’s order directing him to pay Rs. 5,000 per month to his son towards maintenance. The school teacher moved the high court challenging the family court order of January 9, 2019, directing him to pay ₹5,000 per month to his son, a student of IIT Dhanbad. His son also moved HC for enhancement in the maintenance awarded by the family court, claiming that it was too meagre to meet even his basic requirements. The school teacher challenged the maintenance order primarily contending that the family court did not take the factual aspects into consideration. Maintaining that he was sharing his son’s educational expenses although he was not granted access to him, the father contended that while his son was fully supported by his mother, also a school teacher, his aged mother, divorcee sister and her daughter were completely dependent on him. The HC, however, refused to accept the contention and held that the son must be the first priority for the father when it comes to maintenance. “Even if it is assumed for the sake of argument that there are some other persons dependent on him (father), the petitioner (son) must be the first priority of the respondent in the matter of maintenance,” said the division bench of justice AS Chandurkar and justice GA Sanap. The bench accepted the son’s argument that the amount of ₹5,000 per month was meagre and was required to be enhanced considering the fact that the son was studying in a different city and enhanced the maintenance amount to Rs. 7,500 per month. The court has directed the father to pay the enhanced amount from October 27, 2015 – the day the son filed a plea for the maintenance of ₹15,000 per month before the family court at Nagpur - and clear the arrears in three months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/child-must-be-first-priority-for-maintenance-high-court-101634983250220.html

This time over crop burning||BJP MP Varun Gandhi on Saturday posted a video of an Uttar Pradesh farmer setting his crop on fire after failing to get it sold and wrote the need of the hour is to rethink agriculture policy. "Where has the system brought the farmers!" he said. In the video, a person can be seen setting the crop on fire despite people trying to stop him. Varun Gandhi said the farmer is Samodh Singh who has been going from mandi to mandi for the last 15 days to sell his crop, but he has not been successful.Varun Gandhi has been critical of the BJP government's policies regarding farmers' issues of late and was dropped from the BJP's national executive after he voiced his opinion about the Lakhimpur Kheri violence on social media. उत्तर प्रदेश के किसान श्री समोध सिंह पिछले 15 दिनों से अपनी धान की फसल को बेचने के लिए मंडियों में मारे-मारे फिर रहे थे, जब धान बिका नहीं तो निराश होकर इसमें स्वयं आग लगा दी।इस व्यवस्था ने किसानों को कहाँ लाकर खड़ा कर दिया है? कृषि नीति पर पुनर्चिंतन आज की सबसे बड़ी ज़रूरत है। pic.twitter.com/z3EjYw9rIzAfter the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, the BJP MP warned against the attempts to turn the Lakhimpur Kheri incident into a 'Hindu vs Sikh battle'. "To use the word 'Khalistani' liberally to describe the protesting farmers is not only an insult to the generations of these proud sons of the Tarai who have fought and shed blood on our borders, it is also extremely dangerous for our national unity if this provokes the wrong kind of reaction," he said."An attempt to turn Lakhimpur Kheri into a Hindu vs Sikh battle is being made. Not only is this an immoral & false narrative, it is dangerous to create these fault-lines & reopen wounds that have taken a generation to heal. We must not put petty political gains above national unity," Varun Gandhi tweeted.Varun Gandhi had also shared a video of the Lakhimpur Kheri violence and said, "The video is crystal clear. Protestors cannot be silenced through murder. There has to be accountability for the innocent blood of farmers that has been spilled and justice must be delivered before a message of arrogance and cruelty enters the minds of every farmer."Two days ago, Varun Gandhi shared photos of Terai flood and questioned the meaning of governance if "every response in individual-led".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rethinking-farm-policy-need-of-hour-varun-gandhi-s-comment-on-crop-burning-101634979636689.html
23-10-2021||India||‘Feels like winning war,’ says one of 39 women Army officers who got permanent commission||The apex court on Friday ordered the Central government to ensure 39 out of 71 women Army officers got the permanent commission within seven working days. The 71 officers challenged the central government in the Supreme Court demanding a permanent commission. Though they don’t know the names of the 39 lucky women officers, they are happy to have created history. “It feels like winning a war,” said a woman Army officer. It has been a physically and emotionally exhausting fight for dignity, respect, acceptance and, most importantly, equality for these women officers, who dared take the government and the organisation (Indian Army), which they dreamt of serving as young girls, head-on. “Soldiers don’t quit. This is what we are taught during our training. And I’m happy that we all didn’t quit despite the humiliation, step-motherly treatment and challenges we had to face. This will make the journey easier for younger women officers,” said the officer who has served for over two decades. For many women officers, who have put in over 25 years of service, it is about “graceful exit”. It was in 2009 when a group of five women officers first challenged the service provisions and demanded permanent commission. A second woman officer, requesting anonymity, said that she opted for the Indian Army despite clearing the civil services exam. “It was the love for the uniform and the passion to serve the country just like my father who was also in the Army. I joined the Army against his wishes, he didn’t speak to me during my training period,” she said. But she never thought that she would one day challenge the organisation and the government for her rights. She said, “Some of us have 25 years of service, but there has always been a question mark over our status in the forces as the matter was in the court. It has been a difficult journey. We have lost seniority and have served under officers who were much junior to us. We have never been considered for the board (for rank). Today, as we have very few years of service left, this fight is about a graceful exit.” From Short Service Commission to now winning the battle for permanent commission, women officers say it has been a three-decade-long journey of changing people’s mindset, proving to the world that they are no less than their male counterparts and fighting disparity in service rules. Lt Col Ankita Srivastava (retd), who was among the five women who filed the case in 2009, said, “These women have created history. It will only make it easier for future generations of women officers. Women officers didn’t get their due as policies were not in place. In 2004, I had to pursue seniors to get an extension of four years, which was already given to women officers in the Indian Air Force and Navy. It has taken us three decades to get here (from short service commission to permanent commission.” She said that it was the television serial Udaan which inspired her to join the forces. It was about breaking the stereotype. “That series inspired me a lot. I knew this was my calling, as I wanted to command men as we were brought up in that time thinking that we (as women) have to take care of men in our society. I wanted to make people believe that I was worthy of commanding men and get their salute and salute them back when I’m in the profession,” she said. With this court order, they hope that things will change. “We don’t know who all are there in the list of 39 officers. But I hope that those who get permanent commission are roped in to formulate policies to give women equal opportunities and considered for promotions,” said another officer, who has put in 25 years of service. They say that their families, who too had to suffer a lot, have stood by them and are the reason why they all continue to fight for their rights. Some of them were inspired by their fathers who were in the armed forces.

However, the experts said that the lower number of infections in the country doesn't exactly mean that Covid-19 is reaching the endemic stage.Till now, India has reported 34,159,562 cases, 453,708 deaths and 33,532,126 due to Covid-19. On Saturday, the daily tally saw a marginal increase with 16,326 new cases.

However, the Boris Johnson government has said that it is keeping a close check on the crisis and no restrictions will be imposed as of now.Speaking to PTI, one of India's prominent virologists Shahid Jameel, said that the rate of vaccination has improved but needs to be done.

23-10-2021||India||Kerala newborn kidnapping case: Mother of missing baby goes on fast||Anupama S Chandran (23), former leader of the Students Federation of India (SFI), who accused her parents of kidnapping her newborn three days after delivery, began a fast before the state secretariat on Saturday seeking the return of her baby. “It is a shame on Kerala. I need my baby,” holding a black placard she and her husband began their fast even as the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) tried its best to wean her away promising action. State health minister Veena George made a last-ditch effort after talking to her but Anupama said there is no going back. “I am forced to the street. It is not a struggle against the party or government. It is a fight of a mother to get her baby back. No mother should undergo my plight,” she said just before the fast began. The poignant issue also triggered a division in the party. “No doubt, Anupama faced inhuman treatment. I wish authorities should have taken action by now,” said CPI(M) politburo member Brinda Karat in Delhi. Another member MA Baby also said there will be strict action against those who perpetrated this “inhuman act” and government agencies which supported them. “We agree there are serious lapses. We are with the mother,” said Baby. Later, party acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan also said the party will support her. Though police registered a case on Tuesday under non-bailable provisions, no arrest has been made so far. Anupama lodged a complaint with the police on April 19 and approached the CM and state police chief alleging that her relatives forcibly took away her baby and they feign ignorance now. She said police failed to take any action due to political pressure and she was forced to come out on media after all her attempts failed. She said since she went public, she even feared a threat to the baby’s life. After the issue turned into a raging controversy, her father S Jayachandran, a senior leader of the CPI(M) trade union wing CITU, said since the baby was born out of wedlock they decided to shift to the government-run children’s home in the state capital with the consent of his daughter. He said she signed on stamp paper but Anupama later said she signed under duress. She said her parents opposed her relations with her husband Ajith since he belonged to a Dalit family. What is shocking is that the baby could not be traced and there are reports that it was given for adoption without meeting prescribed rules and regulations for adoption. And the father reiterated that the party was aware of his decision and he consulted district leaders. The opposition Congress and BJP have asked the government to constitute a probe and restore the baby to the mother. “It really shocked the conscience of the state but the party is still clinging on technicalities, dismissing it as a mere family issue,” said opposition leader VD Satheessan. “The party always don the role of a self-styled champion of rights. How can it deny the right of a mother? Left intellectuals who sign joint statements at a drop of a hat are silent now,” said BJP state president K Surendran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-newborn-kidnapping-case-mother-of-missing-baby-goes-on-fast-outside-secretariat-101634969628269.html

Representatives from seven vaccine makers - Serum Institute of India, Bharat Biotech, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, Zydus Cadila, Biological E, Gennova Biopharma and Panacea Biotech - will be participating in the meeting, it further said.The meeting will take place for 4pm today. It comes days after India administered one billion vaccine doses, crossing a major milestone in the fight against Covid-19.Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya and Union minister of state for health Bharati Pravin Pawar are expected to be present in the meeting.The Prime Minister will take stock of their experiences as well as discuss various issues like furthering research with the vaccine makers. He is also expected to emphasise on ways to vaccinate eligible people in India as quickly as possible, PTI reported. In the 1 billion doses, the highest - 75 per cent - have received at least one dose while 31 per cent of the adults have been administered both the doses, according to Union health ministry.PM Modi addressed the nation on Friday, in which he asked those yet to be vaccinated to make it a priority, and those who have been jabbed to inspire the others to follow suit.The Prime Minister also cautioned that people still needed to be careful.“We cannot drop the ball, no matter how modern the shield. Till the war is on, weapons are not laid down. We need to celebrate our festivals with great care and masks have to be on. Just as we wear shoes, we must make wearing a mask a habit,” said the Prime Minister.Hailing the milestone, he said that the given the numbers of those vaccinated, the world will now consider India safe.The billionth shot was administered on Thursday, nine months and five days after the country’s Covid-19 immunisation programme kicked off on January 16. Only China has been able to administer more doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-meet-7-vaccine-manufacturers-after-india-crosses-1-billion-doses-mark-101634968091693.html
23-10-2021||India||‘NCB wants to make this an extraordinary case...’: Top defense lawyer on Aryan Khan case||As actor Shahrukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan heads to the High Court for bail, we spoke to one of India’s best criminal defense lawyers, Rebecca John, about the intricacies of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985. Khan was arrested during the Narcotics bureau’s raid on a cruise ship party on October 3, along with several others. Here are the excerpts from the interview. Q: We’ve seen that Aryan Khan has been in custody for 20 days. Although, he wasn’t really caught in possession of any drugs. Now, is this unusual or under the NDPS Act this is expected? A: Ordinarily, I would say that bail should have been granted at the very first instance because Aryan Khan, as per media reports, was not found in possession of any drugs. At the most, it could be said that one or two persons accompanying him had some small quantity in their possession and that was not a sufficient ground to deny him bail. The NCB wants to make this into an extraordinary case. That is the reason why, despite the fact that this young man had no drugs in his possession, there is no evidence to suggest that he was consuming drugs at the time of his arrest and there doesn’t seem to be any apparent nexus of a larger kind from the facts and circumstances which are available in the public domain, bail should have been granted to him as a matter of right. Its denial, therefore, is a matter of concern because India’s criminal jurisprudence says that “bail is the rule, jail is the exception”. So even within a strict liability law like the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, where there are stringent provisions for bail for certain offences, in small quantity offences, there is never any jail term in the first instance unless, of course, you are convicted. So to that extent, this case has thrown up a lot of legal issues and as practitioners, we are concerned about some of the violations that are taking place. Q: Can you please explain to us in general terms what does the term conscious possession mean?A: Conscious possession has not been defined under the NDPS Act and maybe that is the reason why there is a little difficulty in grappling with what this term means but it has been the subject matter of several decisions of the Supreme Court and several High Courts as well. But it comes into play largely when large commercial quantities are recovered. For example, if you’re travelling in a car and a recovery is made from three of the occupants, which recovery will quantify as a commercial quantity? The driver is well within his rights to say, “look, I was just driving them, I didn’t have any idea that they were carrying drugs or something illegal was happening,” then it is for the court to determine whether the driver knew the facts and circumstances of the case and that the other three occupants of the car had large quantities of drugs on them. This is called conscious possession. On many occasions, courts turn down the plea of the prosecution and say that from the facts and circumstances of the case, we are not able to determine the conscious possession of an individual from whom nothing was recovered. At the same time, there have been cases where the Supreme Court has said that from the facts and circumstances of the case, they can determine that although the driver of the car or whoever else did not have anything on him, there is enough conscious possession, enough to connect him with the term conscious possession. So, this really depends on the individual facts and circumstances of a case, whether there is evidence to suggest that person A knew that person B was carrying drugs, which he should not have carried. And if A knew it and A was party to, and by A I mean the accused, the fact that person B had the drugs in his possession, then the terminology is extended and the offence extends on the basis of conscious possession.Q: There was no medical test done on Aryan Khan. Do you think that’s okay?A: These are protocols that a prosecuting agency must follow. So, I will look at it as a very shoddy prosecution or a prosecution that was aware of the fact that he did not have drugs in his possession or was not consuming drugs.But either way, if the prosecution wants to establish that although we did not find drugs on this person, he had been consuming drugs just before we arrived, then it was for them to collect the evidence. So, the fact that they did not get a medical test done works against the prosecution. Q: Anything else that stands out to you? A: I don’t know whether that’s true or false, some of the persons who acted as a testing witness in this case were really not independent witnesses but stock witnesses of the NCB. They were given powers far in excess of what they should have been given, some of them were seen holding and handling these young men, a power which only the NCB should exercise. It was almost as though they were affecting the arrest, at least that is what the videos suggested, if the NCB has a better explanation for that then I’ll stand corrected. All of this makes it a little suspicious. You see a prosecuting agency - it doesn’t really matter who the actors in this case are, it doesn’t matter who is the accused, it doesn’t matter whether the accused is the son of a famous actor - must conduct itself in a manner which is credible, trustworthy and with the highest degree of Integrity. Of course, an accused person has the right to say that this and that was not done, but a prosecuting agency must follow the law and if they are seen violating the law then I have a problem with it because it is the very bedrock of our criminal jurisprudence. The prosecution must always put forward its case in the most credible, trustworthy manner with legal evidence. So, it doesn’t matter what gossip columns may say about this case, at the end of the day you must have legal evidence to prosecute a person and that is not confined to the NDPS Act, that is applicable to any case or any person, rich or poor, famous or not famous. So, the least expectation that we, as citizens, have from the system is that the prosecuting agency is conducting itself in a manner that is credible and trustworthy. Once that is established, then they have every right to say in court that we will be able to prove the charge against the accused person but once serious doubts have been raised on the credibility of the prosecuting agency and it is for them to respond to these charges, then, of course, it becomes a problem. So, this case stands out largely because something has been made out of a much smaller event. The way I look at it - these people were arrested with no drugs or very small quantities of drugs, which the act does not treat as serious, it is otherwise a very stringent act. It now appears that after effecting the arrest, you are making theories and coming up with largely unsubstantiated allegations. Now, this is a problem I’ve had with the prosecuting agencies of late. You first have a story, immediately affect an arrest, and then go around looking for evidence to match the story that you have in your mind. I’m afraid that’s not how intelligent prosecutors must conduct themselves. You arrest only when there is sufficient material to justify the arrest. You can conduct a fishing and rowing inquiry after the arrest is effective, of saying, “oh we are looking into this we’re looking to that”, that was your job before you affect an arrest. So particularly, since the young man did not have drugs in his possession, since they did not conduct any tests which would suggest that he consumed drugs, it was necessary for the prosecuting agency to wait and not press the button as fast as they did. They should have waited, some of what we are saying may be true. And if indeed there is a larger conspiracy, if indeed there is evidence to show that he was regularly peddling with drugs, then you should have collected verifiable material, placed it before a court and then simultaneously arrested the person. But you haven’t done any of that. You are still saying after 20 days you are investigating the various angles to this case, then what necessitated the arrest? This is what surprises me. I would not for a minute be critical if the reverse had been followed, where you collected the material and then justified your arrest. At the moment, you’re open to the charge that this is a witch hunt, you have no material with you and you’ve arrested the person who you should not have erased. Q: And the fact that various politicians, for instance, the Nationalist Congress Party’s Nawab Malik, have weighed in, do you think that the politics of it all can influence a case? A: I would ideally expect politicians to stay away from cases. I think this is part of the legal system and it’s really entirely between prosecuting agencies, defense counsels and the court and the minute it gets entangled with politics, you begin to see a very muddy picture and it can lead to the travesty of justice, it can lead to a situation where a person escapes the provisions of the law, where an innocent person is implicated. Either way, it is bad for the system. So typically, I would expect this to be free from politics. Unfortunately in India, everything now is connected with politics.

23-10-2021||India||India seeks compensation for climate damages caused by developed nations||India is seeking payment for the losses caused by climate disasters, its environment ministry said while laying out the country’s positions on critical issues that will be negotiated at the United Nations’ COP26 climate summit in the coming weeks.  “Our ask is this: there should be a compensation for expenses incurred, and it should be borne by developed nations,” Rameshwar Prasad Gupta, the ministry’s senior-most civil servant, said on Friday. He added that India stands with other low-income and developing countries on the matter. Leaders and diplomats from across the globe are set to gather in Glasgow, Scotland, for the annual COP summit, which is seen as a make-or-break meeting to stave off the worsening effects of climate change. Compensation for climate disasters is expected to be a major sticking point at the talks, and the subject is something that India has already raised with U.S. climate envoy John Kerry, according to Gupta. Rich countries have added the majority of greenhouse gases causing the planet to warm above pre-industrial levels. The 2015 Paris climate agreement included language to address “loss and damage,” but it left questions about liability and redress unanswered. Discussions began as early as 2013 at a previous summit in Warsaw, but the technical details of how such money transfers occur still hasn’t been thrashed out.The broad idea is that, based on historical contributions to global greenhouse gases, countries will provide compensation for the damages that pollution will one day cause. Countries that suffer climate impacts can then lay claim to money for repairs after a climate-fueled hurricane or flood. But not all disasters are caused by climate change, and scientists have only recently begun the hard work of being able to calculate how much a warmer planet contributed to an extreme weather event.India is the world’s third-largest emitter on an annual basis today and among the top ten historical emitters, which means it too will have to contribute money into the pot. Even if India’s pay-in for damages were roughly 4%, the country would stand to get a larger pay-out for the losses it will incur, Gupta said. “If they want India to be a part, we may be willing,” he added.Net ZeroThe country is the only economy among the world’s 10 largest not to have set a goal to zero out its emissions. Even its neighbor China has one for 2060, slightly later than the 2050 target that the U.S., the U.K. and the EU are aiming for. Earlier this year, India considered setting a net-zero goal, but it has since backed out. Not all nations need to announce a net-zero target before Glasgow, according to environment minister Bhupender Yadav. “Climate finance hasn’t come in,” said Gupta. “For more ambitious climate goals, let there be more finance’’ first. This issue is set to be another talking point at the summit. Developed countries were supposed to provide $100 billion in climate finance to developing countries annually, starting in 2020. The money would be used for projects that reduce emissions and help countries adapt to warming. The latest figure stands at about $90 billion, and the hopes for the full commitment are dimming as the Glasgow conference approaches. As with past COP meetings, India’s delegation also plans to bring up the point of fairness. The country’s annual per capita emissions stand at about two tons of carbon dioxide, compared to more than 16 tons for the U.S. and less than half of the global per capita average. The recent energy crunch — marked by soaring natural gas prices — has also given India ammunition to continue using coal, the only fossil fuel which it has in abundance. That’s going to be a problem for the U.K.,  the host country, with COP26 President Alok Sharma having said that the Glasgow talks could “consign coal to history.”India Prime Minister Narendra Modi has confirmed that he will join the COP26 summit along with 120 other heads of state. The conference runs from Oct. 31-Nov. 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-seeks-compensation-for-climate-damages-caused-by-developed-nations-101634967031349.html

23-10-2021||India||Covid-19: September saw weekly cases go down by 20%, here's the situation in Oct||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) situation in India has significantly improved in the last few months, riding on the back of the increasing vaccination coverage, which has given hope to experts that the third wave won't have the devastating effect like the second one. Still, the government health experts have been cautioning people to not let their guards down ahead of the festival season.From a peak of 4.14 lakh cases in 24 hours on May 7, during the peak of the second wave, the daily caseload has come down to less than 20,000 in India. Barring a few, the situation is largely under control in the majority of states.A comparison of the data from September and October shows the declining trajectory of daily Covid-19 cases. It is based on releases by the central government, as carried by the World Health Organization (WHO).In the first week of September, India was recording 30,000 to 40,000 cases every day, according to the WHO. On September 7, the daily caseload stood at 31,222, it said, citing figures from the Union home ministry. In the following week (September 9-15), the cases went down further; on September 14, the number stood at 25,404. By October 20, this came down to 14,623.In the two weeks - September 1 to 7 and September 9 to 14 - a notable decline of 20 per cent in the total number of cases was reported across India, said the WHO. And that trend has continued till date.Still, the situation in Kerala is particularly worrying, as reflected in the WHO report. The report said that 30% of districts showed an increase in new cases for the week (13-19 October), in comparison to the previous week (6-12 October). Most of these districts are in Kerala. However, the top 10 districts reporting the highest number of cases have shown a decrease during the last week.It also said that Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh are the top five states which are contributing 56 per cent of total cases.In the first week of September (1-7), 14 states recorded an increase in cases when  compared to previous week (August 25-31). In the latest report, the WHO said that in the October 13-19 week, four states recorded an increase in cases while 31 states have shown a decline in cases when compared to data from the previous week (October 6-12).The report further said that Kerala has reported more than four million cases, followed by Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh (more than two million cases each).India crossed a major milestone on October 21, when the country recorded one billion (100 crore) vaccination doses. The nationwide vaccination drive was launched on January 16, and the first 50 crore vaccinations were reported in 202 days. The next 50 crore came in just 76 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-september-saw-weekly-cases-go-down-by-20-here-s-the-situation-in-oct-101634962855633.html

The people have suffered enough over the last 10 years,” Banerjee tweeted.Also Read | Goa CM welcomes potential TMC re-entry into Goa“Together, we will usher a new dawn in Goa by forming a new government that will truly be a government of the people and committed to realising their aspirations!” the West Bengal chief minister added, using the hashtag "GoenchiNaviSakal," which, when translated from the coastal state's Konkani language to English, means “Goa's new dawn.”Together, we will usher in a new dawn for Goa by forming a new govt that will truly be a govt of the people of Goa and committed to realising their aspirations! #GoenchiNaviSakal (2/2)The TMC's foray into the state comes on the back of its victory in the West Bengal assembly elections earlier this year, which saw Banerjee win a third consecutive term. Since then, the party has tried to expand itself nationally, particularly in the neighbouring Tripura, as well as Goa. The two states have a BJP government; the Trinamool and the BJP engaged in a bitter electoral faceoff in Bengal, with the former coming out on top.To consolidate itself in Goa, the Banerjee-headed party, last month, inducted former chief minister and 7-time MLA Luizinho Faleiro from the Congress, the main opposition party in the state. On Friday, it appointed Faleiro as a national vice president.I’m humbled by your faith in me @MamataOfficial & party. All that I had expected was to fight the divisive forces of BJP alongside you.Thank you for giving Goans a voice at the national stage! This appointment has reaffirmed your affection, love & concern for Goa and Goans alike. https://t.co/6QX4rz4GE8Assembly elections in Goa, for all 40 assembly constituencies, are expected to take place early next year.

23-10-2021||India||‘Free speech not at cost of communal harmony’: Imam’s bail plea dismissed||The “fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression cannot be exercised at cost of communal peace and harmony of society,” said a Delhi court on Friday as it denied bail to Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student Sharjeel Imam for allegedly making a seditious speech at Jamia Nagar in 2019 during a protest against the amended citizenship law.Imam on December 13, 2019, allegedly delivered a provocative speech, which, according to the police, resulted in riots two days later when a mob of over 3,000 people attacked police personnel and torched several vehicles in south Delhi’s Jamia Nagar area.The prosecution argued that Imam allegedly delivered provocative speeches on December 13 and 15 in 2019 and January 16, 2020, resulting in riots at several places.The case in which his bail plea was dismissed on Friday pertained to the December 13 speech, which allegedly instigated a religious community against the government by creating unfounded fears in their minds regarding the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).In a 10-page order, additional sessions judge Anuj Aggarwal said a “cursory” and “plain reading” of the speech revealed that it was “clearly” on communal and divisive lines.“In my view, the tone and tenor of the incendiary speech tend to have a debilitating effect upon public tranquility, peace and harmony of the society... considering the contents of the speech dated December 13, 2019 which tend to have a debilitating effect on communal peace and harmony, I am not inclined to grant bail to applicant/accused Sharjeel Imam at this stage. The accused cannot claim any parity with co-accused as his role is entirely different from other co-accused. Accordingly, the instant application moved on behalf of applicant/accused Sharjeel Imam for grant of regular bail stands dismissed,” the judge said in its order.Quoting a line from 17th century British poet John Milton, the court said the fundamental right of ‘freedom of speech and expression’ has been placed on a very high pedestal in the Indian Constitution. It, however, added that the Constitution also places reasonable restrictions upon exercise of the said right inter alia on the grounds of public order and incitement to offence.The court, however, noted that the prosecution has given scanty and sketchy evidence in support of the allegations that the rioters got instigated by Imam’s speech and thereafter indulged in the acts of rioting, mischief, and attacking the police party.The judge said the prosecution did not cite an eyewitness account, nor was there any evidence on record to suggest that the co-accused were “instigated” and rioted after hearing Imam’s speech.The court also said that the investigating agency’s theory leaves “gaping holes”, which presents an incomplete picture, unless the gaps are filled by “resorting to conjecture” or by relying upon the disclosure statements by Imam and the co-accused.While denying Imam bail, the court also quoted Indian spiritual leader Swami Vivekananda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/free-speech-not-at-cost-of-communal-harmony-imam-s-bail-plea-dismissed-101634945393521.html
23-10-2021||India||Odisha school official accused of murder also got govt funds for his institutions||BHUBANESWAR: While the Odisha police continue to interrogate Gobind Sahu, president of a school managing committee for the second day on charges of killing Mamita Meher, a teacher at his school in Kalahandi district, official documents suggest that Sahu was a steady beneficiary of government largesse despite running a private school in the sleepy village of Mahaling.The 52-year-old civil contractor-turned-education entrepreneur was arrested from a sugarcane field in Bolangir district on Tuesday. On Wednesday, police claimed that he confessed to having strangled 26-year-old woman teacher Mamita Meher in his car on October 8 after she allegedly threatened to expose his “extramarital” affairs. Meher worked as the principal in charge of Sunshine English medium school in Mahaling village, one of the three educational institutes started by Sahu in the region.Buried teacher’s remains in school stadium“It was a premeditated murder and Sahu had a pit dug in an under-construction stadium in the school two days before killing Meher. He burnt the body with petrol and wood and then buried it in the pit. Later, he went with Mehr’s family members to lodge a complaint with local police station about the woman going missing,” said deputy inspector general of police Dipak Kumar. Police are yet to find out the teacher’s mobile phone, considered vital evidence in the case.On Thursday, police arrested Sahu’s associate Radhe who allegedly dug the pit before the murder. While the horrific details of the murder are gradually emerging, the Opposition has amped up pressure on the ruling Biju Janata Dal and the state’s minister of state for home Dibya Shankar Mishra over his close links to Govind Sahu who reinvented himself as an educationist in recent years.Government records indicate that Sahu’s institutions were also major beneficiaries of government funds, often in violation of government guidelines.A report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in 2014 said a cement concrete road was built under PMGSY to the science college run by him at Mahaling from the ₹4 lakh sanctioned by Western Odisha Development Council (WODC), the government body started in 2000 for creation of community-based projects in 10 western Odisha districts infamous for starvation, child sale and labour migration. The CAG audit found that in 2012-13, WODC sanctioned another ₹6 lakh cement concrete road under PMGSY to the women’s hostel as well construction of sidewall of the hostel.The CAG report said the two projects were inadmissible as they were executed depriving needy sectors.WODC records show it sanctioned ₹5 lakh in 2015-16 for the construction of a library hall of the science college though it was an unaided college. In 2020-21, WODC sanctioned ₹10 lakh for building a cement concrete road to the college campus while another ₹5 lakh was given for the construction of an additional classroom at the science degree college.Since 2010-11 when Gobind Sahu first set up the higher secondary school in Mahaling with the help of local politicians, he has been getting steady government funds including MPLAD and MLALAD funds.‘He got preferential treatment’“Though the three educational institutes run by Sahu are not eligible for any government grants, he has been getting government help from different sources including WODC due to his proximity with leaders cutting across party lines. Ministers visit the college regularly and the college has no problem in adding more and more seats, while we are running from pillar to post,” said Kishore Satpathy, who runs a higher secondary school and one of Kalahandi district’s 21 unaided colleges.Satpathy said of the 2,320 science seats in higher secondary streams on offer in Kalahandi district, Sahu’s school alone cornered 488 seats, a little more than 20% of the total seats. “In terms of science seats, his college has the second-highest number of seats in the entire KBK region,” he said, alleging that “this would not have been possible without political patronage”.WODC chairman Asit Tripathy and chief executive officer Prem Chandra Chaudhury did not respond to calls to respond to allegations that Sahu’s institutions received preferential treatment.Started as a contractorSahu started out as a civil contractor and ventured into the education sector in 2010 when he set up the Mahalinga Anchalika Mahavidyalaya, a higher secondary school near the Kalahandi-Bolangir border, with help from local politicians. Those who know him said he liked the respectability that came with the enterprise. He couldn’t hold on to it for too long.Role in paper leakIn 2013, he was accused of leaking chemistry question papers in the annual higher secondary examination, has been charge sheeted in the case and faces trial. For Gobind Sahu who was known to have friends in the right places, this was just a temporary setback. In 2016, he started the Sunshine English medium school which was considered among the most sought-after place for students in the area.Flaunted political linksA Kalahandi politician said for someone who could pass his matriculation exam with great efforts, Sahu came to be known as an educationist who was able to access funds from WODC, and funds available with MLAs and MPs due to his links with politicians.In a YouTube video posted by Sahu’s higher secondary school last year, Sahu flaunts his contacts in In this context, he names minister of state for home and energy, DS Mishra, the BJD politician who the opposition is demanding should be sacked.“He (DS Mishra) has been visiting the college regularly after becoming an MLA in 2014 and almost every month after he became a minister in 2018. He treats any problem of the college as his own. He visits our college for cultural functions and encourages the students,” Sahu is seen claiming in the video.Calls and messages to Mishra seeking his reaction about his alleged proximity to Sahu did not get any response.Opposition protestsMeanwhile, in Kalahandi and Bolangir districts, political protests raged on demanding Mishra’s sacking from the Naveen Patnaik government on grounds that the minister provided the political clout to Sahu. On Wednesday, National Commission for Women chairperson Rekha Sharma wrote to Naveen Patnaik demanding that Mishra and law minister Pratap Jena be sacked from the ministry as a proper police probe was not possible if they continued.In Bolangir district, BJP activists enforced a bandh on Thursday a day after they held a similar bandh in Bhawanipatna town. Kalahandi Zilla Parishad chairperson Namita Rani Sahu alleged that Mishra often spent nights in the college run by Sahu instead of his constituents in Junagarh assembly constituency.The deceased woman teacher’s uncle Kaushik Meher alleged that she may have been killed over not just Sahu’s extramarital affairs but a flesh trade racket.“Mamita confronted Gobinda Sahu, who is the president of Sunshine School’s managing committee and one of the founders of Anchalika Mahavidyalaya about the sex racket running in the hostel. She had a heated altercation with Sahu a year ago over the activities in the hostel,” said Kaushik Meher, her uncle.The ruling BJD said the mere association with Sahu did not prove DS Mishra’s complicity in the crime. “Leaders of all political parties attend functions organised by educational and other institutions. But a wrong committed by a person of an institution cannot be linked to a person who attended a function in that institution as a guest,” said Pramila Mallick, BJD leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-school-official-accused-of-murder-also-got-govt-funds-for-his-institutions-101634933623751.html

Top defence lawyer answers||Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan was denied bail for the second time earlier this week, prompting his lawyers to move Bombay high court. The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) had arrested Aryan Khan and several others after raiding a rave party on a cruise ship off Mumbai on October 2. While the agency admitted that Aryan Khan wasn’t found in possession of drugs, it argued against the bail petition saying the ongoing investigation related to the arrest could lead them to an international racket.Top defence lawyer Rebecca John said that bail should have been granted at the very first instance because Aryan Khan was not found in possession of any drugs, but the NCB apparently wants to make it into an extraordinary case. Appearing on the latest episode of On the Record, John told Hindustan Times' Sunetra Choudhury that a person accompanying Aryan Khan on the cruise was found in possession of a small amount of drug, which was not sufficient ground to deny bail to the actor’s son.“And there doesn't seem to be any apparent nexus of a larger kind, from the facts and circumstances which are available in the public domain, bail should have been granted to him as a matter of right,” the lawyer said.“Its denial, therefore, is a matter of concern because India's criminal jurisprudence says that bail is a rule, jail is the exception,” she added.NCB argued in the court that Aryan Khan was in “conscious possession” of illegal drugs as the agency found 6 grams of charas from his friend, Arbaaz Merchant, who allegedly admitted to the investigators that they intended to use it for “consumption and enjoyment.”“Although no possession is found from the accused number 1, 6gm of charas was found from accused number 2 (Merchant) of which Aryan had the knowledge and thus it can be said that it was in conscious possession of both the accused,” the special NDPS court said in the order denying bail to all the accused.Aryan Khan Case: Why is he in jail without drug possession?Rebecca John said the term "conscious possession" has not been defined under the Narcotic Drug and Psychotropic Substances Act, and courts, on many occasions, turn down the prosecution’s plea saying they aren’t able to determine conscious possession from the facts and circumstances.From effecting arrest to making theories to coming up with allegations that are largely unsubstantiated, John also criticised the way the agency has conducted itself so far. She said that the prosecuting agencies, of late, have a story, then immediately effect an arrest and go around looking for evidence to match the story.Pointing to the fact that some of the persons who acted as attesting witnesses were not independent witnesses, she said that “every prosecuting agency must conduct itself in a manner that is credible, which is trustworthy, and with the highest degree of integrity.”“The least expectation we as citizens have from the system is that the prosecuting agency is conducting itself manner which is credible and trustworthy,” John added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drugsoncruise-case-is-aryan-khan-s-bail-plea-dismissal-normal-top-defence-lawyer-answers-101634929203073.html
23-10-2021||India||Woman IPS officer sexual harassment case: HC orders status quo on ICC proceedings||ChennaiThe Madras high court on Friday ordered maintaining status quo vis-a-vis the proceedings initiated against a suspended special DGP in a sexual harassment case before the Internal Complaints Committee set up by the Tamil Nadu government earlier.The state government alleged before the court that the official concerned was adopting tactics to drag the case.Justice C Saravanan granted the temporary relief for four weeks while passing interim orders on a writ petition from the accused challenging the reports of the panel. Also, the judge directed the government to file its reply by then.Following a complaint from a woman IPS officer on February 22 this year, who was allegedly sexually harassed by the suspended special DGP, the ICC was formed to inquire into the allegations. The second accused was D Kannan, then SP of Chengalpattu, who had allegedly prevented the woman officer from going to Chennai to lodge a complaint with the DGP on that day. Kannan was also placed under suspension.In his writ petition, the official alleged that two members of the ICC were biased towards him. It had submitted its report to the government on April 8 without holding enquiry in a proper and unbiased manner.He prayed the court to quash the proceedings that had been conducted so far by the ICC and order a proper inquiry after following due process of law and in accordance with the provisions of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act.He claimed most of the witnesses were subordinates to the complainant and they could not depose freely. Hence, he prayed for the transfer of the complainant to some other place. But, this request was also not considered.Based on the ICC’s report, a charge-memo was issued to him on May 31. But, even a copy of the report was not furnished to him. “As such the entire proceedings are vitiated and liable to be struck down,” he claimed.Advocate-General R Shanmugasundaram submitted that the charge-sheet in the case had already been filed. The Supreme Court had also rejected the accused official’s plea to transfer the case to some other neighbouring State. Following an objection from him, one member of the ICC had been shifted out from the panel, he said, adding that the officer was adopting tactics to drag the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-ips-officer-sexual-harassment-case-hc-orders-status-quo-on-icc-proceedings-101634929362475.html
23-10-2021||India||Kerala high court raises questions over virtual queue system at Sabarimala||Kochi The Kerala high court has questioned the state government and the Kerala police whether they have the power to manage the virtual queue at Sabarimala Temple. The court asked if the government is authorised to set up a virtual queue and what is its role in temple affairs.Hearing a PIL challenging the legality of the ‘Sabarimala Pilgrim Management System’ (SPMS) implemented by the Kerala police, a division bench of Justices Anil K Narendran and PG Ajithkumar asked on Thursday, “What is the power of the government to set up a virtual queue in Sabarimala? What is the role of government in temple affairs?”The PIL alleged that the SPMS is restricting darshan at Sabarimala to only those who have availed the virtual queue services.The bench said, “The regulation is to be exercised by the Travancore Devaswom Board as the temple trustee. The government says the virtual queue is for a smoother darshan in the temple. Can this be decided between the government and the police without obtaining orders from the necessary authority? At any point in time, did you obtain any necessary permission from the Devaswom Board?”The government informed the court that the state implemented the virtual queue system to solve the issue of the crowd and that was implemented after the consultation with the Devaswom Board.The court asked the state that if there were specific orders that permitted it to place such a system and to proceed with it. On this, the state replied, “The virtual queue system was not a new scheme and that it had been implemented since 2011. Over 75 lakh pilgrims have already utilised the facility over the years. Its sole purpose was to facilitate smooth darshan without having to make the devotees wait in queue for long hours. The Kerala Police only handles the matter of virtual queues and that every other activity of the Sabarimala temple is handled by the Board itself.”The court directed the state government to file a reply on November 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-high-court-raises-questions-over-virtual-queue-system-at-sabarimala-101634929183119.html

Being an Indian citizen and native of Tamil Nadu, he claimed he is entitled for the protection provided under Articles 16(1) and 16(2) of the Constitution, which provide equal opportunity in matters of public employment.Advocate-general R Shunmugasundaram informed the court there is a provision in the HR&CE Act stipulating that only Hindus must be appointed in the educational institutions run and funded by the department. Moreover, the appointment process has already begun, he added.Directing the AG to file a detailed counter, the judge posted the matter after two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hindus-alone-entitled-for-recruitment-in-hr-ce-institutions-tamil-nadu-advocate-general-to-high-court-101634929003138.html

23-10-2021||India||Stalin urges Centre for additional stock of fertilisers||ChennaiWith a shortfall in the supply of nutrients, particularly Urea, di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and muriate of potash (MOP) to Tamil Nadu, Chief Minister M K Stalin on Friday urged the Centre to provide additional 25,000 metric tonnes of DAP and 10,000 MT of MOP to the State to save the farm sector from a crisis.He said already the State did not get the entire quantum of fertilisers allocated to it from April to September this year and also for October.“Samba crop cultivation is a very important season in Tamil Nadu. This year, the State government has fixed a target of 125 lakh MT of food grains production including rice and pulses and initiated measures in this direction,” the Chief Minister said in a letter to Union Chemicals and Fertilisers Minister Mansukh Mandaviya.The shortage in the supply of urea and DAP will not only severely affect the food grains production but also corrode the farmers’ revenue, he reasoned.An official release said the Chief Minister pointed out that Tamil Nadu received widespread rains during the current Southwest Monsoon season and the Mettur dam was opened as scheduled on June 12 to facilitate the agriculture activities in the Delta districts.“As a result, the area under paddy cultivation exceeded 4.9 lakh acres. Also, all the major dams in the State were opened after many years to facilitate farming operations, resulting in increasing the prospects of raising the paddy in over 10 lakh acres,” he said.Further, with the Northeast Monsoon expected to commence on October 26, this year’s prospects of raising the Samba crop is very bright. So, the demand for fertilisers has increased this year.Though, the Centre ought to have supplied 4.911 lakh MT urea to meet its demand from April to September 2021, the fertiliser companies have supplied 3.852 lakh MT urea to Tamil Nadu, leading to a shortfall of 1.059 lakh MT. Similarly, of the 1.47 lakh MT DAP to be supplied during this period, only 1.15 lakh MT DAP was supplied, leading to a shortfall of 32,000 MT.During October, as against the requirement of 1,66,700 MT urea, 45,150 MT DAP, 31,750 MT MOP, the firms supplied 1,43,500 MT urea, 4,480 MT DAP and 8,140 MT of MOP. “Hence, appropriate orders should be issued to the officials concerned to disburse the total quantity of urea as planned and an additional 25,000 MT of DAP and 10,000 MT of MOP,” the Chief Minister urged in the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalin-urges-centre-for-additional-stock-of-fertilisers-101634928882384.html

23-10-2021||India||Disproportionate assets case: Vigilance crackdown on AIADMK leader||Chennai: Officials of the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) on Friday conducted searches at 36 locations linked to R Elangovan, the chairman of the Tamil Nadu State Apex Cooperative Bank, and his son.Elangovan is said to be an aide of former chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami as they both hail from Tamil Nadu’s Salem district. They were booked under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and Indian Penal Code. Following search operations, officials seized cash of ₹29.77 lakh, 10 luxury cars including a Cooper and an Audi, two Volvo buses, 21 kgs of gold jewellery and other incriminating documents, said an official. The FIR says that Elangovan acquired assets worth ₹3.78 crore, which is 131% in excess of his known sources of income, by allegedly using his political connections. Simultaneously, the second round of raids against former health minister C Vijayabhaskar was also going on in four places. “A search warrant was obtained from (the) Special Judge, Pudukottai and searches are being conducted in three places in Chennai and one place in Salem,” said a senior DVAC official not wishing to be quoted. On Monday, officials had raided 43 locations linked to Vijayabaskar on charges of disproportionate assets he allegedly amassed during his tenure as minister. The FIR filed against Vijayabhaskar stated that he had created a trust, named ‘Mother Terasa Educational and Charitable Trust’, in his native place Pudukottai and alleged black money channelled through this trust was being probed. Previously, three other powerful former AIADMK ministers -- S P Velumani, M R Vijayabhakasr and K C Veeramani -- were searched on charges of corruption. All of them are known to be close to Palaniswami. The DMK which came to power in May had promised in its election manifesto that they will establish a special court to try AIADMK ministers on charges of graft. The DVAC registered a disproportionate assets case against Elangovan, 57, and his son E Praveen Kumar, 27. The check period for the searches is from April 1, 2014 till March 31, 2020. The FIR stated that the likely savings of Elangovan and his family should have not exceeded ₹1,52,65,540 during the period. However, the family had acquired assets worth ₹3,78,31,755, which is 131% of their total income. Furthermore, the officials suspect that the accused father-son duo have assets in the names of benamis even outside Tamil Nadu. The DVAC began searches in as many as 26 locations including 17 in Salem and in other districts of Namakkal, Karur, Trichy and Chennai. Elangovan was elected as the chairman of the Tamil Nadu State Apex Cooperative Bank and president of Salem District Central Cooperative Bank twice in 2013 and in 2018. Praveen is a vice-chairman of Swamy Ayyappan Educational Trust in Salem district. “During the check period (April 2014 to March 2020) by virtue of his official position and his close association with top politicians, Elangovan enriched himself illicitly and was in a possession of pecuniary resources and assets disproportionate to the known sources of income,” the FIR stated. His Twitter bio says that he is AIADMK’s Salem rural district Amma wing secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disproportionate-assets-case-vigilance-crackdown-on-aiadmk-leader-101634928643345.html

However a few days after his new job, the 17-year-old sold off his wife to a 55-year-old man from Baran district for ₹1.8 lakh,” said Bulu Munda, inspector in charge of Belpada police station in Balangir district.The teenager splurged the money on dining and bought himself a smartphone. He later returned to his village and when his wife’s family asked him about her, he claimed that she deserted him.The woman’s family didn’t buy his story and lodged a police complaint with the police. They checked his call records and spotted gaps in his story.“We interrogated him and found out that he sold his wife. A team from Balangir went to Rajasthan to trace the woman. However, the locals there did not allow our team to take her back insisting that the woman has been bought for ₹1.8 lakh. We could get her back home with great difficulty,” said the police officer.The 17-year-old was produced before a juvenile court on Friday and sent to a correctional home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-teen-sold-wife-to-rajasthan-man-month-after-wedding-bought-a-smartphone-101634928402926.html
23-10-2021||India||Karnataka HC to hear plea against arrests in online gambling ban on October 27||The Karnataka high court on Friday formally observed that the government can accede to requests that no arrests be made under the new law that bans online gambling. However, there was no order to this effect, people aware of the developments said. “There is no order or any direction. The case has been posted for Wednesday (October 27) for considering whether an interim order can be granted,” Prabhuling K Navadgi, the advocate general of Karnataka told Hindustan Times on Friday. The observation came while the court was hearing a case filed by the All India Gaming Federation (AIGF) and Mobile Premiere League (MPL) who challenged the new legislation in Karnataka that bans any sort of online gambling that has raised apprehensions among companies operating in India’s IT capital. AIGF, in its petition, also said that the state government is introducing vagueness and morality to exercise ‘social control’. “It is submitted that acts such as playing of games of skill, which is accepted by the society standards, cannot be forced upon the society as immoral by the respondent state, with its own notion of morality and thereby exercise ‘social control’. In any event, it is submitted that it the intention of the respondent state is irrelevant, and what has to be considered is whether the effect or operation of the law infringes fundamental rights (which is the case in the present instance),” the petition stated. Companies have also asked the court to restrain the state government and the police from directly or indirectly ‘preventing, interfering, disturbing and/or obstructing the members of the petitioner society (as per Annexure D) from carrying on their business’.The developments come even as police in Bengaluru and other parts of Karnataka continue to crack down on gambling activities. The Central Crime Branch (CCB) in Bengaluru on Wednesday said that it has so far registered 20 cases of betting during the recently concluded Indian Premier League (IPL). “In the recently concluded IPL, CCB registered (a) total of 20 cricket betting cases and seized ₹78 lakh and arrested 27 accused,” Sandeep Patil, Joint Commissioner of Police (CCB) had said in a statement on October 20. Patil told Hindustan Times that these cases were registered over the last 2 to 3 weeks or during the IPL season in which the Chennai Super Kings won the tournament. “All this (cases) has happened before the ban,” Patil clarified, stating that gambling in itself is an offence under the Karnataka Police Act. The amendments were tabled and passed in the recently concluded monsoon session of the state legislature which was held between September 13 to 24. The Karnataka Police (Amendment) Bill, 2021 which among other changes, has banned ‘any act or risking money, or otherwise on the unknown result of an event including on a game of skill,’ which has added to apprehensions as it proposes to include skill in what was earlier only on a game of chance. The online gaming industry, which gained significant traction during the Covid-19 pandemic-induced lockdown, is slated to grow from 360 million gamers to 510 million by 2022, according to a 2021 report by All India Gaming Federation (AIGF) and EY. The report adds that 85% of these are mobile gamers. It also estimates that online real money game players are expected to grow from 80 million in 2020 to 150 million by 2023.Estimates indicate that Karnataka, known for its prowess in technology, accounts for around 15% of the country’s market. In its petition, the AIGF said that there were over 400 start-ups in India, valued at $885 million in the online gaming space, and out of this around 71 online gaming start-ups are registered in Bengaluru, which is estimated to create 40,000 new jobs in the sector by 2022. Karnataka has attracted over ₹3,000 crore of investments and employs over 1200 people. The petition added that by virtue of the amending Act, gaming companies will not even be permitted to carry on their operations from Bengaluru to provide a platform for playing of games of skill in other states where the same is permitted under law.To be sure, most online gaming and gambling apps have disabled their services in Karnataka after the notification of the law on October 5. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-hc-to-hear-plea-against-arrests-in-online-gambling-ban-on-october-27-101634928224320.html
23-10-2021||India||Imran Khan in rare face-off with Pakistan army over naming new ISI chief||Pakistan’s political circles were abuzz with speculation on Friday following a further delay in the formal appointment of the next chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency by Prime Minister Imran Khan.Khan has been locked in an unprecedented face-off with the powerful army, which issued a statement to the media on October 6 naming Lt Gen Nadeem Anjum as the next ISI chief, replacing incumbent Lt Gen Faiz Hameed.According to convention, the Pakistan Army forwards the names of three lieutenant generals to the prime minister, who picks one as the ISI director general. Though the formal announcement about the choice is made by the premier, it is widely understood that the army chief conveys which of the three officers should be picked for the post.As part of a reshuffle announced by the army on October 6, Hameed was to be moved out of the ISI to head the Peshawar-based XI Corps. A stint in an operational command is needed to put Hameed in contention for becoming army chief after the current chief, Gen Qamar Bajwa, completes his extended term in November 2022.However, people familiar with the matter said Khan has been dragging his feet on making a formal announcement about the next ISI chief. Various theories have done the round in Pakistan in this connection. Some have said Khan believes Hameed should remain in his current post because of the role he has been playing in shaping developments in Afghanistan. After differences emerged among the Taliban over forming a setup in Kabul, Hameed rushed to the Afghan capital to cobble together a setup that put hardliners and members of the Haqqani Network in the driving seat.Others have contended that Khan’s wife, a pirni or spiritual guide, had suggested that the time was not auspicious to make a change in the ISI. There were even reports that Khan’s camp had made an unprecedented suggestion that Hameed should serve as both ISI chief and XI Corps commander.Khan’s stance has aggravated relations between the civilian government and the army. The people cited above said the army is expected to move forward with a planned reshuffle of top generals by October 25.Adding to the speculation in political circles was the fact that Hameed has accompanied foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on his first visit to Kabul since the Taliban assumed power in mid-August. Hameed has been seen publicly with Qureshi in meetings with the top Taliban leadership.There was an expectation that Khan would issue a notification on Anjum’s appointment on Friday as he met the general this view to sound him about the ISI chief’s post. Bajwa and Khan have also met to resolve the issue.The imbroglio has also led to speculation about the future of Khan’s government, which has depended on the army to prop it up since it came to power in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imran-khan-in-rare-face-off-with-pakistan-army-over-naming-new-isi-chief-101634928112019.html

23-10-2021||India||Top court serves notice to former Twitter India MD on U.P. government’s plea||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to examine the appeal filed by the Uttar Pradesh government against a Karnataka high court order, which had quashed a police notice seeking personal appearance of then Twitter India managing director Manish Maheshwari for a probe into a communally sensitive video uploaded by a user on the micro-blogging website. A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana, issued a notice to Maheshwari, who was moved to the US by Twitter in August as senior director, revenue strategy and operations. “We issue notice. We will hear the matter in detail,” observed the bench, which also comprised justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli. Earlier, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the Uttar Pradesh police, told the bench that he is raising a question of law on the territorial jurisdiction of the Karnataka high court in entertaining a petition against proceedings pending in Uttar Pradesh. Appearing for the Twitter official, senior advocates Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Sidharth Luthra sought time to file a response to the state’s appeal. The court gave them four weeks to do so. The Ghaziabad police had lodged a first information report (FIR) in June over a video purportedly showing an attack on a Muslim man. The Uttar Pradesh police claimed the video was manipulated to present a skewed communal narrative, and it was amplified by its spread on Twitter. Subsequently, Ghaziabad police issued to Bengaluru-based Maheshwari a notice under Section 41A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, demanding his personal presence before them. The Uttar Pradesh police also rejected Maheshwari’s request to let him appear through video-conferencing. Maheshwari then approached the Karnataka high court, which held in July that the petition challenging the notice was maintainable. Justice G Narendar of the high court also noted that Section 41A notice was resorted to as an arm-twisting method after Maheshwari did not respond to the initial notice sent to him. “Provisions of the statute cannot be permitted to become tools of harassment. Respondent (UP Police) has not placed even an iota of material to demonstrate even prima facie involvement of the petitioner (Maheshwari),” the HC order had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-court-serves-notice-to-former-twitter-india-md-on-u-p-government-s-plea-101634927867419.html
23-10-2021||India||Karnataka bypolls: BJP, Congress spar over welfare schemes||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday lashed out at the Congress over its popular ‘Anna Bhagya’ (free rice) scheme launched during Siddaramaiah’s tenure between 2013-18. “He (Siddaramaiah) says it in a way that Anna Bhagya came only after him. Wasn’t rice being distributed in ration shops before that,” chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said in Hanagal constituency. The constituency is part of Bommai’s home district of Haveri and the CM is leaving no stones unturned to secure his first electoral victory since he took over the top chair in July this year. He was joined by his predecessor and mentor, BS Yediyurappa during his campaign trail on Friday. Bommai also alleged that Siddaramaiah had misled people by stating that 1.7 million homes were being built for economically weaker sections (EWS). “Siddaramaiah has given a statement that he gave away 1.7 million houses when he was the chief minister. The fact is that he had only sanctioned 1.5 million houses on paper whereas he should have allocated funds too,” Bommai told reporters in Hanagal. The campaign for the October 30 bypolls has picked up pace with all three.political parties roping in their senior leadership to mobilize support. Hitting back at Bommai and Yediyurappa, Siddaramaiah challenged both the leaders to come for a debate in public on contributions made by their respective governments. Comparing the schemes announced by BJP and Congress governments, the senior Congress leader said, “We were giving 7kg rice to 12 million families. It was going to nearly 40 million people. Yediyurappa said that the Centre is giving this rice. If this is the case why is it not being given in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and other places.” He said that he had met Yediyurappa during the peak of the Covid- 19 pandemic and urged him to distribute 10kgs of rice and give ₹10,000 per person to alleviate the suffering of the people but to no avail. Leaders of all the three political parties are also rushing to meet influential and prominent seers of various communities in the hope to get some support and increase their chances of winning.The Panchamasali, the biggest sub-sect within the dominant Lingayats, on Wednesday had made a veiled threat to the government to get the report from the backward classes commission over the community’s reservation demands.Mathas (Mutt) or monasteries play a big role in elections with seers often appearing apolitical but are believed to use support as a bargaining chip.Janata Dal (Secular) leader and former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy also challenged Siddaramaiah on the latters contribution to the constituency.Though the Congress has tried to paint the JD(S) as the “B-team” of the BJP, the former prime minister HD Deve Gowda-led regional outfit are trying to shrug this reputation by attacking both national parties in its bypoll campaign.“How many years will you peddle the same lies? For the last 20 years, the people of Sindgi constituency have supported our (JD(S)) party. What is their contribution? What is our contribution? Let Siddaramaiah come for an open discussion,” Kumaraswamy said in Sindgi, the other constituency headed to the bypolls.Kumaraswamy will take part in a campaign activities in Hanagal constituency on Saturday.The JD(S) has fielded Muslim candidates in both constituencies which the Congress has alleged is to split the minority vote and indirectly help the BJP--an allegation vehemently denied by the regional outfit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-bypolls-bjp-congress-spar-over-welfare-schemes-101634927683837.html
23-10-2021||India||Siddaramaiah slams BJP for celebrating billion doses||Senior Congress leader Siddaramaiah on Friday lashed out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for celebrating the administration of 1 billion vaccine doses but failing to notice that only 290 million Indians have received both doses.“’1 billion doses’ sounds fancy number but the devil is in the details. Only 290 million people out of 1.39 billion are fully vaccinated, which means only about 21% are fully vaccinated. What are @BJP4India leaders celebrating for? For vaccinating just 21% of the population?” Siddaramaiah said in a post on Twitter.The post comes a day after the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led BJP government celebrated the achievement calling it a “historic” and “world record” feat.“In US, 56% population are fully vaccinated, in China it is 70%, in Canada it is 71%. But India’s fully vaccinated coverage is just 21%. Mr. @narendramodi, let us raise the bar before celebrating!!” Siddaramaiah added.Since breaching the 1 billion mark, BJP ministers and those inclined to support the party have stirred a storm on social media, hailing Modi for his leadership in helping achieving this feat while pulling up critics and the Opposition for doubting the former’s abilities.“There may be a need for booster dose too & with even 1st doses & 2nd doses pending for large population, can we even think of booster dose? Mr PM @narendramodi, Let us put a hold to the celebrations & concentrate on vaccinating everyone,” Siddaramaiah said.Several other leaders, academics and experts have questioned the celebrations even as hundreds and thousands continue to lose their life due to the virus.Karnataka accounts for around 6% of the country’s vaccination coverage, data shows.“We have given 1 billion (doses) and will those people who got it stand up and show. The Centre knew that they would ask. So one has to first register then it has to be linked with Aadhar. After all this is done scientifically, only then vaccinations are done,” Basavaraj Bommai, Karnataka’s chief minister said on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/siddaramaiah-slams-bjp-for-celebrating-billion-doses-101634927443053.html

He was standing in a queue for the past two days,” Superintendent of Police Nikhil Pathak was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Kripal said his father had slept outside Rajput Khaad Bhandar in Jugpura area on Thursday night. “Today, he was waiting for his turn in the queue but fell unconscious and was taken to a hospital, where he was declared brought dead,” he said. The deceased farmer was waiting to get fertiliser for their two-acre land.Soon after the incident, Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav sought compensation for the farmer’s family and attacked the Uttar Pradesh government in a tweet, saying never in the “history of independent India has the farmer been so harassed and humiliated”.Later in the day, district magistrate A Dinesh Kumar met the deceased farmer’s family and assured a compensation of ₹5 lakh from the chief minister relief fund. “We have written to the government for the release of compensation money,” he said.Meanwhile, Bharatiya Kisan Union president Lakhan Pal demanded a compensation of ₹50 lakh for the family. The Congress threatened to protest in case higher compensation was not paid to the deceased farmer’s family.Lalitpur has been witnessing a massive surge in the demand for fertiliser over the last one week. The DM said the seasonal rain that lashed the district has increased the demand manifold. The sowing, which was supposed to be done in 30-40 days, will now have to be completed within 10 days. “As a result, the farmers are turning up at the fertiliser shops in large number,” the DM added.Earlier, farmers struggling to get fertilisers had blocked the traffic on Lalitpur-Madavara and Galla Mandi roads on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmer-dies-waiting-in-queue-for-fertiliser-in-uttar-pradesh-101634926842908.html

23-10-2021||India||Kerala customs department submits charge sheet in gold smuggling case||The Kerala customs department on Friday filed a charge sheet in the gold smuggling case, stating that 169 kg of precious metal was smuggled into the country on multiple occasions with the connivance of some officials of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate in the state capital, a senior customs official familiar with the developments said on condition of anonymity.The official said the customs department has named 29 people in the charge sheet, including the former principal secretary of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, M Sivasankaran, who is named as the 29th accused in the case. According to the charge sheet, Sivasankaran was aware of the smuggling activities of other accused and failed to report them.The 3,000-page charge sheet — submitted before the special court dealing with economic offences in Ernakulam —stated that most of the smuggled gold was converted into ornaments and it was difficult to trace them. It also named former employee of the UAE consulate, PS Sarith, as the first accused and accused KT Rameez as the mastermind of the smuggling racket, the official said.The customs official cited above said on condition of anonymity that the accused would regularly smuggle yellow metal by misusing the diplomatic immunity of the consulate and diverted it to the gold market. They would share the proceeds and smuggled gold would then be dispatched to jewellers in Hyderabad, Mumbai and Kozhikode, the official added.The sensational gold smuggling case came to light in July 2020 after the seizure of 30 kg gold hidden in bathroom fittings in one of the consignments camouflaged as diplomatic baggage of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate in state capital. The case was later handed over to the National Investigation Agency and it arrested Swapna Suresh and her accomplice Sandeep Nair from their hideout in Bengaluru.Now a multi-agency team headed by NIA is probing the case and 34 people have been arrested so far. One of the alleged key funders of the smuggling racket, Rabins Hameed, was extradited from the UAE and another key suspect Faizal Fareed is still at large.The customs department, however, did not mention terror angle in its charge sheet.The case invited enough embarrassment to the Left front government after the CM’s principal secretary M Sivasankar, a senior IAS officer, was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate. Later he was suspended and he secured bail from the High Court later.Though four central agencies (NIA, ED, DRI and Income Tax) are probing the case, other than initial arrests, investigation failed to make much headway, officials of the central agencies admit. Main beneficiaries and dispatchers are still at large and some politicians whose names cropped up in the course of investigation also remain untouched.The Union and state governments locked horns several times over the case and the latter even constituted a judicial commission against the Enforcement Directorate (ED), a first of its sort, alleging bid to implicate many senior leaders including CM Pinarayi Vijayan in the case. But later the HC had squashed the judicial commission.During investigation, former minister KT Jaleel’s phone number figured prominently in the call list of accused Swapna Suresh. Subsequently, the minister admitted that he had called Suresh as a consular employee in connection with Ramzan kits offered by the UAE consulate in 2020. But the minister’s clarification landed him in trouble as he was not supposed to accept any funds or freebies without the consent of the MEA. The customs department also found that a big consignment, weighing over 4,000 kg in 31 bags, landed in the state on March 4, 2020 and were taken to Malappuram. Jaleel said he took those packets, carrying religious books, to his constituency. He was questioned by the customs department and ED. Though customs officers said the minister violated the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA), the department is yet to book him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-customs-department-submits-charge-sheet-in-gold-smuggling-case-101634926543893.html
23-10-2021||India||Ananya Panday quizzed by NCB for four hours in drugs case||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Friday questioned actor Ananya Panday for nearly four hours in connection with purported WhatsApp chats between her and Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan, who is among 20 people arrested after a cruise ship drug raid earlier this month. Panday has been summoned again to the NCB’s South Mumbai office on October 25.An official speaking on condition of anonymity said Ananya maintained that she has never used any narcotics and the chats with Aryan were in a light vein.This was the second day in a row that Ananya was summoned to the NCB’s South Mumbai office. On Thursday morning, a five-member NCB team searched her Bandra home and seized her phone and laptop. Later in the evening, Ananya visited the NCB office in Ballard Estate where she recorded her statement.Ananya reached the NCB office at 2.30pm on Friday accompanied by her actor father Chunky Panday, and left at 6.30pm.NCB’s zonal director Sameer Wankhede said the seized handset and laptop would be sent for forensic examination.NCB officials on Thursday evening conducted searches at five more places, including one in south Mumbai, and three in other western suburbs, and apprehended a drug peddler for questioning. Nothing has been found in searches till now, Wankhede said.Aryan was arrested following a raid on a cruise ship anchored at the International Cruise Terminal in Mumbai on October 2. The cruise was set to go to Goa when NCB searched the guests and arrested Aryan along with his friend Arbaaz Merchant. The agency claimed that 6 grams of charas in a plastic pouch concealed in Merchant’s shoe was seized and the contraband material was purportedly meant for consumption by both of them.Earlier, on Wednesday, Aryan moved the Bombay high court after a special Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act court denied him bail, saying there was prima facie evidence that the 23-year-old was indulging in “illicit drug activities” on a regular basis. The court also rejected the bail pleas of Merchant, 26, and model Munmum Dhamecha, 28, who were arrested along with Aryan on October 3. His bail plea hearing is scheduled for October 26.Aryan and Merchant are lodged in Mumbai’s Arthur Road central prison. On Thursday, Shah Rukh Khan met Aryan at the prison during the family meeting hour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ananya-panday-quizzed-by-ncb-for-four-hours-in-drugs-case-101634926424040.html
23-10-2021||India||SC paves way for 39 women officers to get permanent commission by Nov 1||The Supreme Court told the Centre on Friday to grant permanent commission to 39 of 72 women officers before November 1 after a nudge by the court on October 1 led the Army to reconsider its earlier decision.The court also directed the Army to file an affidavit giving reasons weighed by the Army and the Centre to examine the cases of 72 officers while making it clear that rejections will be reviewed in the light of a March 25 judgment where the top court held that PC (permanent commission) will be granted to all women officers who cleared the 60% benchmark based on their track record decided by a selection board, medical fitness, disciplinary and vigilance clearance.The court was dealing with a bunch of contempt petitions filed by women short service commission officers (WSSCOs) denied PC following the March 25 judgment. In all, 514 WSSCOs fulfilled the 60% benchmark. Of those, 72 officers were denied PC citing serous disciplinary and vigilance grounds.A note was presented to the court on Friday by additional solicitor general (ASG) Sanjay Jain and senior advocate R Balasubramanian appearing for the Centre and the Army to show that a comprehensive review of the 72 names found 39 to be eligible. Of the remaining, 25 were declared ineligible as the charges against them were serious, seven were found medically unfit, while one applied for release.The bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna appreciated the Army for being fair and proceeded to direct the Centre to issue necessary PC orders to the 39 officers by November 1. The court was conscious that 36 officers were before the court in contempt petitions and it could not be known how many among them were part of the list of 39.The court said, “If any of the officers forming part of the group of thirty six WSSCOs in the present batch of contempt petitions are not found eligible for the grant of PC, a statement shall be tendered before this court in a tabulated form indicating the reasons why each of the officers who are not found eligible are being denied PC.”In addition, the court wished to examine the criteria adopted during the comprehensive review undertaken by the Army to select or reject the 72 officers. Posting the contempt petitions for hearing on November 12, the bench held, “An affidavit shall be filed on behalf of the respondents expressly stating that no reasons independent of the directions which have been issued by this court (on March 25) have weighed in the grant or, as the case may be, refusal of PC to the 72 officers concerned.”The court made it clear no ground of rejection independent of those laid down in its judgment will be accepted. If the rejection was within the parameters fixed by the court, the bench said that the contempt petitioners could be asked to pursue their case before the Armed Forces Tribunal.ASG Jain told the court that the officers who were rejected during the review exercise had disciplinary issues and, in certain cases, had other grounds of integrity or disobedience of lawful orders and “operational weak reports” against them. He denied any discrimination as the male SSCO officers in the Army have been denied PC on similar grounds.The bench said, “It would be necessary to apprise the court of the grounds which have resulted in the denial of PC to the remaining officers in the contempt proceedings.” Jain said he was willing to share a tabulated chart indicating the position with regard to each officer initially with the court. Thereafter, he added, if the court so considers it appropriate, the chart may be shared with the lawyers appearing for the contempt petitioners.In its March 25 judgment, the court criticised the Army for its “systemic discrimination” against WSSCOs and set the benchmark on merit and medical fitness to be considered for all WSSCOs who obtained 60% marks in assessment by the Special 5 Selection Board (SB-5), subject to receiving disciplinary and vigilance clearance.In June, the Centre filed an application seeking clarification on whether the 72 officers who qualified on merit (60% benchmark) could be rejected on other grounds and listed out a list of deficiencies such as discipline, disobedience of orders, lapses in government procurement, forging medical documents, poor work ethics, lack of professionalism, un-officer like conduct, poor performance in courses, among others.This application was heard by the court in August when it refused to be again drawn into reviewing its judgment and said that any clarification could be addressed to the Armed Forces Tribunal. The court observed, “The Centre must implement the judgment as it stands. There is an attempt on your part to go around our judgment.”The WSSCOs have been waging a legal battle since 2003 to get PC. They had first approached the Delhi high court to seek equality with male officers to get permanent commission. The high court on March 12, 2010 held the WSSCOs to be eligible for PC on a par with men in the Army’s non-combat streams. This judgment was confirmed by the top court on February 17, 2020.The women officers were back in court to complain against the criteria followed by the selection board to deny them PC. Of 615 WSSCOs who applied for PC, 422 were selected, of which 277 cleared the medical fitness eligibility. It was on this set of petitions that the court delivered its March 25 judgment.Soon after the court order, a woman officer said, “It feels like winning a war.”“Soldiers don’t quit. This is what we are taught during our training. I’m happy that we all didn’t quit despite the humiliation and challenges we faced. This will make the journey easier for younger women officers,” said the officer, who has served for over two decades.A second woman officer, requesting anonymity, said that she opted for the Indian Army despite clearing the civil services exam. “It was the love for the uniform and the passion to serve the country just like my father, who was in the Army. I joined the Army against his wishes; he didn’t speak to me during my training period,” she said.But she never thought that she would one day challenge the organisation and the government for her rights.She said, “Some of us have 25 years of service, but there has always been a question mark over our status in the forces as the matter was in the court. It has been a difficult journey. We have lost seniority and have served under officers who were much junior to us. We have never been considered to board (for rank). Today, as we have very few years of service left, this fight is about graceful exit.”(Inputs from Risha Chitlangia)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-paves-way-for-39-women-army-officers-to-get-permanent-commission-by-november-1-101634926422795.html
23-10-2021||India||Provide vaccination status of students, staff, central universities told||On the day India achieved its landmark 1 billion vaccine doses, the union ministry of education sought a tentative timeline from central universities on achieving 100% vaccination coverage of their students and staff. This is the first time that the union government has sought details on the proportion of students vaccinated from its 43 central universities. In July, the universities were asked to submit details of the vaccination status of their teaching and non-teaching staff. The communication has significant public health implications as several universities, including Delhi University (DU), Banaras Hindu University (BHU) and Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), have started reopening campuses in a phased manner. In a communication sent to all central universities on Thursday, October 21, the department of higher education of the ministry asked them to provide the status of vaccination among students, and teaching and non-teaching staff. It also asked for a date “by when the 100% vaccination is expected to be done” in the case of students and staff members. Central Universities have also been asked whether they have resumed offline classes. “If still online, (provide) date by when the central university proposes to start physically,” the communication added. According to data from the health ministry, in the 18-44 years age group, 402.2 million people have received at least one dose of the vaccine and 119.9 million of this number are fully vaccinated. Once the universities respond to Thursday’s message from the ministry, the latter will have the exact number of (central) university students who have been vaccinated. Fully vaccinated people have significant protection against severe infection and hospitalisation. Vaccinating all students is an important step in universities returning to normalcy.It wasn’t immediately clear whether the ministry will make vaccines mandatory for students who are eligible for them (some freshmen and women are still 17 when they enter college, and India is yet to open up the vaccine drive for them, although this is expected to happen shortly, maybe within weeks).  “At a time when the government of India is making all possible efforts to achieve 100% vaccination coverage of the eligible population; it is crucial to compile a database of teachers and students vaccination coverage from the central universities. It will help universities in the strategic reopening of their campuses,” said an education ministry official who asked not to be named. Officials at several central universities said while they already have some vaccination data of the staff, but not of students . “We could not compile any such data as of now since the university campus and college is still closed for students. We will now figure out how to compile data virtually; 98% of our staff members are already vaccinated,” said Nazim Hussain Jafri, Registrar, Jamia Millia Islamia. The university will reopen for final year students in November. DU’s Dean of Colleges Balaram Pani said that the university will now ask all its colleges to collect data from students using Google forms. “The university is currently allowing only vaccinated final year students to attend labs and practical classes physically. We can only ensure 100% vaccination among eligible students once the university re-opens completely. Meanwhile, more than 95% of our staff members are fully vaccinated.”Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, an epidemiologist and renowned public health expert, said that collecting data on the vaccination of college students aged is a welcoming step. “It is desirable that every eligible person is fully vaccinated against Covid-19 to stop the transmission. Specifically in university campuses and schools, the students are not only limited to the classrooms. They meet, engage and interact and therefore, the risk of transmission is there. However, one should not be deprived of their right to education due to the same,” he said.Lahariya said that the data will also help the government to further strategise the reopening of education institutions. “It will help them make a differential strategy. For example, in case it’s found that in some university, there is lower coverage of vaccination then the government can help them strategise how to improve it,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/provide-vaccination-status-of-students-staff-central-universities-told-101634926242927.html
23-10-2021||India||Twitter says its algorithm amplifies right wing political content||Twitter’s algorithm disproportionately amplifies right wing political content and news sources, the company has found in an analysis involving millions of its users across seven countries, and its researchers are unsure why that is happening. India was not among the seven countries studied.The analysis, carried out between April 1 and August 15, 2020 covered 5% of the company’s active users and could be one of the largest such studies by any of the major social media companies on how their products influence what people read and interact with online, and thus its societal impact.It comes a week after a whistle-blower singled out Facebook’s engagement-based algorithm as a crucial source of hate speech and fake news.Twitter’s new study, released by the company on Thursday, found that its algorithm amplifies right wing political narratives.“Our results reveal a remarkably consistent trend: In 6 out of 7 countries studied, the mainstream political right enjoys higher algorithmic amplification than the mainstream political left. Consistent with this overall trend, our second set of findings studying the US media landscape revealed that algorithmic amplification favours right-leaning news sources,” said the study, involving academics from University of Cambridge, UC Berkley and University College London.In a series of tweets detailing the findings, Rumman Chowdhury, Twitter’s director of software engineering, added that “...establishing *why* these observed patterns occur is a significantly more difficult question”.“Twitter is a sociotechnical system -- our algos are responsive to what’s happening. What’s next is a root cause analysis — is this unintended model bias? Or is this a function of what & how people tweet, and things that are happening in the world? Or both?” the Twitter staffer added in another tweet.Ferenc Huszár, senior lecturer in Machine Learning at the University of Cambridge and one of the authors of the study, said there could be a number of reasons. “The patterns we observe can be a result of several contributing factors, and there are probably too many explanations to enumerate,” he said in an email to HT.“Differences may arise, for example, from people with different political interests simply using Twitter differently: some communities might use the retweet, like or reply functions more, or attach a slightly different relevance to each of these actions,” he added.Experts have recently called on companies such as Twitter and Facebook to share access with academic researchers to get to the bottom of harms their technologies may be causing. These concerns have stemmed from a series of controversies that have involved almost all major social media companies – most prominently, Facebook.Huszár identified the potential in this area as one of the most significant takeaways from Twitter’s new study. “Companies such as Twitter can use the same tools they typically use to improve products and drive profits (experimentation and data science) to study the societal impacts their products have. We are only scratching the surface here, I am hoping to see more of this kind of work in the future,” he said.A second researcher agreed. “Academic research needs to engage with the analysis of the ways in which information is aggregated, organised and accessed - Twitter research is a positive and much needed step in that direction. It is commendable that Twitter is investing time and resources in understanding its content feeds and is making data set available for other researchers to verify, which is more than what you can say about other platforms. First step to fixing a problem is admitting you have a problem,” said Jyoti Panday, researcher, Internet Governance Project, Georgia Tech.Panday added it is significant that Twitter appears to admit that it does not understand its algorithms and the “complex communication infrastructure may be beyond the comprehension of the owners of the infrastructure, with the effects of algorithms unclear even to those writing them”.‘TOP TWEETS’ IN FOCUSThe algorithm studied here is the code that determines how people see posts when they view their Twitter feed in the default “top tweets” setting, as opposed to the “latest” mode that orders tweets chronologically. The study picked a control group that was never offered the ‘top tweets’ feature since its roll-out in 2016 and compared what they would have seen with other users who had the feature.To fetch the “top tweets”, the study explains in its appendix, Twitter uses a machine learning (ML) model to predict posts a person is likely to engage with (read, comment on or retweet). These predictions are based on factors such as “inferred topic of the tweet” and past behaviour of a user such as “engagement history between the user and the author of the tweet”.The researchers picked elected officials from seven countries – Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Spain, United States and United Kingdom. Except for in Germany, tweets by political leaders from the right “receive more algorithmic amplification than the political left when studied as a group”, said Chowdhury, and ML researcher Luca Belli in a blog post.The lopsided amplification was strongest in Canada (Liberals 43% vs Conservatives 167%) and the UK (Labour 112% vs Conservatives 176%).A second part of the study, which analysed how posts by US media outlets were amplified, found that right-leaning news outlets, such as New York Post and Brietbart, were more amplified than neutral sources like Reuters and left-leaning news outlets like the LA Times.Twitter’s ML Ethics, Transparency and Accountability (META) team will now carry out a root-cause analysis and determine “what, if any, changes are required to reduce adverse impacts by our Home timeline algorithm,” the two staffers said in the blog post.In the past, a similar analysis of its ML technologies led Twitter to abandon its photo-cropping feature after it found that the algorithm that decided how to crop images to a uniform square “had potential for harm”. This came after a controversy when users discovered the auto-cropping code would focus only on the face of a Caucasian US politician while leaving out that of an African-American.As a result, the company changed its system to allow users to upload photos of any cropping.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-says-its-algorithm-amplifies-right-wing-political-content-101634926182240.html
23-10-2021||India||If left unchecked, crude oil prices will hit global economic recovery: Puri||Crude oil prices, if not maintained at sustainable levels, will severely impact the green shoots of global economic recovery, Union petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Friday.It’s a win-win only if the price matrix takes care of the requirement of consumers and producers, he added.The minister was speaking at the Fifth India Energy Forum by CERAWeek when he made the remark.“Union minister for petroleum and natural gas Hardeep Singh Puri today said that unless the prices of crude oil are maintained at sustainable levels, it will severely impact the green shoots of global economic recovery. In his closing remarks at India Energy Forum by CERAweek, referring to the latest commodity markets outlook by World Bank, the minister said that the cost of energy should not be allowed to outstrip the paying capacity of consuming nations. This imperative needs to be configured by the consuming countries in planning their production profiles for future,” a statement by the ministry said.The minister’s remark came at a time the producers’ cartel – the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (together known as OPEC+) – have been resorting to supply squeeze for keeping oil prices artificially high.International crude prices are at multi-year high as producers have restricted supply even amid an increased demand due to rapid economic recoveries from the Covid-19 pandemic. Other immediate factors include low US inventories and shortage of coal in major economies such as China and India.Benchmark Brent crude, which soared to a three-year high at $86.1 a barrel during the trading session on Thursday, continued to remain firm, hovering above $85 on Friday.India, which imports 85% of crude oil it processes, has been witnessing an unprecedented spike in petrol and diesel rates. Currently, petrol is sold at ₹106.89 and diesel at ₹95.62 in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-left-unchecked-crude-oil-prices-will-hit-global-economic-recovery-hardeep-singh-puri-101634926002797.html

That is what Hindutva is all about, neither left, nor right,” he said.The essence of Hindutva is to take the best from every corner and mould it to suit your needs, surroundings and life, Hosabale added. And there is space for ideas of both sides, the left and the right, since these are “human experience”.He also spoke about colonial remnants that continue to persist despite their irrelevance. To buttress his argument, he quoted the Chief Justice of India’s recent comment about the Indian judicial system not being fit for the country.CJI NV Ramana said last month: “Very often our justice delivery poses multiple barriers for the common people. The working and the style of courts do not sit well with the complexities of India. Our systems practise rules being colonial in origin may not be best suited to the needs of Indian population. The need of the hour is the Indianisation of our legal system.”Hosabale also underlined the importance of cultural cohesion for longevity of nations. He cited the examples of how Germany reunited with the fall of the Berlin Wall and how the USSR disintegrated. “Any forceful division or unification does not sustain, culture is the basis for that,” he said.Speaking on his book, Madhav said it is not anti-West world view, but an Indian one. “A post-Covid world order, based on new principles, is going to take shape in the next decade or so. In this new period of transition, we should we able to transfer our wisdom.”Making a case for being open to new ideas, he added: “We should continue to accept and implement the ideas we got from outside, but there are some ideas that this land can also contribute and we must turn to them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hindutva-is-neither-left-nor-right-rss-general-secretary-hosabale-101634925706163.html
23-10-2021||India||Jharkhand HC pulls up CBI over probe into judge’s death||The Jharkhand high court on Friday reprimanded the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) over its probe into the death of Dhanbad additional district judge Uttam Anand, saying the agency “did not inform the high court before filing the charge sheet despite the bench comprising the chief justice monitoring the process”.Expressing displeasure over the status report and the charge sheet filed on Wednesday, a division bench comprising chief justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and justice Sujeet Narayan Prasad observed that the CBI had failed to produce any evidence to back the murder charge against two persons arrested in the case. “The bench observed that neither the agency took the court into confidence nor did it attach a copy of the charge sheet along with the status report. It said that such a thing was not expected from a professional agency like the CBI,” a lawyer who attended the hearing said on condition of anonymity.“The bench also said that the agency has been filing a stereotyped report every week. The agency has failed to provide any evidence to establish the motive behind the alleged murder. This could ultimately help the two accused,” the lawyer said. Judge Uttam Anand was mowed down by an autorickshaw on July 28, an incident which sparked off security concerns in the entire judiciary. The vehicle, which was stolen from Dhanbad, was recovered from neighbouring Giridih district that night. Two persons — auto driver Lakhan Verma, 22, and his accomplice Rahul Verma, 21 — were arrested two days later. On Wednesday, the central agency filed the chargesheet against the duo under sections 302 (murder), 201 (destruction of evidence) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code.During the hearing on Friday, the CBI said they filed the chargesheet after consultation with officials in the headquarters, and efforts are underway to establish the motive and the conspiracy behind the alleged killing.The probe agency said it would submit a detailed report in this regard during the next hearing on October 29. To this, the bench replied that if the headquarters was consulted, then it is likely that the court will summon the CBI director NAME for clarifications after reviewing the detailed report next week. The Supreme Court and the Jharkhand high court took suo motu cognisance of the hit-and-run incident after CCTV footage showed the three-wheeler swerving on an empty road to knock him down. The CBI took over the probe on July 31 after the top court said the incident had larger ramifications for the independence of the judiciary. The state government had also recommended an investigation by the central agency into the case.In September, the central agency informed the high court that the judge’s death was not an accident and it was investigating all angles to unravel the conspiracy.Several people have been interrogated in the last three months and lie-detector and psychoanalysis tests were also conducted on them, officials said.

23-10-2021||India||Centre writes to states over delay in giving second dose of Covid-19 vaccine||The union health ministry has written to several states that have emerged laggards in administering the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, asking them to address the issue on priority, people familiar with the matter said, adding that around 90 million partially vaccinated people across the country are long-overdue for their second dose.Among the recipients of the letters are Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Rajasthan, and Odisha, which together account for around 27% of the 90 million. HT has seen a copy of some of the letters, written by union health secretary, Rajesh Bhushan. The gap between the first and second dose of the vaccine is 12 weeks in the case of Covishield and four weeks in the case of Covaxin. Almost 90% of doses administered so far in the country are of the first. Two doses of a vaccine are required for adequate protection against severe infection and hospitalisation, especially those caused by mutant strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Uttar Pradesh’s share of the 90 million was 15.6 million. “As per the data available on Co-WIN portal as on 20th October 2021, a total of 1,24, 82, 090 and 31,60, 423 beneficiaries are due for 2nd dose of Covishield and Covaxin respectively in your state. This is a significant number and requires to be addressed on priority basis… as on 20th October, a total of 87,57,640 doses of Covishield and 28,10,780 doses of Covaxin are available with your state…” read Bhushan’s letter to Amit Mohan Prasad, additional chief secretary (heath and family welfare), UP government. In West Bengal, the second shots of around 3 million (30,66,431) people were overdue. “As per the data… a total of 26,46,896 and 6,19,535 beneficiaries are due for 2nd dose of Covishield and Covaxin respectively in your state… as on 20th October, 2021, a total of 33,13,700 doses of Covishield and 6,85,510 doses of Covaxin are available with your state…,” Bhushan wrote to secretary (health and family welfare), Narayan Swaroop Nigam.In Rajasthan too, the number was around 3 million. In a letter to Vaibhav Galriya, secretary (medical, health and family welfare), Rajasthan, Bhushan said,”… a total of 65,68,461 and 15, 70,652 beneficiaries are due for 2nd dose of Covishield and Covaxin respectively in your state… as on 20th October 2021, a total of 38, 57,450 doses of Covishield and 4,44,530 doses of Covaxin are available with your state…” Odisha’s tally is also around 3 million (31,17,720).“As per the data available…a total of 27,21,966 and 3,95,754 beneficiaries are due for 2nd dose of Covishield and Covaxin respectively in your state… as on 20th October, 2021, a total of 21,61,310 doses of Covishield and 2,39, 735 doses of Covaxin are available with your state..,” said Bhushan. Among the other regions to which Bhushan wrote is Delhi, where around 1.6 million people were overdue for their second doses. The health ministry has asked the states to identify those overdue for their shots using the CoWIN database, and initiate the process as soon as possible.“The district wise numbers and names of such due benefiacries for the 2nd dose can be accessed on CoWIN portal, which should be utilized for preparing a district-wise 2nd dose administration plan and executing such plan in a time-bound manner”. The ministry has also assured that availability of vaccine doses is not an issue and the stocks will be replenished as per the state requirement.“…I would like to assure you that availability of vaccine would not be constraint for accelerating the pace of vaccination within the state… kindly direct the concerned officials to initiate the process of planning for timely completion of full vaccination of all adults citizens and implement it at the earliest. I would also expect that the progress of 2nd dose administration is reviewed on a daily basis…,” Bhushan’s letter read. The Union government has decided to focus on those overdue for their second dose in the wake of its billion doses celebration. “It is important to cover those who haven’t received their second vaccine shot even though it being due. For maximum protection, two doses should be taken. It is important to take the vaccine even if you have had the infection,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, department of pulmonology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-writes-to-states-over-delay-in-giving-second-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-101634925644500.html

It was difficult. There were 26 of them — Ainuddin and his parents; his four brothers and two sisters, and their families; the wife of his elder brother, and their three children, aged between 3 and 14. There was one person missing. His elder brother, Moinul Haque. On September 23, Moinul became the face of a controversial eviction drive in Dholpur by the Assam government when a video of him charging a police posse with a stick, falling backwards ostensibly due to a gunshot, and a government photographer repeatedly stomping his prone body went viral. Within hours, Moinul was dead. A month has passed, but Ainuddin says they have received no succour. “We are yet to get any support from the government or district administration.”All 26 of the extended family live in four makeshift structures — constructed of tin sheets, completely open from one side, with bamboo and wood holding the roof up precariously. All the material has come from salvage runs to the wreckage of their once semi-pukka homes. Like the others evicted in Dholpur, Moinul’s family once farmed on seven bighas (roughly 2.3 acres)of land on the Dholpur sandbar. “Now everything is gone. Moinul’s three minor children and our entire family live like this, completely vulnerable to the wind and the rain. We survive on food provided by others,” Ainuddin said.Four weeks ago, less than half a kilometre away, their homes were turned to rubble. Clashes between police personnel involved in the eviction drive, and thousands of residents opposed to the action, led to the deaths of two civilians on September 23, and left nearly 20 others, including 11 policemen, injured. It set off a cycle of allegations and counter allegations, with the Darrang district administration claiming that while the eviction drive started peacefully a day earlier, nearly 20,000 people, “mostly outsiders” gathered at the site and started attacking police personnel with stones and sticks, leading to retaliatory action. Local residents maintain that they were served eviction notices just a day ahead of the drive, and that they agreed to relocate to a new site with their belongings after the administration said it would provide them alternative plots. However, they allege, police started attacking residents without provocation, which led to the deaths and the injuries. Following the eviction, the Darrang Police arrested three people — Sarifuddin, Chand Mahmud, and Asmat Ali Ahmed — for allegedly instigating the violence, booking them under sections of attempt to murder and criminal conspiracy. Sarifuddin is a daily wage labourer who lived in Dholpur 1, and Mahmud and Ahmed are members of local panchayat bodies in Dholpur. Darrang superintendent of police Sushanta Biswa Sarma told HT that the case has been forwarded to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which is probing the incident. Sarma, who was the SP in charge of the eviction drive, is Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma’s brother. Four decades in the makingSpread over 77,420 bighas (25,595 acre), the entire Dholpur area where the eviction drive took place is a giant sandbar with the Brahmaputra on one side and several of its small distributaries crisscrossing the area. It doesn’t have a proper road, and doesn’t get electricity. The residents, around 1,500 families, are engaged in agriculture on the fertile soil, and use motorcycles, horse-drawn carts and bullock carts to move around or ferry produce. They farm seasonal vegetables, pulses and rice, and these are transported to the nearest distributary, and from there on dinghies to the closest markets. With people gradually settling on government land over four decades, there are no clear records on the exact number of residents in Dholpur. In August, around 200 families from Dholpur 3 moved Gauhati high court seeking a stay in the proposed eviction drive. “In response to the petition, the government filed an affidavit stating that the petitioners had settled on government land. But before the petitioners could file a reply, the state government carried out the eviction,” said advocate Santanu Borthakur, who represented the residents. The argument that the residents made in court was not a challenge to the status of the land as government land but that the state revenue board previously agreed on settling these residents somewhere else, and that no eviction should be carried out before that. Two kilometres away from the site of the eviction drive, the family of 12-year-old Shaikh Farid, the second person to die in the clashes, lives in a rare cluster of permanent huts. They have not been served a notice to move so far, but that is no solace. Farid, a Class 7 student, had gone to collect his Aadhaar card from the local post office. He got caught in the violence, and died from a bullet wound from police firing. His new glossy Aadhaar card peeked out from his pocket as he lay prone on the ground.“Not a single person from the local administration has approached us till date. We are yet to get my brother’s death certificate,” said Amir Hussain, Farid’s elder brother. His mother, Gol Banu, lives in a permanent state of shock, even as his father Khalek Ali seems to be coming to terms with his son’s death. “My mother has been unwell since the incident. She can’t even move without support,” Hussain said. The Darrang district administration, however, rejected allegations of lack of support to those evicted in Dholpur and said that medical aid and other basic facilities are being provided. “Those evicted from the government land have been relocated at Dholpur 1 and Dholpur 3 villages which have been earmarked for them. We are also looking at providing plots of land to deserving residents,” said Prabhati Thaosen, deputy commissioner of Darrang. The administration did not give any details of how many would get the rehabilitation package or alternative plots of land. None of them, it turns out, may be “deserving”.“But we need to understand that these people are encroachers and when it comes to rehabilitation, it has to be done under provisions of Assam Land and Revenue Regulation, 1886. And according to it, encroachers are not eligible. On humanitarian grounds, we are providing those evicted with medical and other facilities,” Thaosen added. The administration has set up a health centre for evicted residents, and tube wells in the area.The families of Moinul and Farid are, for now, surviving on the monetary relief provided by some of the state’s opposition parties such as the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) and the Congress. While the AIUDF has given both families ₹2 lakh each, the Congress has given them ₹1 lakh each. In the absence of regular government aid, organisations such as the All Assam Minority Students Union (AAMSU) have stepped in. “The state government has done nothing in the past one month. On the other hand, we have been helping the displaced residents with ration, and have set up tube wells so they can have some water,” said Ainuddin Ahmed, adviser of AAMSU.While some leaders tried to portray those evicted in the drive as illegal migrants with doubtful citizenship, the families of Moinul and Farid said they were Indians, and had government documents to back their claim. “Our family came and settled in Dholpur nearly 45 years ago when our house in Barpeta district was destroyed during floods. Names of all our family members are included in the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and we possess Aadhaar cards,” said Farid’s elder brother Amir Hussain. “Our parents came to Dholpur in the early 1980s from Hajo in Kamrup (Rural) district at a time when the Assam agitation was at its peak. All of our brothers and sisters were born in Dholpur. Except our youngest brothers, all our family members’ names are included in NRC, and have Aadhaar cards,” said Ainuddin.HT could not independently verify this.Garukhuti ProjectMeanwhile, work on the state government’s Garukhuti Project, which aims to remove alleged encroachers from the Dholpur land and start agricultural and other allied activities for indigenous people in the area, is going ahead. In Dholpur, apart from the families living under tin sheets, the expanse is dotted by tractors and other agricultural equipment. The 2021 Assam state budget said that the government plans to “develop this cluster as a beacon of resurgent Assam” and earmarked ₹9.6 crore for the project. “Nearly 500 local youth are currently engaged in tilling around 6,000 bighas of land from which encroachments have been removed. We are planning to cultivate mustard there soon,” said ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Padma Hazarika, who is also chairman of the Garukhuti Project.“Most of the illegal settlers have already been removed from the area. Eviction of the rest will take place after hearing on a petition on the issue in Gauhati high court, which is scheduled for November 3. As for rehabilitation of those evicted, the district administration will look into it,” he added. Following the incident, Congress legislature party leader Debabrata Saikia filed a PIL in the Gauhati high court seeking compensation for those evicted and also an inquiry into the killing of two civilians by the police. The petition alleged that on September 23 there was use of “excessive, illegal and disproportionate force and firearms by police officials, allegedly in response to the protests against the eviction drive”. Advocate general Debajit Saikia responded in court that, on September 23, the plan was to evict 125 families, but nearly 20,000 people including outsiders and those with doubtful credentials gathered at the site and attacked the policemen, which in turn led to retaliatory action. Earlier this month, the high court directed the Assam government to file a detailed affidavit on the clashes during the eviction drive within three weeks. The next date of hearing on the petition is November 3.The Assam government also ordered a judicial inquiry in the aftermath of the incident, and its report is awaited. The state government notification said that the inquiry would be conducted under the chairmanship of a retired judge of the Gauhati high court. Details of who will head the inquiry, and its timeline and mandate, have not been released. “Following the eviction drive, chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that if those evicted were Indian citizens they would be rehabilitated. He even promised them alternative plots within a week. But nothing has happened in the past one month,” said Mohammad Aminul Islam, legislator and organising secretary of AIUDF.“The evicted children are bereft of education, there’s no proper food, health care, shelter, water supply or sanitation facility for those evicted till now. We condemn the government’s attitude towards those displaced,” he added. Despite Sarma’s initial response that the eviction drive will continue even after the September 23 violence, it hasn’t resumed thus far. Officials maintain that more than 90% of the residents earmarked for eviction have already relocated themselves or have been evicted. “With most already removed from the area, we do not expect large scale protests or violence like September 23, when it does resume,” a district official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-eviction-violence-fear-of-unknown-in-assam-town-101634925168624.html

Six of them, all porters, managed to reach the ITBP camp in Chitkul village in Kinnaur and informed them about the incident on October 19.“The bodies of the five deceased were retrieved by the rescue team of SDRF and then airlifted to Harsil in an air force chopper... They were among the seven dead spotted on Thursday. Two of the bodies are yet to retrieved,” Devendra Patwal, district disaster management officer Uttarkashi, said. The bodies have been sent to district hospital for post-mortem examination.“The survivor Mithun Dari, 31, from Kolkata after being airlifted to Harsil, was sent to hospital for treatment. He is in a stable condition,” said Patwal.“The SDRF personnel brought the bodies and the survivor to their camp near Lamkhaga Pass. The survivor was taken care of by rescue workers...,” SDRF media in-charge Lalita Negi said.“The deceased were identified as Anita Rawat, 38, Delhi, Tanmay Tiwari, 30, Saurav Ghosh, 34, Savian Das, 28, Vikas Maikal, 33, all residents of Kolkata,” said Patwal said.Meanwhile, the death toll in various flood-related incidents across the state touched 65 on Friday.According to data shared by the state government, of the total 65 deaths, 35 were reported from Nainital district, one of the worst affected. At least 22 people are still missing in the state.Earlier in the day, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami conducted a ground survey of the affected areas in Chamoli and Pauri Garhwal districts of Garhwal division along with minister for disaster management Dhan Singh Rawat. He also met families of the deceased and missing people and assured “all possible help”.“It is very unfortunate that some people lost their lives in this tragedy. But I want to ensure the affected people that the government is standing with them in this hour of need and will provide them every possible help,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-survivor-rescued-5-bodies-retrieved-in-uttarakhand-101634925167719.html
23-10-2021||India||Rajnath Singh hails 1971 war as a ‘glorious chapter’||Bengaluru Union defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday termed the 1971 war with Pakistan a glorious chapter in India’s military history, asserting that the synergy and cooperation between the tri-services and the government led to its success.“The 1971 war and India’s victory in it are special,....as the main intention behind it was humanity and protection of democracy,” he said after inaugurating the Indian Air Force Conclave at Bengaluru’s Yelahanka Air Force Station, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of India’s victory over Pakistan.“The congruence of our politico-military thought and actions led to the birth of a new nation (Bangladesh) in Asia, ending injustice and atrocities,” he added.The 1971 war recorded the largest surrender of soldiers in the world, after the second world war, with more than 93,000 Pakistani soldiers surrendering before the Indian forces.Singh further highlighted the Centre’s efforts to ensure further integration of India’s armed forces and related establishments at all levels, aimed at readying the country’s military forces for any circumstances in the future.“As you are aware, we are taking the initiatives for further integration of our armed forces and Defence Ministry, towards a logical end. In the days to come, as the follow-up process, the integration will be ensured in the theatre and in all the levels below it,” Singh said. “The government’s intention is to ready our armed forces to any circumstances and is moving in this direction with speed,” he added.Also present at the event, Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Bipin Rawat, raised concerns over a myriad of external security challenges facing India, especially China’s technological advances in the cyber and space domains.“India faces a myriad of external security challenges with deep regional interlinkages, marred by the legacy of unresolved boundary disputes, the culture of competition, and challenge to undermining India’s strategic space,” he said.Talking about bolstering the security forces, Rawat said: “And gradually we’ll look at the future requirements of whether we look at only the military aspect of cyber or for the country as a whole. Because it threatens everybody. If the banking, railway, power grids, any of the systems fail it will affect our warfighting ability,” he said.Mirroring General Rawat’s sentiments, Defence Secretary Ajay Kumar said that India should work towards strengthening its capabilities in the cyber and space domains, but stressed on the “disruptive effect” of artificial intelligence, robotics and information warfare on any country’s existing doctrines and policies.Kumar further pointed to China’s rapidly increasing capabilities in the cyber and space sectors. “In December 2015, China set up the PLA strategic force which has the capabilities to influence electromagnetic spectrum, cyber and space. All this is changing the way war was fought 50 years ago. Today we go non-conventional ways,” he said, adding that China has prioritised intelligence in digitised war.“Dominance in electromagnetic spectrum, cyber, space, autonomy, drones and unmanned aerial vehicles are its priorities. Specifically, on cyber, it already is determining influence on warfare,” he said.Others present at the event including Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) Air Chief Marshal V R Chaudhari and Karnataka Revenue Minister R Ashoka.WIth PTI inputs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-hails-1971-india-pakistan-war-as-a-glorious-chapter-in-india-a-history-101634925167176.html
23-10-2021||India||Shut tribunals if you cannot staff them: SC||The Union government should abolish all tribunals if the judiciary is compelled to make appointments in these bodies to keep them alive, the Supreme Court said on Friday as it reproached the Union government for creating an “imbroglio” over functioning of the tribunals and making “citizens suffer in the bargain”.A bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh called it “very unfortunate” that the Supreme Court is being called on to fill vacancies in tribunals, which is the primary job of the government that has framed legislations and rules for these forums.“The very purpose of setting up these fora is defeated by not having people to man them. Abolish the act if the government doesn’t want them. We are stretching our jurisdiction to ensure they are filled. They are supposed to be filled in routine course but here is a situation where this court has to step in,” the bench told additional solicitor general (ASG) Aman Lekhi.Lekhi was representing the Centre in a suo motu (in its own motion) case registered by the top court on account of “inaction of the government” in appointing members of the consumer courts and providing adequate infrastructure.The bench further remarked: “It is unfortunate that the judiciary has been called upon to do this. When you have the law, forum and rules, they should be naturally filled up. It is not a very happy situation... The very intent of the law is defeated in this process.”During the hearing, senior counsel Gopal Sankaranarayanan, assisting the bench as amicus curiae, further drew the attention of the bench on the government’s enactment of the Tribunal Reforms Act, 2021, in violation of the Supreme Court judgment in the Madras Bar Association case in July.The court took note that the challenge to the 2021 law is pending before a different bench in the top court, but not before expressing its displeasure with regard to how the government brought back the very same provisions for administration of tribunals in the new law that were struck down by the Supreme Court merely a few months ago.“The judiciary says something; you bring back the same rule. The judiciary says it again, but you do the same thing again. You have created an imbroglio. And in the bargain, citizens are suffering. These are fora for remedies for a common man. Take consumer courts for example...the disputes there are not of very high magnitude but you have rendered them remedy-less,” the bench told ASG Lekhi.Lekhi replied that the government, in the consumer court matters, is not looking at taking up cudgels by making it an issue of ego or delay the appointments.But the bench retorted: “We cannot really say...There is a judgement rendered but again the act brings back the same provisions. The net result is that we are not happy with such a situation.”The court also clarified that the process of appointing members in the consumer courts for all other states but Maharashtra will go on in terms of its previous order in August, and will not be impacted by a recent judgment of the Bombay high court. The high court judgment on September 14 struck down certain provisions of the Consumer Protection Rules, 2020 governing appointment of president and members to state and district consumer disputes redressal commissions.The bench added that the Supreme Court’s August order on laying down a timeline of eight weeks for filling up around 800 vacancies in consumer courts across the country shall also be strictly adhered to by the Centre and states.Adjourning the case to November 10 to take stock of the process of appointments and the upgradation of infrastructure of consumer courts, justice Kaul also asked Lekhi to ponder over how far the tribunals have worked, and whether strengthening the judicial system is a better idea than having these bodies with ad hoc appointments.Justice Sundresh, on his part, called for a debate whether a structure such as the judiciary should replace the consumer forums, or appointing young judicial officers to man them to decide the cases given the fact that consumerism as a concept has developed so much.“The system has to be developed in that direction now. Should we go on with this ad hoc arrangement or should we have a permanent set up? We need to think aloud,” said the judge.A tussle has been brewing between the judiciary and the government over the 2021 law on tribunals.In September, a bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana, issued strictures against the Centre for re-enacting the same provisions relating to tenure and some other service conditions that were struck down by the court in July on the ground of tinkering with independence of judiciary and violating basic structure of the Constitution.Examining a clutch of petitions against the validity of the 2021 Act, the bench observed then that it is “very upset” by the government, which, it added, is “bent upon not honouring” the orders of the court and has rather sought to overrule a judgment by enacting a “replica” of the old law.Responding to the criticism, the government said in its affidavit on October 18that any attempt by the Supreme Court to strike down the new law on administration of tribunals will violate the constitutionally mandated separation of powers between different organs of the State.Asserting its authority to enact laws and policies, the Centre also registered its strong objection against invocation of the principles of independence of judiciary by the Supreme Court to annul laws and rules which, it said, are otherwise valid.“The Government of India is distressed by the fact that both laws and statutory rules made by parliament and executive in areas of pure policy are being held to be void by invoking independence of judiciary when such laws and rules do not violate fundamental rights or any provision of the Constitution, and is wholly within competency,” stated the affidavit filed through the department of revenue.A bunch of petitions, filed by the Madras Bar Association, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, and others, have requested the top court to quash the new law, which was passed by both the houses in the monsoon session of parliament. The petitions argue that the Centre has re-enacted the same provisions relating to tenure and some other service conditions that were struck down in July on the ground of tinkering with independence of judiciary and violating the basic structure of the Constitution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shut-tribunals-if-you-cannot-staff-them-sc-101634925162140.html
23-10-2021||India||WhatsApp, FB must abide by law: Centre tells HC in affidavit||The Union government on Friday told the Delhi high court that it is the legal obligation of social media intermediaries Facebook and WhatsApp to evolve a mechanism to identify who first sent a message that may have been forwarded to others, and they could not claim technical difficulties to deny legal compliances. WhatsApp was among the first big companies to challenge Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 saying its section 4(2), which makes it mandatory for companies to trace which user first sent a forwarded message, would amount to a “dangerous invasion of privacy” and defeat a concept known as end-to-end encryption.The government rejected the position. “…it is submitted that the petitioners (Facebook & WhatsApp) being platforms with high technical infrastructure, user base, and revenue base, need to create appropriate mechanism to identify the unlawful information’s origin and the first Indian originator of such information without compromising end-to-end encryption,” it said in an affidavit filed before Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh. “It is submitted that reasons regarding “technical difficulties” cannot be an excuse to refuse compliance to the law of the land,” the government added. The IT Rules have already been stayed by multiple high courts after petitioners challenged other sections, some of which pertain to social media companies and streaming content service providers like Netflix, for executive overreach and other violations of Constitutional provisions. The Centre, reacting to WhatsApp’s position, said that it expects platforms to either prevent online illegal content themselves or assist law enforcement agencies to identify the originator of such unlawful content. “It is submitted that if the intermediary is not able to prevent or detect the criminal activities happening on its platform, then the problem lies in the platform’s architecture and the platform must rectify their architecture and not expect the change of legislation,” it said.The government also appeared to invoke issues unrelated to WhatsApp’s technical design. “It is well clear that WhatsApp collects users’ personal information and shares it with Facebook and third party entities for business/commercial purposes (WhatsApp’s privacy policy of 2016 and its 2021 update). Hence WhatsApp and Facebook which monetizes users’ information for business/commercial purposes are not legally entitled to claim that it protects privacy...” said the document filed by ministry of electronics and information technology. The Centre said this sharing of information is in addition to the fact that under their mandatory privacy policy, personal data of users would be shared with Facebook which can, it said, be used for profiling. The Centre said companies like WhatsApp, which are foreign commercial entities, do not have a place of business in India and are engaged in the business of propagating information created by its platform users. They, the government claimed, cannot challenge the validity of Indian laws. “The instant writ petition challenging the Constitutionality of any Indian law is hence not, maintainable at the instance of a foreign commercial entity,” the Centre said, adding that the rights to challenge are exclusively available to Indian citizens and natural persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whatsapp-fb-must-abide-by-law-centre-tells-hc-in-affidavit-101634924510494.html
23-10-2021||India||Gunfight resumes as Poonch counterterror operation enters Day 12||Heavy firing resumed in Jammu & Kashmir’s Nar Khas forest area of Poonch district on Friday, as security forces intensified the operation to nab terrorists hiding in the dense forest the past 12 days, officials familiar with the matter said. The army also destroyed two IEDs allegedly planted to target soldiers in the nearby Bhata Durian Forest of the district, they added.The encounter, which is one of the longest anti-terrorist operations in recent times, has seen fierce fighting between the security forces and terrorists, who have been intermittently firing and withdrawing back into the densely forested area. Nine soldiers, including two army officers, have died in action since the encounter started nearly two weeks ago.“Counterterror operation is on but there is no further headway,” defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand said.According to army officials, heavy gunfire and loud explosions were heard early on Friday, after a lull of over 36 hours. “On Friday morning, an intense gunfight took place in the jungle. Army’s para commandos are also part of the operation. The army on Friday again used medium calibre weapons. The UBGLs were also used to blow up suspected hideouts of the terrorists,” an official said, requesting anonymity.Forces have also recovered two small boxes in the Bhata Durian Forest, which is nearly 4 kms away from the Nar Khas forest area.“Today (Friday), during the search operation in Bhata Durian forest by Indian Army and police, two small boxes were seen. The boxes were suspected to be the IEDs and therefore they were destroyed safely,” Col Anand said.An official familiar with the matter said that the IEDs were planted by the terrorists to attack security forces.This is the third instance of IEDs being detected by troops in J&K since Thursday.On Thursday, an army patrol detected and defused an IED fitted in the branch of a tree in the forest area of Sawalkot in Ratangir ridge and later defused it. Earlier that day, security forces defused an IED in the Baramulla district of Jammu & Kashmir.In the encounter that began on October 11 in the Poonch sector, the Army has lost nine soldiers, including two Junior Commissioned Officers (JCOs), within four days. Five Army personnel were killed in Chamrer area of Surankote forest on October 11, while four soldiers died in another encounter in the Nar Khas forest in the Mendhar area of Poonch on October 14. Security forces on October 17 detained three people for allegedly providing logistical support to the terrorists.On Tuesday, Army chief General MM Naravane visited Poonch and reviewed the security situation. This was for the first time the army chief visited an encounter site in Jammu & Kashmir.Last week, the Jammu & Kashmir Police said the terrorists were believed to be hiding in the jungles since August this year. A senior police officer said that the terrorists are believed to have sneaked in the Nar Khas forests and Chamrer from Balakot.Meanwhile, local police have issued a travel advisory for the residents and civil services aspirants in the Poonch district.“Aspirants of district Poonch, who have to appear for civil services examination on Sunday to adopt the route DKG or Mendhar as the road between Jaran wali Gali (JWG) to Bhmiber Gali (BG) is closed as of now due to ongoing cordon and search operation (CASO) at Bhata Durian area,” Poonch police posted on its Twitter handle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gunfight-resumes-as-poonch-counterterror-operation-enters-day-12-101634924506748.html
23-10-2021||India||Will probe if Amarinder Singh’s friend has linkswith ISI: Punjab deputy CM||Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Randhawa on Friday said the government will probe whether Aroosa Alam, a defence journalist from Pakistan and former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s companion, has any links with the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI), that country’s spy agency.Randhawa, who also holds charge of home department, announced this on Twitter.“Have given directions to DGP Punjab to probe Aroosa Alam’s alleged links with ISI. Aroosa was given shelter at Chief Minister’s government residence by Captain saab even as he was repeatedly alerted throughout four and half years against it,” said Randhawa in the tweet.Singh hit back immediately, saying Randhawa was now resorting to personal attacks.“You were a minister in my cabinet@Sukhjinder_INC. Never heard you complain about Aroosa Alam. And she’d been coming for 16 years with due GoI clearances. Or are you alleging that both NDA and @INC India led UPA govts in this period connived with Pak ISI?” the former chief minister’s media adviser quoted him as saying on Twitter.The Congress has stepped up its attack on Singh after his announcement that he would leave the party, form a new one, contest the coming state elections, and have an understanding with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Congress first appointed Navjot Singh Sidhu as the president of its Punjab unit against Singh’s wishes, and subsequently forced him to resign as chief minister.Randhawa was not available for comment to clarify his tweet, although he also made a reference to Alam on Thursday in an interaction with the press, and pointedly said Singh has been raising concerns about drones from Pakistan dropping weapons and drugs across the border in Punjab.On Friday, Singh added, “So now you’re resorting to personal attacks @Sukhjinder_INC. One month after taking over this is all you have to show to the people. What happened to your tall promises on Bargari & drugs cases? Punjab is still waiting for your promised action.” He said instead of focussing on maintaining law and order, the deputy chief minister has put the DGP on a “baseless investigation”.Singh has repeatedly raised the security issue and said that Sidhu is a threat to the country’s security because of his close relationship with the ISI and Pakistan.This is not the first time that Alam’s name has been dragged into Punjab politics. In August this year, Sidhu’s then advisor Malvinder Singh Mali , too, did so in a Facebook post.

23-10-2021||India||Cabinet may discuss India’s stance at COP26 next week||The Union Cabinet is likely to discuss India’s position at the Glasgow Climate Change Conference (COP 26) and country’s contribution to climate crisis mitigation next week, a Union environment ministry official said on Friday. The COP 26 climate meet is scheduled to be held from October 31 to November 12 “These decisions (India’s submission and stance at COP 26 ) are taken at the highest level and have to be passed by the Cabinet before they are announced,” the official said at an informal briefing with journalists.A 14 to 15-member delegation including officials from ministries of power, finance, earth sciences, agriculture, new and renewable energy, environment, water will represent India at COP 26. Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav will lead the delegation. India’s lead climate negotiator is joint secretary Richa Sharma.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to be in Glasgow for the first couple of days when he and his British counterpart, Boris Johnson, are expected to make a joint statement on Green Grids Initiative – One Sun One World One Grid (GG-IOSOWOG) at COP 26. GGI-OSOWOG will bring technical, financial, and research cooperation to help facilitate cross-border renewable energy transfer projects according to the International Solar Alliance.Yadav is expected to lead India during the negotiations in the second week of the conference when several issues related to the Paris Rulebook are likely to be debated. The rulebook is a set of guidelines for implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement, the legally binding international treaty on the climate crisis.The official cited above did not comment on whether India will present an updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) ahead of COP 26. “It is not mandatory for India to update its NDC. We can update it during the global stocktake in 2023. Whatever India announces will be on a voluntary basis,” the official said. NDCs are pledges by countries on what action they will take to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).“Developed countries have been pushing India to announce a net-zero emissions target. But for us, our position is clear, action has to be taken based on historical responsibility which means they (developed countries) transition to net-zero emissions first leaving carbon space for us to grow.”India is expected to push for climate justice and equity and contribution based on historical responsibility during negotiations with a similar stand as 24 other like-minded developing countries (LMDCs) including China.The LMDCs issued a statement on October 18 calling a net-zero goal for all countries by mid-century “anti-equity” and against “climate justice.”“Despite their lack of ambition shown in the pre-2020 period, as well as in their Paris Agreement NDCs, major developed countries are now pushing to shift the goalposts of the Paris Agreement from what has already been agreed by calling for all countries to adopt net zero emissions targets by 2050,” the statement said. It added net-zero emissions for all countries by 2050 will exacerbate existing inequities between developed and developing countries.Carbon markets, Loss and Damage, and a transparency mechanism, which will be part of the rulebook, are the major issues likely to be discussed at COP 26. India is expected to push for its carbon credits from the clean development mechanism era pre-2020 to be recognised and allowed to be traded.“There can be multilateral and bilateral trade in carbon credits. We are also saying that whatever the value of each carbon credit in bilateral trading, 2% of that amount should go into the global adaptation fund which can be distributed as climate finance. Most of the money from carbon markets will otherwise be circulating in bilateral trading. The developed countries are not agreeing to this and they are also against trading of CDM era credits. This will have to be resolved,” the official cited above said.India is expected to support the stand of least developed countries and those most vulnerable to climate change impacts on Loss and Damage or a mechanism by which vulnerable nations will be compensated for irreversible impacts of climate crisis such as sea-level rise, biodiversity loss, or extreme weather events. The draft text on the mechanism was weak and could not be finalised during COP 25 in Madrid.“The floods, unseasonal rains, severe cyclones have increased in frequency and severity. There is a 1.2-degree rise in global temperature and we are already seeing this. Island countries and all vulnerable nations need to be compensated for such events. We will support the least developed countries on Loss and Damage because we are also suffering. It needs to be resolved how this money will come through insurance or trust fund, etc,” the official said.India is also willing to contribute to compensation based on its share but also expects to be compensated for the damage. “Our main ask at COP 26 will be climate finance. The developed countries are trying to show somehow that the 100-billion-dollar commitment will be fulfilled. They are also counting commercial investment as climate finance. That is not acceptable,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-likely-to-discuss-india-s-stance-at-cop-26-next-week-101634901702609.html
23-10-2021||India||Amit Shah to review security situation in 3-day J-K visit starting today||Srinagar Union home minister Amit Shah will arrive in Jammu and Kashmir on Saturday, for a three-day visit, to review the security situation amid a wave of targeted terrorist attacks that left 11 civilians dead in the region this month.Besides holding security review meetings, the minister will also address panchayat members and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers, people familiar with the matter said. BJP leader in J&K, Sunil Sharma, said the party has been told that Shah will arrive in Srinagar on Saturday and first travel to Jammu. “He will visit Kashmir before leaving for New Delhi,” he said. The BJP leader added that they have also invited district presidents to one of Shah’s events. “(The) home minister will also attend a rally in Jammu,” he said, after attending a party meeting on Shah’s visit on Thursday.This will be Shah’s first visit to the Union territory ever since the revocation of Article 370, which bestowed special status to the erstwhile state, in August 2019. He had last visited J&K in June 2019 after the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance swept to power at the Centre for a second term. The Union minister, whose visit is part of the Centre’s continuing outreach campaign, is also expected to review the implementation of development schemes in the region. Last month, he held a review meeting on J&K with lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha and senior security officials in the national capital. In view of Shah’s visit, security measures have been tightened across the Valley as forces stepped up checking and frisking activities, especially in Srinagar. J&K Police said 17 terrorists have been “neutralised” in various encounters in the Valley since October 1 amid a spate of attacks on civilians. Five migrant workers were among the 11 civilians killed in the region this month. A soldier was also killed in an anti-insurgency operation in the Valley on Wednesday. The Indian Army has been conducting operations in the dense forests of the Rajouri-Poonch sector for the past 12 days, trying to track down terrorists believed to belong to Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba who have gone to ground in the area.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has arrested 13 terror associates, so far, during raids across the Union territory, in connection with a case to unearth a conspiracy hatched by various terrorist groups to carry out attacks in and outside the Union territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-to-arrive-in-kashmir-for-3-day-visit-on-saturday-amid-spike-in-violence-101634809585773.html

If one were to use Kumarappa’s words, the wounds being inflicted on the Western Ghats today are a display of an economy of violence engaged in resource exhaustion while promoting social disharmony.
