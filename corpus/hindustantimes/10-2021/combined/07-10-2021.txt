A meeting of the ABAP had been convened on Shri Panchayati Akhada Niranjani premises in Daraganj locality by the body’s general secretary Mahant Hari Giri to discuss the issue, informed ABAP office-bearers. Head of the Baghambari Gaddi Math Mahant Narendra Giri, who had been serving on the post since 2014, was found dead in a room of the Math on September 20 following an alleged suicide, leaving the post vacant. The meeting has been convened at a time when the Akhadas are keen to get necessary preparations underway for the Kumbh-2025 to be held in Prayagraj and get set for the important meeting of the body that takes decisions on the mega religious fair three years before its formal starts. Usually this meeting follows a meeting with the state chief minister in which various proposals passed by the ABAP regarding Kumbh are put before him for implementation. “The meeting of the Akhada Parishad has been convened on October 25. The names put forth for appointment as the next president of the Akhada Parishad would be discussed in it. Whoever gets backing of two-third members of the 26-member Parishad would be elected as its new president,” said Mahant Hari Giri, who is also the chief patron of Juna Akhada.. The body has two representatives each from the 13 recognised Akhadas of the country. Senior seers shared that with just over three years remaining for Kumbh-2025, electing a new ABAO president was a top priority for the Akhadas. They shared that as per the traditions followed till now, whichever monastic order’s office -bearer passes away in harness, the name proposed by it is appointed to the post till the end of the five-year tenure. Mahant Narendra Giri of Niranjani Akhada was first elected to the post in 2014 and was then re-elected for another five years at Haridwar in October 2019. This, seers said, could mean that a senior saint of Niranjani Akhada whose name was proposed by the monastic order could be elected to the top post of ABAP till 2025.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/akhada-parishad-meeting-on-oct-25-may-elect-new-president-101633631226624.html

07-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: HC seeks response on plea alleging poor conditions at Lok Nayak Hospital||The Delhi high court on Thursday sought the response of the Delhi government on a plea highlighting the alleged poor conditions in the Lok Nayak Hospital, and said the city dispensation needs to “gear up” to improve the situation at the government-run hospital, which was also the largest facility in the national capital for the treatment of Covid-19.Justice Rekha Palli, while hearing a plea filed by an individual named Ashish Pandey, who was admitted to the hospital recently, asked the city government to “set out steps to improve the working of the hospital”.“We are not out of Covid. Every day, ministers are saying “please take care”. This (LN hospital) is one of your ‘so-called’ prestigious hospitals. I expect the hospital to gear up now,” the judge said.Pandey in his plea claimed that no Covid-19 test was conducted on him at the time of admission on September 27, and there were two-three patients on each bed and three patients were taken to the ultrasound lab at the same time.Pandey also alleged that “dead bodies were lying on the bed for 15-20 hours” while patients lay on the floor.Admonishing the city government, the court said, “Just because you come on media, it doesn’t mean it is working. This is not the first time that we are hearing it,” Palli said.“Some of these (allegations) must be true. I don’t want to doubt him. He is not in the business (of medicine). There is no competition. There are limitations but you need to gear up.. I am not saying you have to become something 100 per cent perfect,” the judge further said.The petition has alleged that “each ward having around 72 beds, had only two second year postgraduate doctors under the supervision of one senior resident, reflecting the shortage of doctors as for more than 250 patients (due to double/ triple occupancy of beds), there were only two postgraduate students and one senior resident doctor”.“None replied to my representation. I am not asking for everything under the sun but there is complete inaction (on part of LN hospital),” Pandey submitted.Delhi government counsel Anuj Aggarwal sought time from the court to file a response to the petition.The petitioner has also prayed for a direction to constitute a high-powered committee to look into issue and monitor the various lapses at LN hospital and take necessary action at the earliest.The plea also alleged that the hospital authorities have a “careless, callous and unbothered attitude” and due to shortage of guards and other auxillary staff, LN hospital authorities wereunable to provide security for wheelchairs and stretchers. The matter would be next heard on December 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-seeks-response-on-plea-alleging-poor-conditions-at-lok-nayak-hospital-101633630684269.html
07-10-2021||Pune||28% schools reopen in Pune district; the least in Maharashtra||PUNE: Pune district has reported the least number of schools reopening so far across Maharashtra, with only 28% schools having reopened in urban areas of the district. The students’ attendance in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has been among the lowest across the state.Medha Sinnarkar, principal of Laxmanrao Apte Prashala, said that her school has reported an at least 60% turnout since it reopened. “However, many parents still fear Covid-19 while sending their wards to school. And many parents who are in their native village have chosen to continue online classes for their children. Students who have a good internet connection and a better environment at home, prefer online education,” Sinnarkar said.“Also, many parents may be thinking about sending their wards to school after the upcoming festivals are over. However, what we have seen in our schools suggests that families with one smartphone at home prefer that their children attend offline classes. The children are also able to respond more effectively with offline classes,” Sinnarkar said.About the least number of schools reopening in Pune, Harishchandra Gaikwad, president of the Pune District Principals’ Association, said that due to recruitment examinations, some schools in the city have delayed reopening.“Moreover, this week also has holidays. Some schools have scheduled their reopening next week. Due to the Navratri festival, Thursday was also a holiday. All these are the reasons for less number of schools reopening. The number is likely to increase in the coming days,” Gaikwad said.He added that rural areas have a larger number of students attending offline classes. “As schools in rural parts were also already functional, Classes 5 to 7 are also seeing a good turnout. Also, students face a variety of issues during online lectures and hence, offline classes have a better turnout in rural parts,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/28-schools-reopen-in-pune-district-the-least-in-maharashtra-101633630624898.html
07-10-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena gives ticket to wife of late MP Mohan Delkar for LS bypoll||Kalaben Delkar, wife of late Dadra and Nagar Haveli Member of Parliament Mohan Delkar, joined the Shiv Sena on Thursday along with her son Abhinav in the presence of party chief and Maharashtra chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray. The party has decided to field the late MP’s wife in the bypoll on the Lok Sabha seat of Dadra and Nagar Haveli on October 30.The by-poll was necessitated after Mohan Delkar died by suicide at a hotel in Marine Drive on February 22. The seven-term MP left behind a 14-page suicide note, accusing government officials and a few private persons of forcing him to take the step. A case was registered against the Union Territory’s administrator Prafull K Patel, who was a junior minister in the Gujarat government under then CM Narendra Modi, and other officials. The Sena had raised the issue of Mohan Delkar’s death in the Lok Sabha and in Maharashtra, demanding action against the officials named in his suicide note.A Shiv Sena functionary said that party’s chief spokesman Sanjay Raut was instrumental in getting Kalaben Delkar, Abhinav and their supporters to the party. Kalaben Delkar is expected to file her nomination on Friday.According to the functionary, the party saw an opportunity to increase its tally in the Lok Sabha, especially on a seat from outside Maharashtra. “Mohan Delkar had a tremendous support in his constituency because of the work that he did over the decades. At the same time, there is an anti-BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) wave there given the circumstances of the MP’s death. We will be able to grow our organisation through the Delkars in the Union Territory,” said the functionary. Currently, Sena has 18 MPs in Lok Sabha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-gives-ticket-to-wife-of-late-mp-mohan-delkar-for-ls-bypoll-101633630324177.html

07-10-2021||Mumbai||Cruise drugs case: Congress demands action against NCB officers for violating norms||The Maharashtra Congress on Thursday demanded action and an internal inquiry against the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) officers involved in the cruise drug party raids for “violation of rules” related to the handling of the accused in the case. The party has also pointed at the discrepancies in the statement by NCB officers in relation to the private persons present during the raids and seizure of drugs from the crime scene.Maharashtra Congress general secretary Sachin Sawant also said NCB officers have been evading questions related to the involvement of private persons in the raid and questioned the connection between NCB and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).State minorities minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Nawab Malik had on Wednesday levelled serious allegations against NCB. He had produced videos and pictures of NCB’s raids on the cruise on Saturday and said that BJP functionary Manish Bhanushali and another private person, KP Gosavi, had illegally been involved in the agency’s action. Malik said the duo was seen taking Shahrukh Khan’s son Aryan and another accused, Arbaaz Merchant, to the custody after their arrest for alleged consumption of drugs. NCB had raided a cruise off the Mumbai shore and arrested Aryan, Arbaaz and others for alleged drug abuse at a rave party on Saturday night.“NCB officers have not been able to explain why the private persons, including an office bearer of BJP, were involved in the raids and why he [BJP worker] was handling the accused. NCB’s handbook states that the officer designated should handle the accused and they have the authority to produce the accused in the court. Without prior written permission, the custody cannot be given to anybody else. Section 59 of the NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act has clearly stated that the officer violating the set rules related to the handling of the accused may attract criminal action and imprisonment of up to 20 years or a fine of ₹ 1 lakh or both. The NCB officers have grossly violated the set rules and an inquiry is needed into it. We demand that the director general of NCB conduct an internal inquiry and take necessary action,” Sawant said.He added that the statements of the NCB officers are contradictory. “NCB officers said he [BJP worker] was an independent witness while, Bhanushali said he was an informer. Similarly, the statement related to the drug seizure from the crime scene had discrepancies. The state government, too, should inquire into the entire episode which appears to be a conspiracy to defame the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and Bollywood,” he said.BJP leaders have said that Malik has been targeting NCB owing to a grudge for action against his son-in-law by the investigating agency. They have also said that leaders from the ruling parties are targeting NCB to hinder the action against drug peddling. “Bhanushali had given a tip-off in the interest of the country by endangering his life. MVA leaders have been targeting him. Malik is the leader of the party which has home portfolio. Why was [BJP leader] Kirit Somaiya stopped from lodging a complaint against corruption by a minister,” questioned BJP leader Ashish Shelar. Leader of opposition and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis said instead of raising questions over the presence of private people, Malik should reply whether the party took place or not and if there were drugs in the party?NCP hit back at BJP and said the latter should reply to the questions raised on the raids instead of making vague and political arguments. They should also clarify in what capacity the BJP office-bearer was involved in the procedure of the raids, said NCP.“Both the BJP and NCB have claimed that the allegations were made because my son-in-law (Sameer Khan) was arrested in January. But the fact is that we have been questioning NCB’s action since last November. NCB officers also said that the allegations were levelled out of prejudice mindset and anybody who has anything to object can approach the court. Are NCB officers speaking the BJP’s language? Isn’t is BJP that always says that people can approach the court instead of replying to questions raised against them,” said Malik.“A BJP office-bearer was seen arresting the accused in videos during the NCB raid. Instead of replying to this, they are making vague arguments,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cruise-drugs-case-congress-demands-action-against-ncb-officers-for-violating-norms-101633629604387.html
07-10-2021||Lucknow||Sidhu, other Punjab Cong leaders, ministers allowed to go to Kheri||Several Punjab Congress leaders, including state ministers and MLAs, were allowed to head towards Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh, hours after they were detained at a police station in Saharanpur on Thursday.Punjab Transport Minister Amarinder Singh Raja Warring said the UP police would escort them to the city where they would meet the families of farmers who were killed in violence that erupted during a protest Sunday. Congress district unit president in Saharanpur Muzaffar Ali Gurjar said 15 to 16 people, including Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, left for Lakhimpur Kheri in four vehicles at around 9 pm. Earlier on Thursday evening, Sidhu, some cabinet ministers and MLAs of Punjab were taken into custody by police on UP-Haryana border in Shahjahanpur when they were going to Lakhimpur Kheri to meet the kin of those killed in Sunday’s (October 3) violence there. Other Congress party members accompanying Sidhu were also taken into custody.They were taken to Sarsawa Air Force station in Saharanpur while hundreds of protestors continued their protest at Shahjahanpur border where the police heavily barricaded the road to prevent their entry to UP.Speaking to media persons before he was taken into custody, Sidhu asked, “Why has the UP government not arrested Union MoS’s son Ashish Mishra who is an accused in the case of mowing down farmers? Is the minister’s son above law?” Demanded his arresting, Sidhu also accused the UP government of not taking action against those who ran over a group of farmers in Kheri.“You are teaching us law. Accused Mishra is roaming scot-free and you are stopping MLAs and MPs (from going to Kheri). We will not tolerate the dictatorship. We are soldiers of Rahul Gandhi,” Sidhu said.Earlier, hundreds of protesters from Punjab led by cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu, some cabinet ministers and MLAs reached the border on Thursday evening.Police had barricaded roads by placing tractor trollies, barricades to prevent them entering UP. The officials said only 5 people could be allowed as Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which prohibits the assembly of more than five people, had been enforced in Lakhimpur Kheri after the October 3 violence.Former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Congress’s Haryana unit chief Kumari Selja also arrived there along with hundreds of their supporters on Thursday afternoon. They wanted to go to Lakhimpur Kheri but police stopped them at the border. Confirming it, Shamli SP Sukirti Madhav said they returned after staying at border for over an hour.

07-10-2021||Lucknow||Jayant accuses BJP of being anti-farmer||Agra: National president of Rashtriya Lok Dal Jayant Chaudhary on Thursday targeted the BJP governments, both at the centre and in the state and blamed them for being anti-farmer. He also blamed union home minister Amit Shah for backing the guilty in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident and urged farmers to unite for the 2022 state assembly election. Jayant Chaudhary was in Khair town of Aligarh on Thursday when the RLD’s ‘Ashirwad Path Yatra’ arrived there. He addressed a public meeting and alleged that farmers in Uttar Pradesh were being attacked, as was evident from the recent incident in Lakhimpur Kheri. “Crime is rising in Uttar Pradesh and in such a scenario farmers need to unite to uproot the present government,” said Jayant. He reminded the farmers of his grandfather late Chaudhary Charan Singh and asked them to unite in his name. Jayant assured Rs. 12,000 to farmers under Chaudhary Charan Singh Krashak Samman Yojna that he proposed. “Ghastly killing of farmers took place in Lakhimpur Kheri and sons of farmers protecting the nation’s borders were termed terrorists. The accused minister was summoned to Delhi but was backed by the union home minister. BJP leaders are unable to understand the pain that a farmer undergoes,” said Jayant. Urging people to be wary of the BJP, Jayant said that the ruling party in the state would play the Ram Temple or Taliban card to secure votes by misleading the voters. “The BJP had assured to double the income of farmers in 2022 but nothing of this sort happened, even though 2022 is approaching. On the one hand, fund was provided to farmers under PM Samman Yojna and on the other, money in multiples was realized from them by enhancing the prices petrol and diesel,” he alleged. Jayant also attacked Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Aditya Nath for welcoming cine actress Kangana Rannaut, who, he said, had termed farmers as ‘terrorists’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/jayant-accuses-bjp-of-being-antifarmer-101633629424351.html
07-10-2021||Mumbai||MVA plans strategic tie-up or seat adjustment for mini Assembly polls||With significant gains in the bypolls to the local body elections in six districts, the three ruling partners in the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition – Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress – are mulling a strategic tie-up or adjustment of seats in next year’s elections to most civic bodies and district councils. The development has come after the ruling parties got a sense from these bypolls that the electorate are not completely against them because of the issues related to reservation, OBCs and Marathas, series of allegations of corruption and lockdown due to Covid. The bypolls held to fill 85 district council (DC) seats and 144 panchayat samite (PS) seats, which fell vacant after the Supreme Court quashed the OBC quota for want of empirical data in March this year, saw Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) suffering a setback. The BJP’s tally of DCs dropped to 22 from 31, while three ruling parties – Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Congress – improved their tally by 10 to 46 seats that fell vacant. Similarly, in PS, too, the Congress emerged to top position by winning 36 seats, while the BJP could win 33. The NCP and Sena won 18 and 23 seats, respectively, from the total 144 seats. Although the ruling parties fought the elections separately they claimed to have a better coordination at the local level to ensure they do not dent each other beyond a certain a limit. “In Washim, the Congress, NCP and even Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi had an understanding while fighting against the BJP in the bypolls and it worked. We are not going to have an alliance of three parties as it will cost us dear at local level and restrict the expansion of the parties. We have amicably decided that we will fight separately. In some local bodies, two parties will come together, while in some we will have strategic understanding in picking the candidates. Our common target will be to keep the BJP out of power and for it we will do whatever needs to be done,” said a Shiv Sena leader, requesting anonymity. Following these bypolls, 23 of 27 municipal corporations, 27 of 36 district councils, 300 of 362 nagar panchayats and more than 290 panchayat samitis are scheduled to go to polls in the first half of 2022. The elections are touted as a mini assembly poll and would serve as a testament to the performance of the MVA government. The BJP currently holds the highest number of local bodies in rural as well as rural bodies won during its five-year rule in the state until 2019. The ruling parties got a morale boost after bypoll results, as it was considered to be a litmus test for them after the OBC quota in these polls was quashed. The Opposition had created a picture that the electorate from the OBC communities is unhappy with the ruling parties and it was their failure to keep the quota intact. The ruling party leaders believe the reservation issue has not gone against them. Besides, the MVA partners were worried over the reaction of voters to issues such as scrapping of Maratha reservation by the apex court, series of allegations of corruption against MVA ministers and continuous lockdown imposed to check the spread of the epidemic. The three parties want to contest separately where they are strong to deny the BJP more space and also prevent local workers of the parties from going to the BJP. Congress has already announced to go solo in all forthcoming elections, though the announcement had not gone down well with two other ruling parties. “We are strong in rural areas in district councils and panchayat samitis and have comparatively less presence in urban areas. During the recent bypolls, all three parties gained their ground and will continue to do so in the forthcoming polls too. Our stand is clear, if we contested in alliance of three parties in corporations in Mumbai and Pune, with fewer seats, it will prove detrimental in our bid to expand the party. We have left it to our local units to decide whether they want to join hands with other two parties,” said a Congress leader. Although the Congress has made up its mind to go solo, the Shiv Sena and NCP are likely to join hands in many municipal corporation elections, including Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Kalyan-Dombivli, Pune, Nashik and districts of Konkan. In some of the districts like Kolhapur, Washim, Congress and NCP may come together. In these districts, the remaining party may play second fiddle. “The decision over the alliance will be taken when the elections are declared. It depends on the local equations and situation, and based on the reports we get from our sampark pramukhs and other leaders in-charge of the respective areas. We would definitely want to fight the polls together in major cities in MMR together, but at least the alliance of two of the ruling parties will definitely be possible. We have clarified within the party that there would be not alliance or tacit understanding with the BJP at any cost. The BJP is a common enemy for all three parties,” said Shiv Sena leader Sachin Ahir. Political analyst Prakash Bal said if the three ruling parties fought the local body polls together, they can eat into the BJP’s space. “The Congress should accept that it has weakened in the state and should compromise on seats to fight collectively. It will help the party in winning more seats in Mumbai and other parts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mva-plans-strategic-tie-up-or-seat-adjustment-for-mini-assembly-polls-101633629364200.html
07-10-2021||Lucknow||Many new names from UP in BJP’s new national executive||Several new names from Uttar Pradesh figure in Bharatiya Janata Party’s 80-member new national executive though the bigger surprise was the missing names of party veterans like party’s Sultanpur Lok Sabha MP Maneka Gandhi, her son and Lok Sabha MP from Pilibhit Varun Gandhi as well as former UP minister Vinay Katiyar. It wasn’t immediately clear why Katiyar was dropped from BJP’s top body. However, in Varun’s case it is being linked to the series of tweets he made on the Lakhimpur violence case. His latest tweet with a video of the incident that sparked violence in Lakhimpur Kheri, read: “The video is crystal clear. Protestors cannot be silenced through murder. There has to be accountability for the innocent blood of farmers that has been spilled and justice must be delivered before a message of arrogance and cruelty enters the minds of every farmer.” “I am not aware of the facts of any individual case but it’s a generally acceptable rule that one shouldn’t be publicly criticising a party or organisation that one serves,” a UP BJP leader said.The Congress has been at the forefront of the struggle for justice in the Kheri incident with party leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra visiting Lakhimpur along with chief ministers of two party-ruled states where they announced ₹50 lakh each from Congress-ruled states of Punjab and Chhattisgarh as compensation to victim farmers’ families.Maneka Gandhi’s name being dropped from the BJP body too has evoked surprise for she too hadn’t said or done anything publicly to attract party leadership’s ire. The first meeting of the BJP’s new executive was scheduled to be held on November 7, party leaders indicated. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expectedly on top of the list with Uttar Pradesh mentioned ahead of his name due to his being the Lok Sabha MP from Varanasi. Similarly, former BJP chief Murli Manohar Joshi too figures in the list from UP with defence minister and Lucknow MP Rajnath Singh right after him. Others from UP who figure in the list are Union minister and Chandauli MP Mahendra Nath Pandey; party’s Lok Sabha MP from Amethi and Union minister Smriti Irani; Union minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti; state’s law minister Brajesh Pathak; state’s labour minister Swami Prasad Maurya; state’s forest minister Dara Singh Chauhan; Muzaffarnagar MP and Union minister Sanjeev Balyan; Bareilly Lok Sabha MP Santosh Gangwar; minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi (who hails from Rampur), and Dr Anil Jain. Two leaders from UP in the national BJP body as vice presidents include Rekha Verma from Sitapur, MP and former Uttarakhand governor Baby Rani Maurya, who hails from Agra. Another UP leader who figures in the list is Arun Singh, the national general secretary of BJP, while party MPs Vinod Sonkar and Harish Dwivedi are in there as national secretaries. Rajesh Agarwal from Bareilly in UP is the national treasurer while Lok Sabha MPs Hema Malini (Mathura), general (retd) VK Singh, Union minister of state BL Verma; former UP BJP chief Laxmikant Bajpai; UP’s backward welfare minister Anil Rajbhar and Anurag Sharma, MP, figure in the list as national invitees. Also from UP is Amit Malviya, the national in-charge of IT and social media. Rajya Sabha MPs Sudhanshu Trivedi, Syed Zafar Islam, Gaurav Bhatia and Prem Shukla are in there as national spokespersons. Lok Sabha MP Rajkumar Chahar, BJP’s national farmers’ wing chief, is also from UP. BJP national president Jagat Prakash Nadda announced the party’s new national executive on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/many-new-names-from-up-in-bjp-s-new-national-executive-101633628944089.html

The department of environment said in an order that the timing for the use of loudspeakers has been extended up to October 16 in “public interest.”"Lt Governor of Delhi has considered the request in public interest and has accorded permission to use loudspeakers and public address systems between 10 pm and 12 midnight with immediate effect up to October 16," an order read.The organisers will, however, still require separate permission from the Delhi Police to use loudspeakers.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has already relaxed some of the restrictions on gatherings and large congregations, which were imposed in the wake of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, for the festive season till November 15.In its latest guidelines, the DDMA has prohibited fairs and food stalls during festivals and people will be allowed to sit only on chairs by following proper social distancing. The DDMA has also banned Chhath celebrations in public places and river banks in the city, triggering a backlash from Manoj Tiwari, a member of Parliament from Delhi. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader will take out a ‘Rath Yatra’ from Saturday to interact with people of Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh settled in Delhi and gather their opinion on holding Chhat puja at public places, reported PTI.“There is no chance of Covid spread when people celebrate Chhat in public places because devotees get into only knee-deep water while offering prayers,” he said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-allows-use-of-loudspeakers-for-ramlila-dussehra-till-midnight-101633625271793.html
07-10-2021||Mumbai||Aksa beach in Mumbai to get an anti-erosion wall; environmentalists remain vigilant||A year after it was deferred by the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) last year, a proposal by the Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB) for “sea front development and beatification at Aksa beach” was given limited nod in June, with permissions granted only for construction of an anti-sea erosion wall and parks and recreational grounds, as per the provisions of Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ), 2011. The minutes of MCZMA’s last meeting, held on June 10 and 11, were accessed by HT only this week, as the authority’s website remained inaccessible owing to a technical error between June and early October.While according permission for the works in its 155th meeting earlier this year, MCZMA had clearly stated that other activities proposed by MMB, including parking spaces, gyms, volleyball courts and a food plaza, were prohibited in view of CRZ regulations. MCZMA also instructed MMB to ensure that no construction takes place on the beach itself.Since MCMZA’s approval, however, similar seafront developments (by public works department) at Versova Beach and Girgaum Chowpatty (by the municipal corporation) have been found to be in violation of CRZ regulations, with large portions of the sandy beaches being reclaimed or used as dumping grounds. Environmentalists have raised the issue at multiple levels, including with local legislators and parliamentarians. “A trend seems to be emerging wherein authorities apply for CRZ clearance to carry out some permissible activities, and then during the execution, they end up violating the protected area. Take Versova, for example, where pretty much half of the sandy beach has been completely reclaimed under the guise of building an anti-sea erosion wall, and a promenade-like space has come up within the protected area. Similarly, at Girgaum Chowpatty, too, reclamation work is happening in the CRZ-1 area. Aksa Beach has also been on the radar for development, and it is important for citizens to remain vigilant so that we do not lose another sandy beach in Mumbai,” said environmentalist Zoru Bhatena, who has mounted official responses to happenings at both Girgaum and Versova.However, he also commended MCZMA for deferring permissions to MMB for the construction of non-permissible utilities at Aksa. MMB’s proposal is currently awaiting a nod from the Maharashtra State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA). “The permissions to go ahead with anti-erosion wall were given as part of CRZ clearance already granted for essential maintenance work in March 2019. The proponent later sought amendment in CRZ clearance, which has been granted with strict limitations. MMB has not been allowed to carry out any work on the beach itself,” said an environment department official privy to the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/aksa-beach-in-mumbai-to-get-an-anti-erosion-wall-environmentalists-remain-vigilant-101633627625228.html
07-10-2021||Mumbai||Temperatures rise for fifth straight day in Mumbai||The mercury in Mumbai went up to 35.8 degrees Celsius on Thursday, after rising and remaining consistently above normal for five straight days. On Wednesday, the temperature had soared to 35.1 degrees Celsius, from 34.5 degrees Celsius recorded on Monday and Tuesday. Rising temperatures are typical in the city in October, which marks a period of transition between the monsoon and the winter seasons.“As the monsoon prepares for withdrawal, the cloud cover becomes thinner and there is more penetration of sunlight, leading to high temperature. This is why Mumbai skies had a yellowish colour on Thursday,” said a meteorologist with the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) regional forecasting centre in Mumbai.As per IMD’s forecast, the daytime maximum temperature will remain between 35 and 36 degrees Celsius for at least the next week. “There may be some respite if there are thundershowers during the day, but there will be a steeper rise in temperature after October 15/16, when monsoon is expected to withdraw from the city,” the official said.Last October, the city had recorded a maximum temperature of 35 degrees Celsius on the 10th, 28th and 29th of the month. The highest October temperature ever recorded was 38.6 degrees Celsius in 2015. The phenomenon of October heat is typically exacerbated by a slowing down of onshore winds after the monsoon and a reduction in relative humidity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/temperatures-rise-for-fifth-straight-day-in-mumbai-101633627504203.html

07-10-2021||Noida||Jewar airport project: Farmers ask Noida authority to compensate for acquired land||Farmers, who have given their land for the Noida airport project, demanded on Thursday that their issues related to plots and compensation should be addressed on a priority basis.Nearly 300 farmers raised the demands during a meeting organised by Gautam Budh Nagar administration, Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida), and Jewar MLA Dhirendra Singh at the Jewar tehsil compound on Thursday.“Many farmers are yet to get plots and compensation against their land acquired for the airport project. We have submitted our complaint before the administration, and hope that our issues will be attended to and resolved without delay,” said Arif Khan, a farmer from Nagla Shareef village.The displaced farmers said they have been facing issues in getting the electricity connection and other basic services at the Airport township developed at the Jewar Bangar village.“The township needs to have separate cremation grounds for members of the Hindu and Muslim communities. The administration is yet to make sure that we get electricity connection without trouble. We had a power connection at our village house, and we were promised that the connection would be shifted to our new place in the township easily. But now, we are facing issues in getting a new electricity connection,” said Ramesh Kumar, a farmer from Rohi.The district magistrate, Suhas LY, assured farmers that the officials will look into this matter at the earliest. “We have provided plots and other benefits to farmers whose lands were acquired for the airport project. But if they face problems, we will look into each of their problems on a case-to-case basis and resolve those. Some farmers who left the village long ago may have some issues with their plots. The additional district magistrate, XXX, will look into the cases and take appropriate action.”According to the Yeida, more than 90% of the families affected by the airport project have started constructing houses in the rehabilitation township. “Out of the 3,003 plots that have been allocated in Jewar Bangar, construction work of nearly 2,730 plots has started. Many families have started living in their new houses,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer (CEO) of Yeida.Also, according to MLA Singh, “We had organised this meeting to solve the issues of the farmers, if any. Such meetings will also take place in future, so that these farmers do not face any difficulty.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/jewar-airport-project-farmers-ask-noida-authority-to-compensate-for-acquired-land-101633627204217.html
07-10-2021||Noida||G Noida: Three years on, damage to govt hospital’s basement goes unrepaired||The basement of Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida has been facing infrastructure issues since 2019, said authorities on Thursday. GIMS, one of the biggest medical institutes in western Uttar Pradesh, is spread over 15 acres in Kasna region. The hospital building’s basement is waterlogged and has been developing cracks since 2019. As a result, a major portion of the basement remains unused.Dr (Brig) Rakesh Gupta, director of GIMS, said that the infrastructural flaws in the basement pose a huge risk to the five-storey building of the hospital where thousands of patients come everyday for treatment. He said he has been speaking to the authorities regarding the issue for the past few years and, last week, wrote to the Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate, requesting him to expedite a solution. “Groundwater keeps flowing into the second level of the basement and the whole area becomes waterlogged. During monsoon, the situation worsens as humidity increases. This has led to seepage in the walls of the building. Some areas of the basement have also developed cracks,” said Dr Gupta. He added that in his letter to the DM, he has explained that experts have termed the building unsafe. In 2019, a team from IIT Roorkee inspected the building and in 2020, it submitted its report to Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) and GIMS officials. “The report said that the building is unsafe and suggested repair work worth ₹23 crore to fix the issues. The Public Works Department has been selected by the Directorate of Medical Education and Training in 2020 to ensure the repairs. In my letter to the DM, I requested him to write to the higher authorities to release funds so that the repair work can be initiated,” said Dr Gupta. When chief secretary of UP Rajendra Kumar Tewari visited GIMS recently on September 3, the status was that GNIDA will provide the funds for repairs, said Dr Gupta. “At the time we had discussed the matter with Mr Tewari and the GNIDA was ready to provide the funds. However, at GNIDA’s recent board meeting, the fund disbursal was not approved and it was decided that the directorate will provide them,” he said. According to the GNIDA CEO, the funds are to be released by the Directorate of Medical Education and Training, Uttar Pradesh. “We had taken up the issue at the GNIDA board meeting, but it was found that since the institute is a state-level medical facility and not a city-level one, the directorate will have to release funds for its repairs,” said Narendra Bhooshan, GNIDA CEO. Officials of the directorate could not be reached for comment.Bhooshan added that the designer who was given the contract for designing GIMS building by the GNIDA was suspended and his payment forfeited after designing flaws were found in the building in 2019. However, according to the consultant who designed the building, the designs were proof-checked by IIT Delhi’s team as well as GNIDA authority officials. “After approval of the building design, GNIDA engineers supervised and executed the construction of the building via third-party contractors. Still, the designing consultant is being punished for the building flaws which is unfair,” said the consultant, who requested to remain anonymous.Meanwhile, Suhas LY, DM, Gautam Budh Nagar, said that he had written to the principal secretary of medical education regarding the matter earlier this year. “This is a long-standing matter which has often been taken up with the medical education department of Uttar Pradesh government. Since a complete overhaul is required--which demands huge expenditure--the government needs to look into it. I have already written to the principal secretary of medical education regarding the issue earlier this year,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/g-noida-three-years-on-damage-to-govt-hospital-s-basement-goes-unrepaired-101633627144390.html
07-10-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to launch week-long special Covid-19 vaccination drive from October 8||The Maharashtra government has declared to launch “Mission Kavach Kundal”, a seven-day special campaign to boost its Covid-19 vaccination drive, starting from October 8. It has set a target of vaccinating minimum 1.5 million people a day. It is also looking to prioritise covering the first doses of all citizens at the earliest. This will help in reducing the severity of the Covid-19 infections even if the potential third wave hits the state, said state health minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday.He also declared to provide monetary assistance of ₹50,000 each to the kin of those who died due to Covid-19 infection during the pandemic. The state government has made a provision of ₹700 crore for the same. The decision was taken, following the directives of the central government.“The state government has decided to undertake a special drive to boost vaccination in Maharashtra. Between October 8 [Friday] and October 14, we will be holding ‘Mission Kavach Kundal’ under which the state has set a target of administering 1.5 million doses a day at least. The drive will help us cover the citizens to get vaccinated in less time,” Tope told reporters on Thursday.The most beneficiaries covered in a day in the state is 1.4 million. As many as 1,439,809 doses were vaccinated on September 8.According to the statistics provided by the state health department, the targeted population for vaccination in Maharashtra is 91.5 million. Of them, 60 million have been covered with first dose and 31.5 million is yet to be vaccinated, while those fully vaccinated are 25 million.“If we could give priority for first doses and cover the remaining 31.5 million than the entire population will covered with first dose and the threat of severity after infecting with the virus will be reduced… I have directed the officials to work on mission mode and cover 2 million to 2.5 million in a day in the coming days,” he said.He informed that they have enough stock of doses at present and expecting more as union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya has promised him there won’t be any shortage in supply. “We have 7.5 million doses, as of now, and another stock of 2.5 million doses is expected to reach. The union health minister in a telephonic conversation has promised to provide enough stock as the Centre has also set a target to cover 10 million doses by October 15,” health minister said.The state has planned to mobilise people by taking staff from departments such as women and child development, school education, rural development and revenue to boost the drive, he said, adding, they will also rope in NGOs such as Rotary Club and Lions Club to create awareness.“The state government has also decided to provide financial assistance of ₹50,000 each to the next of kin of those who could not survive after infecting with Covid-19. Anyone having death certificate with mention of Covid-19 infection after RT-PCR or Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) test will be held eligible for the monetary help. The amount will be granted from State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF) as directed by the central government. A provision of ₹700 crore has also been made,” Tope said.Total number of Covid-19 deaths in the state is 0.14 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-launch-week-long-special-covid-19-vaccination-drive-from-october-8-101633627028619.html
07-10-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad civic body set to geo-tag all its properties to prevent encroachment||The Ghaziabad municipal corporation (GMC) has decided to geo-tag all its properties to prevent encroachments, officials said on Thursday.The development comes after a committee of officials identified nine persons, who allegedly encroached and sold land meant for the first political training institute in Uttar Pradesh to the poor people. The institute was proposed to come up over a corporation land -- over an area of nearly 3.03 hectares -- adjacent to the Raj Nagar Extension road. Out of the total 3.03 hectares, 1.37 hectares was encroached and houses were constructed there.A proposal for the institute, with an estimated cost of ₹168 crore, was cleared by the Uttar Pradesh state cabinet in October 2018.In October 2020, the GMC got the encroachment removed, with nearly 14 houses constructed on the land meant for the proposed institute. Overall, the GMC officials said, 101 people constructed houses in a locality -- Shanti Nagar -- over the government land.Later, a committee was constituted and it was found that some nine persons had grabbed the government land worth ₹3.51 crore and later sold it to some poor people. The inquiry committee also got access to sale deeds and other documents which were provided to them by the occupants of the houses.“We have initiated proceedings to debar the illegal occupants from the government land. The cost of the land will be recovered from the properties of identified people who sold the government land. We have initiated proceedings to lodge an FIR, and will also be recommended for action under the Gangster Act,” said MS Tanwar, commissioner of GMC.The suspects have been identified as Om Tyagi, Indu Tyagi, Suraj Paswan, Rajnish Chaudhary, Brijesh Tyagi, Babita Tyagi, Mahesh Sharma, Ajit Singh and late Inder Pal.The GMC officials, meanwhile, said that they are developing a system to geo-tag lands to identify those easily. “With geo-tagging, we will get information about encroachment of our land. We will introduce this system soon to protect government lands from encroachments. In the past one year, we have freed nearly 57 hectares of government land at different locations in Raj Nagar Extension, Crossings Republik, and Vijay Nagar, valued around ₹1,700 crore,” Tanwar added.The political training institute is proposed to be constructed by the Construction & Design Services, a unit of the Uttar Pradesh Jal Nigam, and part of the project was approved by the Uttar Pradesh housing department. The facility will train and impart education to politicians and activists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-civic-body-set-to-geo-tag-all-its-properties-to-prevent-encroachment-101633626544203.html
07-10-2021||Gurugram||Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, elevated road expected to turn Sohna into next major realty hub||Completion of major road infrastructure projects is set to turn Sohna into the next big real estate hub of the National Capital Region (NCR), as evidenced by takers for the micro market despite an overall slowdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic, according to experts and realtors.With the Haryana portion of the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway and the Sohna elevated road likely to be finished by next year, experts believe that the real estate sector will get a major boost as these infrastructure will improve accessibility, create jobs and allow people to move about with ease.Developers who had invested in Sohna around five to six years ago said these two road projects will boost housing demand as it would take residents only 15 minutes to reach Rajiv Chowk in Gurugram.Vinod Behl, a real estate expert, said Sohna is centrally located in the NCR, and the growth of any real estate destination largely depends on that area’s connectivity, physical and social infrastructure, established residential and commercial developments in the neighbourhood and its proximity to corporate and industrial hubs, the major centres of employment. These key drivers significantly influence the price of a property and its future appreciation. In that respect, Sohna scores quite high as a micro market of Gurugram, he said. “The area is contiguous to south Delhi and Gurugram, besides providing access to Palwal, Faridabad and Alwar. He said connectivity to the Jewar airport in Uttar Pradesh, when it becomes operational, will enhance the area’s potential as a realty hub,” said Behl.As per the details shared by the Department of Town and Country Planning (DTCP), there are 10 affordable group housing projects, 15 projects under the Deen Dayal Awas Yojana, three commercial projects, and 19 group-housing projects in Sohna, besides six to seven commercial projects.Around 800 acres have been licensed in Sohna since 2012, with maximum licences issued in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2019.Sohna is spread across an area of 27 square kilometres and is divided into 38 sectors for urban development by the government of Haryana. Lower plot costs, in comparison to Gurugram, is one of the reasons for developers taking up projects there over the past seven years.According to Santosh Kumar, vice-chairman of Anarock, a real estate consultancy, Sohna has witnessed significant real estate activity since 2013 and supplied around 30,000 housing units till the third quarter of 2021. “Popularly known as south Gurugram, Sohna emerged as a favourable affordable destination owing to its proximity to various business centres and industrial clusters,” he said.Data made available by Anarock reveals that the maximum real estate activities in Sohna took place in 2014, 2015 and 2017, when 12,000, 6,000 and 4,000 housing units were launched, respectively. The launch of new projects has been muted over the past four years, largely due to unfavourable market conditions.As far budget segmentation is concerned, Kumar said that 55% of the projects are in the mid-segment ( ₹40 lakh to ₹80 lakh), 26% are in the affordable segment (below ₹40 lakh) and 16% in the premium segment ( ₹80 lakh to ₹1.5 crore).The numbers also suggest that of the 29,270 units launched, 30% have been completed while 46% will be ready by the end of next year. The average property price in Sohna is around ₹4,100 per square feet (sqft), a slight increase from ₹3,798 per sqft in 2015.Mubeen Khan, a city-based real estate consultant, said that while properties in Sohna were available for ₹3,500-5,000 per sqft, the area was more focussed mid-segment housing. “In comparison, Gurugram is more about premium housing, with average price of a flat being more than ₹75 lakh,” Khan said.The developers say better connectivity with Gurugram, Delhi and other parts of the country will help this micro-market grow faster. “By 2031, around 640,000 people are going to reside in south Gurugram. With the increase in population and led by multiple government initiatives, Sohna is expected to witness heightened demand for residential spaces in the time to come. Sohna is aligned with the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, Palwal-Sonipat Orbital Rail Corridor, linked to KMP [Kundli-Manesar-Palwal] and new elevated road to Gurugram will boost housing in the city,” Pradeep Agarwal, managing director of Signature Developers, which has a major presence in the town, said.According to Behl, what makes Sohna attractive for both end-users and investors is the lower entry point, with good scope for price appreciation that has seen risen significantly over the past seven years.Improved connectivityDevelopers and experts were particularly enthused after Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari visited Sohna on September 5 and announced that work on the Haryana portion of the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway and Sohna elevated road will be completed by mid-2022, even as officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) clarified that the Sohna elevated road would be completed by June 2022.The stakeholders admitted that while the past three to four years witnessed a slowdown across the country, the Sohna micro market and projects on Sohna Road remained attractive due to affordability and good prospects. “Last year, it was Sohna and New Gurugram micro markets which had emerged on the top as far as supply and price of properties is concerned. Once the elevated road is completed, home buyers in Gurugram will have great options to buy affordable houses, plots and also premium housing in this area,” Sanjiv Thakur, a real estate consultant, said.Although developers admitted that the launch of new projects has been slow over the past two years due to a weak market caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdowns, they are optimistic that the two new road projects will lead to a turnaround and greatly contribute to Sohna’s growth.“Owing to its proximity to different business centres and industrial clusters, it promises good connectivity and planned infrastructure upgrades. The proposed link between the new Jewar airport and the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway is the newest and most crucial connectivity factor, boosting real estate on Sohna Road,” Amarjit Bakshi, the chairman and managing director (CMD) of Central Park, said.Market trendAccording to studies by real estate consultancies, homebuyers’ preferences are changing, as many as preferring to reside in gated communities on the outskirts of the cities. A report released by Anarock last year stated that almost 57% of home launches in NCR in 2020 took place in areas on the outskirts of Gurugram, such as Sohna and Sohna Road, besides areas under the Yamuna Expressway in Uttar Pradesh’s Gautam Budh Nagar.“Sohna, Sohna Road and Dwarka Expressway are some of the most preferred areas among the buyers. Previously, most of the sales in the periphery were made by investors or buyers planning to relocate in future. However, they are now willing to accept the distance between their homes and their workplaces due to boost in infrastructure and connectivity,” an excerpt from Anarock’s report stated.Echoing this viewpoint, Ashish Tandon, president, sales and marketing, SS Group, said that these two expressways will enhance connectivity and boost demand for real estate. “The improved connectivity and decongestion will push up the prices of residential properties, generate employment opportunities and usher in a socio-economic transformation of the region,” he said.Basic infrastructureWhile most of the stakeholders are bullish about Sohna’s emergence as a housing hub, there are others also who suggest caution as the area is still lacking in physical, social and recreational infrastructure.“Roads are good but we need much more to survive and thrive in a city. There is need for schools, colleges, malls, hospitals, and similar recreational spaces. It will take a long time for this area to emerge as a subcity of Gurugram,” Ramesh Menon, the chief executive officer of Certes Realty, said.He said that the supply of housing in Delhi is likely to increase by next year, and this will also impact the growth of peripheral areas. “The private players and Haryana government will have to do lot of work to boost infra in Sohna to ensure its transformation into a city,” Menon said.Officials of DTCP, however, said that work on setting up the infrastructure is being taken up on priority. “The focus is to build required infrastructure in proportion to population growth. We had envisaged that Sohna will develop as a key micro market and this is happening. We will work with all stakeholders to ensure that this town grows into a city,” RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement), said.Bhath said that large-scale exercises are also being taken to prevent the illegal development of colonies and farmhouses in and around Sohna. “We are going to ensure that sanctity of Sohna master plan is maintained,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/delhimumbai-expressway-elevated-road-expected-to-turn-sohna-into-next-major-realty-hub-101633626244219.html
07-10-2021||Mumbai||Rise in narcotics activities: Each Maharashtra district to have anti-narcotics cell||Against the backdrop of the recent seizures of the drug haul in Gujarat and raids on a cruise rave party in Mumbai, state home minister Dilip Walse Patil held a review meeting and directed to constitute anti-narcotics cell in each of the districts.The high-ranking officials from Mumbai and Maharashtra Police forces apprised the home minister about the rise in the cases related to consumption and peddling of drugs. The officials also expressed concerns over the spurt in the criminal cases committed under the influence of the drugs. The home minister has asked the police force to chalk out a programme to curb the activities. He also directed police to set up anti-narcotics cell in each district.“Police need to thoroughly investigate the narcotics cases and take strict action against the people involved in them. They should be more vigilant to bring narcotics activities under control. The peddling of drugs has reached villages. The consumption of drugs among school and college-going youth is on the rise. Some medicines are being used as drugs. There are complaints of online marketing of such medicines. The defunct industrial units are used for narcotics-related activities. To curb such activities, the police should implement joint drive with the help of food and drug administration and industrial departments,” Walse Patil said.Director general of police Sanjay Pandey said that a joint meeting of the heads of all departments of the police force will soon be convened to discuss the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rise-in-narcotics-activities-each-maharashtra-district-to-have-anti-narcotics-cell-101633626067535.html
07-10-2021||Gurugram||Covid-19: Oxygen plants opened, production capacity at 6,000 LPM||Two oxygen plants, set up to provide adequate medical oxygen to combat the next wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, at Civil Hospital in Sector 10 and Tau Devi Lal Stadium were inaugurated on Thursday.Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram, said that the district can now produce 6,000 litres per minute (LPM) of medical oxygen, as 12 plants at government facilities and 11 in private hospitals, all having 100-500 LPM capacity, have been set up. Work on seven more plants at private hospitals is currently underway.“With the start of these two new plants, the city now has the capacity of producing 6,000 LPM of oxygen. We have directed private hospitals with more than 50 beds to set up plants by the end of December,” Yadav said. Officials said that the plant at Civil Hospital, which has a capacity of 1,000 LPM, was among 35 such plants in the country inaugurated virtually by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday. According to the state government, 39 plants have now been set up with the PM Cares Fund. The plant at the Tau Devi Lal Stadium, which has a capacity of 1,650 LPM, was inaugurated by mayor Madhu Azad. It has been set up under a corporate social responsibility initiative by Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd, a spokesperson for the district administration said. Dr Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said that with the opening of these plants, the city is becoming self-reliant in oxygen production and would be able to meet any eventual requirement in case of Covid-19 spread in the future. “The plant in Civil Hospital will ensure that oxygen can be supplied to 100 beds continuously. The plant at Tau Devi Lal Stadium is equipped to fill oxygen cylinders and it will also ensure adequate supply of gas to the temporary hospital at the stadium,” he said. A shortfall in medical oxygen was a major issue faced by the district, besides several locations in the country, during the second wave of the Covid-19 outbreak earlier this year. Many deaths were also attributed to the shortage, following which the Haryana government and district administration made it mandatory for hospitals with more than 50 beds to set up oxygen plants. According to the data shared by the Haryana government last month, 39 pressure-swing absorption (PSA) plants had been commissioned in the state and it had achieved 98% of the target, of 40 plants, under the PM Cares Fund. On September 29, health minister Anil Vij said that of the 40 PSA plants, 39 plants have been made functional. Besides this, the Centre has offered to fund 22 additional oxygen plants for Haryana. On Thursday, Yadav said that all 40 plants have been made functional.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-oxygen-plants-opened-production-capacity-at-6-000-lpm-101633626065847.html
07-10-2021||Gurugram||MCG to start round-the-clock vigil of illegal waste dumping points||Officials of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on Thursday said that round-the-clock surveillance to check unauthorised dumping of waste and keep tabs on secondary waste collections points is likely to start by the month-end. The move will coincide with the implementation of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) and help prevent dumping of construction and demolition waste, officials said, after a meeting was held on Thursday to discuss sanitation issues. “Officials of Ecogreen (the MCG’s concessionaire for waste management) apprised us that even at their own secondary waste collection points, violators are dumping waste illegally. MCG officials also said that at least 20 points have been identified where dumping of waste is being carried out at vacant plots on a large scale,” a senior MCG official, who attended the meeting, said. MCG officials said that issues pertaining to the Bandhwari plant, Grap measures, as well as Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) targets, which were originally listed for discussion during Thursday’s meeting, will be discussed next week.The official cited above said that MCG officials were directed to first compile a list of all illegal dumping points and subsequently, constitute teams for surprise inspections to initiate legal action against violators.“Besides these tasks, the teams will also set up CCTV cameras at each of the identified unauthorised dumping points as well as secondary waste collection points, each of which will be monitored by MCG officials,” the official said, wishing not to be named.After Ecogreen officials carry out the door-to-door collection of waste from households, they dump all the waste at a garbage centre located within a sector or a large residential area. Such garbage centres are known as secondary waste collection points.In July, Ecogreen and MCG had identified at least 19 unauthorised dumping points across the city, at Umang Bharadwaj Chowk, a plot opposite Pataudi Road police station, a plot near Kapashera border, below Daulatabad flyover, a plot near Sheetla Mata Mandir, and near Sector 9 Huda market, among others.Unauthorised dumping of waste, including illegal dumping of construction and demolition (C&D) waste, is one of the major factors contributing to air pollution. With the MCG set to implement Grap measures from October 14, officials were directed to set up CCTV cameras at each authorised point by the end of this month and to also identify more such sites in the city where surveillance can be initiated. Among other key decisions taken during the meeting was a direction issued to Ecogreen for maintaining a fleet of backup vehicles for door-to-door waste collection so that the service is not affected. The MCG also decided to set a 150-tonne waste material recovery facility (MRF) at Badshahpur within two months. “In a nutshell, recycled waste is segregated from household garbage at an MRF. We have already constructed the first such facility at Rajiv Chowk, and are aiming to set up one in all 35 wards of the MCG by early 2021,” an official of the MCG’s sanitation wing, who attended the meeting, said.The MCG also decided to construct four composting plants, specifically for converting horticulture waste into compost, in each of its four zones. Officials also decided to start a drive from next week to check use of single-use plastic and polythene.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-to-start-round-the-clock-vigil-of-illegal-waste-dumping-points-101633626064099.html
07-10-2021||Mumbai||Devotees throng religious places in Mumbai; experts suggest caution||Six months after places of worship were closed down on account of the rising number of Covid cases in the second wave of the pandemic, devotees across religions were able to offer their prayers as part of a larger community on Thursday.Prominent places of worship like Mumbadevi Mandir, Siddhivinayak temple, Mahim Church as well as both the Mahim and Haji Ali dargahs saw huge crowds of devotees – including politicians – throng these places, even as the institutions adopted strict Covid-19 guidelines to prevent crowding and maintain physical distancing. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) issued orders on October 1 which reinforced the restrictions put in place by the state: no religious place was allowed to offer “prasad” or sprinkle holy water; devotees were to be allowed only in specific time slots; and all sites could be full up to only 50% capacity. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray accompanied by his family members visited the Mumbadevi temple in South Mumbai on Thursday morning. He was followed by Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and Water Resources minister Jayant Patil visited Siddhivinayak temple. Minority development minister Nawab Malik and port Development minister Aslam Shaikh went to Mahim and Haji Ali dargahs respectively.Raj Chakravarty, a designer based in Andheri visited the Mata Rani temple in Andheri on the first day of the Navratri festival. “We were asked to wear the mask at all times and we were sprayed with sanitiser. It is good that the temple authorities are taking due precautions,” he said.“We are allowing only 250 people per hour and only through online booking. Citizens are following the rules and there is no chaos,” Adesh Bandekar, chairman of the Siddhivinayak Temple Trust said. The temple, which is open from 7am to 7pm every day will allow 2500 devotees daily, Bandekar said.Suhail Khandwani, Managing Trustee, Mahim and Haji Ali Dargah said that restrictions imposed are working very well. “We are allowing only 25 people inside the dargah at a time.” Both places are open from 6am to 10pm every day, and is being sanitized every four hours.Bishop John Rodrigues, rector, Mount Mary Church at Bandra said all precautions were taken on Thursday. “We took people in batches of eight for veneration of Mother Mary. During our two prayer services, we took just 60 people in the church though our capacity exceeds 180 people. In addition, our volunteers took all caution to ensure that Covid-19 appropriate behaviour was observed.” With schools reopening and now places of worship too, medical experts have asked people to remain extra vigilant to prevent the spike in Covid-19 cases.Dr Rahul Pandit of Fortis Hospital, Mulund, who is also a member of the state’s Covid-19 task force said in view of the easing of restrictions, there was an urgent need for stringent observation of Covid appropriate behaviour. “The authorities need to keep watching for any surge in cases and act accordingly. They need to take localised timely actions to contain the spread of the Covid-19 virus,” said Dr Pandit. “Since there is more movement, citizens should adopt Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and even the authorities need to enforce it strictly,” he added.In September, the government had allowed the reopening of religious places with strict safety protocols in place. Late in the month it announced that all places of worship would reopen on October 7, the first day of the Navratri festival, an auspicious nine-day festival among Hindus. Meanwhile, Maharashtra on Thursday recorded 2681 Covid-19 new cases with 49 deaths. Mumbai’s tally of new cases was 453 with five deaths thus bringing its total death toll to 16,141. The total number of Covid-19 patients right from the outbreak last year has now reached 6,570,472.There were 147,320 tests done on Thursday while the number of recoveries clocked at 2,413. The total number of active patients in Maharashtra currently stands at 33,397 while the total number of deaths right from the Covid-19 outbreak has now reached 139,411.There are currently 33,397 active patients across the state of which Pune tops with 8818 patients followed by Mumbai with 5711 active patients and Thane with 4156. The death toll has now reached 139,411 with Pune leading with 19,496 deaths followed by Mumbai with 16.141 and Thane with 11,383.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/devotees-throng-religious-places-in-mumbai-experts-suggest-caution-101633625943974.html

As part of phase 1, 1,334 hectares of land has been successfully handed over to concessionaire Zurich International AG.“We have completed almost all works related to land acquisition and handover under phase 1. Now we are expediting the process to acquire land for phase 2 of the project. We will issue public hearing schedules village-wise in the next two days. Once public hearings are completed, we will move on to the next stage of land acquisition,” said Balram Singh, additional district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar.The Uttar Pradesh government is likely to appoint an official to supervise rehabilitation and resettlement works under phase 2 soon. After public hearings in villages, the administration will invite objections and seek consent of farmers.“Once we will have consent of at least 70% farmers, we will notify Section 11 before starting the acquisition according to procedure,” said Singh.The team from Gautam Buddha University found out that 3,800 families are likely to be displaced during phase 2.“The administration must make sure that farmers get their plots, funds and other benefits properly without delay,” said Sanjay Kumar, a farmer from Ranhera.A total of 1,363.45 hectare has to be handed over the to the subsidiary of the Zurich AG for the next stage of the project, of which 1,185.69 hectare is private land. The social impact assessment team had visited six villages under phase 2-- Karoli Bangar, Kureb, Mundhera, Birampur, Dayanatpur and Ranhera. The team completed its field visits by August 31 and started compiling its report thereafter. Nodal officer of the team and head of department of political science and international relations department at the university, Dr Vivek Kumar Mishra, said, “In our report submitted to the administration, we wrote that the farmers want to give their land for the airport as they feel it will provide them and their families better opportunities.”The motive of the study was to assess and detail the socio-economic profile of the villagers affected by the project and the impact on their livelihoods.The acquisition of private land in the six villages will require almost ₹2,891 crore. The administration has already received ₹1,084 crore from Uttar Pradesh government. The remaining amount has to be arranged by the Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/social-impact-survey-for-second-stage-of-jewar-airport-completed-101633625584097.html

In all, 14 girls selected from shelter homes in Bihar were sent to Eurindian Academy of Hotel Management in Bengaluru by the state government in December 2020. The social welfare department had initiated this step as a part of its aftercare programme meant for the girls at shelter homes and had signed an MoU with the Bengaluru-based ECHO Centre for Juvenile Justice under which the NGO had to make the girls complete their one-year diploma course in hotel management and ensure their placement in star category hotels.“While four of them have been selected by Radisson group of hotels, four others have been added in the team of professionals at Eurindian Academy and two others have also got placement in another good hotel,” said Rajkumar, director at Bihar’s social welfare department. “The rest four have to wait for another few months for placement since they are still minors,” he said. “They now have the option to either get back to Bihar and wait for the right time or join internship at any organisation in Bangalore,” he said. “The Bihar government spent around ₹14 lakh for the entire programme.

The exercise was carried out at Kaushambi police post, near Meenakshi Hospital and Panchmani apartments on the directions of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), where members of the Kaushambi Apartments Residents Welfare Association (Karwa) are contesting a petition with regard to the air and noise pollutions in the township. According to official figures, the five-day average PM10 levels were 119.688 micrograms per cubic metre (mpcm), 145.364 mpcm and 80.004 mpcm at the three locations, respectively, and higher than the standard limit of 100mpcm of PM10. Officials said the results of the PM2.5 levels for all five days could not be obtained properly due to some technical issues. Data obtained by the pollution board showed that the average daytime noise levels were 71.96 decibels at Kaushambi police post (commercial zone), 70.87 decibels near Meenakshi hospital (silence zone) and 66.73 decibels at Panchmani apartments (residential), respectively. The daytime standard noise levels at commercial, silence and residential zones is 65 decibels, 50 decibels and 55 decibels, respectively. On the other hand, the night time noise pollution levels were also high with Kaushambi police post recording 68.07 decibels against the average of 55 decibels for a commercial zone, 61.94 decibels near Meenakshi hospital against the standard 40 decibels in silent zones and 56.40 decibels at Panchmani apartments, 11 decibels higher than 45 decibels that is the average for residential areas. “The PM2.5 levels could not be ascertained due to some technical issues. The hospital area also has residential and commercial establishments nearby. So, it can be considered a mixed zone. There was some rainfall on the days we were monitoring the air and noise pollution levels. The higher levels of PM10 could be the result of infrastructure works going on near Kaushmabi,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB. “For other pollution related issues, different departments are taking up measures as directed under the environmental management plan for the township. Another round of special monitoring is underway this week. All the results will be compiled and submitted before the tribunal with reasons,” he added. The Kaushambi township comprises 22 high-rise residential towers and is adjacent to Delhi’s Anand Vihar border. It is just opposite to the inter-state bus terminus at Kaushambi and Sahibabad Site IV Industrial Area. In its order on August 23, while hearing Karwa’s petition, the NGT directed the divisional commissioner (Meerut), the district magistrate of Ghaziabad, the SSP of Ghaziabad and the regional officer of UP pollution control board, to personally appear for the hearings. “We have been contesting petitions against the Ghaziabad agencies since 2015 and it is now that they have started implementing the directions. We will assess their works in the long term and apprise the court. Ghaziabad city is already high on pollution levels and ours is also a hotspot in terms of pollution. The PM10 and PM2.5 levels are already high here,” said V K Mittal, president of Karwa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noise-pollution-pm10-levels-much-higher-than-average-in-kaushambi-township-101633624863840.html

The empanelment list has led to the buzz about Tiwari’s likely appointment at the secretary level with the central government.Tiwari has a long tenure of service with him (till early 2023). A change on the top post, if any, may provide an opportunity for some officers of the 1986 and 1987 batches working in Uttar Pradesh.It remains to be seen whether Tiwari goes on deputation to the Centre and who will be the new chief secretary if he does so.“Empanelment is only eligibility for appointment at the Centre. Giving a posting is the prerogative of government,” said Tiwari.People aware of developments said much will depend on the Centre’s decision about the likely appointment of Tiwari in the coming weeks. It may take a few weeks to a few months as the empanelment of an officer for any post at the Centre is followed by the process of his/her consent being sent to the Centre before being given an appointment for posting there.

However, the UP administration did not budge and the Congress contingent, comprising ministers Banna Gupta and Badal Patralekh, returned to capital city Ranchi on Thursday morning.Atleast eight people were recently killed in Lakhimpur-Kheri allegedly after a car belonging to Union minister of state Ajay Mishra Teni mowed them down during a farmers’ protest.Attacking the UP government, that had barricades put up at the border it shares with Jharkhand, the state unit chief said they were stopped despite informing the UP government of its plans. “We were going to Lakhimpur-Kheri to support the farmers and strengthen the protest being led by our leaders Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Rahul Gandhi. The UP government did not allow us entry despite the fact that two state ministers were part of the contingent, and we had informed the state government on Wednesday itself of our plans. Besides, the policemen at the border had no clue as to what to do and why they were stopping us,” said Thakur. He attacked the UP government led by chief minister Yogi Adityanath of “subverting democracy by force”. “The Yogi government and the BJP wants to subvert democracy by using brute force of police, but we will not budge. We will chalk out our plans again and reach Lucknow and Lakhimpur whenever required,” Thakur said. Reacting to the same, the BJP had on Wednesday described it as “political tourism” of the Congress ministers.“Agriculture minister Badal Patralekh is very concerned about farmers in UP, but he is least bothered about pending dues to farmers against paddy procurement and black marketing of fertilisers in the state ,” said Jharkhand BJP general secretary Aditya Sahu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jkhand-cong-contingent-makes-u-turn-after-being-stopped-at-up-border-101633621865247.html
07-10-2021||Patna||JAP-Cong alliance talks hit a hurdle||The talks of alliance/merger between former Madhepura MP Rajiv Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav‘s Jan Adhikar Party (JAP) and Congress seem to have hit a hurdle for now with JAP deciding to field candidate in Kusheshwarsthan assembly seat in Darbhanga district, which is set for bypoll along with Tarapur assembly seat in Munger district on October 30.Soon after his release from jail in a 32-year-old kidnapping case on Tuesday, Yadav had praised Congress. “In Bihar, we will support Congress in the assembly by-elections,” he had said.However, on Wednesday, his party announced the candidature of Yogi Choupal from Kusheshwarsthan. Sources in JAP said Congress had almost finalised the name of Pappu Yadav as the candidate from Tarapur but wanted his party to merge with Congress. “Yadav too was ready for it, but some Congress leaders blocked the move,” said a JAP leader, wishing not to be quoted. “A dejected Yadav left for Delhi and has deferred any further decision till his meeting with Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi,” the JAP leader said.However, before Yadav’s departure for Delhi, JAP state unit president Raghavendra Kushwaha announced the candidate for Kusheshwarsthan. Kushwaha said that decision to contest the bypoll was to maintain the party’s independent existence. “At the most, there will be an alliance with any party, but definitely no merger,” he said. Talking to HT, Yadav, however, blamed some state Congress leaders for stalling the move to give him the ticket from Tarapur. “Congress has suffered and reached in such a position because of these leaders who are working as B team of both BJP and the RJD,” alleged Yadav.“They have been feeding wrong information about me as they are afraid of being exposed once I join the party. It is the same group of Congress which worked against my wife and former MP Ranjita Ranjan during last Lok Sabha polls,” he said. Yadav, who is in Delhi, is likely to meet Rahul Gandhi and is hopeful of “positive outcome.” “I keep on interacting with Rahul Gandhi on and off. I have given up my demand for Tarapur seat,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/japcong-alliance-talks-hit-a-hurdle-101633621863951.html
07-10-2021||Patna||Four new sites in Bihar in protected monuments’ list||Four new sites in Bihar have been declared as state protected monuments and their development and upkeep will now been handled by the directorate of archaeology of the culture department, officials said. These include archaeological remains discovered on the banks of Chandan river in Amarpur block of Banka district, the huge mound discovered at Guwaridih-Bariarpur in Bhagalpur district, the ancient Lord Shiva temple at Dumaria village in Gopalganj district and mausoleum of Qamar Ali and Sultan Ali and Dulhin Mandir at Sherghati in Gaya.The mound at Guwaridih village in Bhagalpur district was brought to the notice of the government by some locals in November 2020. The remains of the ancient wall at Chandan river has been a chance finding. It was noticed during Chhath festival last year when some villagers were cleaning the banks. Both these places had drawn attention of chief minister Nitish Kumar, who had visited the sites of Guwaridih and Chandan river and asked officials to get the sites protected. The monuments at Sherghati, the tombs of Qmar Ali and Sultan Ali are said to be more than 400 years old. The two Alis were commanders of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb who came here as the army men but settled here. Another monument at Sherghati is Dulahin Mandir, which is more 150 years old temple and was built by Rani Ganesh Kunwar, the matriarch of a local landlord family in the 19th Century. “All these tombs, temples and mounds were declared state protected monuments last week. The directorate had decided to bring these monuments under the purview of the state archaeology and had issued notice two months ago, asking people to submit any claims they might have over the site. With the no such claims made by any one, these have officially been declared the state protected monuments,” said Deepak Anand, additional secretary of the culture department who is heading the state archaeology. The tombs and temples are in a bad shape and need redevelopment while the archaeological sites in Bhagalpur and Banka districts will mainly need conservation, he said. Official said that with these additions, Bihar now has 34 state protected monuments. “The state has been rich in archaeological sites, temples and tombs of great personalities. We try to preserve these to preserve our heritage and culture,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/four-new-sites-in-bihar-in-protected-monuments-list-101633621805590.html
07-10-2021||Patna||Wish to simplify working at govt offices, says BPSC topper Gourav Singh||After attempting twice to crack the exam and getting a satisfactory rank, the 65th Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) exam topper Gourav Singh secured the first rank in his third attempt with sheer grit, and now wishes to improve the working at government offices for convenience of people.A resident of Rohtas district, 28-year-old Singh has been selected for the Bihar Administrative Service.The BPSC topper said he had expected to qualify the exam, but never imagined that he would emerge as the topper. “This was my third attempt at the BPSC exam. My rank was not satisfactory in the second attempt, while I could not clear the preliminary exam in the first attempt. I was sure to crack the exam this time, but I never thought of securing the first rank,” said Singh, who was on cloud nine after the results were announced Thursday. He gives the credit of his success to his mother Shashi Singh, who, he said, stood strong by his side after the demise of his father Manoj Singh in 2001. Singh’s paternal house is in Uttar Pradesh, but he moved to his maternal house in Rohtas along with his mother, who is a government school teacher. Singh has pursued mechanical engineering from Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology. Talking about his study strategy, he said, “The syllabus for the civil services exam is known to us and study material is available in the form of books. We just need to organise and categorise them for effective learning and revision. I prepared for the exam through self-study, but took plenty of test series at my coaching centre for improving my knowledge and score.”He also thanked his friends and seniors for their support in his journey.As an administrative officer, Singh now aims to improve the condition of government offices.He said, “I am concerned about the condition of government offices. Majority of them lack basic amenities and common people have to make several visits there for work. I want to simplify and systematise the working at government offices for convenience of people.”Singh also aspires to crack the Union Public Service Commission exam in the coming future.“First, I wish to serve my state and contribute my services for its growth. If I get time for preparation after my duties, I will try to crack the UPSC exam in the future,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/wish-to-simplify-working-at-govt-offices-says-bpsc-topper-gourav-singh-101633621803832.html

She said the decision was taken to reduce injuries and fatalities during road accidents.Transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agrawal said, “All automobile dealers have to ensure the two-wheeler buyers purchase helmets certified by Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) along with the vehicle. All DTOs will constitute teams to carry out surprise inspections at automobile showrooms to ensure availability of certified helmets at their stores.”Riders are yet to develop the habit of wearing safety headgears while several of them wear poor quality helmets just to pass traffic checkpoints and skip from a penalty, he said adding that wearing a certified helmet is recommended for better protection.A senior transport official, said, “Customers will have to pay an extra amount for the helmet. Those who already own a helmet will have to submit their photograph wearing it to the dealer.”As per the department, at least 347 people died in 2020 and 525 in 2019 in road mishaps because of not wearing helmets.Agrawal has directed all DTOs to arrange awareness programmes on helmets and road safety at their respective districts. He said that the direction was issued in the light of provisions made in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, and Motor Vehicle Act,1988. As per Motor Vehicle Act, two-wheelers riders have to pay a fine of ₹1000 for not wearing a helmet while riding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/buying-helmets-with-two-wheelers-now-mandatory-bihar-transport-dept-101633621383791.html
07-10-2021||Mumbai||Physics, maths optional for engineering: No clarity over guidelines yet||Almost six months after the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) said that physics and mathematics in Class 12 are optional for those seeking admission to engineering courses, the Maharashtra Common Entrance Test (MH-CET) for admission to engineering courses in the state are being conducted only for those who have studied the subjects.With no clear guidelines from the regulator on how to conduct admissions to engineering courses for students, who haven’t studied physics and maths in Class 12, the CET cell has gone ahead with the entrance exam as usual. Exams were held between September 20 and October 1. “There has been no notification or guideline on whether and how to make any changes in the entrance exam process. So, for the admissions to the academic year 2021-22, maths and physics in Class 12 are mandatory for those taking the MH-CET. If we receive any guideline or notification from the state or the AICTE, we will modify the exam,” said CD Joshi, commissioner, CET cell. Until last year, admissions to engineering courses were done for students who studied maths and physics, apart from one of chemistry, biotechnology, biology and/ or technical vocational subject. However, in April, AICTE released its approval process handbook 2021-22— a legal document as per the All India Council for Technical Education Act, 1987. In it, the apex body regulating all technical courses and institutions made maths and physics in Class 12 optional for those seeking admissions to engineering courses. It said this was to bring in diversity in engineering courses. The regulator said that institutions should conduct ‘bridge’ courses to induct students, who did not study maths and physics in Class 12. “After the handbook was released, there have been no guidelines from the state government or AICTE on what kind of bridge courses institutions have to come up with. Neither has there been any guideline on how to conduct entrance exams for such students,” said an official from a premier engineering institute in the city. Anil Sahasrabudhe, chairperson, AICTE, said, “As of now, there’s no mandate that all institutes must admit students. In the handbook, we have opened the doors for students who may not have studied maths and physics. So, if any university or institute wants to do it they can. At the moment all engineering admissions are done based on state and central level entrance exams designed for physics, chemistry and maths students. What institutes can do this year, it to allow students without physics and maths to take the same entrance exams. If they clear the exam, they can get admissions.” SS Mantha, chancellor of KL Deemed to be University in Hyderabad and a former chairperson of AICTE, said, “In my opinion physics and maths are building blocks of engineering courses that cannot be exempted. However, the approval process handbook released by AICTE is binding on state governments and the regulator expects that institutions follow the rules.”Vaibhav Narwade, a professor and member of the Board of Studies of the department of computer engineering at the Ramrao Adik Institute of Technology Nerul, Navi Mumbai, said, “The state government runs a centralised admission process. They may consult with AICTE and decide the procedure. I don’t think colleges will face problems during admissions.”However, in the absence of any clear guidelines on how to conduct bridge courses, institutions remain clueless. “Institutions are expected to build bridge courses, but physics and maths are not courses that can be bridged. If the regulator has come up with a rule, then it is also the responsibility of the regulator, state government and institutions to formulate and issue operating guidelines on how to conduct such courses. Any such course will need to have a procedure, there’s a cost attached them, the curriculum has to be designed, proficient resources have to be brought on board to teach such courses,” said Mantha.Sahasrabudhe said that a committee was working on details on how to admit students. “The committee is looking at nitty-gritty such as courses can be opened up for which students. For example, maybe mechanical engineering will require both physics and maths, but biotechnology may not require physics, but biology may be allowed. These broad guidelines will be issued after the committee has worked on these details,” he said, adding that the guidelines can be expected by the end of December.The changes in the AICTE handbook 2021 were an attempt at reviving the dipping demand for engineering courses in the country. In Maharashtra, almost half of all engineering seats have been going vacant for want of takers for the past three years. In the academic year 2020, around 45% of seats remained vacant at the end of the admission process and 49% were vacant the year before. Incidentally, in 2019, a report released by employability assessment company Aspiring Minds found that more than 80% of all Indian engineers were unemployable for any job in the knowledge industry. The report found that only 3.84% of engineers had the required technical, cognitive and linguistic skills to be in a software-related job in a startup.In 2014, the Maharashtra government had commissioned an analysis of the drop in demand for engineering colleges in the state. GD Yadav, then the vice-chancellor of the Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai, had then presented a report suggesting “appropriate criteria to reduce the intake and closure of some of the programmes including mergers of branches with fancy nomenclature into the mainstream.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/physics-maths-optional-for-engineering-no-clarity-over-guidelines-yet-101633621324009.html

This includes maintaining social distance, washing hands frequently and getting vaccinated. The virus has not been completely eradicated and caution is needed to prevent the surge. The vaccination is the only way forward to prevent this. Hence, kindly request you to provide vaccination status of your society members, maids, security guards, milkman, laundry person, gardener etc.”Mrudula Ande, assistant municipal commissioner of the BMC’s R North ward that covers Dahisar and Borivli area said, “We have over 1,900 societies in our ward, and we have initiated the exercise to understand the situation of vaccination in these societies. Ultimately, this will only help in reaching the goal of 100% vaccination status.”Ande added, “By this exercise, we can also understand the vaccination session pattern required and which area requires how many vaccine doses. We will also be issuing certificates to societies where all the eligible members are fully vaccinated. We are taking help from the elected representatives and are taking up similar drives in the slums too.”In the city, there are around 40,000 housing societies and around half of the city’s 12.4 million population resides in slums. On Monday, the BMC launched the logo, that has a QR code pasted on it. This logo will be given to societies having all their adult population fully vaccinated. These certificates will be pasted outside the housing societies indicating that the society is safe. Similarly, the BMC also plans to set up vaccination centres in clusters of 15-20 societies after getting the required data. Meanwhile, on Thursday, 87,229 citizens were vaccinated taking the total to 12,912,602. Out of the total, 4,507,809 citizens are fully vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-seeks-vaccination-status-from-housing-societies-in-mumbai-101633621145277.html

07-10-2021||Mumbai||Ready to vaccinate children against Covid-19, no need for infra upgrade: Mumbai civic body||As schools reopened for classes 8 to 12 earlier this week, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has indicated that it is ready to vaccinate the city’s adolescents as soon as the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) permits the vaccination programme to roll out to children, and will not require any infrastructure upgrade. “We are fully prepared to vaccinate the children but we have to wait for approval of ICMR and their guidelines. As the footfall of adults has declined with the completion of their immunisation, there won’t be any chaos once we start the vaccination of children,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. “We haven’t further chalked down any plan for it yet,” he said. Currently, the city has 325 vaccination centres and around one million children between the age group of 12 and 17 years in the city. Almost 90% of the eligible population in the city (ages 18 and above) have taken at least one of the two-dose anti-Covid vaccines available. This has lowered the footfall of probable beneficiaries compared to the start of the mass immunisation programme in January 2021. Since the start of the pandemic last March, 49,743 infections were seen among children and adolescents -- 13,947 below nine years of age and 35,806 between 10 and 19 years of age. As per a survey conducted by BMC in July among children and adolescents, the sero-positivity rate between the age group of 1 and 4 years was 51.04%. Children in the age group of 5 and 9 years showed 47.33% positivity rate. The highest positivity rate was recorded between 10 and 14 years at 53.43%. In the fourth category, teenagers between 15 and 18 years had a 51.39% positivity rate. “We are expecting that by the end of this year, we will at least have vaccines for children. Once the vaccines get approval from ICMR, children with commodities should be given priority,” Dr Bakul Parekh, member of the State Covid task force said. Zydus Cadilla’s ZyCoV-D and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin have been tested in children and the results of the trials are expected. The national drugs regulator approved ZyCov-D that has been tested in children 12 years and above for emergency use on August 20 this year, paving the way for inoculation of children under the national Covid-19 immunisation programme. While the trials of Covaxin had 525 volunteers between ages 2 and 18 years, the ZyCov-D trials had 1000 volunteers in the age group of 12 and 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ready-to-vaccinate-children-against-covid-19-no-need-for-infra-upgrade-mumbai-civic-body-101633621024190.html

Though there won’t be garba or dandiya, the removal of restrictions has come as a relief to 86 pandals set up in the city as opposed to 56 last year.This year, Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) received 91 applications of which five were rejected and 86 approved.NMMC officials informed that while some applications were repeated, some of the proposed pandals were on the footpath disturbing the movement of the common public, hence they were rejected.“We are conducting regular checks on people for masks and social distance. We are also appealing to people via social media to follow all Covid norms even when visiting the pandals,” medical health officer, Dr Pramod Patil, said.While the residents of Navi Mumbai are disappointed over not being able to play garba and dandiya with their community members in housing societies or pandals, some of them have planned to dance in their own homes“It’s sad that for the second consecutive year, we are unable to enjoy the festival but we also understand that it is for the larger good. But why kill the festival mood? We have decided to dance at home itself,” said a Vashi resident.Meanwhile, Jaywant Sutar, who organises a pandal at Sector 1, Shirawane in Nerul, has decided to arrange blood donation camps since there cannot be any other celebration. “Usually, we do have scholarships and recognition certificates being given to children and women who do well. But since the last two years, we are not able to do anything for the social cause. Hence, we decided to arrange a blood donation camp.”The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has given permission to only 91 pandals in the city for Navratri. Around 214 pandals had requested permission through online and offline means in the last few days. TMC was adamant on following the Navratri guidelines issued by them including conducting awareness programmes and blood donation camps.“We have issued guidelines to all Navratri pandals based on the SOP released by the State Government. Based on the location of the pandals, we have only permitted a few this year so that social distancing rules and Covid protocols are followed properly,” said a senior officer from TMC.(Inputs by Ankita Menon)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-civic-body-gives-nod-to-86-navratri-pandals-thane-to-91-101633620847281.html

The notice, issued under Section 160 of the criminal procedure code that relates to summons to witnesses, said Ashish Mishra must appear in person and present evidences that he is aware of about the incident.“Two people are being questioned. They have confirmed the role of three others who are dead. Technically, they have also been accounted for. These people are giving a lot of information,” IG Singh told the media.“If Ashish Mishra does not abide by the summons, legal procedure will be adopted,” IG Singh said, adding that there was no time limit in the summons sent to Mishra.Additional director general (ADG), law and order, Prashant Kumar later identified the two men arrested as Luv Kush and Ashish Pandey. He said the forensic team has found two missed cartridges and is examining one of the vehicles involved in the incident.People aware of the development said the two persons arrested on Thursday were claimed to be close aides of Ashish Mishra and more raids were going on.The police action came only a few hours after the Supreme Court on Thursday told the Uttar Pradesh government to submit a report within a day on how many arrests have been made so far in connection with the case.Eight people, including four farmers, were killed in Lakhimpur Kheri district on Sunday, in the bloodiest clash since the farmers’ protest over the Centre’s three contentious agricultural laws started last year.The farmers were allegedly knocked down by a convoy of vehicles, one of which belonged to Mishra. Two BJP workers -- Shubham Mishra and Shyam Sunder -- and a driver -- Hari Om Mishra -- were allegedly pulled out of the vehicles and lynched by angry protesters. A journalist working for a private TV channel, Raman Kashyap, also died in the violence. The farmers allege that Mishra’s son was in the convoy.People familiar with the development said a forensic team recovered a bullet from the incident site. Police officials, however, did not elaborate.The IG added that the incidents of firing or any fire arm injuries were not confirmed in the post-mortem report of the eight deceased. She said the team further examined the site on Thursday and the police will proceed with evidences that are coming up during the investigation.The Lakhimpur Kheri violence has triggered a major political storm with the opposition leaders demanding the removal of Union minister Ajay Mishra, who on Wednesday met Union home minister Amit Shah in New Delhi. On Thursday, the junior home minister was the chief guest of a workshop organised by the home ministry’s Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD) but the media was not allowed to cover it as had been planned initially.The minister has been claiming that his son was not in the car that ploughed through the protesters. He claimed the driver lost balance after being attacked by stone-pelters and then some protesters came under the car. Later, the driver was lynched and the car was set on fire, the minister has claimed. However, the police FIR states that Ashish Mishra was driving the car that ran over the protesters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-cops-can-t-find-minister-s-son-paste-notice-at-his-lakhimpur-kheri-house-101633620785579.html

Ashish has been booked for allegedly being in a car which ran over protesting farmers last Sunday in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri.Ashish Mishra Monu has been summoned at the crime branch office in Reserve Police Lines on Friday 10am to produce oral and digital evidence, the notice said seeking his presence.Ashish has been named in an FIR lodged in connection with the October 3 incident under IPC section 302 (murder). Luvkush Rana and Ashish Pandey were arrested earlier in the day. Police officials familiar with the developments told HT that these two are close associates of Ashish Mishra and that Ashish was not traceable.Ashish Mishra was allegedly in the car which carried BJP workers who were en route to welcome Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, who was attending an event at Lakhimpur Kheri. Farmers were protesting against the presence of the deputy chief minister. A car that reportedly carried Ashish and three others mowed down killing four farmers. Barring Ashish, two workers of the BJP who were inside the car were lynched. Another victim of Sunday’s violence was a local journalist Raman Kashyap. Kashyap’s father told news agency PTI that his son died after being hit by a vehicle when he was covering news of farmers' protest against Maurya's visit to Ajay Mishra's native place.The Lakhimpur Kheri district is under tight security as opposition leaders and farmers’ groups continue to visit the kin of the victims. Though the Yogi Adityanath government assured the victims’ kin justice and announced a compensation of ₹45 lakhs, calls for the Union minister’s son to face charges continue to grow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-union-minister-ajay-mishra-s-son-summoned-by-up-police-101633620165055.html
07-10-2021||Mumbai||Ambernath police arrest burglar based on tools left behind at crime scene||A hacksaw blade and a pair of pliers left behind by a burglar at the scene of crime led Ambernath police to arrest him within three days of the crime being discovered.According to the Ambernath police, the Rajesh Mobile Store near the Ambernath Railway Station was found to have been broken into on the morning of October 2. The burglar had secured entry into the stock room of the store through the roof and decamped with high end cell phones and tablets worth ₹15 lakh.A survey of the crime scene established that the accused had uprooted one corner of the tin roof and cut through the metal grills underneath to enter and exit the stock room. Before leaving, he had also taken the Digital Video Recorded (DVR) of the Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras installed in the store. While this meant that the police did not have CCTV footage to aid them in their investigation, they did find the first clue in the form of the tools used by the burglar – a hacksaw blade and a pair of pliers.“We first checked the CCTV footage of cameras installed around the burgled store and managed to get some footage of the accused. However, we could not get any visuals that had captured his face. We then started making inquiries in hardware stores in the area and found that someone had bought the same tools two days before the store was burgled. Fortunately, this hardware store had a CCTV camera that had captured the face of the customer clearly,” an officer who is part of the investigation said.The officer added that the footage of the suspect was compared with the footage of the customer who had bought the tools from the hardware store and the police found that several features like height and gait of both the subjects matched. The police then circulated stills of the suspect’s face among their informants, and based on human intelligence, picked up the suspect, identified as Firoz Naeem Ahmed (33) from his Ambernath residence on Tuesday. “We found stolen cell phones and tablets worth ₹10 lakh from Ahmed’s possession, after which we placed him under arrest on Tuesday night. After further interrogation, we also recovered a laptop computer, an iPad, a tablet and three cell phones that he had sold to an electronics dealer, which we suspect he had stolen from some other establishment. Inquiries into this aspect are under way,” the officer said.Ahmed has been remanded in police custody till October 9, the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ambernath-police-arrest-burglar-based-on-tools-left-behind-at-crime-scene-101633619704056.html

The BSP delegation assured family members of all assistance in the fight for justice and other legal matters. The BSP and party chief Mayawati is standing with the farmers in the period of crisis, SC Mishra said.Expressing concern over the failure of the local police in arresting the accused name in the case Mishra alleged big leaders in the central and state government were involved in the case. The BJP is trying to save the accused, he said.Demanding removal of Union minister of state (Ajay Mishra Teni) from his post, SC Mishra said the district unit of the BSP will remain in contact with the family members of the deceased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-bsp-delegation-meets-victims-family-members-101633618745115.html
07-10-2021||Pune||Sharad Pawar says IT searches excessive use of power||PUNE: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar reacted strongly to the IT searches at premises linked to Ajit Pawar and kin saying the action smells of excessive use of power and could have possibly been a reaction to his strong position on the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, which he had likened to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. Speaking to reporters at his hometown Baramati on Thursday, Pawar said, “The way farmers were killed at Lakhimpur Kheri, everyone strongly condemned the incident. Even I spoke about it strongly and likened the incident with Jallianwala Bagh massacre. It has angered those in power and the ongoing developments may have been a result of this.” The NCP chief, who initially desisted from commenting saying the action is still on, also called the searches at his nieces (Ajit Pawar’s sisters) locations as excessive use of power. “I read Ajit Pawar’s statement also. He had said the IT department has powers to carry out operation at his premises, but the searches at residences of relatives (Ajit’s sisters) is an excessive use of power,” Pawar said. Official sources said that searches were conducted till evening across Mumbai, Pune, Satara and a few other cities in Maharashtra and Goa. The premises linked to business groups such as Daund sugar mill, Shivalik and Jarandeshwar Sahakari Sugar Karkhana (Jarandeshwar SSK) and businesses linked to Ajit Pawar’s sisters in Pune and Kolhapur were being searched, they said. Other NCP leaders termed the income tax department’s Thursday searches at premises linked to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and his kin as an attempt to “defame” its leaders. While Virdhawal Jagdale, director at the Daund sugar factory in Pune district, maintained that the mill has complied with all rules while paying taxes. Jagdale, a member of the Pune zilla parishad from NCP, did not deny his association with Ajit Pawar saying that his father was a legislator and that he himself is a NCP leader in the zilla parishad. “The income tax officials arrived around 7am at our factory, which has been in operation for the past 13 years. All through, we have paid taxes and complied with norms. As far as the searches are concerned, I do not know why they are being carried out but we will cooperate with the income tax officials,” Jagdale said. Following the income tax department raids on some businesses linked to members of Ajit Pawar’s family and to real estate developers for alleged tax evasion, Maharashtra NCP president and state cabinet minister Jayant Patil blamed the Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) for trying to defame NCP leaders. Patil told reporters in Pune, “I have been saying for a long time that no sooner BJP leaders take our leaders’ names, actions by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), income tax department and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) follow. There is no doubt that it is a BJP conspiracy to defame our leaders.” Patil wondered aloud why the BJP is ‘so afraid’ of the NCP, which shares power with the Shiv Sena and Congress in Maharashtra. Ajit Pawar, who is also the state finance minister, said in Mumbai on Thursday that some entities linked to him have been raided. He said that while he has no problem with the income tax department raiding companies linked to him, he is upset that his three sisters were dragged into this. Jarandeshwar SSK was in the news recently after the ED in July attached over Rs65 crore worth of land, buildings, plant and machinery of the sugar mill at Chimangaon-Koregaon in Satara under the anti-money laundering law. The ED claimed that the cooperative-run sugar mill is linked to Ajit Pawar and his family. On Wednesday, BJP leader and former Member of Parliament (MP) Kirit Somaiya visited Jarandeshwar SSK in Satara and Baramati town in Pune, from where Ajit Pawar is an member of legislative assembly (MLA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ncp-terms-i-t-raids-as-bjp-s-attempt-to-defame-its-leaders-101633618563625.html

During this time, they used the money received from new investors to pay the old ones, EOW officials said.Finally, when they were unable to pay profits or return the base amount of ₹7.99Cr paid to them by 13 investors, an FIR was registered against them with the Kolsewadi police station in Kalyan. The couple was booked for cheating and criminal breach of trust under the Indian Penal Code, along with relevant sections of the Maharashtra Protection of Interests of Depositors (MPID) Act, and the case was subsequently transferred to the EOW for further inquiries.The invoking of the MPID Act is significant because it empowers the investigating agency to attach assets of the accused to reimburse the victims of financial crimes.“After completion of preliminary inquiries, Nair was placed under arrest on Tuesday evening. Inquiries are still under way against his wife. We appeal to any other customers or investors who might have been cheated by the accused to approach us immediately and register a complaint,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (EOW), Sunil Lokhande, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/economic-offences-wing-of-thane-crime-branch-arrest-jeweller-for-running-ponzi-scheme-cheating-customers-101633618323498.html

The compressed natural gas (CNG) prices have remained stable at Rs59.50 per kg.On May 31, petrol prices had breached the mark of Rs100. After four months, diesel prices have also followed this trend. As the Covid induced curbs have been eased, the goods and passenger transport has gone up. Transport associations had been demanding government intervention in the diesel price control but no relief was given.All the transport associations in the state will be attending a meeting in Pune on Saturday (October 9) to discuss several issues related to transporters. Representatives from the associations informed that the topic of increasing transportation rates as the diesel prices are soaring would be one of the key factors in the meeting.“Diesel prices are soaring but the transportation rates haven’t increased in that proportion. Transporters are already in trouble. We have been demanding that diesel should be brought under Goods and Services Tax (GST) to stabilise its price. All the related issues would be discussed in the meeting to be held on Saturday in Pune,” said Baba Shinde, director of the All India motor transport Congress (Maharashtra).“The decision related to the hike in the transportation rate would be taken in the meeting. Diesel prices have been consistently going up and there seems to be no relief. The meeting would be conducted in the Market Yard. Other issues related to the transporters would also be discussed in this meeting,” said Ram Kadam, president of motor goods vehicle association, Pune districtThe hike in fuel prices has made it difficult for the common people to manage their budget.“I have a diesel car and a two-wheeler. But in the light of the soaring fuel prices I have reduced the use of the car as with the additional financial burdens, it is no more viable to use it. When petrol crossed Rs100 I was hoping that something would be done about the fuel prices. But it is disappointing to see that the government does not care. I am afraid soon prices of other goods will also increase,” said Virendra Bhat, a resident of Warje..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/diesel-price-inches-closer-to-rs100-per-litre-mark-in-pune-101633616883544.html
07-10-2021||Mumbai||Sudden showers on 2 days hamper repair work of roads, potholes in Thane||A week after Hindustan Times highlighted the poor condition of some of the major roads in the city, the potholes still remain to be filled. The road repair and pothole filling work that was initiated by various authorities fell flat after heavy downpour in the city on Wednesday night washed away the materials used to fill the craters. Commuters continue to struggle during peak hours due to traffic snarls faced while dodging the potholes.The Public Works Department claims that the Mumbra Bypass Road has been repaired. “We have filled all the potholes on the Bypass Road and this has resulted in smoother traffic on this stretch of road,” said S Totawar, executive engineer, PWD, Thane. On July 29, a five-foot deep crater had formed on the Thane-bound lane of the crucial road with the road under the bridge being visible through it.However, commuters claim that PWD has done shoddy repair work; “They have only filled the potholes with mud and gravel and no efforts have been taken to level the road or asphalt the stretch,” said Ashrita Gupta, a 46-year-old Kalwa resident.Moreover, the National Highway Authority of India, which looks after the Mumbai–Nashik Highway, has started the pothole-filling work from Majiwada to Vartak Nagar. “We have initiated the filling of potholes on this part of the road and will gradually move towards Vadpe. The huge craters at major intersections of the highway have also been filled. Rest of the work is in progress in the small gaps of dry spell that we get to complete the repair work,” said an officer from NHAI. “Filling the potholes itself has been a respite for the commuters. The huge craters have been levelled and traffic jams are fewer on this stretch. However, such efficiency should be displayed all through by the authorities and ensure that potholes don’t recur,” said Yogesh Jhanjhawal, a 34-year-old Kalyan resident.The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) had started with the road repair work but the unexpected heavy showers have hampered the process. “From Tuesday onwards, we had initiated pothole-filling and road-asphalting works. However, the unexpected heavy showers in the evening for two consecutive days have forced us to temporarily stop the asphalting of roads and only continue with filling of potholes. As of now, it would be difficult to predict the time taken to complete the road repair work as the rains continue to disrupt the process,” said Arjun Ahire, deputy city engineer, TMC.Although the traffic along Ghodbunder Road has seen some respite, the condition of potholes continues to be the same. Efforts were taken to fill the potholes. However, heavy rains caused the potholes to reappear. Commuters face traffic snarls during peak hours while the MMRDA claims that it’s awaiting a dry spell to repair the roads. SVR Srinivas, commissioner, MMRDA, said, “We have already initiated pothole-filling and road repair work. However, as there has not been a continuous dry spell, we are not able to complete the work and the repaired roads have not dried properly leading to only temporary relief for motorists.”Meanwhile, the TMC has imposed a fine of ₹10 lakh against a city-based contractor for substandard road work. “It is the responsibility of the concerned contractor to ensure that the roads are motorable. Making temporary repairs is part of the work order, but a large number of potholes were observed on the roads and this inconvenienced many commuters. A time period of three days was given to the contractor to submit the reasons for the lackadaisical work. As no response was received, the contractor was fined,” said an official from TMC.Two weeks ago, four civic engineers were suspended by the TMC commissioner for the poor state of roads in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sudden-showers-on-2-days-hamper-repair-work-of-roads-potholes-in-thane-101633616467939.html

He suggested PM Modi replace the father of the nation’s picture in these high-value currency notes with that of his iconic spectacles.“It is my suggestion that a picture of Gandhi's spectacles can be used on ₹500 and ₹2,000 currency notes. Ashok Chakra can also work effectively for this purpose,” the Sangod MLA Bharat Singh wrote in his letter to PM Modi, according to news agency PTI.“Mahatma Gandhi symbolises truth and Gandhi's picture is printed on ₹500 and ₹2,000 notes, which are generally used in practices of corruption and in exchange for bribes. The high-value currency notes are being used in bars which are a disgrace to ‘Mahatma Gandhi’,” he said.“Gandhi's portrait should be removed from ₹500 and ₹2,000 currency notes and it should be used only on small currency notes which are used by the poor,” he further added.The Sangod lawmaker drew attention to the rise in cases of corruption in the nation as well as in his state Rajasthan. He highlighted that a total of 616 graft cases were registered between January 2019 and December 31, 2020, with an average of two cases registered per day.

07-10-2021||Mumbai||‘Spiderman’ thief caught in Kharghar police web||The Kharghar police, along with Unit III of Navi Mumbai Crime Branch, have arrested the wanted ‘Spiderman’ thief as the police referred to him, for stealing valuables from flats in high rises at night by climbing the pipelines and sometimes by going from ducts of the building.Senior police inspector, Sandeepan Shinde of Kharghar police station, said, “The accused, Saif Isa Shaikh, 19, a resident of Mumbra and a lean structured man, is a pro at climbing the pipelines and entering the ducts of buildings, getting inside the flats and doing away with valuables without making a sound. Sometimes, it would be just a mobile phone.”The police also arrested three of his partners identified as Siraj Naem Shah, 21, Shoeb Waris Qureshi, 18, and Mohammad Umar Mohammad Yusuf Shaikh, 43, all residents of Govandi. Qureshi owned a motor bike and rode it with Shah and Saif sitting behind him. The role of Shah was to keep a watch while Saif would go climbing on the building while Qureshi would wait on his bike. After the theft, the stolen valuables were taken to Umar, who is a pro at dismantling any mobile phone in minutes and then selling off the spare parts separately.“The phones were dismantled so as to make the stolen phone untraceable,” Shinde said.After a few such house breaks, during investigation, police had found CCTV footage of the three accused from various locations, while Umar was arrested based on the statement of the three.“Using the footage and data dump of the accused, the trio was nabbed from Govandi,” senior police inspector, Shatrughn Mali from Unit III, Crime Branch, said.While in police custody, two of the four accused were found to be Covid positive and hence they were shifted to a hospital and other two to Taloja jail.“As of now, we have solved seven house break cases wherein they were involved. After the duo recovers, we would take them into police custody to investigate further,” Shinde added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/spiderman-thief-caught-in-kharghar-police-web-101633615683351.html
07-10-2021||Pune||PMPML undertakes survey of Pune-Lonavla route||As only Covid-19 vaccinated people are allowed in the local train between Pune and Lonavla, there is a growing demand from people to start Pune Mahanagar Parivhan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) bus service to the hill station.The people who are fully vaccinated and completed 14 days after taking the second dose of vaccination are allowed to travel in the local trains as per state government order.“There is a demand for buses on the route from people so we have undertaken a survey, after which analysis will be done about how many people require bus service, how many trips will be required and at what all places buses will have to stop before reaching its destination (Lonavla),” said Chetna Kerure, joint managing director, PMPML.In Pune, from the third week of August, local train service started between Pune and Lonavla. The number of trains has increased to six from October 1.“It will benefit people from Lonavla as right now local trains are the preferred option of travelling and we generally see huge crowds taking train service as it is at affordable rates. If PMPML starts buses till Lonavla and if it provides frequent bus services then it will be helpful. Till now PMPML bus comes till Wadgaon, it should be extended to Lonavla,” said Somnath Jadhav, chief executive officer (CEO), Lonavla.On Thursday, PMPML started bus service from Hadapsar to Morgaon which is a distance of around 59km while from Pune railway station Lonavla is approximately 66km.“The duration of taking a second dose after the completion of 84 days and then completing 14 days is making things difficult for commuters who travel from Lonavla every day. With markets and schools opening up, and even many IT companies have started calling employees to the office for back end work, PMPML bus service will be helpful,” said Jagdish Dhole, IT professional.“PMPML is a city service and currently it is serving 7% of the population from the city and if they are thinking of extending it just on the demand of few people then it is a baseless decision. Before taking any call all the other authorities and RTO should get involved to find out whether investing in this route is profitable or not,” said Sanjay Shitole, honorary secretary, PMP Pravasi Manch, a Pune based organisation that looks after commuter’s rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmpml-undertakes-survey-of-pune-lonavla-route-101633615323305.html
07-10-2021||Jaipur||Congress opts for MLA’s spouse for Vallabhnagar bypoll, BJP goes for a new face||JAIPUR: The Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday announced their candidates for bypolls to be held on Vallabhnagar (Udaipur) and Dhariawad (Pratapgarh) assembly seats in Rajasthan later this month.The candidates were named ahead of the Friday deadline to file nominations for the polling scheduled on October 30. The votes will be counted on November 2.The by-polls were necessitated due to the death of Congress MLA from Vallabhnagar Gajendra Singh Shaktawat and BJP MLA from Dhariawad Gautam Lal Meena.The Congress has fielded Shaktawat’s wife Preeti Shaktawat from Vallabhnagar that is expected to witness a triangular fight with three candidates from the Rajput community in the fray; Preeti Shaktawat, Himmat Singh Jhala of the BJP, and former BJP MLA Randheer Singh Bhindar, who is widely expected to contest as an independent.A senior Rajasthan BJP leader said the state unit had also recommended Uday Lal Dangi for the party ticket “but the leadership gave a ticket to Himmat Singh”.The Congress would stand to benefit if Randheer Singh Bhindar files his nomination paper since Bhindar and Himmat Singh Jhala would primarily be targeting the BJP’s support base for votes, the BJP leader said, pointing that it remains to be seen if someone else from Gajendra Singh Shaktawat’s family also files his papers.In Dhariawad, the BJP has opted to give the party ticket to Khet Singh Meen rather than someone from the family of Gautam Lal Meena.The Congress has named Nagraj Meena for the seat though he lost the last two assembly elections to the BJP, which secured more than 50% of the votes polled in the 2018 elections.Political analyst Manish Godha said the Congress has played the sympathy card on the Vallabhnagar seat, while the BJP has fielded two new faces, which could increase the chances of infighting.The two assembly seats are in the Udaipur division, where the Congress did not fare well in the last assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/congress-opts-for-mla-s-spouse-for-vallabhnagar-bypoll-bjp-goes-for-a-new-face-101633615143383.html

07-10-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Pollution body officials take note of crop residue burning near Dasna||Instances of crop residue burning have started surfacing even as the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) initiated works as part of its winter action plan to combat increasing air pollution ahead of the winter season. On Thursday afternoon, HT found crop residue burning in agricultural fields near Dasna and brought the matter to the attention of UPPCB officials. Instances of crop residue burning in neighbouring states deteriorate the air quality in the National Capital Region (NCR). “We have taken cognisance of the information and we will ask officials to visit the field and survey the area near Dasna. Crop residue burning is not allowed; we have informed the officials of the local administration and the agriculture department to check for such instance,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of the UPPCB. “Under the action plan, the gram samitis and the tehsildars have also been directed to keep an eye on such activities in their respective areas. Last year, there were several instances of stubble burning in Dasna area; local farmers were also taken on board to dissuade them from the activity,” added Sharma. According to the official statistics of the Consortium for Research on Agroecosystem Monitoring and Modelling from Space (CREAMS) Laboratory of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, there were 101 instances of crop residue burning in Uttar Pradesh between September 15 to October 6 last year while 52 such cases have been reported in the corresponding period this year. The CREAMS statistics also said there was only one incident of stubble burning in Ghaziabad during the same period last year while no such cases have been reported this year. “There should be more awareness among farmers; Those indulging in agriculture-related activities need to stop burning crop residue. Moreover, farmers should be incentivised and arrangements should be made to provide them equipment to deal with crop residue. It is with better monitoring and awareness that such activities can be reduced,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist. In the winter action plan, the different departments have been directed to conduct awareness programmes among farmers while involving village panchayats; to explore the possibility of installation of biomass power project or bio manure and enhance vigilance at sources of stubble burning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-pollution-body-officials-take-note-of-crop-residue-burning-near-dasna-101633614483387.html
07-10-2021||Chandigarh||Kashmiri namda artisan Arifa Jan took the road less travelled to much applause||It was not for Arifa Jan to take the beaten path and try for a government job. Instead, she defied her parents and risked it all to become an art-and-craft entrepreneur, and that too one specialising in the dying craft of weaving namda – a rug made of felted wool. Jan was drawn towards the traditional craft, which is in dire need of revival, while she was studying at the Craft Development Institute (CDI). While she felt she had found her calling, convincing her family of the same was an arduous task. “Soon after passing out from CDI, I decided to set up a stall in New Delhi. However, my parents were against it as they wanted me to strive for a government job. They only let me go when I told them that the exercise will fetch me a job.” “Even my relatives were skeptical as there were no entrepreneurs in our family. My father is a government employee, and mother a homemaker. It was only after I won several awards and a trip to the United States under the Women Entrepreneurship Exchange Programme did my family accept that I had made the right decision,” says the 30-year-old, who has a year-old child. Her husband is also an artisan and deals in Pashmina. Jan, who is a commerce graduate, went on to sell her products in different countries and now works with 20 artisans across the city. Arifa says her art gave her the opportunity to travel far and wide, to the United States and Kyrgyzstan, where she received a lot of appreciation. In 2020, Jan was awarded the Nari Shakti Purskar, which was presented to her by the President of India, Ram Nath Kovind. She also bagged a state award in 2018 and was also nominated as the chairperson of the women’s wing of Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industries (KCCI).She has set up a couple of centres, where she keeps products ready for delivery. However, the lockdown imposed after revocation of Article 370 and the pandemic, she lost several business opportunities. “The government has pledged to help entrepreneurs, but we are facing a lot of impediments on ground. I wanted to setup my own factory but officials are not cooperative. However, I am hopeful that one day she will have all the machines needed to assemble the final product under one roof. It needs a lot of investment, but I am not one to back down from a challenge.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kashmiri-namda-artisan-arifa-jan-took-the-road-less-travelled-to-much-applause-101633612503855.html

While the average testing was 7,810 this week, it was 6,956 last week.“The main reason behind the cases going down is the vaccination coverage that we have achieved. Almost 50% of the people have been jabbed with both the doses and 97% with their first dose. Besides, herd immunity, too, is an important factor that plays a role in bringing down the cases. Even as the cases are down now, the people should continue to maintain the Covid protocols and continue wearing masks.

07-10-2021||Mumbai||Repair of potholes in Kalyan, Dombivli halted due to sudden rain||The road repair works undertaken on some of the major roads in Kalyan and Dombivli earlier this week came to a standstill on Thursday due to the unexpected downpour. Most of the roads in the twin cities still had huge craters, making it difficult for the commuters. However, following the report in Hindustan Times, the Public Works Department (PWD), has done the patch work at the Gandhare Kalyan (W)-Padgha Link Road earlier this week. This road was in a bad shape till last week with huge potholes.A PWD officer said, “A pothole-filling patch work has been carried out at the Gandhare-Padgha Road when there was no rain. Now that it has started raining again, we will have to wait and see if the work done is washed away. The necessary work will be carried out by our staff.”However, the potholes on the road that connects the Durgadi Bridge and Govindwadi Bypass Road in Kalyan (W) are yet to be repaired.“We had begun the repair work earlier this week as there was no rain. However, unfortunately it started raining again on Wednesday evening. So, we had to halt the work. Now, since it is expected that the rain will continue this week, we will only start the work once it stops raining,” said Sapna Koli, city engineer, KDMC.As per the KDMC the actual repair work that includes asphalting of the roads would begin after October 15, once the rain stops, and is expected to be finished in a month.On Wednesday, the work of the vital Pune Link Road in Kalyan (E) was undertaken by the civic body. However, the work has stopped now due to rain.“This stretch has both concrete and asphalt portions. The asphalt stretch develops potholes every year. We fail to understand why the civic body is not able to concretise the entire stretch,” said Sagar Munde, a 48-year-old motorist who takes the road to connect to Dombivli for work. This vital link helps one to connect from Kalyan city to Dombivli, Ulhasnagar, Ambernath and Navi Mumbai.Koli said that owing to lack of funds, the concretisation of such major roads or the re-asphalting could not be undertaken.“The intensity of rain this time was so high that most of the roads were affected and potholes were developed. We had plans to asphalt the road before Ganeshotsav. However, the rainfall did not slow down and hence the work was not initiated. Our team, however, kept a watch on road conditions and filled the potholes throughout the festival,” said Koli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/repair-of-potholes-in-kalyan-dombivli-halted-due-to-sudden-rain-101633608128467.html

The girl, along with her two male friends, was handed over to a team from the Delhi Police on Wednesday.According to the Kalyan Government Railway Police (GRP), the 15-year-old girl, along with her two friends, both in their early 20s, was travelling on board the Delhi Hazrat Nizamuddin-Mumbai Central Express on Monday. The train was nearing Kalyan when the TC approached the trio and asked for their tickets. While they had tickets, they seemed scared and the TC smelled a rat. He asked them where they were coming from, where they were going to and the purpose of their visit to Mumbai. When the trio could not answer even simple questions such as these, he called up the GRP.“We sent a team to take the trio into our custody when the train reached Kalyan. After some questioning, the trio finally admitted that they had run away from home and gave us their addresses. We called up the Delhi Police and found that a kidnapping case had been registered after the girl had gone missing. We apprised the Delhi Police of the fact that we had the girl in our custody,” senior police inspector Valmik Shardul, Kalyan GRP said. He added that the girl was in a relationship with one of the two boys accompanying her and they had eloped with the intention of getting married in Mumbai.

07-10-2021||Pune||Taste of Life: Satyagraha’s spice factor gave this revolution a ‘united’ flavour||Food is a great unifier. While it is utilised to bring solace to each other and is recognised as a form of comfort, it is also used as a form of resistance.On April 30, 1938, a letter appeared on page four of the newspaper “Jnanaprakash”. The author had used a pseudonym. “Since last few months, clove has been unavailable in the markets of Pune and elsewhere. It is an important ingredient of daily cooking, and depriving people of the spice for political reasons is highly condemnable. I have noticed that members of the Congress party have been threatening merchants to stop selling cloves because of the ongoing Satyagraha. But their Satyagraha is being a menace to the common public, not to mention it is depriving poor dock workers and coolies of their livelihood. I urge all the merchants to procure cloves from Ceylon, if not from Zanzibar, and start selling it immediately”, the letter read.A week earlier, on April 24, 1 938, a small procession in Shukrawar peth in the morning hours had grabbed everybody’s attention. The participants were Congress workers who were visiting every shop selling spices to urge them to stop selling cloves. Most of the merchants had already stopped selling the spice. A few who had some stock in their shops handed it over to the Congress members.This exercise was a part of the Satyagraha, passive resistance, to protect the rights of Indian clove traders in Zanzibar.In the little Sultanate of Zanzibar off the east coast of Africa, there lived 180,000 natives who spoke Swahili, 33,000 Arabs, 15,000 Indians, and 278 Europeans. The Sultan of Zanzibar, His Highness Seyyid Sir Khalifa bin Harub always sought advice from an English Resident on complicated commercial matters. Zanzibar in 1937 provided 80% of the world’s supply of cloves; India, in turn, consumed 50% of Zanzibar’s output.Most of Zanzibar’s Indians used to be in the clove business. As they prospered, they became moneylenders to the natives. Some of them, it was wrongly alleged, usurped lands from the natives when they could not repay the loans. To counter the growing influence of the Indians in Zanzibar, and to repay the Resident, the Sultan, on the advice of the Resident, set up a Clove Growers’ Association. The association’s powers were great: it had an export monopoly and it set its own price; Indians had to pay $750 to the association for annual licences.The colonial offices of the British Government served the threefold purpose of perpetuating the political rule of the British over the colonies, of enriching the British monopolist at the expense of the Indian small trader, and of running colonial administrations with India’s property. The Clove Decree of the Zanzibar Government was such a law designed to further Britain’s economic interests. Under this law, the purchase of cloves from growers in distant areas became a monopoly of the Clove Growers’ Association. Despite its name, the Association was not formed of the growers of clove, but consisted of an advisory body of six or more Englishmen appointed by the Government.The Zanzibar Clove Bill came into operation on August 1, 1 937. As a measure of retaliation, Indian dealers and exporters of clove decided to resort to passive resistance. No Indian was to apply for buying the licence as an agent of the Clove Growers’ Association. No Indian was to engage in the export trade. No Indian was to serve on the advisory board of the Clove Growers’ Association. This basically meant that the Indian population in Zanzibar would go hungry.They expected the Government of India to impose an embargo on the import of cloves from Zanzibar. In their determination to resist the Clove Act, the Zanzibar Indians appealed to the Provincial Governments and Municipalities to assist in the embargo on cloves.They also wrote to Mahatma Gandhi, who extended his support to the cause. A Clove Boycott Committee was created under the leadership of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. The Congress Working Committee met in Wardha in August 1 937 and passed a resolution assuring the Indian clove dealers in Zanzibar of its sympathy in their plight and extending its support in the “heroic struggle” they had then decided to launch upon.The Clove Boycott Committee then declared a complete boycott of foreign cloves. The stringent boycott of imports found resounding support from dock workers who refused to unload ships carrying those cloves. There was extensive picketing at the docks by Congress volunteers to dissuade other workers employed by the merchants to carry on the work.Various merchant associations in Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras had also started an unofficial embargo of Zanzibar cloves on the principle that “any attempt to injure Indian interests for the advancement of British Imperialism” ought to be strongly opposed.On March 6, 1938, Subhash Chandra Bose, appealed to the dealers in clove, both wholesale and retail, to hand over to the Congress Committees, any stock of cloves they might still be possessing. The appeal was a part of a lengthy statement on the boycott of Zanzibar cloves.Bose repeated his appeal when he visited Pune in May, 1 938. Jawaharlal Nehru, too, during his visit to Pune in the same month, appealed to merchants of Pune, not to sell cloves and succumb to the “divisive agenda”.Both Bose and Nehru praised common Indians for supporting the Satyagraha. Clove was an important ingredient of Indian cooking.The boycott of the Zanzibar clove inspired many to carry out similar boycotts. The organisation of Kirana Merchants of Cawnpore called for a complete boycott of the importation of dry fruits in India from Afghanistan. They were opposing the policy stated to be adopted by the Afghan Government who, it was alleged, was creating a monopoly for export of dry fruits from the country by having established the “Sharrkatisamar” (Afghan Dry Fruits Co.) with a state subsidy. The export of dry fruits in India had till then been handled mainly by Indians. Hejib and sons, the most prominent dealer of dry fruits in Pune then, declared in “Jnanaprakash” that he would support the boycott. A similar boycott was called against the import of foreign salt. Merchants from Pune participated for around four months. The clove Satyagraha succeeded, albeit partially. The Clove Growers’ Association was disbanded, and the English monopoly over the clove trade was reduced to half. Meanwhile, the boycott continued everywhere till new shipments arrived in Bombay.The Satyagraha effectively demonstrated that eating and cooking were two of the oldest and most powerful tools for revolution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/taste-of-life-satyagraha-s-spice-factor-gave-this-revolution-a-united-flavour-101633604103678.html

The Dum Dum Park Bharat Chakra Puja Committee unveiled their innovative pandal on Mahalaya, highlighting farm law agitation as well as Sunday’s Lakhimpur Kheri massacre.A giant replica of a tractor being used by farmers to till land is placed at the entrance of the Dumdum Park Bharat Chakra pandal, depicting their struggle. The tractor has two wings attached symbolising freedom from bondage labour.Artist Anirban Das, who conceptualised the theme, told news agency PTI that the names of farmers who died in the course of the agitation have been written in chits of paper on the giant tractor.As you walk in, the sidewalks are adorned by the sketch of a car and a farmer lying on its path, accompanied by a line in Bengali -- "motorgari uray dhulo niche pore chashigulo", which translates to ‘the car leaves behind a swirl of dust while farmers fall under its wheels’.Hundreds of sandals lie on the ground of the pandal, symbolising the scenes from protest in which they face police action. "From the days of Tebhaga movement to recent ones, the pandal showcases several farmers' protests. Shoes in the pandal symbolise people who've been struggling in these movements for ages," the organiser was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.A number of posters have been placed all across the pandal with slogans in English and Bengali. One of the posters read, "We are farmers, not terrorists, farmers are food soldiers", while another read “stand with Lakhimpur Kheri”. The main pandal is decorated with replicas of paddy, hanging from the roof.The puja committee's secretary Pratik Choudhury said they wanted to highlight the exploitation of farmers. “We have sought to narrate the story of the farmers who provide the food to us," he said."The recent incident in Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri, where four farmers were knocked down by a vehicle and killed during a protest, happened when our pandal was almost ready. But, we incorporated it," Choudhury added.However, this is not the first time a Durga Puja pandal in Kolkata has depicted the current socio-economic and political issues. Last year, the Barisha Club in south Kolkata built its pandal on the crisis faced by the migrant workers amid the nationwide lockdown.This year, Navratri will be observed from October 7 till October 15. Durga Puja, which is celebrated from 'Sashthi' (sixth day of Navratri) is on October 11 while Dashami falls on October 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/durga-puja-pandal-in-kolkata-showcases-lakhimpur-kheri-violence-farmers-protest-101633600016354.html

The court, however, cautioned that only 45-60 people will be allowed for the rituals in big pandals and 10-15 people will be allowed in smaller ones.The court has imposed a ban on entry of visitors to Durga Puja pandals this year, too, stating that all restrictions imposed last year will remain in force this time around.“This means the ban on the entry of visitors inside the Durga Puja pandals remains. The court had mandated putting up barricades outside the pandals while putting a cap on the number of puja committee members who can enter a pandal,” Sabyasachi Chatterjee, an advocate, told Hindustan Times.Advocate general Soumendra Nath Mookherjee informed that the West Bengal government has no objection to the court’s order banning visitors. The state government released its own set of guidelines, banning cultural events at or near puja pandals.The advisory also urged organisers to ensure that prasad distribution, pushpanjali, and sindoor khela are held in a planned manner, in small groups, with staggered entry and exit timings to ensure social distancing measures are complied with. Organisers have also been urged to ask devotees to bring flowers from home for pushpanjali so crowding can be avoided."This year Puja is being organised and celebrated in the middle of this unprecedented pandemic. This demands proper and adequate health safety measures for the citizens. Puja Committees must ensure the health and safety norms for themselves and for the participants and visitors," read the advisory issued by the West Bengal government.The five day festival, the biggest one in West Bengal, is slated to start from October 11. Centre has already cautioned states to take appropriate measures during the festive season to ensure Covid-19 cases do not go up after the festivities end. Bengal has recorded a total of 18,848 Covid-19 cases till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/calcutta-high-court-relaxes-some-durga-puja-restrictions-for-vaccinated-individuals-101633600096736.html

07-10-2021||Kolkata||‘Duare Nodi’? Durga Puja ‘tarpan’ offered on waterlogged streets in Bengal's Ghatal||In videos that went viral on social media on Wednesday, a resident of Ghatal locality in West Bengal's West Medinipur district was seen offering ‘tarpan’ on the auspicious occasion of Mahalaya on waterlogged streets near his home, which resembled a river. The customary ‘tarpan’ is a ritual held on Mahalaya, at the onset of Durga Puja festivities, when lakhs of people each year pay their obeisance to their forefathers marking the end of ‘Pitri Pakshya’ on the banks of the river Hooghly or other rivers and water bodies – the latest addition to these being waterlogged streets.Arup Bera – a resident of Ward 2 of the Ghatal municipality area – was seen on Wednesday traversing the flooded streets near his home only to offer ‘tarpan’ on murky waters which were reminiscent of the Bhagirathi-Hooghly riverine system, where lakhs of people observed the same ritual earlier that day.According to reports, the residents of Ghatal usually offer their ‘tarpan’ every year on the Shilabati river (also known as ‘Shilai’), which flows through the districts of Bankura and West Medinipur in West Bengal. However, the region was flooded due to heavy rains this year, which kept the busy town squares entirely waterlogged. Streets across as many as 14 of the 17 municipal wards in Ghatal reportedly remain under water.Also Read | Mahalaya: Birendra Krishna Bhadra heralds the arrival of Durga Puja; here's why an age-old tradition still inspires hopeMahalaya marks the end of ‘Pitri Pakshya’, or the 16-day lunar day period when Hindus pay homage to their ancestors (Pitrs) by offering food, money, and other gifts as a sign of reverence. Although it holds a special significance in the age-old cultural tradition of West Bengal ahead of Durga Puja, the day was solemn under the shadow of a doubt this year.On the one hand, the heavy rainfall across the state in recent days left multiple districts – including East and West Medinipur, and wide swathes of land in Howrah and Hooghly – waterlogged; on the other, the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has virtually ensured that muted celebrations take place throughout the festive season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/duare-nodi-durga-puja-tarpan-offered-on-waterlogged-streets-in-bengal-s-ghatal-101633503329632.html

The accused, Mahavir Kumar, attended online classes, joined the school’s WhatsApp groups, and also allegedly shared morphed photographs of the students on social media.A two-month-long police investigation led to the arrest of Kumar, who is from Patna and pursuing a B Tech at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur or IIT Kharagpur. He alleged spoofed phone numbers of the students and regularly spoke to their teachers. Kumar is accused of harassing over 50 girls and their teachers by creating fake profiles on Instagram. Kumar joined WhatsApp groups and allegedly circulated obscene photographs of the students.Deputy police commissioner (north) Sagar Singh Kalsi said they received a complaint from the school principal on August 6 about the alleged activities of the cyber-stalker. “The man was stalking minor girls and also called teachers from different international numbers. The stalker was also spoofing numbers and calling teachers from the numbers of the students.

07-10-2021||Chandigarh||Alma mater always matters a lot, whether you’re in or out||Our educational journey begins as toddlers with tears in the eyes and pain in the heart against the wish to attend school. Years later, on leaving school as teenagers, our hearts go through the same tear-jerking feeling ironically for starkly different reasons. Built of cherry-red bricks, our school’s building was nestled in a beautiful nondescript town, Talwara, hemmed in by the undulating ridges of the Solah Singhi Dhar. The lush surroundings and manicured lawns offered a pleasing spectacle round the year. The security guard opened the gate only after learning that an alumnus had come to visit his alma mater after ages. Stepping into the campus evoked a sense of déjà vu. Strolling around was akin to walking down memory lane, jammed with a gamut of emotions. The present paled into insignificance for the nostalgic mind was busy spinning its own tales of days gone by. Spending some solitary moments vividly brought about a refreshing world of the past before my mind’s eye. The appearance of the morning assembly ground elicited a broad smile, reminiscent of my queer habit of turning left and right with closed eyes during prayer recitation, corrected by the then class teacher, who light-heartedly called me a fan turning without electricity. Imagining myself as one among the students gathered outside the canteen, the rest seemingly transformed into my old friends sumptuously feasting on yummy bread pakodas and licking tangy chutneys off their fingers. So easy was it for me to visualise many of them smartly dressed in cream shirt and green knickers/skirts, engaged in long-winded conversations, punctuated with giggles. The sight of the water-cooler under the stairs melted my heart into recalling how having played different games, we’d pool its chilled water into our palms before gulping it down to counter the summer blaze. Entering our empty Class 10 classroom unleashed a flood of memories as the eyes went on to picture unforgettable madcap escapades inside the four walls. Our loud and lively laughter, full of life, resonated resoundingly in the room. Standing on the ramparts, I got hallucinations as if the exams were going on! Only after exchanging three golden words, Best of luck, would we step into the hall. After the exam, ambivalent expressions would scan the faces of students who pumped their fists into the air for ticking a right answer by chance or getting disappointed for giving the wrong answer to a simple question. The staff room transformed into a temple where our deities assembled to take periodic breaks. Not only did our teachers slap us on the face to discourage our wrongdoings, but they also gave congratulatory slaps on our backs to encourage our good deeds. The silence of the corridor threw back loud echoes of the rapid staccato of our running boots on the polished floors against the rising toll of the stone bell calling it a day. Having stopped by the woods on a summer afternoon, I willy-nilly stepped out of the gate with a heavy heart in total variance with my inner childish wish to stay there a little longer. It was too moving to reflect within that none of the peers had stood the sweeping vagaries of time. What trailed behind would just be tales; some told, many untold. Soul-stirring and elevating, my stopover boldly underlined that a student might leave his/her alma mater, but the alma mater never leaves the student, rather it stays in the heart forever as indelible and priceless memories. unsharma3116@gmail.com The writer is an Una-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/alma-mater-always-matters-a-lot-whether-you-re-in-or-out-101633592342084.html

07-10-2021||Delhi||#Dussehra2021: Ravana effigies lose height, grandeur in Covid times||Gone are the days when Delhiites would get to witness giant Ravana effigies — with some as tall as 125ft — being burnt on Dussehra. Though the city is coming back to life, with the lowest number of Covid-19 cases in months, strict precautions are still in place to avoid the third wave of pandemic. With restrictions on social gatherings, Ravana effigy makers at Titarpur village are witnessing a lull in bookings. Situated between Subhash Nagar and Tagore Garden, the stretch is known to be one of the biggest markets to buy effigies of Ravana, Meghnad and Kumbhakaran.“Jo kaam pehle hota tha, usse toh aadhe se bhi kam hai! Ab woh bade-bade Ravana toh ban nahin rahe, sab chote he le rahe, 5-15-20ft ke... Humne price badha diya hai. Pichle saal 5ft ka ₹1,000 ka mil raha tha aur is saal hum ₹2,000 ka bech rahe. Jis material se banta hai woh bhi toh mehenga ho gaya hai,” says Sonu from Sonu Ravanwala, who’s prepping for Dussehra, which will be celebrated on October 15 this year. The stretch that’d usually be full of effigy makers during this time of the year, now only has a handful of them. Even these few are not doing much business. “Hum pehle at least 90-100 Ravana banate they, ab hum sirf 25-30 bana rahe, woh bhi 5ft ke. Kya karein zyada bana ke, sale hi nahin hogi,” says Vicky Mahapatra from Amit Yadav Rawanwala.In fact, some craftsmen are making these effigies only on pre-orders. “Hum toh bana hi nahin rahe the. Par phir 10-11 logon ke calls aaye, toh humne shuru kiya. Ab din raat kaam kar rahe hai taaki time pe ho jaye,” says Satpal from Satpal Ravanwala.While the sale, storage and use of firecrackers is banned in Delhi, effigy makers say this isn’t a problem for small size effigies. “Chote Ravana toh paper aur bhusa laga kar jal jaate hai,” says Mahapatra, adding, “Is baar humne new designs bhi add kiye hain. Snake wale mukut aur seeng wale Ravana taaki logon ko kuch different lage.”Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dussehra2021-ravana-effigies-lose-height-grandeur-in-covid-times-101633589721465.html
07-10-2021||Kolkata||In Kolkata, Durga idol draped in gold saree worth ₹1.5 lakh||With the onset of Navratri, Kolkata has been illuminated with elaborate pandals and intricately decorated idols of Goddess Durga. The festival, during which Durga Puja is also held, is especially glamorous in West Bengal's capital city where people come up with new themes for pandals every year, which are unique and innovative in their own way.This year, Durga idols were seen shimmering in gold at a pandal by Bandhu Mahal Club in Baguiati, in which one idol has been installed with eyes of 10-11 grams of gold, while another idol has been draped in a saree embroidered with 6 grams of gold."The saree has about 6 grams gold and the eyes of the Durga idol have 10-11 grams of gold.

The BJP MP further noted that the local administration did not have any locus standi to decide what and how much of the Puja was to be done. "I spoke to Chief Commissioner, BBMP & asked him to revisit Durga Pooja rules which are discriminatory, arbitrary & illogical.

Earlier this month, he also held a meeting with RSS workers and state-level functionaries in Muzaffarpur.Book’s writer Dr Sanjiv Kumar says it talks about the development of Patna in the last 50-60 years, but particularly analyses the reports published in the Hindustan Times (Patna) from 2004 to 2014 concerning issues confronting the masses, viz. power scenario, tap water supply situation, solid waste management and other civic issues, apparently to trace the changes during the NDA rule.Another senior RSS functionary Ramlal--known for his organisational skills and service as the general secretary of the BJP (organisation) for the longest period-- was in Patna since the beginning of this month. Both Ramlal and Hosabale left Wednesday evening for Ranchi and Delhi respectively. Ramlal is the incharge of the RSS publicity and communication wing since 2019.Also Read: Nitish Kumar confident NDA will win both bypoll seats in Bihar; voting on Oct 30“These are all routine visits in connection with the organisational work.

The two gunmen, Rahul Tyagi and Jagdeep alias Jagga, were shot dead by the police team just seconds after they shot at Gogi killing him on the spot.The crime branch is probing Gogi’s murder that capped a decade-long rivalry between him and Tajpuriya. Until his arrest in March 2020, Gogi, a resident of Alipur in outer Delhi, had at least 19 criminal cases, and topped the list of Delhi police’s most wanted men.Police said they are also probing jailed gangster Neeraj Bawana’s role in the case, even as they are yet to find any substantial evidence against him.“Naveen Bali is a key member of Neeraj Bawana’s gang. We are yet to find evidence on Bawana’s role apart from the fact that Bali brought one of the hired killers. The killer posed as a lawyer and entered the court that morning according to the plan,” said a crime branch officer.The officer added that Tillu Tajpuriya and Bali have confessed that joined hands to eliminate Gogi inside the court.To be sure, the confession of the two men before the police will not be admissible as evidence in court.Meanwhile, as a precaution to prevent gang wars in the prison, the jail authorities on Saturday transferred Bali’s brother Rahul Kala to another cell within the jail complex.Kala is another key member of the Neeraj Bawana gang, who has been named in several murder cases registered against Bawana.A second crime branch officer, who asked not to be named, said after Bali’s questioning, police will seek custody of another jailed Uttar Pradesh gangster Sunil Rathi. To be sure, Rathi is yet to be arrested or named as an accused in Gogi murder case.Prison officers have transferred Rathi to another jail within the Mandoli complex because of the threat to his life. Rathi, who was once one of the most wanted men in Uttar Pradesh, murdered gangster Munna Bajrangi inside the Baghpat jail on July 9, 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gangsters-tillu-and-naveen-bali-arrested-in-gogi-murder-101633561928837.html

How can we then hold the Ramlila when we don’t have the infrastructure ready at the moment,” said Rajesh Khanna, general secretary of the committee, adding that the preparations for the Ramlila took over a month.Ramlila celebrations usually begin on the first day of Navaratri, which falls on Thursday this year.“The Covid situation is under the control right now. We hope that this continues and we are able to hold the Ramlila in a grand manner next year,” he said.Khanna and other committee members said the Ramlila has only been disrupted thrice in recent history. “Last year, the Ramlila could not take place due to the pandemic. This year too, it will not take place. Before this, it did not take place in the period after Partition, in 1947-48. Ours is the oldest Ramlila of the city and it was supported by the Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar. There have been disruptions but hopefully, we will be able to hold the Ramlila from next year as before ,” said Vijay Saarthi, a committee member.Sanjay Bhargava, president of the Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, a traders body, said the Ramlila procession used to be a big highlight during the festival season and drew people from across the city. “Every day around 4pm, the procession would start from Esplanade Road and would end at the Ramlila maidan at Ajmeri Gate. For the entire duration of 9-10 days, residents would come out on the streets to watch the spectacle. There used to be a festive atmosphere for everyone, including residents and vendors,” said Bhargava.He said that the prospects of the Ramlila had dimmed over the past few years, with many residents moving out to different areas. “Pandemic affected the scale of the Ramlila but there are other reasons as well. The charm is gradually fading since people have moved to other areas,” said Bhargava.Meanwhile, other Ramlila committees are also holding muted celebrations this year on account of Covid concerns.Shri Dharmik Lila Committee, which has been organising the Ramlila since 1924, will hold celebrations over a five-day period. “We do not want to aggravate the pandemic situation and so, we will not hold the Ramlila the way we usually do. However, we will hold the Ramlila over a period of five days at the ISKCON Temple,” said Ravi Jain, a functionary of the committee.A Delhi government spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/permits-came-too-late-for-2nd-year-delhi-will-miss-180-year-old-ramlila-101633560498492.html

Among others present during the protest were leader of opposition in MC Devinder Singh Babla, women wing leader Deepa Dubey and Youth wing incharge Manoj Lobana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-protests-against-election-commission-outside-chandigarh-dc-office-101633560659528.html

The toilet scam pertains to the operation and maintenance of 86 public toilets between 2006 and 2014. No need of prosecution sanction of retired officer: CBI CBI had filed a reply to the application moved by Ramesh Chander Diwan, former superintending engineer, seeking discharge from the charges on grounds that prosecution sanction was not taken by competent authority.

07-10-2021||Chandigarh||Process set in motion to make Chandigarh an educational, commercial hub: Adviser||Process to transform Chandigarh Beautiful into an educational, healthcare and commercial hub of the region has been set in motion.New facilities and infrastructure will be created in the city to attract educational, health institutions and opportunities for trade and commerce.Confirming the development, UT adviser Dharam Pal, said, “There are three areas where we are focusing on. Making the city a commercial centre in the region besides converting it into an educational and healthcare hub.” The adviser would review the previously planned project of ‘Edu City’. “I will also visit the area where the Edu City was planned for better assessment of the potential and aspects,” Pal said. “Trading can take place even as firms keep their manufacturing units in neighbouring cities like Panchkula. There is no major scope or intention to expand manufacturing in the city. But the trading and commerce part can be centered here,” he added. The city was earlier considered as the educational hub in the region, but in the past few years, Mohali has slowly emerged as a major alternative with a number of private and public-sector educational institutions of national and international stature attracting students from the region. While City Beautiful leads in premium public health infrastructure such as the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Mohali has seen mushrooming of multiple options in the medical education and healthcare sector.“Mohali is being projected as a destination for health tourism with its many private hospitals. Previous attempts of the Chandigarh administration to expand the health infrastructure in the city has failed to take-off,” said a UT official. The administration is looking to overcome the constraint of availability of land through introduction of a land pooling policy. “Bengaluru-based Indian Institute of Human Settlement has been entrusted with the task of formulating a land aggregation and pooling policy. This is expected to bring forth surplus land for development works,” Pal said.Most of the potential vacant land is locked in different pockets predominantly in villages. A major chunk of this land is facing serious threat of encroachments and illegal constructions. “A village development plan is in works which will allow integration of villages in the sectoral plan of the city. It is a challenging task, but will pave way for better development opportunities,” the UT adviser said. International meet in collaboration with UNDPIn one of the steps to realise these objectives, the UT administration will hold an international-level meet in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to formulate ‘Chandigarh Vision 2050’. The two-day event is planned to be held within this month.“We will bring in international experts in urban planning, transport, civic and municipal issues on a common platform. Intensive brainstorming sessions will be held to gauge how well we are doing, how to meet future challenges and what is the vision for city’s future,” said Pal. The event will be comprising workshops and seminars on six sectors.As per UT officials, this is the first time when administration is planning such endeavours for the city’s future. ‘Chandigarh Master Plan 2031’ was finalised nearly seven years ago, but a little progress has been made in achieving the goals set therein. Issues related to it will also be delved upon during the meet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/process-set-in-motion-to-make-chandigarh-an-educational-commercial-hubadviser-101633559819279.html
07-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Two oxygen generation plants to be inaugurated today||In an effort to augment the medical facilities in the city amid the possibility of the third wave of the Covid pandemic, two pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen generation plants will be inaugurated in Chandigarh on Thursday. One of these plants is among the 35 such units to be virtually inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi under the PM CARES fund across 35 states and union territories.The Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) has already installed two oxygen generation plants on its campus, each with a capacity to generate 1,000 litres of oxygen per minute (LPM). One of these plants will be inaugurated by UT administrator and Punjab governor Banwarilal Purohit and Chandigarh MP Kirron Kher. UT adviser Dharam Pal will also be present on the occasion. Both the plants, however, are already operational. The second plant to be inaugurated is at the Government Multi Specialty Hospital (GMSH) in Sector 16, which is capable of generating 500 LPM. So far, four oxygen generation plants have been set up at Chandigarh’s four government health institutes (including the two plants which will be formally inaugurated on Thursday) with a cumulative capacity to generate 3,600 liters of medical oxygen per minute. Besides, four more oxygen plants are being established at various government hospitals in the UT with the help of donations from non-governmental organisations. Once operational, 2,000 LPM oxygen will be added to the Chandigarh’s in-house generation capacity. During the second wave, the demand for oxygen had suddenly increased with the rise in patient load and the UT administration had to request the Centre to raise its oxygen quota from 20MT to 35MT. “The UT government hospitals are now self-sufficient in generating medical oxygen and we will be able to handle the demand in case of emergency in the third wave. Besides, we are requesting private hospitals of Chandigarh, with the bed capacity of over 50, to set up their own oxygen generation plants so that we do not face any shortage at the time of crisis. We are conducting regular meetings with private hospitals and are helping them to install the plants,” said Yashpal Garg, Chandigarh health secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-two-oxygen-generation-plants-to-be-inaugurated-today-101633559399262.html
07-10-2021||Delhi||Sanitation workers slammed for poor cleanliness in Delhi||The Delhi high court on Wednesday came down heavily on municipal employees, especially safai karamcharis, for not discharging their duty of keeping the city clean and leaving it in a “dismal state of cleanliness”.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh, while hearing a clutch of pleas on the non-payment of salaries and pensions to municipal employees, said the court was not obliged to come to the aid of municipal workers and press for payment of salaries when they were not discharging their functions on the ground.“While on one hand, we are pressing for payment of salaries and pensions, it appears that the municipal employees, especially safai karamcharis, are not discharging their duty. As a result, in the city, there is an increase in cases of dengue; garbage and malba; and broken roads and pavements,” the bench said.“They have to do some work. On the ground, there is nothing. Hundreds of crores (of rupees) is rolled out (as salaries and pensions). This is the dismal state of affairs. What is happening to the city? Where is the sense of responsibility of the petitioners and the municipal corporations? At the end of the day, it is the citizens who are suffering. The city is falling; it can’t go down any further,” the court said.Referring to the cleanliness in Sainik Farms, the court said the area continues to be dirty and shabby.“Not a single piece of plastic has been removed from there. It continues to be just as dirty and shabby... cows are eating all that plastic; they will die,” justice Sanghi said.“We want to make the city world class and there is dirt everywhere,” justice Jasmeet Singh added.Appearing for the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, standing counsel Divya Prakash Pande told the court that the employees go on strike at a drop of the hat and stage protests at the municipal body’s headquarters.The court responded that it would “not exercise its discretionary jurisdiction” if the petitioner employees resort to “unjustified and frivolous strikes”.“You can’t have it both ways. You can’t put a gun to our head.. They will have to take consequences. Enough is enough,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sanitation-workers-slammed-for-poor-cleanliness-in-delhi-101633558984813.html

07-10-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Shekhar’s pre-Blue Line chai||Here’s a persuasive reason to patronise a pavement chai place. The owner is so committed to his stall that he has its name tattooed on his arm. Shekhar Chai is engraved on Shekhar’s right arm, in Hindi.The chai is rich with the invigorating flavour of freshly crushed ginger. It is served in old-fashioned earthen kulhad that lends the chai a sensory taste of the wet earth. There’s yet another compelling reason to make this pavement stall your new friend. Shekhar Chai is located in a part of the Capital where it happens to be older than many of the surrounding landmarks. It stands right under the elevated track of the Blue Line Metro—no subway route was here when the modest establishment came up more than 20 years ago. It lies across the road from Pacific Mall—no mall was here either. It is adjacent to many multi-storeys—not one was here earlier.“This was a jungle of kikar,” gushes Shekhar. In his late 20s now, he started giving a helping hand to his father—Sikander, the stall founder—since his childhood days. This afternoon, Shekhar is alone at the stall. “That area used to be full of pigs,” he says, waving towards the aforementioned mall. By now, a few auto rickshaw drivers have gathered for his chai and the talk settles on the locality’s drastic transformation. The verdict isn’t flattering—too much noise and smog now. Shekhar’s is the only dissenting voice. “I have more customers coming to the stall than ever before.”One of the tea drinkers comments on the high cost of living. That triggers Shekhar to crib about the current price of milk compared to what it was 20 years ago. The now-and-then juxtaposition prompts everyone to get nostalgic about the old days. Amid the babble, the optimistic Shekhar asserts that the old lifestyle choices are staging a comeback. He points to his green-friendly kulhads. They had disappeared from tea shops but are showing up again. “We started to import (sic) them from Pilkhuwa (town) as customers were increasingly asking for kulhad wali chai… people are making a U-turn in search of quality.”The discussion ends with the tea. A new round of group chai later might start another impassioned chat session. The stall is open 24/7, and the stands in front of Metro pillar no. 172.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-shekhar-s-pre-blue-line-chai-101633558485415.html

07-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi police to file FIR, probe allegations against Tihar jail officers||The Delhi Police crime branch will register an FIR to probe allegations of corruption against Tihar jail officers for allegedly helping former Unitech promoters Sanjay Chandra and Ajay Chandra with running a “secret underground office” in south Delhi from inside the prison, officials privy to the development said on Wednesday.The Supreme Court directed Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana to investigate the case. Asthana submitted his inquiry report last week, based on which the top court on Wednesday ordered the suspension of jail officers, and registration of FIR against them.Till late Wednesday night, the crime branch was yet to register an FIR. The prison headquarters was also yet to issue suspension orders of any jail officer. Officials in the crime branch, who asked not to be named, said the FIR is likely to be registered on Thursday after they formally receive a copy of the top court order. Prison officers too said they were yet to receive the copy of the inquiry report, and the names of the officers found guilty.Asthana questioned at least 18 jail officers of different ranks and recorded their statements. It was not immediately known how many officers Asthana has named in his report.“The suspension orders will be issued the moment a copy of the report is made available, and we see the names recommended for action in the report,” one prison officer, who asked not to be named, said.On September 30, HT reported that the police commissioner recorded the statements of at least three jail superintendents, four deputy superintendents and other prison officers as part of the probe. The SC had on August 26 directed the police chief to personally look into the role of prison officials after the Enforcement Directorate(ED) informed the court that jailed Unitech ex-promoters Sanjay Chandra and Ajay Chandra violated prison rules and also ran a “secret underground office” in south Delhi from inside Tihar jail with the help of jail officers.A mid-level jail officer, who asked not to be named, said, “The statement of around 15-18 prison officers were recorded. These prison officials were those who were posted in jail 1 and 7, where the Chandra brothers were lodged. We do not know who has been found guilty in the inquiry. Nobody is speaking a word here. It looks like at least two superintendents and some deputy superintendents will be suspended.”In the last week of September, the jail officers were called to the Delhi Police headquarters and questioned individually by Asthana. After recording their statement, police chief Asthana had also visited the prison complex for an inspection inside jail 7. Asthana and two senior police officers had also reportedly questioned Chandra brothers in two jails of Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-to-file-fir-probe-allegations-against-tihar-jail-officers-101633558260121.html
07-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana MC fails to curb use of plastic bags||With assembly elections scheduled next year, a special drive to impose a complete ban on plastic carry bags in the city has turned out to be a complete failure amid “political interference” in the working of the civic body.Commenced on August 2, the special drive launched on the directions of mayor Balkar Sandhu was conducted for just two days. Now, the MC employees are also showing resistance in continuing the drive suspecting “punishment posting” after MC secretary Jasdev Sekhon was transferred from the city on August 6 allegedly due to political interference.Sekhon was in charge of the 13-member committee formed for imposing the ban and was reportedly transferred from the city after he locked horns with the close aide of a senior Congress leader, who stopped Sekhon from taking action against shopkeepers in the Jawahar Nagar camp area.Though Sekhon was posted back in the city on September 10 after the MC employees’ union raised objections over the same, the drive failed to kick off again.One of the MC officials requesting anonymity said the drive was initiated on August 2 on the directions of the mayor and he assured to defend the employees against the pressure mounted by the plastic industry and politicians. The teams confiscated around 12 quintals of banned bags in two days and issued challans to the tune of ₹2 lakh. However, MC officials are showing resistance to restart the drive suspecting political interference after witnessing what happened with Sekhon. The government also wants to “delay” the action to avoid criticism ahead of the assembly elections. Also, the plastic industry representatives had met the mayor and sought relief during the festive season.The trade and use of plastic carry bags continue at every nook and corner of the city as the MC has failed to impose a ban on plastic carry bags, said the official while adding that the ban could not be imposed till politicians support the MC. Earlier too, drives were initiated but were put to a halt due to “political and plastic industry pressure”.Mayor Sandhu said, “There has been a reshuffle and new IAS/PCS officers have joined the Ludhiana MC. We are working to allocate branches to various officials and a special team will again be constituted for imposing a complete ban on plastic carry bags. There is no political pressure and the ban will be imposed at any cost.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-mc-fails-to-curb-use-of-plastic-bags-101633558379110.html
07-10-2021||Delhi||Suspend Tihar officials for helping Unitech promoters, says top court||The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered the Delhi Police to immediately suspend officials of Tihar Jail and lodge a criminal case against them for helping former Unitech promoters Sanjay Chandra and Ajay Chandra, accused of cheating and diverting money of homebuyers, in carrying out illegal activities from jail.The Chandra brothers, who are presently lodged separately at Mumbai’s Arthur Road Jail and Taloja Central Jail, were removed from the Tihar Jail after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) probing alleged diversion of funds by Unitech found that witnesses in the case were being influenced and proceeds of crime dissipated in order to derail the investigation.On August 26, the Supreme Court directed the Chandra brothers to be shifted to Mumbai and ordered Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana to conduct a thorough probe into the matter.Submitting his report in a sealed cover on September 28, Asthana detailed the role played by jail officials in helping Chandra brothers and exposed chinks existing within the jail administration that needed to be remedied at the earliest.Additional solicitor general (ASG) KM Nataraj took the court through the report, which specifically named the jail officials involved and disclosed the next step of the Delhi Police to lodge a criminal case with the crime branch for the offences of corruption by a public servant under the Prevention of Corruption Act, and for destruction of evidence and criminal conspiracy under Section 201 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code.A bench of Supreme Court justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah said: “We direct a full-fledged criminal investigation against the persons mentioned in the report and also other unknown persons whose identities will be revealed during investigation… In the meantime, we direct that the officials of Tihar Jail found prima facie complicit in course of enquiry be placed under suspension pending further proceedings.”To ensure such incidents do not occur in the future, the court directed the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) to come up with a proposed action plan on 23 points highlighted in Asthana’s report.“We direct the ministry of home affairs to respond to the suggestions contained in the report of commissioner of police so that remedial steps can be taken immediately, in terms of the report and in view of violation of Jail Manual, for enhanced prison management.”The top court gave the Centre four weeks to submit its action plan.The apex court also examined investigation reports submitted by the Serious Fraud investigation Office (SFIO) and ED. Additional solicitor general Madhavi Divan, appearing for ED and SFIO, said: “Some parties are not cooperating with the probe.” She pointed out to the arrest of three people in the case, including Sanjay Chandra’s wife Preeti Chandra and father, 82-year-old Ramesh Chandra, the founder of Unitech.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for Sanjay Chandra, objected to secret reports against him being considered by the court and demanded a copy of the forensic audit report prepared by M/s Grant Thornton to be supplied to him. The bench refused as it said that this report was the basis for ED and SFIO to proceed against the accused that cannot be shared when the investigation was still on. Singh invited the wrath of the court as he accused the judiciary of doing injustice to his clients by not sharing the reports despite Unitech offering 100,000 flats to homebuyers.He disputed the conclusion arrived at by forensic auditors that money was diverted by the company without hearing them once and said the court will have to repent later if allegations are proved wrong during trial. He also questioned the arrest of Chandra’s father and wife by ED when the investigation was pending since 2018.The bench told the senior counsel to mind his words. “There should be some sense of responsibility in addressing the court. Is this the way to argue that you make allegations against the court and say you will have to repent later? Do not remind us of the law of the land. The ED has investigated independent of the Grant Thornton report. So don’t pitch your case too high.”Regarding the fresh arrests by ED, the bench was conscious of its duty not to disclose contents of an ongoing investigation, but rebutted Singh by saying: “There are reasons and reasons to arrest both of them (father and wife). We cannot disclose to you what is in the report, but this much we can say they are not innocent.”Giving further time for ED and SFIO to conduct further probe and file fresh status reports, the bench posted the matter to November. By the next date, the action plan on Tihar Jail by the ministry of home affairs shall also be made available, the bench held.The Chandra brothers are facing prosecution since 2015 in separate cases accusing them of cheating homebuyers of their hard-earned investments in 74 Unitech housing projects.A forensic audit ordered by the Supreme Court in 2018 revealed that the two accused siphoned off ₹1,749 crore to foreign countries which included Cyprus to which an amount of ₹290 crore was traced by auditor Samir Paranjpe, working with Forensic and Investigation Service of M/s Grant Thornton India.The audit report concluded that the Chandra brothers collected more than ₹14,200 crore from nearly 30,000 homebuyers as investment in their 74 projects. It was the claim of Unitech that they spent close to ₹26,000 crore in the projects, beyond what they received from homebuyers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/suspend-tihar-officials-for-helping-unitech-promoters-says-top-court-101633557143964.html
07-10-2021||Chandigarh||Govt should challenge high court order on Saini cases to expedite probe into sacrilege violence: Punjab special public prosecutor||Senior advocate Rajwinder Singh Bains, the newly appointed special public prosecutor in the post-sacrilege violence cases, said the Punjab government should immediately challenge the Punjab and Haryana high court order of September 10 staying probe into criminal cases involving former director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini to ensure speedy justice in the cases.Bains said that Saini’s role is “central point” of the entire episode and it can’t be probed due to the September 10 judgment of the high court.“Circumstances have changed now. The state government has fresh grounds. Former chief minister Amarinder Singh and his media adviser BS Chahal, against whom Saini’s allegations of vendetta were directed at, are not in a position to influence the probe anymore. Therefore, either “quashing or stray order” needs to be secured so that SIT can start the probe,” he said. The HC on September 10 had stayed investigations against Saini in criminal cases till February 2020 observing that his involvement in multiple cases could be a “political ploy” in the wake of the upcoming assembly elections. Bains, who was appointed to deal with the four FIRs into the 2015 post-sacrilege violence incidents as advocate general APS Deol could not have appeared in these cases having defended Saini and suspended ADGP Paramraj Singh Umarangal. Bains said he has started examining the case documents. “In my discussions with the government officials, I have pointed out that this order (September 10 order) needs to be challenged as entire prosecution case hinges around Saini’s role,” he said.There is “legally no clean path” for the prosecution in this case and is “full of obstacles”, he added. “But I have to present the case on the basis of investigation carried out by police. I can’t dictate terms of probe. Also a lot will depend on how early we are able to clear the legal hurdles such as the high court order in Saini’s case,” Bains said. Then Amarinder Singh-led government had come under criticism, even from within the party, for tardy probe into these cases. Legal experts say that even in Behbal Kalan case in which challan has been presented, chargesheet names Saini and Umranangal, among others as accused. But the high court order on quashing of challans in the Kotkapura case casts a shadow on this case as well since the chargesheet was signed by former SIT member Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, who later took premature retirement from the police force.

I am a science teacher and these students belong to the arts stream. For the past month, they were body shaming me and making fun of me. They used to call me odd names and tease me. I am a heart patient and don’t lose my temper easily,” said the teacher.He added that when the students didn’t refrain from teasing him with disrespectful names, he abused them after he couldn’t take the insult anymore.According to the sources, a senior officer from the local administration handed over the recording to DEO Lakhvir Singh Samra, who is set to visit the PAU school on Friday to conduct a probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-inquiry-marked-after-recording-of-lecturer-abusing-students-surfaces-101633556898390.html
07-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh to be made slum-free by March 2022||The UT administration has set March 2022 as the deadline for making the city slum-free, a major goal of the Chandigarh Master Plan 2031. In a meeting with senior UT officials on Wednesday, UT adviser Dharam Pal directed that those eligible for resettlement should be resettled and others evicted after being given due time.“The biggest site is Colony number 4 and other smaller pockets in the city will also be cleared by March 2022,” Pal said.Notably, the administration has previously also set deadlines to rid the city of slums, twice, in 2010 and 2017.The Estate Office has already reclaimed around 200 acres after razing Colony Number 5, Mazdoor Colony, Kuldeep Colony, Pandit Colony, Nehru Colony, Ambedkar Colony, Kajheri Colony and Madrasi Colony over the past few years.But though sizable progress has been made, the goal still remains elusive. “We should rehabilitate and resettle all 25,000 people identified by the biometric survey. But those who have settled later need to go. We will give adequate time to residents, two to three months, before forced eviction is undertaken by the administration. We cannot allow the process to linger on. The more it prolongs, more complicated it becomes,” said Pal.Clearing out Colony Number 4 biggest taskColony Number 4, in Industrial Area, is the second-biggest slum in Chandigarh after Colony Number 5, which was razed in 2013. While it originally housed over 7,000 people, the population is now down to around 5,000. Besides more slum pockets in Industrial Area, there are others in Manimajra, and Sectors 25 and 53.The administration has conducted biometric survey twice, say UT officials.The survey included thumb impressions, photographs, physical verification and voter identity card of residents seeking rehabilitation.During the 2006 survey, a large number of residents were declared ineligible on the grounds that their names were not on voters’ list, while many residents were not present during physical verification.Pal has directed the Deputy Commissioner (DC) office and the Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) to coordinate on the issue. The DC Office gives the eligibility list to CHB that further allots the housing units. Stating that the administration was also working on alternative housing options, Pal, said “We have the capacity and will examine under which schemes, like rental housing scheme, these arrangements can be made.”Over the past year, CHB has rehabilitated slum dwellers from tin-shed colonies in Sectors 52 and 56 to the Rehabilitation Colony, Maloya, under the Chandigarh Small Flats Scheme 2006. It has also allotted around 2,500 flats to eligible residents of Colony Number 4 in Maloya. Around 500 flats are still vacant with CHB in Maloya.Overall, the administration has constructed more than 40,000 units in different areas, including Maloya, Ram Darbar, Mauli Jagran and Dhanas.Administrator briefed on Master PlanOn Wednesday, UT administrator Banwarilal Purohit also reviewed the Chandigarh Master Plan 2031 during a meeting with senior officials of the administration. The administrator was briefed on the master plan challenges, particularly the issues related to development and integration of 23 villages with the sectoral plan of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-to-be-made-slum-free-by-march-2022-101633556708193.html
07-10-2021||Chandigarh||Zirakpur project’s towers packed in tight vicinity, allottees drag builder to court||After GBP Group, real estate major Fortune Multitech Private Limited has found itself in soup over building violations at its 14-storey towers at a residential project in Peer Muchalla area of Zirakpur. The three towers, coming up as Victoria Heights, have been constructed without the required setback space between each tower, leaving inadequate area for fire tenders, alleges the resident welfare association (RWA) that has taken the builder to court. One-third space of the total height of the building should be left between two towers for sunlight, air and movement of fire tender. But this has not been ensured, a major violation under the National Building Code and Punjab Municipal Bylaws. No possession has been given yet. Not long ago, in August, the Supreme Court had ordered demolition of the realty firm’s twin 40-storey Supertech towers in Noida for violating building norms. In its order, the top court had said that it was a result of “nefarious complicity” between the Noida Authority and the developer. In their petition before the Punjab and Haryana high court, the allottees, who have formed the RWA of the Victoria Heights society, have said they don’t want it to meet the same fate as the Noida project. The matter will next come up for hearing on November 8. Through an affidavit before the high court, the deputy director of Punjab local government admitted that the project has no approval under the Punjab Apartment and Property Regulations, and permissions were given by the local civic body. The advocate representing the RWA, Mukesh Kumar Verma questioned the competency of the Zirakpur municipal council, stating that as the project did not have a licence, MC had no power to sanction the project. “Even the town and country planning department does not have the authority to give technical sanction in absence of consent of allottees,” he submitted. Speaking to HT, Verma said, “We have approached the high court as we don’t want problems later.” RWA president Parveen Bhadoo said, “Not only inadequate setback space, there are several violations. The builder has not even left a green belt and converted it into a tower. We will take this to a logical conclusion.” Sunny Garg, director of Fortune Multitech Private Limited, said, “Our buildings are coming up in line with norms. As the case is already in high court, we will comply with the court’s directions.” MC executive officer Girish Verma said, “We will seek a report on this and if violations are found, action will be taken accordingly.” Navreet Singh Kang, chairperson of Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA), Punjab, also said they will look into the violations. d.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/zirakpur-project-s-towers-packed-in-tight-vicinity-allottees-drag-builder-to-court-101633556706140.html

He had tested positive for Covid-19 in March this year due to which he missed the Senior World Championship in New Delhi the same month, Rana said.“He has been getting professional training since 2016 here along with 30 students. The game requires the highest level of concentration, but during the lockdown it was tough. We continued practising in every possible way and here is the result,” his coach, also an international player, said.Sarabjot, along with his coach and fellow shooter Aditya Malka, met Haryana home minister Anil Vij at his residence on Wednesday after his return from South America.Vij said, “Sarabjot has made us proud once again. We have provided world-class facilities for such players to practice in their own hometowns. We have functional gymnastics and badminton halls, and upcoming projects like FIFA-approved football stadium with an athletics track and an all-weather swimming pool will surely provide an edge to Ambala in sports.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/twin-gold-for-ambala-s-sarabjot-at-junior-shooting-world-championship-101633556700237.html
07-10-2021||Chandigarh||Amid rising complaints, toothless Punjab RERA wants more powers||With the GBP Group controversy bringing to fore several drawbacks in the functioning of the Punjab Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA), the authority is planning to approach the state government to give it more teeth to protect the buyers.Though already under the scanner of RERA since 2019, the management of GBP Group managed to flee the country last month, leaving nearly 2,500 investors in the lurch.While the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 empowers the RERA to keep a check on builders fleecing buyers, it has no resources or powers to execute its orders on the ground. All decisions are passed on to the deputy commissioners for action as RERA has no authority on the civic bodies, the local development authorities, banks and other financial institutions involved between the conception and completion of the realty projects. 2019 order still not enforcedIn May 2019, upon inspecting the sites, RERA had found that a GBP Group project in New Chandigarh did not have basic statutory approvals, such as CLU, approvals of layout and building plans, and grant of licence to develop a colony. Therefore, a penalty of ₹1.5 crore was imposed and two months deadline was set for remedial measures.However, over two years later, the builder has paid up only ₹50 lakh of the penalty and has continued to sell more properties of the project, amid no progress on addressing the anomalies. An officer of the authority, requesting anonymity, said unlike other states in the country, the Punjab RERA did not have any executive or recovery officers, who were needed to ensure that builders complied with RERA orders and paid the penalties.RERA chairperson Navreet Singh Kang said, “We will take up the issue of more powers with the Punjab government. As far as the GBP Group is concerned, we have already decided to lodge a criminal complaint under Section 59(2) against them.”Buyers should exercise cautionKang said investors should always check the builders’ licence before investing in any project and check the completion certificate before accepting possession of a property.Over the past decade, Mohali, particularly its peripheral areas of Zirakpur, Kharar and New Chandigarh (Mullanpur), has emerged as tricity’s development hub. As such, it is no wonder that 65% of the complaints received by RERA, since its inception in 2017, are from buyers in Mohali district alone.“There are 1,078 registered projects in Punjab and 642 of these are in Mohali. Over 95% of the buyers’ complaints are about delay in possession of property, non-payment of interest and penalty, sale of flats to multiple buyers, unnecessary demands by builders and tardy progress of projects,” said Kang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amid-rising-complaints-toothless-punjab-rera-wants-more-powers-101633556699180.html
07-10-2021||Delhi||Bail to man jailed for 12 yrs over role in ’08 Delhi blasts||The Delhi high court on Wednesday granted bail to a man who was lodged in the jail for the last 12 years for his alleged role in the 2008 Delhi serial blasts, saying that courts must attend to the legal or constitutional rights of people before they are dead.“Courts should not play coroner and attend to legal or constitutional rights only after they are dead. Instead, we must play doctor, and save such rights from demise before they are extinguished. Courts should proactively step in to protect such rights from being stifled and buried,” a bench of justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup J Bhambhani said.“If equity calls upon affected persons to be vigilant to protect their rights, then surely the courts must also be vigilant, and, to quote the Supreme Court, act as sentinels on the qui vive when it comes to protecting constitutional and legal rights,” the bench added.The court said that Mohammad Hakim’s incarceration of more than 12 years as an under-trial “would certainly qualify as a long enough period for the system to acknowledge that his right to speedy trial continues to be defeated”.Hakim was accused of carrying cycle ball-bearings from Lucknow to Delhi that, according to the police, were subsequently used to make IEDs used in the 2008 Delhi serial blasts. The case is at the stage of examination of the prosecution witness.The accused, in custody since February 2009, approached the high court in appeal against a trial court order rejecting his bail application in the criminal case under several provisions of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, Explosive Substances Act, 1908 and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.The prosecution contended that the alleged offences were grave and heinous.It was stated terrorist outfit Indian Mujahideen had taken the responsibility for the serial bomb blasts in different places in Delhi on September 13, 2008 that left 26 people dead and 135 injured.In its judgment, the court noted that despite 256 witnesses being examined over 12 years, 60 prosecution witness were still to be examined.The high court bench observed that even if it is assumed that the accused would be awarded a life sentence after the completion of the trial, he has already undergone more than half the sentence he may eventually face.The court also refused to assume that Hakim might be awarded capital punishment, saying that the death sentence was for “rarest of rare” cases and could not be treated as the “default punishment”.“In the present case, if the State plans to seek the capital sentence for the appellant, it is therefore all the more necessary that the appellant be afforded a speedy trial; failing which, the appellant deserves at least to be given back his liberty after more than 12 long years of imprisonment as an undertrial, since it cannot be ignored that as of now, the appellant has undergone punishment for more than a decade of his life, for an alleged offence for which he has not yet been found guilty,” the court said.Noting that the accused was enrolled in a B.Tech (Biotechnology) degree course at the Integral University, Lucknow for the 2008-2009 sessions, the court asked, “In the event of acquittal, how would the State compensate the appellant for having been robbed of what may have been the most productive and defining decade of his life?”The court also said that though the prosecution stressed that Hakim has been charged with the offence of criminal conspiracy to wage war against the government of India, no particular allegation has been pointed out in the charge sheet or in the order of charges framing that could relate to the offences under Sections 121 or 121A IPC.While granting him release, subject to a personal bond in the sum of ₹25,000 with two local sureties of the same amount from family members, the court said that the accused shall surrender his passport, not travel outside the country without prior permission, keep his cell phone active, and not contact witnesses or tamper with evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bail-to-man-jailed-for-12-yrs-over-role-in-08-delhi-blasts-101633556470765.html

Talking to mediapersons after visiting a gaushala in Amritsar, Sukhbir said they will also apprise the Union minister about the “attempts being made by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi to scuttle the formation of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC)”.The SAD chief said he would lead the delegation. He said a separate delegation will also Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath soon to impress upon him the need to ensure the perpetrators of the ghastly attack on farmers are not only brought to book but awarded exemplary punishment. “The Uttar Pradesh government should also move swiftly to ensure justice to the victim farmers’ families. We will send another delegation to Lakhimpur Khiri to assess the situation there and meet the victims’ families,” he said. A delegation was sent to Uttar Pradesh earlier also but it was stopped at the Ghaziabad border, he added. On the arrest of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and subsequent visits to Lakhimpur by the Congress top brass, Sukhbir said the Congress leaders are going to free Priyanka and are they not concerned about the well-being of farmers. “We will lodge a strong protest against the manner in which the AAP government in Delhi is interfering in the religious affairs of the Sikh community. The Delhi government has usurped the democratic process due to which the DSGMC is yet to be constituted even two months after its elections were held,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/akali-dal-delegation-to-meet-amit-shah-seeking-exemplary-action-against-lakhimpur-khiri-culprits-101633556578981.html
07-10-2021||Chandigarh||Probe marked against ‘dummy admissions’ in Ludhiana government primary school||Acting on a complaint regarding alleged dummy admissions in Government Primary School, Giaspura, the state government has marked an inquiry to district education officer, senior secondary, Ludhiana.The school education secretary has asked DEO Lakhvir Singh Samra to conduct a probe and submit his findings by October 15.A Barnala-based RTI activist Sat Pal Goyal, in a complaint to the chief minister and education secretary, had alleged that 50% of the admissions in Giaspura primary school are ‘dummy’. “The school head is charging ₹600 per student for uniforms, against the actual rate of ₹400. The grants sent by the government for uniforms and mid-day meal scheme, are also being siphoned off by the school authorities by showing these dummy admissions.” School head Nisha Rani refuted the allegations. “This is not the first time Goyal has complained against our school. An inquiry regarding the same was recently conducted by a team formed by DEO primary following his complaint. The team randomly called parents of students to check if their admissions were valid. We were given a clean chit. I am not bothered about any inquiry since I am performing my duties honestly and sincerely,” said Rani.She added that the school has 4,828 students in all, of which 3,600 are in Classes 1 to 5. “At times, some students are absent but at least 3,400 students turn up for classes every day,” claimed Rani.On the allegations of mid-day meal fraud, she said, “We get ration and funds to feed students of Classes 1 to 5 but we ensure that students of LKG and UKG also get the benefit.”On school uniforms, she said, “There is no fraud; ₹600 is the exact cost of the uniform.”When contacted, Goyal said, “The school head is committing the fraud in connivance with senior officials of the education department. I will move court in case of unfair probe by the department.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/probe-marked-against-dummy-admissions-in-ludhiana-government-primary-school-101633556398993.html
07-10-2021||Chandigarh||Former Punjab minister Sewa Singh Sekhwan dies at 71||Former Punjab minister Sewa Singh Sekhwan died at his house in Sekhwan village of Gurdaspur district on Wednesday. He was 71. Sekhwan, who joined the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in August in the presence of party’s national convener Arvind Kejriwal, was unwell for the last six months. “He breathed his last at around 7pm. He died due to liver rupture. He had been suffering from liver infection for the last six months,” said Sekhwan’s son Jagroop Singh over phone. The body will be cremated on Thursday. Sekhwan was one of the tallest panthic leaders in Punjab. He along with former MPs Ranjit Singh Brahmpura and Ratan Singh Ajnala parted ways with the Shiromani Akali Dal and formed a new political party named SAD (Taksali) in December 2018. The three, who were close to SAD patriarch Parkash Singh Badal, had raised a banner of revolt against party chief Sukhbir Singh Badal. Sekhwan was vocal against the SAD for not delivering justice in the Bargari sacrilege and subsequent firing incidents. Later, Sekhwan shifted his loyalties from Brahmpura to former minister Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, who formed another splinter group — SAD (Democratic). Sekhwan wanted Brahmpura and Ajnala to join the SAD (Democratic) to fight for a “common cause to liberate the state from the Badals”. In May 2021, Brahmpura and Dhindsa merged their groups and formed a new political outfit after the name of SAD (Sanyukt). Sekhwan, who was apparently not happy with Brahmpura and Dhindsa forming a new group, had been keeping away from the programmes of the SAD (Sanyukt). In August, Kejriwal visited Sekhwan’s residence and inducted him into the party fold. Sekhwan’s son Jagroop Singh has been active politically in the Qadian constituency of Gurdaspur. Sekhwan, who worked as a teacher for 14 years, entered politics after his father’s death in 1990. He was elected MLA in 1997 from Kahnuwan segment. He also remained SAD’s core committee member for several years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/former-punjab-minister-sewa-singh-sekhwan-dies-at-71-101633556338741.html

Even as massive combing operations were launched by the personnel of the BSF and the Punjab Police along the barbed wire fence at the international border in the two districts, nothing suspicious was found. BSF deputy inspector general (DIG, Gurdaspur) Prabhakar Joshi said, “The first incident was reported near the Bohar Wadala border outpost (BoP) in Gurdaspur. At 7:25pm, two women constables of the 89-Battalion heard the sound of a drone coming from across the border. The women troopers, who saw the drone with a blinking light, opened fire at them. A head constable also joined them but the drone managed to return before crossing the barbed-wire fence.”The second incident, the DIG said, took place at the same time near the Kasyam Barman BoP in Pathankot district. “Troopers of the 121-Battalion opened fire at the drone which entered the Indian territory after crossing the fence. The third drone was spotted at around 9:55pm near the Dorangla police station in Gurdaspur district. When the 58-Battalion personnel resorted to firing, it returned to Pakistan.”Joshi said a full-night search operation was launched with the help of the police. “Our troops are on alert and are working 16-18 hours a day to thwart such attempts at the border,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/3-pakistani-drones-retreat-after-bsf-opens-fire-in-punjab-s-gurdaspur-pathankot-101633556039992.html
07-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana police claim to have arrested 42 snatchers in 13 days||The Ludhiana police commissionerate has claimed that snatching cases in the city have seen a considerable dip since the new police chief, Gurpreet Singh Bhullar, took over on September 22. In a communique shared by the public relations’ office, it was stated that in the last 13 days, police have traced 94% of the snatching cases with the arrest of 42 accused and 100% recovery of stolen property.As per the release, between September 1 and September 21, when Naunihal Singh was at the helm of the police department, the city recorded 51 chain snatching incidents. From September 22 to October 4, the cases dipped to 18. It was also stated that the tracking rate went up from 33.33% to 94% after Bhullar took over. Cops claim to have recovered stolen property worth ₹48.34 lakh since September 22.Police commissioner Bhullar said a multi-pronged strategy has been adopted to curb this street crime. “Special thrust is being laid on eliminating snatching by marking hotspots and keeping tabs on criminals who got out on bail recently. CCTV surveillance near snatching hotspots, such as Ghumar Mandi Road, DMC Road, Kipps Market Sarabha Nagar, Urban Estate Dugri, Jalandhar Bypass, Gill Road, Sherpur and Giaspura Chowk, have been increased,” he said. The commissioner further said special focus is also being laid on prompt and speedy response by police stations and PCR teams to any calls regarding crimes or mishaps. Bhullar said vigilance has been stepped up in the city and senior officers have been asked to monitor nakas in their area and ensure that every officer discharges their duty efficiently.“These are just baby steps. The ultimate goal is to make the city crime-free,” the top cop said, adding that active support and cooperation of the general public is necessary to realise this goal.Bhullar was posted as Ludhiana police commissioner after a major reshuffle in the police department following the shift of power after Captain Amarinder Singh’s resignation as chief minister. Naunihal Singh, during his 31-day tenure as police commissioner, had remained in the news for his midnight vigils which had left many police officers sleep deprived.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-police-claim-to-have-arrested-42-snatchers-in-13-days-101633556038869.html

We all know the sources, but what is the government doing to tackle those? There is no clarity on that. We also want to know if government agencies tasked with managing pollution in the Capital are even equipped to handle it,” Kandhari said.Environment minister Gopal Rai said public participation is needed to ensure the fight against pollution is more effective. “Ultimately, pollution management is a joint effort that cannot happen without people’s support and suggestions,” Rai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/citizens-group-writes-to-govt-over-action-plan-101633555685188.html

In a press statement, party spokesman and Adampur MLA Pawan Kumar Tinu said it has been more than a week since the CM took a helicopter flight to Bathinda to see the damage caused to the cotton crop over lakhs of acres of land. “The CM had promised prompt compensation but not a single farmer or farm labourer has received any relief. The State government is yet to conduct a survey to assess the damage to the crop,” he said. Tinu said reports coming from the Malwa region indicated that farm labourers were in dire straits due to destruction of the cotton crop and had lost their means of livelihood. “We request him to devote a few days in his office to order a comprehensive compensation for farmhands on the same lines as done by the erstwhile Parkash Singh Badal-led SAD government when the cotton crop was affected badly,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/stop-helicopter-hopping-for-few-days-resolve-grievances-of-scs-akali-dal-101633555683003.html
07-10-2021||Delhi||Capital’s air least breathable from Nov 1 to 15, shows data||The Capital breathes its most polluted air between November 1 and November 15 when the smoke from stubble fires and firecrackers plunges the city into a health emergency, a Delhi government analysis of average PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) levels over the last five years showed.The analysis by the government’s environment department found that average PM2.5 levels between November 1 and 15 touched 285ug/m3, categorised as “severe” under regulations of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap).Senior Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) officials said November 1-15 is the worst pollution period for Delhi primarily because the city’s air is saturated with the smoke from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana. The situation is made worse by cracker-bursting during Diwali, and unfavourable winds that bring in pollutants from cities in the National Capital Region (NCR) into Delhi.“The major contributor during this fortnight was stubble fires that happen in large numbers in Punjab and Haryana. These fires increase by October 15, but the impact on Delhi’s air peaks by November,” a DPCC official said, asking not to be named.The official added, “Apart from this, over the last four-five years, Diwali was celebrated either in the end of October or the first half of November. Even though last year there was a complete ban on crackers, violations were reported because the ban was announced at the last moment, and also because people bought crackers from NCR cities such as Ghaziabad and Gurugram.”In 2020, Diwali was celebrated on November 14; in 2019, it was on October 27, in 2018, it was on November 7, in 2017 it was on October 19 and in 2016, the festival was celebrated on October 30.The trend may continue this year as well since Diwali will be celebrated on November 4, the official said.The analysis focused on how winter pollution levels fluctuate between October and February. The months were divided between fortnights to check pollution levels, and to focus on particular sources during specific periods, so that government agencies can plan focussed action.The analysis showed that the winter pollution season starts from October after the withdrawal of monsoon. In the first fortnight of October, the average PM2.5 levels were 80ug/m3. As stubble burning cases increased and the wind pattern over northwest India changed, the average particulate levels also spiked, settling at 158ug/m3 in the second half of October. After peaking at 285ug/m3 in the first 15 days of November, the PM2.5 levels came down briefly, reaching 163ug/m3 between November 16 and November 30, before rising again.Between December 1 and 15, average PM2.5 levels were 188ug/m3. With temperatures dropping, the pollution levels went up to 218ug/m3.In December, scientists said, the pollution sources were mostly local such as open waste burning, vehicular emissions and road and construction dust. “The spike in the latter half of December is very different from what we see in November. This is primarily caused by local factors. Delhi’s internal pollution sources are unable to disperse and remain close to the surface because of the cold conditions and low wind speeds. Other factors that add to the city’s pollution spike are cracker bursting during the New Years’ and also during weddings during this time of the year,” a second DPCC official said.Officials said that this assessment of how the city’s air quality fluctuates will help the government target its action against pollution sources. The city’s first state-level winter action plan has also taken into account the findings of this analysis.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy) at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said that their own analysis has also showed that Delhi’s winter pollution spikes in two phase -- once at the onset of winter, and then again at the peak winter.“We need to understand that winters are tricky because meteorological conditions do not allow easy dispersal of pollutants. Even under these conditions, the government can ensure that round the year action and targeted emergency action can help reduce spikes,” said Roychowdhury.She added, “You cannot find a magic bullet, but the agencies can ensure that fuel is not added to fire. The weather conditions might not be conducive, but at least we can control the emissions from local sources so that the pollution load does not increase. We need a holistic winter plan, but we also ensure emergency measures during peak pollution days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/capitals-air-least-breathable-from-nov-1-to-15-shows-data-101633555142754.html
07-10-2021||Chandigarh||Anandpur Sahib sacrilege fallout: SGPC hiring ex-servicemen in task force to strengthen security at gurdwaras in Punjab||In the wake of a sacrilege incident at Takht Kesgarh Sahib in Anandpur Sahib, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has started recruiting ex-servicemen in its task force to beef up security at all historic Sikh shrines in Punjab. In an advertisement published in various newspapers on Wednesday, the apex gurdwara body chief secretary invited applications from amritdhari ex-servicemen aged between 35 and 45 for the job. Though it recently already roped in 40 ex-servicemen in the task force, also called the ‘Sewa Dal’ with its president Jagir Kaur having handed over appointment letters on September 18, the SGPC felt the need for carrying out the recruitment on a large scale. It will be recruiting 200 ex-servicemen to ensure sacrilege incidents do not take place at gurdwaras in future, it is learnt. The on-duty ex-servicemen will carry weapons.SGPC chief secretary (honorary) Harjinder Singh Dhami said, “The decision was taken in view of the sacrilege at Takht Sri Kesgarh Sahib and other gurdwaras. Since retired armymen are trained and experienced, they are better equipped to prevent such incidents. An average 4 personnel will be deployed at a gurdwara each. For now, we need to hire nearly 150 ex-servicemen”.Jagir Kaur said, “Ex-servicemen are physically competent and disciplined. They will deal bad elements entering the shrines with an intention to v commit sacrilege.” Days after the Kesgarh Sahib incident, the Golden Temple chief manager had written to the Amritsar police commissioner seeking deployment of cops in the parikarma (circumambulation around the sarovar) of the shrine to check criminal and anti-social elements. The SGPC drew a flak from the Sikh organisations that called it out for its alleged incompetence to contain these elements despite having a task force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/anandpur-sahib-sacrilege-fallout-sgpc-hiring-ex-servicemen-in-task-force-to-strengthen-security-at-gurdwaras-in-punjab-101633555378920.html
07-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Survey raises questions over door-to-door waste collection||Raising questions over door-to-door garbage collection in the city, the initial findings of a micro survey conducted in the city showed that 1,609 garbage/waste collectors are informally involved in the door-to-door lifting of garbage in 1,678 mohallas/colonies with 2,56,765 households and 61,077 commercial/industrial establishments in various parts of the city.However, only 82 garbage collectors are involved in the process in areas falling under Zone C of the MC having 143 colonies/mohallas with 42,088 houses and 11,453 commercial and industrial establishments. Further, 644 collectors are involved in areas falling under Zone D having 588 colonies with 81,364 houses and 9,688 commercial/industrial units.In Zone A, 505 collectors are involved in door-to-door lifting in 505 mohallas having 56,496 houses and 22,874 commercial units. Similarly, in Zone B, 434 collectors are involved in 442 mohallas/colonies with 76,817 houses and 17,062 commercial/industrial units. One of the officials requesting anonymity said the MC had commenced the survey in August and the purpose of conducting it was to find out the missing points due to which the door-to-door lifting was not done in the entire city on a daily basis. Surprising revelations have come to the fore as only 82 garbage collectors are involved in Zone C area door-to-door lifting of garbage in 53,541 houses/commercial units. This means every collector is picking waste from around 650 units, which seems practically impossible. Further, the number of garbage collectors is also less than the total number of colonies/mohallas in the city.This shows that the waste is not being collected from houses on a daily basis and there are loopholes in the system.Residents had been complaining about the delayed lifting of garbage from their houses in the past and the garbage was collected after an interval of a few days. Due to this, residents also dump the waste in open plots/areas and drains, the official said.Ankur Mahindroo, joint commissioner, MC, said the survey had been conducted to streamline the lifting process. These were the initial findings and detailed verification was being done.“The aim is to depute collectors in a way that all areas are covered on a daily basis. Changes will be done in the coming time to distribute areas among the collectors. But the informal sector will not be disturbed and the MC is working to involve them with the civic body only, as done in Chandigarh. The report will be tabled in front of senior officials and further steps will be taken to improve the system,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-survey-raises-questions-over-door-to-door-waste-collection-101633555140290.html

07-10-2021||Other||Protest against steel price hike in Ludhiana||The industrial organisations of the city staged a protest at the cycle market over the unprecedented steel price hike.Fastener Manufacturer Association of India, All Industries Trade Forum, Federation of Punjab Small Industries Association (FOPSIA), and Fastener Suppliers Association of India organised the protest.The public and private steel plants have increased steel prices by around ₹6,000 per tonne in the last eight days. Following the large production, the state’s secondary steel plants also increased the ingot prices from 43,800 to 49,500 in the last 10 days.In the last year, the price of steel has increased to around ₹20,000 per tonne. The protesters said the main reason behind the increase is the cartel of Indian steel companies formed under the name of the Indian Steel Alliance. Shockingly, the government steel companies are also a part of this cartel, they added.The government of India and the steel ministry are silent on the issue due to their vested interests, said FOPSIA president Badish Jindal.The industrialists alleged that local steel furnaces and rolling mills are working under the cartel and keep on changing the prices every hour as per their requirements. These price manipulations are throwing Indian MSMEs out of export competition, and the industries are failing to fulfil the long-term contracts with suppliers. The industrialists said they will intensify the strike if the prices are not reduced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/protest-against-steel-price-hike-in-ludhiana-101633554538761.html

Dr Sunil Hari, district epidemiologist, said that peri-urban places like Naraingarh were prone to such infections.“Though, the boy died of some other reasons, the department is leaving no stone unturned to avoid its spread. Flu wards are functional and special attention will be paid to symptomatic patients at OPDs,” Dr Hari said. Officials said that the larva of female species of Aedes Aegypti mosquito or dengue mosquito was mostly found in the back tray of refrigerators filled with water and empty tyres. Advisories were issued to patients to stay in bed nets, as if the mosquito bites the infected person, it can act as a carrier and might infect others too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dengue-58-cases-reported-from-ambala-so-far-101633554418600.html

They approached the chief minister’s office for the second time in the last three months over the alleged apathy of the public works department (PWD) in dealing with the issue.The members of Samaj Sudhar Sabha NGO accused the officials of the PWD department of wasting the public money and ill-planned development of the stretch of around 4 km (outside the MC limits).The residents rued that the road portion which was constructed in 2017, was again left dotted with potholes by the end of 2018 due to the inferior quality of material used. They stated that the tender estimate in 2014-15 was ₹2.04 crore, but it was slashed to ₹1.32 crore and finally, the work was allotted for ₹80 lakh.The residents alleged that work quality was compromised due to reduced project costs. They rued that the road also gets waterlogged as a drainage system was not put in place then. They stated that the residents and commuters face a harrowing time during the monsoons and road accidents also take place due to the deep potholes. Repeated complaints have been with the department to no avail.NGO members including, vice president Varunesh Kumra, Hardeep Singh, Pankaj Maheshwari, among others, stated that the project was also ill-planned as the width of the road within MC limits is around 22 feet but it was constructed at a width of 12 feet.Accusing the PWD officials of adopting corrupt practices, the member of the NGO stated that the department also claims to have conducted repair works in 2020, even when nothing was done to improve the condition at ground level.Kumra stated that the department had, in an RTI reply, admitted that repair works were taken up in 2020, but when the details were sought, it failed to give a proper reply. Therefore, the NGO has filed a second appeal in the state information commission case.He said, “The first complaint was submitted with the CM’s office in August. The office had directed the department to resolve the grievance and send an action taken report. But no action was taken by the department. Now, we have submitted another complaint on Tuesday. A copy of the complaint has also been marked to deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma.”PWD executive engineer Adesh Gupta said that the road portion got damaged due to water accumulation as the MC has failed to establish a proper drainage system there. A detailed project report has been sent to the state department for the reconstruction of the road. The project will be initiated soon after getting approval from the state department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/potholed-noorwala-road-ludhiana-ngo-accuses-pwd-officials-of-apathy-101633553341664.html

07-10-2021||Mumbai||Bombay high court nod to state-appointed panel to take charge of Shri Saibaba Sansthan||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) has allowed the state-appointed committee to take charge of the Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust, Shirdi from October 19 and disposed of the public interest litigations (PIL) that had sought the same. However, in light of the state government allowing the opening of religious places from October 7, the court directed the ad-hoc committee which was appointed in 2019 to oversee the precautionary measures till the new committee took charge. While disposing of the PIL’s the court held that as the petitioner had sought setting up of a court-appointed committee till the state government appointed a committee as per the Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust Act, the petition had served its purpose as the new committee was appointed. The HC also allowed the petitioner to file a fresh petition if he wanted to challenge the new committee. The division bench of justice Ravindra Ghuge and justice SG Mehare, while hearing the public interest litigation filed by Uttamrao Shelke through advocate Pradnya Talekar, had been informed that the state government had appointed a managing committee in September 2021 but the same was did without the permission of the court. In light of this, Talekar informed the bench that the petitioner wanted to challenge the new committee and hence sought permission to amend the PIL and include the new challenge. However, senior advocate SN Dhorde for the state government informed the bench that one of the main prayers of the petition was to direct the state government to form a new committee as per the rules which had already been done, hence the petitioners’ grievance had been addressed. Dhorde further submitted that as the petitioner was seeking to challenge the newly appointed committee, which was a separate cause of action, he could not be allowed to amend the PIL and include the new issue. In October 2019, the court had appointed an ad-hoc committee and asked the state government to form a new committee as per the Act. Till then the ad-hoc committee comprising principal district judge, Ahmednagar, the collector, Ahmednagar and the chief executive officer of Shree Sai Baba Sansthan Trust, Shirdi. The committee was to supervise, monitor and look after the financial affairs of the Sansthan. After hearing the submissions, the bench observed, “Subject to any orders passed by a Court in the litigation, if initiated by the petitioner or any other litigant, the newly appointed managing committee would officially take charge from the learned principal district judge, Ahmednagar, who is the chairman of the adhoc committee in force, on 19.10.2021 in between 5pm to 6:30pm.” The bench also permitted the petitioner to file a separate petition to challenge the constitution of the new committee and also held that all pending civil applications for seeking permission of the court for various purposes were also disposed of, with the rider that all issues put forth in the civil applications should be taken up by the new committee after 19.10.2021, subject to there being no legal impediment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-nod-to-state-appointed-panel-to-take-charge-of-shri-saibaba-sansthan-101633551359634.html

The police have arrested a total of six accused in the past two days in the case. The arrested junior engineers — Yashwant Deshmukh, 49, and Shrikrishna Mohite, 46, had allegedly given a contract of ₹20 lakh to the shooters to eliminate the victim Deepak Khambit out of professional rivalry and had paid ₹10 lakh to the shooters in advance, said a police officer. The incident took place on the evening of September 29 when Khambit, an executive engineer with MBMC, was heading to Borivli from Mira Road. Two accused — Amit Sinha and Ajay Singh followed him on a bike when he was returning home from work in his private car. Singh was riding the bike, while pillion rider Sinha fired two rounds on the car’s window.Khambit suffered a minor injury from glass, which shattered after a bullet hit the window.The Mumbai Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale said, “Both junior engineers joined MBMC in 2004, but neither of them got an important post and promotion. They were angry and hired shooters.”The police have arrested Pradeep Kumar Pathak and Raju Vishwakarma. Based on their interrogation, police arrested Sinha from Bhadohi district and Singh from Ghazipur in Uttar Pradesh. Vishwakarma and Sinha both have past criminal records and they had met in jail a few years ago. Vishwakarma was in touch with engineers who gave him a contract to kill Khambit, said a police officer. Sinha was allegedly associated with Chhota Rajan and DK Rao gang and was earlier arrested in a firing case in Malad. Five accused are in police custody till October 11 while Singh is being brought to Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/2-junior-mbmc-engineers-arrested-for-conspiring-to-kill-executive-engineer-101633551358337.html
07-10-2021||Mumbai||Rise in domestic air passenger traffic in September as Covid cases dip||The domestic air passenger traffic grew by around 3% with around 68-69 lakh passengers in September 2021 compared to around 67 lakh in August 2021. According to rating agency- ICRA, around 61,100 departures were seen last month as against 39,628 departures in September 2020, resulting in last year’s departures being higher by around 6%.Suprio Banerjee, vice president and sector head, ICRA said: “For September 2021, the average daily departures were at approximately 2,100, significantly higher than the average daily departures of approximately 1,321 in September 2020, and higher than around 900 in August 2021, though they remained lower than around 2,200 in January 2021.”The ministry of civil aviation (MoCA) had reduced the permissible capacity deployment to 50% of pre-Covid levels from June 1, 2021, due to the resurgence of the second wave Covid-19. It had increased the permitted capacity to 72.5% with effect from August 12, 2021, but has now permitted the capacity to 85% with effect from September 18, 2021, until further orders. Additionally, the ministry relaxed the fare cap rule from September 18. “Though the recovery continued in September 2021, demand continues to be subdued from the corporate traveller segment as reflected by passenger traffic being lower by around 38% in September 2021 compared to pre-Covid levels,” Banerjee added. ICRA said that the increase in permitted capacity to 85% levels is a step in the right direction, given the onset of the festive season. “Also, reduction in fare cap rollover period from 30 days to 15 days is a move towards market-driven pricing as applicable during the pre-Covid period, wherein the pricing was determined by the actual demand-supply dynamics and real passenger load factors,” it added.Under the Vande Bharat Mission (VBM) that started on May 7 last year, international passenger traffic (inbound and outbound) for Indian airlines was around 46 lakh for the period May 7, 2020, to September 30, 2021. For September 2021, international passenger traffic for Indian airlines under the same set-up was around four lakh, marking a sequential growth of around 30%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rise-in-domestic-air-passenger-traffic-in-september-as-covid-cases-dip-101633551298161.html
07-10-2021||Mumbai||MVA calls Maharashtra bandh on Oct 11 over Lakhimpur Kheri incident; BJP says its opportunism||The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition partners on Wednesday called a one-day bandh across Maharashtra on October 11 to protest against the death of farmers in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri. The announcement was made by the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) state president Jayant Patil. The state cabinet earlier in the day expressed its condolences over the “unfortunate” death of farmers. The MVA is attempting to corner the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident at a time when the coalition government is facing criticism from the Maharashtra BJP over the lack of relief package for flood-affected farmers in Central Maharashtra and Vidarbha regions. The decision came a day after NCP chief Sharad Pawar compared the mowing of farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri to the Jallianwala Bagh. Pawar also called the BJP government insensitive. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut also met Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over the issue in New Delhi on Tuesday. “To condemn the incident where farmers were crushed to death in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri, Maharashtra will observe a day’s bandh. The cabinet too expressed condolence over the incident. It is extremely important to condemn the cruelty of the BJP or its state governments against the farmers and to scuttle the farmers’ protests at several places. So far, the accused have not been nabbed yet,” said Patil, who was flanked by Congress’ Balasaheb Thorat and Shiv Sena’s Eknath Shinde.He added that MVA allies Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress along with the smaller parties in the alliance have decided to hold this band. “The bandh will be observed the entire day, barring essential services such as hospitals, ambulances, milk supply, etc,” Patil added.Reacting to the decision of a one-day strike, leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said that ruling parties are politicising the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, adding that the decision reeks of politics. “Condemning the [Lakhimpur Kheri] incident is fine but had the cabinet thought about the farmers in Maharashtra, who are affected by the flood, then it would have been better. But instead of thinking of the farmers, such a proposal was passed, which is nothing but opportunism. It reeks of politics,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mva-calls-maharashtra-bandh-on-oct-11-over-lakhimpur-kheri-incident-bjp-says-its-opportunism-101633551238201.html
07-10-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena’s Dussehra rally at Shivaji Park? Dussehra gathering not online, says Raut||Ahead of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) election in February 2022, the Shiv Sena is planning to hold its annual Dussehra rally on a larger scale than last year. The party is exploring if a rally could be held at its traditional venue, Shivaji Park in Dadar. Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that this year Dussehra rally will not be an online event, indicating that it will be a physical event, unlike last year. This year the Dussehra festival falls on October 15.Amid pandemic in 2020, the party had organised the event on a small scale in an auditorium, where Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray gave his speech, which was streamed live on social media platforms. Only 50 top leaders and ministers were part of the physical event inside the Savarkar auditorium behind Shivaji Park. “The Dussehra rally will happen, and it will not be an online event. We feel that the rally should be held properly. Uddhav ji also has the same view on this. The discussion is going on how the rally can be organised by following the Covid protocols and norms. The rally would happen based on the decision Uddhav ji takes,” said Raut.Since Thackeray took over the reins of Maharashtra, the party has not been able to hold a full-fledged event, barring one celebratory function on Bal Thackeray’s birth anniversary on January 23, 2020. Party’s foundation day on June 19, the anniversary of Marmik magazine were celebrated online. Given the crucial BMC, and other civic polls including in Thane, Nashik, Aurangabad, the party intends to hold a physical event.Senior party functionaries said that they have two options before them, either to hold it in a bigger auditorium this year or hold it at Shivaji Park in central Mumbai. “There is a feeling within the party that the rally should be held on a bigger scale given the Covid situation is under control. Last year too we did not have a rally but given the civic elections next year we feel that a large-scale rally will be needed to mobilise the cadre. The other option is to hold it in a bigger auditorium in Mumbai and simultaneously stream it on social media platforms for a bigger reach. However, Uddhav ji will take the final call,” a functionary said requesting anonymity. Interestingly, chief minister Thackeray has been speaking against public gatherings and political functions owing to the Covid restrictions in place. The state government has so far not lifted curbs on social, cultural, and political gatherings in the state. Last month, the state government allowed theatres and auditoriums to open their doors for patrons from October 22 with 50% capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-s-dussehra-rally-at-shivaji-park-dussehra-gathering-not-online-says-raut-101633551184775.html
07-10-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers suffering due to government apathy: Hooda||Former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Wednesday accused the BJP-JJP government of making farmers run from pillar to post for selling their produce.The leader of Opposition said he paid a visit to mandis in state on October 3 and saw farmers facing problems. “The grain has started turning black. The government is responsible for this delay but farmers will have to bear the brunt,” he said.In a statement, Hooda said it seems the state government is merely pretending to buy paddy and bajra. He said this apathy is not just limited to paddy, the government is also playing similar games with bajra growers.“Today the market rate of bajra is between ₹900 to ₹1,200. Even if ₹600 of the Bhavantar Bharpayee Yojana announced by the government is added to this, farmers will still lose ₹350 to ₹650 per quintal. Even the MLAs of the ruling coalition have flagged this to the Haryana chief minister,” he said.“About 28 lakh quintal paddy is lying in the mandis as on Wednesday and procurement process is hardly running smoothly in any mandi. The crop brought to the market is either being sold to private agencies at lower rates or has to be taken back home and farmers have to bear the transportation cost twice over,” Hooda said.“The government is bringing new rules every day to harass the farmers, traders and workers. Despite the government repeatedly changing the dates and announcing government procurement from October 3, farmers are running from pillar to post in the mandis,” he said.Hooda said the government is imposing unnecessary conditions such as portal registration, and scheduling. There is a capping of 25 quintal per acre, which was reduced from 33 quintal last year while there was no cap on procurement during the Congress government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-suffering-due-to-government-apathy-hooda-101633551183247.html
07-10-2021||Mumbai||Bypolls in Maharashtra rural local bodies: BJP ahead but loses seats to MVA partners||Results of the much-anticipated local body bypolls held in six districts on Tuesday to fill seats vacated by Other Backward Class (OBC) candidates revealed that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) suffered losses from its previous showing in the district council elections held shortly before the pandemic started, but emerged as the single largest party over the Congress, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Shiv Sena. However, the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition improved their collective performance over the last district council (zilla parishad or ZP) and panchayat samiti elections held in six districts of Dhule, Nandurbar, Akola, Washim, Nagpur and Palghar in January 2020. Together, the Congress, NCP and Sena clocked 46 district council seats out of 85, improving their tally by 10. The BJP won 22 out of the 85 district council seats -- a reduction of nine seats. In the 144 panchayat samiti seats that also went to poll on Tuesday, the Congress won the highest number of seats at 36, while the BJP won 33 seats. The NCP and Shiv Sena won 18 and 23 seats respectively. The remaining 34 were won by smaller parties and independent candidates. In all, 367 candidates were in the fray for the ZP polls while 555 candidates stood for the panchayat samiti seats. Elections to these seats were held in the Open Category for the first time in 1994 after the Supreme Court quashed the 27% reservation for OBC candidates in local bodies stating that this reservation, taken together with reservation for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe candidates exceeded the 50% cap mandated by a previous nine-judge Supreme Court order. Political experts saw these by-polls as a bellwether to test the mood of OBC communities following the SC’s March 4 order quashing reservation. To manage what could have been a messy political fallout, the state promulgated an Ordinance in September that amended two laws (out of five) which govern local bodies to revert to an OBC quota that permitted up to 27% reservation for candidates from this category. “Even after the quota was quashed, the ruling parties have not borne the brunt as the BJP thought they would. Though the BJP has been constantly cornering the MVA government, it does not seem to have reflected in these elections. This means if the three ruling parties remain coordinated and perform well at the local level, they may have better prospects in the forthcoming elections. The Congress has been significantly gaining ground in Vidarbha as it has won more seats in Nagpur and Washim. It could be a good sign for the party,” political analyst Hemant Desai said. Performance measure In these six districts, Congress is in power in Nagpur and Nandurbar ZPs, BJP in the Dhule ZP, NCP-Congress alliance in Washim ZP while Prakash Ambedkar led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) is strong in Akola ZP. In Palghar, Shiv Sena and NCP combine is in power. The power equation in these bodies remains intact. While the BJP’s numbers in Nagpur, Dhule and Akola dropped substantially, the Congress gained two seats and retained power in Nagpur district council. The BJP retained power in the Dhule district council, but saw a reduction in the number of seats. The VBA saw a dent in its tally in Akola and Washim. The BJP’s agreement with the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) failed to produce results in Palghar after both parties won nine of the total 29 seats. The BJP won eight seats of the total 20 that it contested while the MNS won one. “It was the local leadership which decided the seat adjustments based on the local conditions. It has nothing to do with the state leadership,” said BJP leader Madhav Bhandari. “We have lost our few sitting members in Nagpur and the results are not as expected,” said BJP leader and former minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule. He said the results were not an indication of the mood within the OBC community as all the parties fielded OBC candidates. Public Works Department minister and Congress leader Ashok Chavan said that the results showed that the people rejected BJP’s double standards. “Though three ruling parties contested the polls separately, we have collectively won 46 of 85 seats. Our individual tally too has improved, whereas the numbers of BJP and Bahujan Vikas Aghadi have reduced. The voters have given fitting reply to the BJP which misguided Maratha and OBC communities,” he said. Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said that the BJP emerged as the top party. “Of the total 229 seats, we have won 55 or 25% while 25% have been won by other small parties and independents. The three ruling parties could win only half of them, while Shiv Sena, the prime constituent in the MVA government has been thrown to fourth position. It is worrisome situation for the Sena which need to think twice over the alliance.” Baban Taywade, president of National OBC Federation said that the OBC voters largely voted against the BJP in the bypolls. “Even though the Maharashtra government has issued an Ordinance and even if it stood the legal scrutiny, the quota for OBC would be upto 27% and not assured 27% as it used to be. Only the Central government can give us 27% quota by bringing a constitutional amendment. If the BJP really wants the OBC quota to be restored, it should bring the amendment,” he said. Palghar MP Rajendra Gavit’s son and BJP candidate Rohit Gavit was defeated, while Gujarat BJP chief CR Patil’s daughter Dharati Devare won from Dhule. Former minister and BJP MLA Vijaykumar Gavit’s younger daughter Supriya won ZP election from Nandurbar. Following these bypolls, 23 of 27 municipal corporations, 27 of 36 district councils, 300 of 362 nagar panchayats and more than 290 panchayat samitis are scheduled to go to polls in the first half of 2022. The elections are touted as a mini assembly poll and would serve as a testament to the performance of the MVA government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bypolls-in-maharashtra-rural-local-bodies-bjp-ahead-but-loses-seats-to-mva-partners-101633551118151.html
07-10-2021||Mumbai||Water level in 7 lakes 99%; no water cuts in Mumbai this year, says BMC||Mumbai will not have any water cuts for the next one year as the water level in the seven lakes is 99%, as of Wednesday morning. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has adequate water stock for the next 372 days.Every year, the BMC undertakes a review meeting on October 1 after withdrawal of monsoon in the last week of September, however, since monsoon withdrawal is delayed for the past two years the review meeting will happen in mid-October, according to BMC officials. However, the BMC has maintained that looking at the current situation it is clear that there will not be any water cuts. Ajay Rathore, chief engineer of BMC’s hydraulics department said, “The monsoon is yet to officially withdraw and there are chances of more rainfall, due to which we have not taken an annual meeting yet. But looking at the situation, it is clear that Mumbai will not have any water cuts this year.”Of the seven lakes supplying drinking water to the city, four— Tulsi, Vihar, Tansa and Modak Sagar — have already overflowed once this monsoon. According to BMC’s data, the livestock of water is 100% in Tulsi, 99% Vihar, 98% in Tansa and 97% in Modak Sagar. The seven lakes that supply water to the city are located in Mumbai as well as neighbouring Thane and Palghar districts. The city has received over 3,000mm of rainfall this monsoon and nearby cities too have reported good rainfall.In the current year, between July 16 and 23, the catchment areas of the lakes received a maximum of their stock. On July 17, the overall water level in seven lakes was 17% and the BMC was considering announcing a water cut. However, by July 22, the water level crossed the 50% mark, followed by 60% on July 24 and 70% on July 28. On October 06, the water level was 99.00% in the seven lakes. Last year, on October 06, the water level was 98.60%, and it was 98.92% in 2019.Bhatsa dam in Thane, which supplies 55% of the total annual water requirement of the city, has 99.43 water stock, which was 999.92% last year at this time. In the case of Upper Vaitarna, the water level is 99.79% as of Monday. Last year at this time, the level stood at 99.58%. Middle Vaitarna has 97.78% of water stock as opposed to 97.47% last year at this time.The seven lakes are bifurcated into two systems — the Vaitarna system which supplies to the western suburbs and the island city, and Bhatsa system which supplies to the eastern suburbs. The civic body supplies 3,850 million litres of water daily against the city’s demand for 4,200 million litres.The city had experienced a 20% water cut last year in August 2020, amid the Covid outbreak owing to the low level of water storage in the lakes. BMC chief Iqbal Singh Chahal had also prepared a backup plan to bring water to Mumbai from Bhandardara dam in Ahmednagar if required. Before 2020, no water cut was imposed in 2019, owing to good rainfall in catchment areas. The BMC had imposed a 10% water cut in 2018, a 20% cut in 2016 and a 25% cut in 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/water-level-in-7-lakes-99-no-water-cuts-in-mumbai-this-year-says-bmc-101633551001164.html

07-10-2021||Chandigarh||HC declines bail to Gurugram juvenile accused of murder||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday dismissed the bail plea of a Gurugram juvenile accused of murdering a Class-2 student of the same school in 2017.The HC bench of justice Avneesh Jhingan dismissed the plea primarily on grounds of apprehension that there can be an attempt to tamper the evidence or influence the witnesses. The boy is accused of slitting the throat of a Class-2 student in a bid to postpone the exams. Initially, the probe was conducted by the Haryana Police and a bus conductor was accused of murdering him. Later, CBI claimed that the crime was committed by the boy in question. The boy, named Bholu by a local Gurugram court since identity of a juvenile in conflict with law cannot be revealed, is in an observation home since November 2017. Earlier, attempt of bail plea taken up to the Supreme Court resulted in dismissal of the same by the apex court in September 2020, in which it was also ordered that he be treated as an adult while deciding his bail pleas. The fresh round of bail process was initiated in February and after dismissal of plea at the lower court, the HC was approached on April 23, 2021. One plea is still pending in the Supreme Court involving a question whether the boy is to be tried as an adult or a juvenile. He was 16-years-and-five-months-old at the time of the alleged incident. In the fresh plea, it was argued that the appellant was in observation home for three years and eleven months. Ultimately, if it is held that the petitioner is to be treated as child in conflict with law, he has already undergone the maximum sentence he could be awarded, it was argued further adding that even if he is to be treated as an adult, his custody period is substantial, more over as there is no progress in the trial. There are total 127 prosecution witnesses. The HC took note of the CBI report which argued that the appellant is to be treated as an adult for considering his bail application. The contention that ‘if he is to be treated as child in conflict with law’ is not available to him as ordered by the Supreme Court. The CBI had further argued that there is no change in circumstances and mere custody itself cannot be a ground for grant of bail. The CBI had also brought on record proceedings before the Juvenile Justice Board, Gurugram, where the presiding officer had recorded that the appellant and his father, who is a practising lawyer, tried to pressure the presiding officer. There are complaints filed that the appellant and his father tried to influence the witnesses in the present case, the CBI had submitted. The court observed that considering the facts and circumstances in totality, the custody period and non-progress of trial cannot be the sole ground for grant of bail. The court also took note of the lower court order on dismissal of bail plea about apprehensions recorded that certain witnesses including the sister of the deceased were minor and possibility of influencing the witnesses cannot be ruled out, if the boy is to be released on bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-declines-bail-to-gurugram-juvenile-accused-of-murder-101633550697989.html
07-10-2021||Chandigarh||Bargari sacrilege: Accused dera followers seek CBI probe papers||Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda followers, who are accused in the 2015 Bargari sacrilege case, have sought copies of the probe documents of sacrilege cases handed over by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to the Punjab police Special Investigation Team (SIT). Sukhjinder Singh, alias Sunny, Nishan Singh, Ranjit Singh, alias Bhola, and Pardeep Kumar, Shakti Singh and Baljit Singh filed an application in the court on Wednesday claiming that the prosecution has not furnished various documents, including the documents handed over by the CBI along with the chargesheet. They have asked for CBI’s handwriting and fingerprints reports of the CFSL lab along with specimen handwriting of the accused taken by the CBI. Further, they demanded the statements of witnesses recorded by the CBI under Section 161 of CrPC and all other documents obtained by the central agency during the investigation in the final report. In July, the SIT probing three 2015 sacrilege cases had filed a nine-point opinion on the closure report of the CBI to negate the clean chit given to dera followers in sacrilege cases. The CBI had concluded that no clue leading to the detection of these three cases could be found. “No eyewitness could be found,” it had said.The handwriting samples of accused Sukhjinder were sent by the CBI to the CFSL lab, which did not match with the ones on the derogatory posters pasted at Bargari in 2015. The SIT, however, has claimed that from peculiar facts and circumstances, it is evident that the CBI has overlooked certain relevant and important aspects. “The motive behind these three cases is having a direct link with Dera Sacha Sauda and the accused in these cases are dera followers,” the SIT claims. In June, the SIT had sent Sukhjinder’s fresh handwriting samples to the CFSL lab to match with the derogatory posters. However, the report is awaited. Apart from the CBI documents, dera followers have also asked the court to direct the prosecution to produce photographs of holy angs (torn pages of bir of Guru Granth Sahib), recording and transcripts of phone calls of Rupinder Singh and Jaswinder Singh. They also sought a copy of the application of discharge of Rupinder and Jaswinder. Advocate Vinod Monga, counsel of dera followers, told the court that these documents were essential for the trial of this case and those go deep into the matter to prove the innocence of the accused. The court proceedings were scheduled to frame charges against the accused in the Bargari sacrilege case in the court of judicial magistrate Tarjani on Wednesday. However, the matter was adjourned to October 27 for arguments on the application filed by the accused seeking documents. On October 20, 2015, then Punjab Bureau of Investigation chief additional director general of police (now DGP) Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota had announced that they have cracked the Bargari sacrilege case with the arrest of two persons. Sahota-led SIT arrested two Sikh youth, Rupinder Singh and Jaswinder Singh, both residents of Panjgrain village in Faridkot, concluding that the two brothers were in touch with someone in Australia and their funding by “foreign-based handlers” has been established. It also claimed to have intercepted their calls to handlers in Dubai and Australia. Audio clips of telephonic conversations between Rupinder and his foreign handler and Rupinder and Jaswinder, who was using his relative Gurbachan Singh’s number, were also shared. However, the SIT theory came under question the next day following media reports that the “foreign handlers” named in the case were ordinary NRIs who sent money to Rupinder and Jaswinder to fund the anti-sacrilege protest in Bargari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bargari-sacrilege-accused-dera-followers-seek-cbi-probe-papers-101633550579583.html
07-10-2021||Chandigarh||Relief to Haryana farmers as rice millers join procurement||A strong lobby of the rice millers of Haryana forced the government to bow to their demands, including withdrawal of FIRs registered against some rice millers for contravening the CMR policy by allegedly bringing in rice from other states.The deadlock ended as the government reportedly agreed to their demands during a meeting between the members of the rice millers’ association and Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala late on Tuesday.Though the government is yet to make any announcement in this regard, a statement jointly circulated to the rice millers’ association president Hansraj Singla, chairman Jewel Singh and vice-president Vinod Goel, to members of the Haryana Rice Millers’ Association has confirmed the development.On their request, the rice millers have also joined the procurement operations from Wednesday.They said the meeting took place as the residence of the Deputy CM, who also holds the portfolio of food, supplies and consumer affairs department, and has agreed to their demands including reducing bank guarantee on paddy provided to rice millers under the CMR policy to 1% owners of rice mills and 2.5% for rice millers who have taken the mills on lease from the proposed 5%.Cases were registered against rice millers, who were booked for allegedly bringing rice from other states in 2019 and 2020.While there were no specific details of the number of cases, people associated with the association said cases were registered against rice millers in Karnal, Kurukshetra and Kaithal districts following recovery of rice meant for the public distribution system of other states. Only those rice millers will be given the benefit who have returned the entire rice to the government.They clarified that cases registered against the defaulter rice millers for not returning the rice will not be withdrawn. The government has also agreed to open procurement for farmers of other states within the next seven day, they said.Haryana Rice Millers’ Association vice-president Vinod Goel said, “The government has accepted our demands and have asked all rice millers to join procurement without any further delay and inconvenience to the farmers.”The move has come as a big relief for thousands of farmers in state as procurement gained momentum on Wednesday and most of the paddy lying in mandis for the past couple of days was procured and lifting will also start by Wednesday evening.BJP’s Thanesar MLA Subhash Sudha also issued a statement stating that talks between the government and rice millers remained positive and the rice millers have decided to start procurement.Officials of the Haryana Agriculture Marketing Board said the government has also accepted a demand of the farmers and raised the per acre cap for procurement up to 30.8 quintal from 25 quintal.Even as procurement had started from October 3, rice millers were not cooperating due to new norms introduced by the government in the CMR policy, and without rice millers, the government agency was unable to start lifting of procured paddy.Bank guarantee clause for Haryana millers amendedThe Haryana government has decided to amend the bank guarantee clause in the milling policy for the ongoing Kharif season. An official spokesperson said following a review an additional security amount of 2.5% of the value of the paddy allotted will be obtained from the miller in the form of bank guarantee.However, for a rice miller who is an unencumbered owner of a rice mill and land underneath and has delivered his entire custom milled rice by May 31, the additional security amount will be 1% of the value of the paddy allotted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/relief-to-haryana-farmers-as-rice-millers-join-procurement-101633550578113.html

It was floated in September 2019. However, due to lack of response to tender, PMC extended the tender time limit. After that, the corporation had received one response. However, the agency did not have a certificate from the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI). The corporation gave the agency time to get a certificate from AWBI within six months. However, it did not happen as the corona pandemic began and the entire process halted.As per state government order and AWBI advisory, every municipal corporation should have control the cat population and reduce the incidents of cruelty.Amay Joshi, a resident of Shrikrupa Shursti society, Jambhulwadi, said, “We are facing the problem of cats in our society. Some residents feed non-vegetarian food to cats which is not acceptable to vegetarian residents. Cats cause a stench on the premises.” Girish Kamble, a resident of Kalp-kalyan Society, Dhankawadi, said, “The cats roam around the society at night and scatter waste collected in dustbins, leaving food lying around. It causes uncleanliness. It puts restrictions on us from moving around the society or using the staircases.” Manoj Dubey, an animal activist said, “Cats are independent and do not depend on human beings for food. Cats are useful for us. They don’t want specific food or shelter. They are not creating any trouble for anyone. We are against cat sterilisation. It is one of the important parts of the life cycle. Cats eat rats and other small animals which are harmful to us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmcs-cat-sterilisation-drive-runs-into-covid-roadblock-101633550097885.html

But this year, I suffered huge losses as the prices fell sharply in the open market and the government failed to initiate procurement process,” he said.“I don’t know how the government will evaluate bajra per yield and how much it will pay us. The government should give us ₹900 per quintal under the ‘Bhavantar Bharpayee Yojana’,” he added.Balbir Thakan, state secretary of All India Kisan Sabha, said their apprehensions that the government would ‘shut down mandis’ came true after the state government included bajra under the ‘Bhavantar Bharpayee Yojana’.“After the government move, the price of bajra has sharply declined by ₹450-500 per quintal. Who will compensate for this difference? The state government wants to adopt such methods so that it can shut down mandis and give open players complete freedom to fleece farmers. The government had announced to purchase 25% bajra from October 1 but it has failed to start procurement so far,” he added.Ram Kumar Ritholia, president of Vyapar Mandal at Charkhi Dadri, said farmers are forced to sell their crop at ₹1,100- 1,300 per quintal.“Bags of bajra are lying under the open sky. It seems that the government will not procure bajra at MSP and their decision will affect farmers and arhtiyas. In the last one week, the prices of bajra have reduced by ₹500 per quintal and those agents who had purchased bajra last week are suffering losses,” he added.The government will compensate only those farmers of Haryana who have registered on the ‘Meri Fasal, Mera Byora’ portal for buying bajra. In Kharif season 2021, total 2.71 lakh farmers have registered on the portal for bajra and the government has set up 86 centres to procure 25% bajra of Haryana but procurement could not be started in state.Former Haryana chief minister and leader of Opposition, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, said the farmers are forced to sell their bajra crop at ₹900-1,200 per quintal.“If government compensates ₹600 per quintal to farmers under the ‘Bhavantar Bharpayee Yojana’, even then they will suffer losses of ₹350-600 per quintal,” he added.BJP’s Nangal Chaudhary MLA Abhe Singh Yadav said he and other party MLAs met Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Tuesday and appraised him of the problems faced by the bajra growers.Haryana agriculture minister JP Dalal said arrival of bajra has started at a few mandis.“We will give ₹500 crore compensation to bajra growers under the ‘Bhavantar Bharpayee Yojana’. We had decided to give ₹600 per quintal compensation to bajra growers as the prices of the crop is ₹1,650 per quintal in the open market. We will review the situation if the prices decline in the open market,” he said in Bhiwani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/resentment-in-haryana-bajra-growers-after-price-drop-101633550037809.html

Later, they removed barricades and took control of the main gate of the college. Police managed the law and order situation and ensured the minister’s visit from the backside of the college.Farm leader Joginder Talu said they protested against Dalal over Khattar’s statement.“Khattar has asked his workers to pick sticks and have a face-off with farmers but his minister left the meeting from the backside of the college. BJP is making all attempts to divide people,” he added.Interacting with the media, Dalal slammed the farmers for protesting outside the college.“If the agitators want to protest against me, they can visit my constituency. It is shameful that they took control of the main gate of the college where girls study. I had come to felicitate final year students with degrees but few agenda-based people blocked the main gate to disrupt the event,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-protest-against-jp-dalal-in-bhiwani-101633549737738.html
07-10-2021||Pune||As flyers express discontent, IAF says Pune airport closure was ‘inescapable’||PUNE Under criticism for shutting down Pune’s Lohegaon airport for 14 days starting October 16, in the middle of the festive season and on very short notice, the Indian Air Force (IAF), on Wednesday, said the move was “inescapable” and airline officials were informed about tentative dates in advance. According to an announcement, Lohegaon airport, which is currently only operating during the day, since will remain completely shut from October 16-29, due to the runway being re-carpeted. The 14-day complete closure was earlier planned from April 26 till May 9, but had to be deferred. In its statement IAF said, “To address the issue of the rapidly deteriorating condition of the runway and associated operating surfaces at Air Force Station Pune, runway resurfacing was an urgent requirement. The aim is to prevent any damage to engines of operating aircraft.” “Partial closure of the runway was undertaken at Pune for a period of 12 hours daily during the night, to cause least possible disturbance to civil aviation for a period of one year from October 26 2020 to October 25 2021, during which time the work progressed. According to IAF, the earlier announcement of closure in April had to be deferred as the Ministry of Defence asked for the postponement to avoid disruption of Covid-19 vaccine supply. “Due to the emergent requirement for transportation of Covid vaccines, the Ministry of Defence had directed us to defer the complete closure of the runway,” the IAF said. “The work of resurfacing, other than the central flexible portion of the runway is nearing completion. To ensure timely availability of runway post resurfacing, complete closure of 14 days is inescapable and was planned in the 3rd and 4th week of October. The tentative period of closure was intimated to all airline operators, local Airport Director and Airports Authority of India CHQ, well in advance. However, the exact dates of closure could be promulgated only after the requisite approvals were obtained from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Ministry of Defence. As per the present plan, flight operations would resume from October 30, 2021, before Diwali festival,” said the IAF statement, which came against the backdrop of severe criticism from flyers. Sudhir Mehta, chief managing director, Pinnacle Industries, and president of Mahratta Chamber of Commerce Industries & Agriculture, said in a tweet: “The closure of the Pune airport by the air force for 15 days with just 10 days notice could have been avoided, especially when so many vaccines are being transported . While the city shares the airport with the air force, it’s ultimately a national asset.” Currently, 55 flights are operating daily and daily footfall crossed the 10,000 mark recently. Before first Covid wave, 170 flights used to operate from the city airport. Siddharth Shirole, BJP MLA from Shivajinagar said, “There should have been proper communication from the Airport authority. They should have informed of it in advance to avoid last moment confusion.” Amit Paranjape, chairperson, IT & ITES Committee, Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA) in his tweet said, “Better support from the Center as well over the past two decades (and even today) would help. Everyone knows what the short term and long term solutions are... But no political leadership being seen on the ground at any level. Pune continues to suffer.” The IAF meanwhile clarified that during closure days, vaccines will be airlifted from Pune to Mumbai by deploying suitable IAF assets to ensure uninterrupted supply. Aviation analyst Dhairyasheel Vandekar, formerly in-charge of the Air India station in Pune, said, “Authorities should have kept plan-B ready in advance which could have helped the flyers.” “Some options should be finalised by airport authorities and airlines to connect flights with Mumbai airport and Shirdi Airport. Finding a slot should not be an issue as Mumbai airport is not running to 100 per cent strength and Shirdi airport also had many slots available,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/as-flyers-express-discontent-iaf-says-pune-airport-closure-was-inescapable-101633549557726.html
07-10-2021||Chandigarh||Lakhimpur Kheri violence: Police use water cannon to disperse AAP workers trying to lay siege to guv’s house||Demanding immediate dismissal of Union minister Ajay Mishra from the cabinet and the arrest of his son for the incident in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday staged a protest near the Punjab Raj Bhawan. The Chandigarh Police used water cannon to disperse the party workers who tried to lay siege to the governor’s house. The police had put up barricades near the MLA hostel to stop the protesters from proceeding towards the Raj Bhawan. When AAP supporters led by AAP legislature party deputy leader Saravjit Kaur Manuke tried to break the barricades, the police used the water cannon to disperse them. However, some party leaders, including Punjab affairs in-charge Jarnail Sigh and MLA Aman Arora managed to reach close to the governor’s house and were detained from there. Jarnail and Arora said the AAP, through the governor of Punjab, wanted to ask the Modi-led central government and the Yogi Adityanath government why they had not taken action against the Union minister and his son, according to a party release. Miffed Mann conspicuous by absence While MLAs Budh Ram, Baldev Singh, Kulwant Singh Pandori, Manjit Singh Bilaspur and Jai Singh Rodi participated in the protest, AAP state unit president Bhagwant Mann was conspicuous by his absence from the protest in Chandigarh. He was also not part of the delegation of state leaders led by Punjab affairs co-incharge Raghav Chadha that went to Lakhimpur Tekri. Mann is said to be upset over the Delhi leaders’ attempts to call the shots in the state unit as well as the delay in naming the chief ministerial (CM) face of the party for the upcoming state polls. The two-time Sangrur MP’s supporters have been campaigning for naming him as the party’s chief ministerial candidate. The AAP leadership has been non-committal so far as some central leaders have reservations about making him the face of the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-police-use-water-cannon-to-disperse-aap-workers-trying-to-lay-siege-to-guv-s-house-101633549497791.html

Under the leadership of CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan, all the schemes are being implemented in a better way in the interest of the people of the state. Every time I see this, I feel very happy. Madhya Pradesh has emerged as a leading state by doing commendable work in the field of land digitization.”The Svamitva Yojana, or ownership scheme involves mapping residential land ownership in the rural sector using geographic information system (GIS) mapping and is expected to revolutionise property record maintenance. For people in rural areas, the scheme, which will lead to the distribution of property cards in rural cards to those who possess property, will enable easier bank credit and end local property disputes.The Svamitva scheme was launched as a pilot project in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab and Karnataka. Now it will be introduced across the nation.“The land rights will strengthen the villages. People have to face land disputes and many difficulties for land ownership. People spend their savings to fight cases in court. Gandhiji also expressed concern about this situation. It is our responsibility to make improvements in this area,” PM Modi said, adding that he started working on the Svamitva scheme concept when he was still Gujarat chief minister.He continued. "Earlier the schemes were made for a section of farmers but we are making schemes to empower 80% marginal farmers,” he said, referring to the Kisan credit card, which he said, has brought relief to the farmers.“It has become easier for more than two crore farmers to get bank loans without any guarantee. An amount of ₹15 lakh crore has been deposited in the accounts under Mudra Scheme. We are depositing ₹6,000 in the accounts of farmers to support them,” he added.PM interacted with 3 Svamitva beneficiariesA beneficiary, Pawan Kumar, a resident of Hadiya village in Harda district, said people were surprised when the drone used for GIS mapping first arrived in the village. “The villagers named it chhota (small) helicopter. Later, they came to know about its importance”.Another beneficiary, Prem Singh of Dindori district, said the whole village knows about the scheme and they are happy with it.Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan also addressed the beneficiaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-a-leading-state-in-land-digitisation-pm-modi-praises-shivraj-singh-chouhan-101633548357960.html
07-10-2021||Lucknow||Rahul, Priyanka meet kin of farmers, journalist in Lakhimpur Kheri||Capping a day of hectic political developments, Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Wednesday night met the family members of two farmers and a journalist who were among the eight people killed in violence in the Tikunia area of Lakhimpur Kheri on Sunday (October 3).As the Uttar Pradesh government permitted Opposition leaders to visit Lakhimpur Kheri subject to certain restrictions, the two Congress leaders consoled the family members of Lovepreet Singh in Palia, Nachhatar Singh at Ramandeep Purwa in Dhaurahra and a journalist, Raman Kashyap, in Nigahasan.After meeting the family of Lovepreet, Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “Shared grief with the family of Lovepreet. But until justice is not done, this satyagraha will continue. Won’t forget your sacrifice, Lovepreet.”While leaving the house of journalist Raman Kashyap, Rahul Gandhi demanded the arrest of the accused persons and said: “Constitutional values are being violated”. After the Congress leaders met the three families, Priyanka said they would visit the rest of the families on Thursday. “All three families we met today are not satisfied with just monetary compensation. They want justice, which means the resignation of minister Ajay Mishra and the arrest of his son Ashish. If police can arrest me without a warrant what is stopping them from arresting Ashish Mishra,” she said.The Congress leaders reached the house of Nachhatar Singh around midnight and stayed for over 20 minutes.Before that, the meeting with Lovepreet’s family took place at Chaukhra farm in Palia, Lakhimpur Kheri, in the presence of Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel hours after the Uttar Pradesh government released Priyanka from nearly 55-hour detention in Sitapur and allowed her brother Rahul Gandhi to lead the party delegation to Lakhimpur Kheri.A large number of villagers were also there as the Congress leaders spent nearly half an hour with the family of Lovepreet, assuring them that the party was with the farmers and it would provide all the necessary help in their fight for justice.Earlier, the Congress leaders had left Sitapur for Lakhimpur Kheri around 6pm. Rahul, along with a Congress delegation comprising the chief ministers of Punjab and Chhatisgarh, went to meet Priyanka in Sitapur after landing at the Chaudhary Charan Singh Airport in Lucknow on Wednesday afternoon. Soon after their arrival, both Channi and Baghel announced relief of ₹50 lakh each to the families of those who died in the Lakhmpur Kheri violence.The permission for the visit to Lakhimpur Kheri was preceded by high drama.“BJP government’s permission (to go to Lakhimpur Kheri)! What for are they afraid?” said Rahul Gandhi in a tweet in Hindi even as Congress workers staged statewide protests demanding the release of Priyanka.The state government initially appeared reluctant to allow the Congress delegation led by Rahul Gandhi to reach the state capital on way to Lakhimpur Kheri. After allegedly being denied permission to board the flight to Lucknow, they were soon given boarding passes. When the delegation landed in Lucknow at about 1.30pm, the administration stopped them again.“I want to move out of the airport. They are not allowing me to move out. What kind of permission is this?” said Rahul Gandhi to media persons there.He sat on a dharna along with Channi and Baghel inside the airport. Although police stopped a number of them on way, a large number of Congress workers assembled outside the airport and shouted anti-government slogans.The district administration asked them not to move out of airport from the arrival gate. “We want to go (to Lakhimpur Kheri) in our car, but they (police) want to take us in their vehicle. I have asked them to go in my personal vehicle. They are planning something,” said Rahul Gandhi to media persons there.Rahul, in a video posted by the ANI, appeared to be heard telling district administration officials: “Are you deciding how I will go? Give me the rule that allows you to tell a citizen about how to go to any place.”District administration officials were heard replying “Sir, it’s a traffic jam here.” Rahul then said, “I move in a traffic jam every day.” District administration officials then replied, “We have made arrangements for you. Your vehicles are there at the VIP hangar. We are going to escort you till Sitapur border.” After high drama, Rahul, along with members of the Congress delegation, came out of the airport and left for Sitapur, where his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra joined him to go to Lakhimpur Kheri.Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot’s convoy was stopped near Moradabad on way to Lakhimpur Kheri Meanwhile, posters reading “nahi chahiye farzi sahanubhooti (don’t want fake sympathy)” came up in Lucknow on Wednesday.UP government spokesman Siddarth Nath Singh, speaking to media persons, also questioned Priyanka Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi for being adamant on visiting Lakhimpur in violation of prohibitory orders.“Anyone is free to meet the families of those who have lost their near and dear ones in Lakhimpur Kheri. But currently investigation is underway. They should wait for a few days and then go and meet,” he said.On a video of Priyanka Gandhi sweeping the floor of her guest house room where she has been kept in Sitapur, the UP minister said that it was good to see her joining PM Modi’s Swachhta campaign. Professor SK Dwivedi, head of the department of political science, Lucknow University, said “The BJP government has shown a soft attitude towards the opposition viewing that the public opinion may turn against it. The leaders of opposition parties are also guided by political interest with a view to gaining their sympathy in view of 2022 UP assembly elections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/rahul-priyanka-meet-kin-of-farmers-journalist-in-lakhimpur-kheri-101633548658789.html
07-10-2021||Chandigarh||PSPCL serves notice to 4 power plants to scrap PPAs||Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) on Wednesday served notice of termination of power purchase agreements (PPAs) to four private power generating plants with effect from October 31. The plants that have been served notices are Damodar Valley Corporation’s Durgapur (200MW share), Raghunathpur (300MW share), Bokaro (200MW share) and Meja Urja Power Project (85MW share). Till mid-June, the PSPCL was defending the PPAs by filing petitions before the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC). The decision came following the PSERC ruling saying that power is costly from generating stations of Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC), Kolkata, Pragati Power Corporation Limited and Meja Urja Nigam Power Private Limited, aggregating to 885MW. PSPCL chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) A Venu Prasad said the PSPCL has served notice to four power generating plants saying that it won’t buy electricity from October 31. The PSPCL notice says that the PPAs are not approved by the PSERC. “The PSPCL will not be in position to procure power from the above mentioned generating stations beyond October 31, 2021, and the PPA shall stand cancelled and terminated for all intended purposes,” the notice read. The PSERC had in September pulled up the PSPCL for purchasing power at high cost from some power generators, saying it was against the interest of consumers. The PSPCL’s proposal of procurement of 885MW of power on long-term basis from Meja, Pragati-III and DVC’s Raghunathpur, Durgapur & Bokaro stations at ₹5.53, ₹4.82, ₹4.61, ₹4.44 and ₹4.39 per unit, respectively, would not be an economically viable proposition, particularly so, when much cheaper power is available in the market, read PSERC ruling. The PSERC said that the PSPCL should buy power at not more than ₹3 per unit, including fixed and variable cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pspcl-serves-notice-to-4-power-plants-to-scrap-ppas-101633548657629.html

The private hospital group, Lokmanya hospitals, conducted the survey and claims to have found that the average person encountered during the drill showed little sympathy towards patients in an ambulance, as a result of which, time taken to travel a 30-minute distance would increase to 80 minutes. Civil problems like construction and commercial activities on the streets further added to the delay, ambulance drivers who were part of the drill claimed. The drill was conducted within a 10km radius from the Lokmanya hospital and covered areas like Senapati Bapat Marg, Pashan, Warje, Kothrud, Pimple Saudagar and Aundh. The drills were run in morning and evening rush hours, 10-12 am and 5-8 pm. The idea of the drill was also to emphasise the “golden hour”, the first 60 minutes during any medical emergency, critical in saving a patient’s life.The hospital used five ambulances for the seven day-drill which ended on October 4. Ambulance drivers claimed to have observed continued apathy from other vehicles on the road as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-pvt-hospital-s-mock-ambulance-drill-claims-to-expose-citizens-apathy-101633546617133.html

However, all other routes are operational... We have information on new routes to Ayodhya, Kushinagar, and Pithoragarh, and the connectivity from the civil terminal will improve further,” said Shobha Bhardwaj, director of the Sikandarpur civil terminal.The new routes will be popular as Ayodhya is famous for religious and historical importance, and Kushinagar is an important Buddhist pilgrimage site too, said the officials. Also, Pithoragarh -- located in Uttarakhand -- is a famous hill station.“It is now up to the respective airlines to start the operations. It is likely that the new routes will start soon,” Bhardwaj added.According to the officials, the civil terminal at Ghaziabad is proposed to operate flights to eight routes -- Nasik, Pithoragarh, Kannur, Hubli, Faizabad, Shimla, Jamnagar and Kalaburgi.The first flight from the civil terminal was made operational between Hindon and Pithoragarh on October 11, 2019, and the second route between Hindon and Hubli on November 6, 2019.

Only 2,500 people, wearing masks (a mandatory), will be allowed to attend the event at the Ramlila Ground, which sees a footfall of 5,000 people at the event every year,” said TS Chaurasia, president of SSDRC.Also, there won’t be swings or joyrides at the Ramlila Ground this year. “We will face heavy losses because of this, and the proprietors are unemployed and feeling dejected,” Chaurasia added.Meanwhile, only 2,000 people will be allowed to attend the SRMMC’s Ramlila event, which usually saw a footfall of 10,000 people. “We are grateful that we have been allowed to hold the Ramlila event this year, but it is a huge responsibility to ensure that all the Covid-19 protocols are in place. Several Covid response teams have been formed, under which, our volunteers will ensure that all the attendees wear masks during the event,” said Munna Sharma, general secretary of SRMMC.Sharma also said that apart this year, the committee will burn an effigy of the Covid-19 virus -- SARS-CoV-2 -- along with effigies of Raavan, Kumbhkaran and Meghnath during the celebrations.Apart from this, 90 food stalls have been set up at both the venues, against the usual 200.Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, Noida, said that the police have been tasked to ensure proper implementation of Covid-19 protocols at these venues. “In a first, such a grand event will be held in the city amidst the Covid-19 crisis. Last year, these celebrations were banned. Swings and joyrides tend to increase overcrowding at the grounds, especially among children, and we need to avoid that. So, only staging of Ramlila performances has been allowed this year,” Singh said.According to medical experts, any kind of social gathering will pose a risk of spread of the coronavirus infection. “Whether Ramlila fairs or any other social gathering, we should remember that the coronavirus infection is still here, and such events could become super-spreader events. People should follow all Covid-19 protocols, including wearing of masks, maintaining social distancing, and using hand sanitisers frequently,” said Dr NK Sharma, president of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Noida chapter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ramlila-celebrations-begin-in-gautam-budh-nagar-101633545896804.html
07-10-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad transport department suspends registrations of 1.12 lakh vehicles||The Ghaziabad regional transport office (RTO) has suspended registrations of nearly 112,791 types of vehicles after the owners failed to take no objection certificates (NOCs) for registering vehicles outside the national capital region (NCR) or for not cancelling the registrations, officials said on Wednesday.The decision was taken in view of the directions by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), which had banned the operations of over 15-year-old petrol vehicles and over 10-year-old diesel vehicles in the NCR on April 7, 2015, according to the officials. In an order on July 20, 2016, the tribunal had directed the department concerned to deregister such vehicles.The transport department, in this connection, issued a public notice on August 3, 2021, asking owners of such vehicles to either get an NOC and get the vehicles registered in 34 other districts outside the NCR region in Uttar Pradesh, or cancel registration of such vehicles.“As the 60-day notice period has lapsed, we have decided to suspend registrations of diesel vehicles which are over 10 years old and petrol vehicles which are over 15 years old. So, we suspended registrations for vehicles which were registered in the district from July 1, 2001, to September 30, 2006,” said Vishwajeet Pratap Singh, additional regional transport officer, Ghaziabad.“Prior to this period, we suspended registrations of nearly 84000 such vehicles, and more vehicles prior to it in accordance with the directions by the tribunal. Now, we have suspended nearly 1.12 lakh vehicles, and gave these vehicle owners six more months to get done with the process. If the vehicle owners apply for NOCs for registering their vehicles in districts outside the NCR during this period, the registrations will not be cancelled. Otherwise, we will cancel the registrations and they will not be able to get the NOCs too,” Singh added.Any such vehicle found plying on roads will be impounded, and strict action will be taken against the owners, said the officials, adding that vehicles with suspended registrations include vehicles having registration series as UP14N, UP14P and UP14Q to UP14Z, besides UP14AA to UP14AE.According to the transport department, nearly 2,488 diesel vehicles (older than 10 years) have taken NOCs, and registrations of 2,522 such vehicles have been cancelled till September 30.

07-10-2021||Noida||Noida authority to restart work on Chilla elevated road||The Noida authority is likely to restart work on the Chilla elevated road--a mega project aimed at providing seamless connectivity between Noida and Delhi that was stopped last year for shortage of funds. The authority has written a letter to the state government asking it to direct the public works department (PWD) to release funds for the project. In March last year, the authority asked the staff to stop work on the 5.5km Chilla elevated road due to financial crisis. This was first time that the board decided to halt work on such a big infrastructure project citing financial issues, said officials of the Noida authority adding that since then, the work on the project has been put on hold. The PWD and the Noida authorities are supposed to bear 50% costs of the project that is pegged at ₹605.30 crore. Since the PWD has not provided the funds for the project, the work was stopped in March last year. The Noida authority has already spent ₹74 crore on the project. “We are likely to restart work at the site as the funding issues are being resolved,” said Neha Sharma, additional CEO of the Noida authority.The Noida authority is also writing a letter to the UP government so that the funding issue can be resolved at the earliest and the works can be taken up on a priority basis. “We have taken up the matter with deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya. It was decided that the funding proposal will soon be approved by the state cabinet. Once it’s approved, the PWD will start releasing funds for the project,” Noida MLA Pankaj Singh, who pursued the funding issue with government after repeated appeals from residents. “The Chilla elevated road will benefit commuters travelling from and to Delhi and Noida once its constructed,” said an official from Noida authority. The authority started work on the elevated road on January 25, 2019, right after Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath laid the foundation stone for the project. The elevated road will ease traffic on the existing Noida-Delhi Link Road that connects Delhi’s Mayur Vihar with Noida Expressway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-authority-to-restart-work-on-chilla-elevated-road-101633545423105.html

How can we then hold the Ramlila when we don’t have the infrastructure ready at the moment,” said Rajesh Khanna, general secretary of the committee, adding that the preparations for the Ramlila took over a month.Ramlila celebrations usually begin on the first day of Navaratri, which falls on Thursday this year.“The Covid situation is under the control right now. We hope that this continues and we are able to hold the Ramlila in a grand manner next year,” he said.Khanna and other committee members said the Ramlila has only been disrupted thrice in recent history. “Last year, the Ramlila could not take place due to the pandemic. This year too, it will not take place. Before this, it did not take place in the period after Partition, in 1947-48. Ours is the oldest Ramlila of the city and it was supported by the Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar. There have been disruptions but hopefully, we will be able to hold the Ramlila from next year as before ,” said Vijay Saarthi, a committee member.Sanjay Bhargava, president of the Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, a traders body, said the Ramlila procession used to be a big highlight during the festival season and drew people from across the city. “Every day around 4pm, the procession would start from Esplanade Road and would end at the Ramlila maidan at Ajmeri Gate. For the entire duration of 9-10 days, residents would come out on the streets to watch the spectacle. There used to be a festive atmosphere for everyone, including residents and vendors,” said Bhargava.He said that the prospects of the Ramlila had dimmed over the past few years, with many residents moving out to different areas. “Pandemic affected the scale of the Ramlila but there are other reasons as well. The charm is gradually fading since people have moved to other areas,” said Bhargava.Meanwhile, other Ramlila committees are also holding muted celebrations this year on account of Covid concerns.Shri Dharmik Lila Committee, which has been organising the Ramlila since 1924, will hold celebrations over a five-day period. “We do not want to aggravate the pandemic situation and so, we will not hold the Ramlila the way we usually do. However, we will hold the Ramlila over a period of five days at the ISKCON Temple,” said Ravi Jain, a functionary of the committee.Delhi government spokesperson did not comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/one-of-the-oldest-ramlila-in-delhi-will-not-take-place-for-second-year-in-a-row-101633545056927.html
07-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt to start dust control campaign from October 7 to 29||Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai announced on Wednesday that the government will run a campaign from October 7 to 29 to curb dust pollution in the national Capital. At a press conference on Wednesday, the minister also said that the government will launch a web portal on Thursday to monitor all construction agencies’ compliance with dust control guidelines. “The project proponents found violating the norms will be issued a show-cause notice. Action will be taken against them if they fail to reply within two days. A stop work order will be issued along with hefty fines if they continue to violate norms,” Rai said. According to National Green Tribunal’s guidelines, violation of pollution control rules at construction sites will lead to the imposition of a fine ranging from ₹10,000 to ₹5 lakh. Rai said 31 teams, including 17 from Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and 14 from the Green Marshals (usually home guards), have been constituted to inspect construction sites and monitor the situation. The Delhi government, in September, issued a set of 14 guidelines for construction and demolition agencies to curb dust pollution. Officials of the government had also conducted meetings with major construction agencies operating in the city to ensure that all pollution control measures are followed on sites. The 14-point guidelines stated that construction sites should be covered from all sides using tin sheds, construction material must be covered with sheets, and roads leading to sites must be paved to avoid any dispersion of road and construction dust. Agencies constructing in an area over 20,000 square metres will also have to deploy anti-smog guns to ensure that dust settles. Vehicles carrying construction material should also be covered. There should be no collection of construction and demolition (C&D) waste on the roadside. Besides, the grinding of stones will not be allowed in the open, the guidelines said. The minister said all agencies involved in construction activities will be required to mandatorily register on the web portal. “All construction agencies will have to comply with the checklist, conduct self-audits and upload a self-declaration on a fortnightly basis,” Rai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-start-dust-control-campaign-from-october-7-to-29-101633544757003.html
07-10-2021||Delhi||EDMC to cancel building plan if debris is not dumped properly||In a bid to reduce dust-related air pollution arising from the dumping of construction and demolition (C&D) waste in east Delhi, the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EMC) announced that it may cancel approved building plans if the owners or builders fail to safely dispose of the waste.Builders are supposed to dispose of the waste at the Shastri Park construction and demolition waste processing plant. EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand issued an orderon Tuesday stating that developers and builders will have to deposit C&D waste in the Shastri Park facility. “If they fail to do so, we will undertake punitive action and even approved building plans can be cancelled,” the commissioner’s order states.The order issued on Tuesday states: “It has been observed that many owners and builders are not disposing the C&D waste at the Shastri Park processing plant which is a violation of orders issued in 2018 and attract penal action. The junior engineers JEs (building) have to take fortnightly round of the construction site in their area as there is urgent need to mitigate the pollution causing factors.”The order outlines a series of actions junior engineers, the nodal officers for managing the C&D waste, could take against builders/developers. “The owners/ builders will deposit the waste in Shastri Park facility and collect the receipts. The JEs will be responsible for collecting the receipts issued by the C&D plant in Shastri Park and shall issue challan for imposition of adequate penalty in case of violation,” the order said. The order added that executive engineers will submit a monthly report to EDMC headquarters regarding the disposal of C&D waste.EDMC mayor Shyam Sunder Aggarwal appealed to east Delhi residents to utilise the Shastri Park facility. “We notice people dumping their malba on roadsides and along drains. This not only leads to traffic jams but is also harmful in terms of air pollution. The Shastri Park facility is available free of cost for residents and people should co-operate,” he added. The 500-tonne per day capacity processing plant at Shastri Park was one of the first such facilities to come up in the country. Delhi has also developed three more such plants in Burari, Rani Khera and Bakarwala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/edmc-to-cancel-building-plan-if-debris-is-not-dumped-properly-101633544456737.html
07-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi gets 27 new oxygen plants, Satyendar Jain says will aid Covid fight||The Delhi government on Wednesday inaugurated 27 oxygen plants and two cryogenic refilling plants across public hospitals in the city, as part of its preparations to bolster the Capital’s medical capabilities to tackle any future Covid-19 surges.The pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants inaugurated on Wednesday added 31 metric tonnes to the city’s oxygen production capacity, and the refilling plants are of 12 metric tonnes capacity.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said, “The Delhi government is taking complete precaution regarding Covid-19, in light of the coming festival season. The government has already put in place a graded response system in the public domain. Presently, only three to five infected people are being tested positive for every 10,000 Covid-19 tests. The graded response system will kick in when the Capital will report five positive cases against 1,000 tests a day,” he said.According to the response plan, seen by HT, the first curbs are triggered when the Covid-19 test positivity rate crosses 0.5%, or new cases over a week exceeds 1,500, or if there are more than 500 oxygen beds occupied on average over a seven-day period. The plan classifies an outbreak into four bands, with an ascending order of severity – yellow, amber, orange and.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal inaugurated five plants in May this year and 22 in June. As the state and Centre ramp up health care infrastructure in the Capital, 73 PSA plants with a total capacity of 77.80MT are being installed in the city’s hospitals. Of these, 10 plants of 22.50MT have been commissioned in central government hospitals under the PM-Cares Fund, and these will be inaugurated on October 7, 2021. Besides, the health minister on Wednesday inaugurated two bottling plants with a capacity of 12.5MT at Siraspur. These have the capacity to refill 1,400 jumbo cylinders in 24 hours, the government said in a statement. The Kejriwal government in early August this year approved the “Medical Oxygen Production Promotion policy - 2021”, which gives the private sector a range of incentives as well to set up oxygen production plants, storage facilities and procure oxygen tankers. “This policy will help improve the availability of oxygen in Delhi, which became a major constraint while handling the previous Covid-19 waves. This policy has been made with the objective of making Delhi self-sufficient in the production of medical oxygen to deal with the situation of any medical emergency in future,” the government statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-gets-27-new-oxygen-plants-satyendar-jain-says-will-aid-covid-fight-101633544336481.html
07-10-2021||Delhi||Three Nigerians held with 1.3 kg heroin in southwest Delhi’s Mohan Garden||Three men from Nigeria, who were allegedly involved in smuggling and circulation of heroin in the national capital, were arrested and around 1.3 kg of heroin were seized from them, police said on Wednesday.Police said that three men had rented two rooms in a building in southwest Delhi’s Mohan Garden area, where they mixed the heroin with chemicals to manufactured fine quality heroin, before supplying it to people in different parts of the city.Police identified the men as Henry Okolie (41), Uchechukwu Peter (37), and Stanley Chimeize Alasonye (41). Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Shankar Chaudhary said the drugs were bought from Nigeria, through Russia, and was smuggled into the country via the porous borders of Bangladesh and Nepal.“They also used Indian ports and were living without a valid visa. Alasonye was the leader of the gang,” Chaudhary said.Heroin is one of the most common drugs smuggled into the national capital. From the villages of districts in Uttar Pradesh ,Madhya Pradesh and counties such as Myanmar, Afghanistan and Nigeria, there are different sources of heroin in Delhi.In 2020, police seized about 94.27 kg heroin from different people. Marijuana was the most common drug seized -- over 4,396 kg -- by police in the Capital last year.In the latest case, police said the arrests on October 1 came about after a police officer, acting on a tip-off, stopped Okoluie and Peter, who were on a scooter, in Mohan Garden. DCP Chaudhary said the police found two heroin packets of 500 gm each, concealed in their pocket. A subsequent raid at their house in R Extension block revealed a “factory” on the top floor and later led to Alasonye’s arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/three-nigerians-held-with-1-3-kg-heroin-in-southwest-delhi-s-mohan-garden-101633543976442.html
07-10-2021||Delhi||13 years in the making, Kishan Ganj underpass in Delhi to be opened in January||The Kishan Ganj underpass in north Delhi, one of the most delayed infrastructure projects in the city, is likely to be completed by January 2022, just ahead of the upcoming municipal corporation elections, officials overseeing its work said on Wednesday.More than two decades after it was approved by the erstwhile unified Municipal Corporation of Delhi and 13 years after the work started, only one of four underpass sections is complete and open to traffic.A senior North Delhi Municipal Corporation official, who is overseeing the project, said the three remaining concrete box sections under the railway line have been laid by the Northern Railway, which is currently carrying out the finishing work and the construction of the retention wall, before the site is handed over to the north corporation.“Around 5% work remains. Once the site is handed over to the corporation, we will start constructing six 150m long approach roads -- three on each end of the underpass boxes. The approach roads will cost around ₹16 crore,” the official said, asking not to be named.“We have sought the approval of the finance department for the approach road construction and we expect the nod to come in about a month. By then, the Northern Railway would have completed the remaining work,” the official quoted above said.The civic body plans to open the entire underpass, which will link central Delhi with west Delhi, by January 2022, the official said. The project, once fully opened, will benefit the areas of Inderlok, Gulabi bagh, Sarai Rohila, Kishanganj, Padam Nagar, Pratap Nagar, Tri Nagar, Shanti Nagar and Rampura and nearby areas. The project is also expected to decongest Sadar Bazar, Rohtak Road, areas under Walled City extension and Azad Market, the official said.Although the three concrete boxes were laid in June, the handover to the north corporation was delayed on account of heavy rainfall, the construction of retention walls and encroachments near one of the three sections, said civic officials.But a Northern Railway official, overseeing the project, said the municipal corporation can start the work on approach roads to two underpass sections. “The underpass boxes were installed in June. In July, we wrote to the municipal corporation that it can initiate work on approach roads but nothing was done so far. Underpass sections 2 and 3 can easily be made operational. Only section 4 is hindered by encroachments -- about 25 shanties have come up in front of the box,” the official said, also asking not to be named. He said the retention wall will be ready in 15 days.Similar to the Rani Jhansi flyover near St Stephen’s Hospital, which took almost 10 years to build and was opened in 2018, the Kishan Ganj project, too, has witnessed several delays and changes.Conceptualised in the early 1990s, the project was approved by the unified MCD in 1998. But the construction started only on June 30, 2008, and the underpass was expected to be ready by the 2010 Commonwealth Games at a cost of ₹25 crore.One of the four boxes was inaugurated in 2018, by then Union minister Dr Harsh Vardhan. In 2019, the ministry of housing and urban affairs decided to provide 80% funding to the project so that the remaining sections are completed.But delays still dogged the project. Corporation officials say the financial crunch that the civic body faced over the years, as well as hurdles in land acquisition, the time taken to shift utilities, and the relocation of existing shops and religious structures ended up delaying the project even more.“More than 200 shops had to be shifted from the site. Two transformer substations were relocated and five religious structures were also moved from the work site,” the civic body official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/13-years-in-the-making-kishan-ganj-underpass-in-delhi-to-be-opened-in-january-101633543744666.html
07-10-2021||Lucknow||UPPCL engineers’ demand for higher pay boomerangs||The demand by Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) engineers for a hike in their existing pay scales has apparently boomeranged on them. The state government has, instead, questioned the very logic of the heavily loss-ridden corporation providing higher salaries to its engineers and other personnel than what the government employees are entitled to.The development comes when the engineers are organising protests to demand, among other things, higher pay scales. In this backdrop, special secretary (energy) Bhawani Singh Khangaraut on Wednesday wrote a letter to the UPPCL managing director (MD), questioning the basis of the Assured Career Progression Scheme (ACPS) that UPPCL implemented for its employees in variance with the one available to the state government employees.The ACP scheme envisages placement of employees in the higher pay-scale/grant of financial benefits (through financial upgrade) even if they are not promoted to the next level after a particular period.Referring to the UPPCL director’s (personnel and appointment) letter dated February 16, 2021, Singh, in his letter, pointed out that the revised pay-scales as recommended by the sixth pay commission had been in effect in UPPCL since January 1, 2006.“Under the revised pay structure, UPPCL personnel get time-bound pay-scales/ACP after an interval of nine years, 14 years and 19 years whereas the state government employees are entitled to the same after an interval of 10 years, 16 years and 26 years,” he said in the letter.“It is important to note that the UPPCL approved higher pay-scales to its employees deviating from the government’s policy decision despite the corporation having very high cumulative losses/deficit because of which energy corporations are facing unnecessary financial burden,” the officer added.The government not only rejected the UPPCL’s proposal for further upgrading engineers’ pay-scales, but also asked the management to explain the reasons why the corporation provided higher pay-scales to its officers and other personnel ignoring earlier government orders (GOs) in this regard.UPPCL engineers, according to people dealing with the issue, get one of the highest salaries and best perks in the state despite the corporation’s fragile financial state. “A person who joins as a junior engineer in UPPCL gets more than ₹2 lakh per month before five years of his retirement. Similarly, anybody joining as an assistant engineer gets a monthly salary of between ₹2.75 lakh and ₹3 lakh five years before retirement as executive engineer/superintending engineer/ chief engineer,” they said. “Apart from this, they also have access to use of unmetered electricity and full medical expenses to their and their dependents’ treatment even after retirement,” they added. UPPCL, according to the information sourced from the UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC), currently spends around ₹2800 crore annually on its employees in terms of salaries and perks. UP Rajya Vidyut Parishad Abhyanta Sangh general secretary Prabhat Singh, however, said, that there were serious discrepancies in the pay scales of assistant engineers and the same must be corrected because highly educated AEs get less salary than junior engineers and this, according to him, was demoralising for them. “We demand the management/government to fix the appointment grade of AEs at ₹6600 and the third ACP grade at ₹11000,” he stressed. UPPCL engineers’ monthly salaries (approx) before five years of retirement is as follows: Junior engineer (More than ₹2 lakh), executive engineer ( ₹2.50 lakh) and superintending engineer ( ₹3 lakh).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uppcl-engineers-demand-for-higher-pay-boomerangs-101633543616153.html
07-10-2021||Delhi||SC declines urgent hearing on Delhi govt’s plea against GNCTD Act||The Supreme Court on Wednesday declined to entertain a plea by the Delhi government to urgently hear its challenge to the new law for the National Capital Territory (NCT) that gives primacy to the Lieutenant Governor in several executive and legislative matters. “Yesterday also Delhi government was mentioning a matter for urgent listing. Today also it is happening. Do we have to hear the Delhi government every day? We will see,” Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana told senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who represented the Delhi government. Singhvi tried to persuade the bench that the CJI on September 13 entertained his plea to list the case, but the matter has still not come up for hearing. The senior counsel also sought to distinguish between the different cases filed by the Delhi government. “This is the petition on the Government of National Capital Territory (Amendment) Act, 2021, (or GNCT Act) which is contrary to the constitution bench judgement of the Supreme Court. We are saying it is against Article 239A (which deals with the status of Delhi) under the Constitution,” submitted Singhvi. Justice Ramana, however, did not accept the request to specify a hearing date. A day ago, the Delhi government sought a hearing of its plea to settle the contentious issue of who should control administrative services and bureaucrats in Delhi after the split verdict of two judges in February 2019. The CJI agreed to list this matter after the Diwali break. Earlier, on September 13, Singhvi mentioned the petition regarding the 2021 GNCT Act, arguing that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government’s plea should be listed urgently, as it was cleared by the apex court’s registry on August 19. The Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha passed the GNCT Amendment Act in March. After the Parliament approved the bill, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal termed it a “sad day for Indian democracy”. The amended Act has changed four provisions of the National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991. The new law makes it mandatory for the Delhi government to seek the opinion of the Lieutenant Governor (LG) before taking any executive action in pursuance of decisions by the council of ministers, or any other decision under any law in force in the Capital. Another contentious amendment seeks to invalidate retrospectively rules made by the legislative assembly of Delhi or committees/house panels to consider the matters of “day-to-day administration of the Capital” or conduct inquiries in relation to the administrative decisions. The Delhi government, in its petition before the top court, has maintained that the 2021 law is contrary to two judgments by the Supreme Court: a Constitution bench verdict on July 4, 2018 and a two-judge bench decision on February 14, 2019. The Kejriwal-government, in its petition, has told the Supreme Court that the new law is unconstitutional because it has in effect “disenfranchised” the people of Delhi by taking away power from their elected representatives, striking at the root of representative democracy and violating the law-making power of Delhi assembly, recognised under Constitution and decisions of the Supreme Court. “The Amendment Act, by giving LG overriding powers over the Delhi legislature and the executive, strikes at the root of representative democracy giving LG the power to veto the will of the people of Delhi…from expressing their sovereign will through their elected representatives,” said the petition, filed through advocate Shadan Farasat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sc-declines-urgent-hearing-on-delhi-govt-s-plea-against-gnctd-act-101633543436558.html

According to police, two other daughters, Mehak (13) and Monika (8), managed to flee while Sushila tried in vain wake up the twins and escape before the house erupted in flames. Monika sustained 30% burns during the incident and is currently undergoing treatment.Sushila’s husband Rajesh had left for work just 10-15 minutes before the incident.Talking to HT, Rajesh said that he was not even halfway through when he got a call from a neighbour about the fire. “I was taken aback and rushed back home. The flames were erupting from everywhere. I could not even hear anyone screaming but was told that a few minutes ago, they could hear my wife and kids crying for help, and that it stopped one after the other. My daughter Mehak told me that she was cooking when suddenly, there was a gas leakage and fire following it. She told me that they were all trying to escape but since her siblings were asleep when the fire broke out, my wife took more time to get them outside. Mehak was awake so she rushed out on her mother’s command, but the others got stuck inside and couldn’t escape,” he said.Deputy commissioner of police (central) Shweta Chauhan said when the police team reached the house, four people were found with burn injuries and were rushed to Ram Manohar Lohia hospital in a PCR van. “Fire was caused due to leakage in a rubber pipe which connects the cylinder to the burner... Rajesh was away at his workplace at Lawrence Road where he works at an Atta chakki,” said DCP Chauhan.The DCP said the woman was declared brought dead to RML hospital and the twins died during treatment on Tuesday evening.“Although the cylinder did not explode, the leakage of the gas caused the fire to spread rapidly and the victims couldn’t escape. Inquest proceedings are being done,” said the cop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-woman-two-kids-dead-as-fire-breaks-out-after-gas-leak-in-anand-parbat-101633542536022.html
07-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab records 260 farm fires; Amritsar accounts for 60%||Even as paddy harvesting is yet to pick up the pace due to a delayed monsoon withdrawal, Punjab has already reported 260 cases of stubble burning, with Amritsar district alone accounting for over 60% of these incidents. According to data available with the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), the state’s Majha region, where harvesting begins earlier than in other areas, 199 farm fires have been reported between September 15 and October 4. These include 161 incidents in Amritsar, 34 in Tarn Taran and four in Gurdaspur. In Pathankot, harvesting is yet to begin. Malwa region, which comprises 15 districts in south Punjab, accounts for 52 cases, while Doaba region, comprising Jalandhar, Kapurthala, SBS Nagar and Hoshiarpur, has recorded only nine cases. Also read: Farm fires in Punjab, Haryana appear on Nasa ‘red dot’ mapA quick and cheap way to prepare soil bed for the next crop, widespread farm fires reduce the air quality to dangerous levels in the region, with winds carrying pollutants up to the national capital every year. Amid delayed harvesting, there has been around 80% drop in incidents this year, as 1,216 cases were reported in the corresponding period in 2020. However, scientists and environmentalists have warned that farm fires in north India are likely to be more intense than in previous years, considering the delayed monsoon withdrawal from the region. On Wednesday, the air quality index was recorded at 70 in Amritsar. Though in the “satisfactory” range so far, it could quickly turn “poor” if stubble burning incidents continue in the coming days, say experts. Farmers say they need incentivesHowever, farmers say they are forced to burn the paddy stubble despite knowing its environmental consequences. “We know that stubble burning not only pollutes the environment, but also damages the fertility of our fields. We have been demanding that adequate machinery be provided to us through village-level societies for stubble management besides a bonus of ₹200 per quintal. But, the government is doing nothing,” says Kisan Sangharsh Committee (KSC)’s state convener Kawalpreet Singh Pannu. Also read: Air quality commission asks states to follow ISRO protocolHarminder Singh, a social activist based in Jalaldiwal village near Raikot in Ludhiana, says besides fuel prices, the rates of engine oil and grease have jacked up exponentially, making it unviable for small farmers to pursue in-situ stable management. “Even with subsidies, the farmers are paying ₹25,000 extra for buying a super seeder,” he says, adding that delay in monsoon withdrawal has furthered shortened the window to prepare the fields for wheat sowing, which takes place in the first half of November. Govt steps up efforts to curb menace PPCB chairman Adarshpal Vig says the government is open for suggestions and is eager to work in coordination with farmers. “We can resolve this problem only with combined efforts. We have also roped in the industrial to use stubble,” he says. Meanwhile, district administrations have stepped up efforts to create awareness among farmers. In Majha region, agriculture department officials have been visiting villages and making announcements from gurdwaras to encourage farmers not to burn paddy stubble. “Our teams are in the field, organising awareness camps against stubble burning. Those farmers who are not burning stubble will be honoured,” says Kuljit Singh Saini, who is the chief agriculture officer for Amritsar and Tarn Taran. In Jalandhar, which has reported six cases so far, deputy commissioner Ghanshyam Thori has announced ₹50,000 cash reward for panchayats that encourage farmers to shun stubble burning. Deepti Uppal, Thori’s counterpart in the neighbouring Kapurthala district, says strict vigil is being kept at villages that have reported a high number of stubble burning cases in the past. “We have also arranged 3,500 machines for managing paddy stubble across the district and designated nearly 70 acres of shamlat land for storing paddy bales,” she says.

They had received support from farmer leader Rakesh Tikait.With the Uttar Pradesh government agreeing to their demand, a second post-mortem was conducted on Tuesday night by a team of experts from Lucknow, superintendent of police Sujata Singh said.Hours after this, Gurvinder Singh was cremated by his family members in his village in the presence of Tikait, ADG (Gorakhpur) Akhil Kumar and senior police and administration officials, additional superintendent of police (Rural) Ashok Kumar said. Farmer leader Tajinder Singh Virk was also present at the funeral.ASP Ashok Kumar said security personnel were deployed in the area as a precautionary measure. He added that the situation was under control.District magistrate Dinesh Chandra Singh said the family members of Gurvinder Singh had raised objections on the autopsy done earlier.“With the permission of the state government, it was done again and videographed as well,” he added.Sukhdev Singh, uncle of Gurvinder Singh, said, “Post-mortem was done in front of us and our leaders. At that time doctors told us that Gurvinder was not shot.”Two doctors designated by the family members of Gurvinder were also present during the post-mortem.“When in both post-mortems, doctors say that he was not shot, we had no option left but to cremate him,” Sukhdev Singh added.The mortal remains of the three other farmers were cremated at their native places on Tuesday.Eight people were killed in violence during a protest against the farm laws in Lakhimpur Kheri on Sunday (October 3).

He included Nighasan journalist Raman Kashyap among the deceased, saying “he is a farmer first, irrespective of his profession.”Tikait, who is among the prominent leaders of the agitation against the Centre’s agri laws, had brokered the agreement between the authorities and the farmers on October 4 here, after which they had ended their protest and the families of the four deceased farmers had agreed to their post-mortem.After reaching an understanding, ADG of police (law and order) Prashant Kumar, in the presence of Tikait, had informed of the government’s decision to give ₹45 lakh each to families of the victim farmers and set up a judicial probe under a retired high court judge.“Our protest has not ended. We will wait till eight days since the agreement and if the demands are not fulfilled, a nationwide agitation would be launched,” Tikait told reporters at a Gurdwara in Lakhimpur city. The deadline coincides with the 10th-day Antim Ardas ceremony (post-death ritual) in the Sikh community.An FIR under section 302 of IPC (murder) has already been registered against the union minister’s son Ashish Mishra and others in the incident in Tikonia police station.Tikait said the pact with the government was reached after consulting the victims’ families and farmers, and everybody had expressed “satisfaction” over it.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha leader had reached the incident site in the wee hours on Monday, after four farmers were allegedly mowed down by an SUV on October 3.On Tuesday, Tikait visited the family of Gurvinder Singh, one of the four dead farmers, in Bahraich and backed their demand for a second post mortem examination, which the government agreed to, and his last rites were performed this morning.The mortal remains of the other three farmers were cremated on Tuesday.“How can he (minister Mishra) remain a Union minister of home affairs when his son is facing such a serious charge? For an unbiased probe in the matter, the Centre must sack the minister,” said BKU media in-charge Dharmendra Malik.The BKU leader said the three others, who were killed in the violence, fell to mob fury. “When 4-5 people were killed and 15 to 20 got injured after being mowed down, the furious mob expressed their anger,” he added.When asked about minister Ajay Kumar Mishra’s statement that he and his son were not on the crime spot on Sunday, Tikait said: “The minister is defending himself. He is an accused under Section 120B and must resign.”Tikait said gunshots were fired during Tikonia violence and there were videos to substantiate that.On the agitation against the three farm laws, the BKU leader said: “The agitation would continue till the repeal of these laws and enactment of law on minimum support price (MSP).” Inputs from agency||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lakhimpur-violence-tikait-warns-of-nationwide-stir-if-minister-s-son-not-arrested-within-time-frame-101633529154208.html
07-10-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra bans garba, dandiya and processions for Navratri||The Maharashtra government has prohibited garba, dandiya and other cultural celebrations for Navratri, to be celebrated between October 7 and October 15. It has restricted the height of the idols to four feet for community pandals and two feet for household celebrations. It has asked the organisers of community pandals to make arrangements for online darshans and banned more than five people at a time in community pandals. It has further prohibited processions and foods and beverages in community pandals.An order with detailed guidelines was issued by the state home department on Monday. Even though the second wave of Covid-19 has gone, the threat of Covid-19 is still looming large and thus crowding to celebrate the festival will not be a good idea. It is necessary for the people to take all sorts of precautions, while celebrating Navratri, said the state government in its circular.“Do not organize garba, dandiya or any other cultural programmes. Instead, give priority to organise health camps such as blood donation and awareness programmes for prevention of Covid-19, malaria and dengue, among others. The community mandals should make arrangements for online darshan of the idols through cable network, website, Facebook and other social media platforms, stated the circular.“Do not allow more than five people at a time in community pandals. Foods and beverages have also been strictly prohibited in the community pandals. Ensure no crowding while holding bhajan, aarti and kirtan and noise pollution norms are also followed. The same rules will be applicable even for the Rawan Dahan event,” it added.“Do not organise any procession either for home arrival or immersions of the idols. The traditional ‘aarti’ shall be performed at home, instead of the immersion places. Children and senior citizens should avoid going for immersions,” it stated.The state government further asked the people to avoid traditional idols and use idols made up of metal or marble for worshipping. If the idols installed are made of clay or are eco-friendly, then they can be immersed at home itself. If not possible at home, the idols should be immersed in a nearby artificial pond.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-bans-garba-dandiya-and-processions-for-navratri-101633364476467.html

And the process for establishing labs in Parwan, Laghman and Kapisa is also underway.After completion of these facilities, Afghanistan will have 36 WHO-supported labs.The UN health body sent life-saving medicines and medical supplies to 360 health facilities in Afghanistan since August in an attempt to cover the health needs of 3.9 million people.On Wednesday, supplies were sent to two hospitals in Kabul and WHO provincial offices for onward distribution. The supplies will cover the health needs of 50,000 people in Afghanistan, the organisation stated, according to Khaama Press.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-says-covid-19-testing-vaccination-declining-in-afghanistan-since-august-report-101633630107871.html

Bush said today the United States had begun military strikes against the Taliban regime and Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda network, both in Afghanistan.A first wave of 50 cruise missiles bracketed the country, the beginning of what is likely to be a sustained assault on Taliban military targets and Al-Qaeda installations.Meanwhile, there were also reports of fighting on the Iran Afghanistan border.Bush, in a simultaneous television address from Washington, said US-led military forces were taking "targetted action." He noted how, after the terrorist attacks of September 11, the US had demanded the Taliban hand over the terrorist mastermind, Bin Laden.“None of those demands were met and now the Taliban will pay a price," said Bush. He said the US was "supported by the will of the world." Bush signalled that the war on terror would not end with the assault on Afghanistan. "Every nation has a choice to make in this conflict. There is no neutral ground."He said it would be a long war, but "We will win this conflict through the patient accumulation of successes." Pentagon sources said Tomahawk cruise missiles were launched from ships and submarines in the Arabian Sea.The official said targets included air defences, military communication sites and terrorist training camps inside Afghanistan. The cruise missiles were followed by a wave of fighter-bombers. In northern Afghanistan, helicopters were sighted.UK Prime Minister Tony Blair later made a statement in London saying British submarines had participated in the attack. He said of the Taliban, "They were given the choice of siding with justice or siding with terror and they chose terror."The first explosions could be heard about 8.57 pm Afgan time. Thunderous explosions and the rattle of aging anti-aircraft fire were heard Sunday night in Kabul as the cruise missile and airborne munitions began hitting the Afghan capital. Power went off, plunging the city into darkness.The explosions seemed to have been concentrated in the south-west of Kabul. The firing tapered off for a few minutes, but resumed after the sound of jet aircraft over the city could be heard."A huge plume of smoke is rising near Kabul airport," said the Afghan Islamic Press agency. The city's residents, inured to war, were reported to be showing no signs of panic.CNN reported explosions in Jalalabad in northeastern Afghanistan. Explosions also rocked Kandahar, the spiritual capital of the Taliban mullahs. Kandahar's airport control tower was damaged, said a Taliban source over telephone. Qatar's Al Jazeera television network said the strikes had levelled the Taliban headquarters in Kandahar."We condemn this attack," said Rehmantullah Kakazada, the Taliban consul-general in Karachi. "We are ready for jihad," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ht-this-day-october-8-2001-us-begins-attacks-against-afghanistan-101633628963602.html

The decision was prompted by “the continued spread of Covid-19, local clinical conditions around IBM sites, and the reality that vaccines are readily available nationwide,” a company spokeswoman said in a statement. “As we’ve said throughout the pandemic, IBM’s health and safety practices are driven by science.”CNBC earlier reported on the mandate. In June, IBM told US employees to return to the office by September but was then forced to shut down New York City locations amid rising Covid-19 cases in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ibm-tells-us-staff-to-get-vaccine-by-december-8-or-face-suspension-101633628451486.html

Mohammad, who lives in California, has been fighting ever since to be reunited with his sons, who are now 9 and 11, and are moving from house-to-house, living in hiding with their grandmother and uncle, he said. He asked that only his first name be used to protect them.On Thursday, the International Refugee Assistance Project, whose lawyers are working on his behalf, filed a lawsuit in a federal court in San Francisco against Secretary of State Antony Bilken, alleging the administration failed in its legal obligations under the Afghan Allies Protection Act to help his family despite his work for the U.S. government during the 20-year war there.“The only thing that I want is just one hug" from my kids, Mohammad said.Mohammad said he has repeatedly asked the U.S. government for help. He contacted the State Department in August after bullets pierced the home where his sons were hiding before the Taliban took control of the country. He asked for his children to be evacuated as the U.S. military conducted one of the largest airlifts in history, but they were left behind.The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Mohammad communicates daily with his sons either through calls or texts.His youngest has broken down crying, asking, “Dad, are they going to kill me?”“What can I say?” Mohammad asks.He sent another letter to the State Department on Sept. 9 asking that his sons be granted humanitarian parole, but again he said he got no response. He also contacted his California lawmakers.Mohammad was approved for a special immigrant visa in January and applied the next month for his sons, requesting that their visa applications be expedited because they are in “imminent danger.” Their applications are still pending.The lawsuit states that “removing his children from Afghanistan, where they are in daily peril, and reuniting them with their only remaining parent is essential to their survival and wellbeing.”“At this point the government has known since mid-August at minimum that these kids are alone and in serious danger, and they didn't take any action to protect them," said lawyer Alexandra Zaretsky of the New York-based International Refugee Assistance Project.Zaretsky said Mohammad is one of thousands of Afghans who worked for the U.S. government in Afghanistan and were forced to leave behind close family members to be able to get to safety. Many are still fighting to be reunited with them. The administration has provided no figures for how many special immigrant visa applicants and their family members are still stuck in Afghanistan a month after the U.S. withdrew its troops, and it has yet to take substantial action to protect them, according to the lawsuit.Mohammad said he wants his sons to know that his work in promoting women's rights in Afghanistan for a program funded by the U.S. government was worth it, even if many of those advances may vanish under the new Taliban government.He said he also wants them to see “because of my loyal service to the United States,” they have the chance to come to a good country like the U.S. where “your future is guaranteed" and they can get a "good education and other rights that human beings should have."He tries to encourage them not to give up, though he is losing faith in his words.“I'm giving them hope whenever I am talking to them, but I’m also thinking, ‘But is this even possible? Are they ever going to be reunited with me here?'" he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dad-who-fled-afghanistan-sues-us-to-reunite-with-young-sons-101633625313679.html

The minister updated the summit on the state of the ties highlighting the first in-person bilateral meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden and then of the Quad with Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia and then Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga of Japan.S Jaishankar recalled the Five Ts proposed by Narendra Modi for the way forward for the bilateral relationship with the US - Tradition, Technology, Trade, Talent and Trusteeship. He said the spirit of the Five T as proposed by the prime minister also “permeates” the Quad.Focusing on the bilateral relationship, the foreign minister said, “What is noteworthy about our conversations is that they have gone well beyond general arguments, and are now expressed as specific initiatives, or programmes, considering some of the recent developments.”S Jaishankar listed out an entire range of discussions and issues that the two sides are tackling - technology trade, climate change, infrastructure, defence and people-to-people cooperation.And he added, “We not only work together on global issues, but are dedicated to the well being of the global commons that provides the basis for coordinated action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indiaus-ties-quad-more-collaborative-era-for-businesses-says-s-jaishankar-101633624563837.html

Pfizer vaccine has shown the efficacy of 94-95% in preventing symptomatic Covid-19 seven days after the second shot of the two-dose regimen, however, the data on the durability of vaccines are still limited.The incidence of symptomatic Covid-19 has been increasing in Israel despite high vaccine coverage and effectiveness, prompting researchers to study whether it is due to waning immunity after the receipt of two doses of Pfizer’s BNT162b2 vaccine. More than 4,800 healthcare professionals participated in the 6-month longitudinal prospective study.The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that the neutralising antibody level substantially decreased six months after the second dose of Pfizer vaccine, especially among participants 65 years of age or older. It also suggested that neutralizing antibody concentrations among persons 65 years of age or older were at a lower level than participants between 18 to 45 years of age.Also Read | When Pfizer Covid vaccine for children may be rolled out? White House adviser answersThe neutralizing antibody concentrations were lower in men 65 years of age or older as than women in the same age group. The neutralizing antibody titers declined briskly in the period of up to 80 days after the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, but slowed afterwards, according to the study.“Particularly vulnerable populations with lower neutralizing titers were older men and participants with immunosuppression,” the authors wrote.While obesity is associated with severe Covid-19, the authors said it is still unclear whether vaccinated obese persons are at higher or lower risk for breakthrough infection. The United States has recommended a booster dose of Pfizer vaccine for people aged 65 and above and other vulnerable groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/immunity-weakens-faster-in-men-than-women-after-second-pfizer-shot-study-101633623722900.html

White House adviser answers||After Pfizer Inc and BioNTech formally requested emergency use authorization for their Covid-19 vaccine in children aged five to 11, a White House adviser said that the new vaccine could be ready as early as November pending approval from regulatory agencies. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will review the application to decide whether there’s enough evidence to support the vaccine’s safety and efficacy.White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeffrey Zients told CNN that the advisory panel of the FDA will debate the evidence at the end of October. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will be rolled out for children after recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The United States is witnessing a worrying surge in infections among children as there was a 7% increase in the cumulated number of child Covid-19 cases between September 16-30 since the beginning of the pandemic. Pfizer’s Comirnaty has received emergency user authorisation from the FDA for its use in individuals 12 years of age and older to prevent Covid-19.According to a report by the American Academy of Pediatrics, nearly 5.9 million children have tested positive for Covid-19 as of September 30. It further stated that the number of new Covid cases among children remains exceptionally high as more than 173,000 infections were reported in the last week of September.“At this time, it appears that severe illness due to Covid-19 is uncommon among children. However, there is an urgent need to collect more data on longer-term impacts of the pandemic on children, including ways the virus may harm the long-term physical health of infected children, as well as its emotional and mental health effects,” the Illinois based association said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/when-pfizer-covid-vaccine-for-children-can-be-rolled-out-us-official-answers-101633614742569.html

He is the author of 10 novels, including “Paradise,” which was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1994.Anders Olsson, chairman of the Nobel Committee for literature, called him “one of the world’s most prominent post-colonial writers.”The prestigious award comes with a gold medal and 10 million Swedish kronor (over $1.14 million). The prize money comes from a bequest left by the prize’s creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel, who died in 1895.Last year's prize went to American poet Louise Glück for what the judges described as her “unmistakable poetic voice that with austere beauty makes individual existence universal.”Glück was a popular choice after several years of controversy. In 2018 the award was postponed after sex abuse allegations rocked the Swedish Academy, the secretive body that chooses the winners. The awarding of the 2019 prize to Austrian writer Peter Handke caused protests because of his strong support for the Serbs during the 1990s Balkan wars.On Monday, the Nobel Committee awarded the prize in physiology or medicine to Americans David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian for their discoveries into how the human body perceives temperature and touch.The Nobel Prize in physics was awarded Tuesday to three scientists whose work found order in seeming disorder, helping to explain and predict complex forces of nature, including expanding our understanding of climate change.Benjamin List and David W.C. MacMillan were named as laureates of the Nobel Prize for chemistry Wednesday for finding an easier and environmentally cleaner way to build molecules that can be used to make compounds, including medicines and pesticides.Still to come are prizes for outstanding work in the fields of peace and economics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nobel-literature-prize-tanzanian-born-novelist-abdulrazak-gurnah-wins-award-101633605790368.html

The Case Breakers, a task force of 40 former law enforcement investigators, believes that the hairs found in the clenched fist of a murdered teen student, Cheri Jo Bates, belong to the “Zodiac Killer” suspect, according to a press release.The Riverside Police Department (RPD) had refrigerated the hairs, skin and blood found under her fingernails of Bates after her body was discovered in October 1966. The Case Breakers requested the RPD to allow a comparison of Bates’ computer-coded DNA to the sequence of a person whom the independent investigators believe is a “very strong suspect”. RPD denied the request saying the department is “100% sure” Bates was killed by someone other than the Zodiac, according to the investigators.“Fifty-five years ago this month, RPD chose to ignore the obvious. It would take just minutes to quickly and quietly compare [suspect’s] DNA. You’d think the pain Cheri Jo’s family and her old friends have been living with would be Priority #1. Here’s to hoping the next chief finds the courage to act,” Thomas J. Colbert, team organiser, Case Breakers, said in a statement.The Zodiac Killer first began terrorising the streets of Northern California in the early 1960s and the Case Breakers believe the dreaded serial killer was behind the murders of 10 Californians between 1962 and 1970.The investigators said they have recovered new physical and forensic evidence, signed up eyewitnesses and secured pictures from Poste’s former darkroom. They believe the scars on the suspect forehead is irrefutable evidence that has been spotted by three case witnesses and an observing cop who later passed on to the San Francisco Police Department sketch artist.However, the SFPD and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FB) have not acknowledged the claims and said that the Zodiac Killer case is still an open investigation, reported CNN. “We have no new information to share at the moment," the FBI said in a statement to CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/private-investigators-claim-they-have-identified-zodiac-killer-dna-needed-for-confirmation-101633600365557.html

The country told WHO that some 40,700 people were tested till September 23, including health care workers and those with flu-like symptoms, for Covid-19 but all of them tested negative.The highly secretive nation shut its borders in January last year and imposed strict measures to combat the virus, describing its campaign as a matter of “national existence”. This has put additional strain on the country’s resources and economy. A Reuters report opined that WHO’s efforts to provide aid to North Korea might be a signal of the nation easing its border rules.Also Read: North Korea's Kim Jong Un seen with head bandage, sparks yet another round of health speculationSo far the country has resisted any help from nations, refusing vaccine shipments from close ally China and Russia. China made Covid-19 vaccine, Sinovac, was offered to North Korea under the Covax program, but the country asked for it to be distributed among harder hit nations in view of the global vaccine shortage.In July of this year Russia’s offer of Sputnik shot donations was also rejected by North Korea. In addition to this an offer of donation of AstraZeneca shots have also been met with refusal. The state owned television in North Korea have regularly highlighted cases of adverse reaction to vaccines reported in the US and Europe, which experts opine points towards the nation’s vaccine hesitancy, and the ruling elite’s disapproval of international monitoring requirements that would be attached to the vaccines it receives from the outside world.WHO’s announcement of shipping aid to North Korea comes weeks after Kim Jong Un urged party workers to fight the virus in “our style”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-to-send-covid-19-essential-medical-supplies-to-north-korea-via-chinese-port-101633594020577.html

Gen Bajwa is expected to complete his extraordinary six-year tenure as Pakistan Army Chief in November 2022.According to Pakistan watchers, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed was made Peshawar Corps commander as it is mandatory for contenders of Pakistan Army Chief’s post to have commanded a Corps level formation for at least one year. Gen Hameed has served staff posting at Rawalpindi GHQ after commanding an infantry division at Pano Aqil in Sindh province between 2015-2017. He was the 24th chief of ISI and has now been succeeded by former Karachi Corps Commander Lt Gen Nadeem Anjum.While many a Pakistan Army watchers believe that Gen Bajwa may secure another two-year tenure for himself in November 2022, there is unison that Gen Hameed has been rewarded to the prestigious Peshawar Corps for getting Pakistan a much-required strategic depth in Afghanistan under the proxy Taliban regime. Not only did the ISI provided tactics, arms, ammunition and medical support to the Taliban, it also broke the back of Panjshiri resistance by providing Pakistani commandoes in mufti with military maps and drone surveillance of the area. Today, the Panjshiri resistance is cooling its heels in Dushanbe in Tajikistan with all major powers simply tired of Afghanistan.As commander of Peshawar Corps, Gen Hameed will be directly in touch with the Miramshah shura of the Taliban, the Haqqania madrassa in Akora Khattak in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and will also be part of negotiations with the Tehreek-e-Taliban, Pakistan. The Corps controls Khyber Pass on Afghanistan-Pakistan border as also keeps an eye on the Wakhan corridor, which juts into Xinjiang.By having personal access to the entire top Taliban leadership including Defence Minister Mullah Yaqoob and Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani, Gen Hameed could play a key role in using the Sunni Pashtun force to push TTP towards a ceasefire with Pakistan Army in light of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s peace overtures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-dg-isi-could-succeed-gen-bajwa-as-pakistan-army-chief-101633582925139.html

I am proud to have called her my friend.

07-10-2021||World||No more assistance to Pakistan, hold Imran Khan accountable now: Ex-US advisor||Asserting that Pakistan has “had it both ways” for too long, a former US national security advisor during the Trump Administration has advised lawmakers against any fresh aid to Islamabad.Testifying before a powerful Congressional committee on Afghanistan, Gen (retd) H R McMaster, said that the US needs to hold the Pakistan prime minister accountable for some of his comments after the fall of Kabul in August.It is also delusional, he said, to think that any of the money that would go to the Taliban or through the Taliban for humanitarian purposes would not immediately be used by the Taliban to solidify their power and to become an even greater threat. “So, we're in a situation where we're facing a really extraordinary dilemma that it's going to be tough for us to mitigate the humanitarian crisis without empowering the Taliban,” he said in response to a question.“I don't think we should give any assistance to Pakistan at all. I think Pakistan has had it both ways for way too long. I think Pakistan should be confronted with its behavior over the years that has actually resulted, I think, in large measure in this outcome,” McMaster said.It was during the Trump Administration that the US had blocked all security assistance to Pakistan. The Biden Administration has not resumed the security aide yet.“I think we ought to hold Imran Khan responsible for his comments when Kabul fell and he said that the Afghan people have been unshackled. Why should we send a dime to Pakistan under any conditions? I think that they should be confronted with international isolation because of their support for jihadist terrorists, who are threats to humanity, including the Haqqani network, the Taliban, and groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba,” he said.Responding to a question from Congressman Scott Perry, during the Congressional hearing convened by the House Foreign Affairs Committee, McMaster said that it is a good idea to remove Pakistan’s status as a major non-NATO ally.“I would say the only time I think we have ever laid out a very clear and realistic assessment of South Asia and prioritised the strategy was President Trump's speech in August of 2017. Now, he abandoned it and he doubled down on the flaws of the Obama administration. I don't know how that happened. But I think if you go back to that August 2017 speech, that was the proper approach to Pakistan as well, which called for a suspension of all assistance to Pakistan until Pakistan fundamentally changed its behaviour,” McMaster said.Congressman Bill Keating said Pakistan remains a problem and the US needs to assess it.“Its long-standing activities, by many accounts, have been negative. I think that's putting it mildly. For decades, though, for decades, whether you go back to'96 when the Taliban took control, Pakistan was one of the first to recognise them,” he said.“When you go through the change in 2001 in Afghanistan and then the reconstruction of the Taliban starting around 2005, they were there giving assistance, by all accounts, and I believe those accounts are accurate. And indeed, right up into this current change in the government, Pakistan, there were many people that suggested their intelligence was embedded with them,” Keating said.Pakistan’s relationship with the Haqqani network is one that is of great concern.“That may indeed affect our relations with India in that respect. But can you comment on that? I think they have been duplicitous, not just recently, not just in the few months of this administration, but for decades in this with many administrations, Republican and Democratic alike,” he said.Former US Ambassador to Pakistan Ryan Croker acknowledged that Pakistan worked against the US in some very fundamental aspects with their support for the Taliban.“Earlier, I tried to present their narrative as to why. We were going to walk out, and they did not want to be left with the Taliban as a mortal enemy. They may get that anyway. And as satisfying as it would be to a lot of us, myself included, to do something to punish Pakistan for this, I don't think we have the luxury. They are already worried over the repercussions inside their own country of the Taliban's so-called victory in Afghanistan,” he said.“Now, we can say, ‘Yeah. Well, they deserve whatever they get.’ But again, a blow-up in Kashmir is going to bring a regional war. So, I think reassessment is always good, but let's reassess with a clear eye on the dangers now that the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan has created throughout the region. We do not need a completely destabilized Pakistani state with nuclear weapons,” Croker said.McMaster told the lawmakers that the Taliban was backed by ISI and that’s why they recaptured Afghanistan.“The Taliban's differential advantage was the backing by the ISI of other groups. But it was the unscrupulous units who are willing to terrorise. They didn't give up their differential advantage. And so, I don't think it's a mystery at all why they collapsed. And I think it should be unacceptable, to disparage the Afghans who did fight, and over 60,000 of them made the ultimate sacrifice to preserve the freedoms we're now seeing,” he said.The Taliban, he said, went around to the Afghan units, and they said, "Hey, here's how this is going to go."With the backing of the Pakistani ISI, intertwined with the Haqqani network and Al-Qaida, what they did is they told those commanders, "Hey, listen. You accommodate with us. We give you the signal, or we kill your family. How does that sound?" he said.And that's why the Afghan forces collapsed in addition to the withdrawal of US intelligence support, the withdrawal of our airpower, which was the Afghan forces differential advantage, McMaster said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-more-assistance-to-pakistan-hold-imran-khan-accountable-now-ex-us-advisor-101633568192266.html
07-10-2021||World||US watchdog to inspect if Ashraf Ghani fled Afghanistan with money from country||John Sopko, the U.S. special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, said on Wednesday his office would look into allegations that former Afghan President Ashraf Ghani took millions of dollars with him when he left the country.Ghani has said he left Kabul to prevent bloodshed and denied reports he took large sums of money with him. But speculation has persisted, and Congress asked Sopko's team to get to the bottom of it."We haven't proven that yet. We're looking into that. Actually, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee has asked us to look into that," Sopko told a House of Representatives subcommittee.Ghani has been bitterly criticized for fleeing as the militant Islamist Taliban reached the outskirts of Kabul in August.Sopko's Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) has long been investigating fraud, waste and abuse during America's massive state-building effort, which came to an ignoble end after 20 years with the Taliban takeover.Sopko suggested to the House Foreign Affairs Committee subcommittee that oversees development aid that the failure of the U.S. project shouldn't have been a surprise, given rampant corruption and mismanagement."Corruption grew so pervasive that it ultimately threatened the security and reconstruction mission in Afghanistan," he told the House panel.The congressional hearing was one of a series looking at the chaotic U.S. withdrawal and the path forward. "We can apply the lessons learned in other conflict zones," Representative Joaquin Castro, the subcommittee's Democratic chairman, said.The United States and other countries have cut off almost all aid to Afghanistan."These are trying times for all of us who care about the future of the Afghan people, especially the Afghans that aided the U.S. and its allies over the past 20 years," Sopko said.He said all of SIGAR's staff - including locally employed Afghan staff - were safely evacuated from Kabul.

07-10-2021||World||All you need to know about Mosquirix, first malaria vaccine approved by WHO||The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Wednesday endorsed the world's first malaria vaccine. The global health body said that it should be given to children across Africa in the hope that it will spur stalled efforts to curb the spread of the parasitic disease.The WHO recommendation is for RTS,S - or Mosquirix - a vaccine developed by British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline."This is a vaccine developed in Africa by African scientists and we're very proud," said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.What is Mosquirix?According to European Medicines Agency, Mosquirix is a vaccine that is given to children aged 6 weeks to 17 months to help protect against malaria. It also helps protect against infection of the liver with the hepatitis B virus, but European Medicines Agency warns that the vaccine should not be used only for this purpose.The vaccine was developed by GlaxoSmithKline in 1987. However, it does face challenges: Mosquirix requires up to four doses, and its protection fades after several months.Still, scientists say the vaccine could have a major impact against malaria in Africa.Since 2019, 2.3 million doses of Mosquirix have been administered to infants in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi in a large-scale pilot programme coordinated by the WHO. The majority of those whom the disease kills are aged under five.How is Mosquirix used?Mosquirix is given as a 0.5 ml injection into a muscle of the thigh or in the muscle around the shoulder (the deltoid). The child is given three injections with one month between each injection.A fourth injection is recommended 18 months after the third. Mosquirix can only be obtained with a prescription.How does Mosquirix work?Scientists at the European Medicines Agency say that the active substance in Mosquirix is made up of proteins found on the surface of the Plasmodium falciparum parasites.When it is administered to a child, the immune system recognises the 'foreign' proteins from the parasite and makes antibodies against them.What is the efficacy of Mosquirix?The vaccine's effectiveness at preventing severe cases of malaria in children is only around 30%, but it is the only approved vaccine. The European Union's drugs regulator approved it in 2015, saying its benefits outweighed the risks.WHO said the side effects of the vaccine were rare, but sometimes included a fever that could result in temporary convulsions.How will Mosquirix help in checking the spread of malaria?Azra Ghani, chair of infectious diseases at Imperial College London, said she and colleagues estimate that giving the malaria vaccine to children in Africa might result in a 30% reduction overall, with up to 8 million fewer cases and as many as 40,000 fewer deaths per year.“For people not living in malaria countries, a 30% reduction might not sound like much. But for the people living in those areas, malaria is one of their top concerns,” Ghani said. “A 30% reduction will save a lot of lives and will save mothers (from) bringing in their children to health centers and swamping the health system.”The malaria burden in AfricaMalaria is far more deadly than Covid-19 in Africa. It is caused by the parasite plasmodium falciparum. The disease killed 386,000 Africans in 2019, according to a WHO estimate, compared with 212,000 confirmed deaths from Covid-19 in the past 18 months.The WHO says 94% of malaria cases and deaths occur in Africa, a continent of 1.3 billion people. The preventable disease is caused by parasites transmitted to people by the bites of infected mosquitoes; symptoms include fever, vomiting and fatigue.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/all-you-need-to-know-about-mosquirix-first-malaria-vaccine-approved-by-who-101633571543085.html
07-10-2021||World||US judge temporarily blocks near-total ban on abortion in Texas||A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked a near-total ban on abortion in Texas, the toughest such law in the United States, in a challenge brought by President Joe Biden's administration after the US Supreme Court had allowed it to go into effect. The action by US District Judge Robert Pitman in Austin prevents the state from enforcing the Republican-backed law, which prohibits women from obtaining an abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, while litigation over its legality continues. The case is part of a fierce legal battle over abortion access in the United States, with numerous states pursuing restrictions.“This court will not sanction one more day of this offensive deprivation of such an important right,” Pitman said in the ruling.Biden's Justice Department sued Texas on September 9 and sought a temporary injunction against the law, arguing during an October 1 hearing that the measure violates the US constitution. The US Supreme Court on September 1 let the law take effect in a 5-4 vote powered by conservative justices.At six weeks of pregnancy, many women do not yet know they are pregnant. The law makes no exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest. It also lets ordinary citizens enforce the ban, rewarding them at least $10,000 if they successfully sue anyone who helped provide abortion after a fetal cardiac activity is detected. Critics of the law have said this provision enables people to act as anti-abortion bounty hunters.The Justice Department argued that the law impedes women from exercising their constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy that was recognized in the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide. The department also argued that the law improperly interferes with the operations of the federal government to provide abortion-related services.Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, has defended the legality of the state's abortion law, with this office saying in a statement: "The most precious freedom is life itself."Pitman heard about three hours of arguments on the Justice Department's request. Justice Department attorney Brian Netter called the law an "unprecedented scheme of vigilante justice" that must be struck down.Will Thompson, an attorney in the Texas Attorney General's Office, countered the department's arguments, saying there were plenty of opportunities for people in Texas to challenge the law on their own. He said the department's arguments were filled with "hyperbole and inflammatory rhetoric."Pitman's action can be appealed to the New Orleans-based US 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, a conservative-leaning body that previously allowed the Texas abortion ban to proceed. Pitman was appointed by Democratic former President Barack Obama.US conservatives have long sought to have Roe v. Wade overturned. The Supreme Court on Dec. 1 hears arguments in a separate case involving a Mississippi law that bans abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Mississippi has asked the high court to overturn the 1973 precedent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-judge-temporarily-blocks-near-total-ban-on-abortion-in-texas-101633569347900.html

Many of the victims died when roofs and walls collapsed, Suhail Anwar Hashmi, a senior provincial government official, told AFP. A woman and six children were among twenty dead, he said.“We are receiving information that 20 people have been killed due to the earthquake,” provincial interior minister Mir Zia Ullah Langau added. “Rescue efforts are underway.”Naseer Nasar, the head of Balochistan's provincial disaster management authority, told AFP that between 15 and 20 people had died, but that the toll may increase.The worst-affected area was the remote mountainous city of Harnai, in Balochistan, where a lack of paved roads, electricity, and mobile phone coverage has hampered the rescue effort. The earthquake was also felt in Balochistan's provincial capital Quetta.The US Geological Survey said the quake had a magnitude of 5.7 and struck around 3am at a depth of around 20 kilometres (12 miles).Pakistan straddles the boundary where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet, making the country susceptible to earthquakes.In October 2015, a 7.5-magnitude quake in Pakistan and Afghanistan killed almost 400 people across rugged terrain that impeded relief efforts. The country was also hit by a 7.6-magnitude quake on October 8, 2005, that killed more than 73,000 people and left about 3.5 million homeless, mainly in Pakistan-occupie Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-20-dead-as-magnitude-5-7-earthquake-strikes-pakistan-101633568466241.html
07-10-2021||World||Taiwan raises spectre of invasion||Military tensions with China are at their worst in more than 40 years, Taiwan’s defence minister said on Wednesday, promoting a new arms spending package to lawmakers days after record numbers of Chinese aircraft flew into the island’s air defence zone.Tensions have hit a new high between Taipei and Beijing, which claims the democratic island as its own territory, and Chinese military aircraft have repeatedly flown through Taiwan’s air defence identification zone, though no shots have been fired and the planes have stayed away from mainland Taiwan.Over a four-day period beginning last Friday, Taiwan reported close to 150 Chinese air force aircraft entered its air defence zone, part of a pattern of what Taipei calls Beijing’s continued harassment of the island. Just one incursion was reported on Tuesday. Asked by a lawmaker on the current military tensions with China at the parliament, defence minister Chiu Kuo-cheng said the situation was “the most serious” in more than 40 years since he joined the military, adding there was a risk of a “misfire” across the sensitive Taiwan Strait.“For me as a military man, the urgency is right in front of me,” he told a parliamentary committee reviewing an extra military spending plan worth T$240bn ($8.6 billion) over the next five years for home-made weapons including missiles and warships.China says Taiwan should be taken by force if necessary. Taiwan says it is an independent country and will defend its freedoms and democracy, blaming China for the tensions.Chiu said China already has the ability to invade Taiwan and it will be capable of mounting a “full scale” invasion by 2025.US President Joe Biden said on Tuesday he had spoken to Chinese President Xi Jinping about Taiwan and they agreed to abide by the Taiwan agreement.Biden appeared to be referring to Washington’s long-standing “one-China policy” under which it officially recognises Beijing rather than Taipei, and the Taiwan Relations Act, which makes clear that the US decision to establish diplomatic ties with Beijing instead of Taiwan rests upon the expectation that the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means.Halt provocative actions towards Taiwan: BlinkenUS secretary of state Antony Blinken called China’s recent actions around Taiwan “provocative and potentially destabilising”, urging leaders in Beijing to stop such behaviour.“The actions we’ve seen by China are provocative and potentially destabilising,” Blinken said in an interview in Paris with Bloomberg Television. “What I hope is that these actions will cease because there’s always the possibility of miscalculation, of miscommunication, and that’s dangerous.“It’s very important that no one take unilateral actions that change the status quo by force.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-raises-spectre-of-invasion-101633566986265.html
07-10-2021||World||‘Historic day’: WHO go-ahead for broad use of first-ever malaria vaccine for children in Africa||The first vaccine for malaria, the mosquito-borne disease that kills about 400,000 people each year, is set to be deployed more widely after more than three decades of work and about $1 billion in investment.The vaccine developed by GlaxoSmithKline Plc and its partners won a recommendation from the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday for use in children in sub-Saharan Africa and other regions with moderate to high transmission. It marks a turning point in a battle against the parasite that causes malaria.The shot prevented only about four in 10 malaria cases among children who received four doses in a large study, but the injection, along with other measures, could still save hundreds of thousands of lives. Now the focus will shift to getting it to more people following a pilot program in Africa that began in 2019.Following a meeting of the United Nations health agency’s vaccine advisory group, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus spoke of “a historic moment”.“Today’s recommendation offers a glimmer of hope for the continent, which shoulders the heaviest burden of the disease and we expect many more African children to be protected from malaria and grow into healthy adults,” Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, said in a statement.The WHO said its decision was based on results from ongoing research in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi that has tracked more than 800,000 children since 2019.Many vaccines exists against viruses and bacteria but this was the first time that the WHO recommended for broad use a vaccine against a human parasite.GSK, which has developed the shot with non-profit organisation PATH, committed to donating as many as 10 million doses for the ongoing pilot, and to supply as many as 15 million doses annually.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/historic-day-who-go-ahead-for-broad-use-of-first-ever-malaria-vaccine-for-children-in-africa-101633551343298.html
07-10-2021||World||HT This Day: October 7, 1981 - President Sadat Assassinated||Grenade, rifle assault by six soldiers at army paradeThree attackers killed in gun battle; emergency declared Cairo- President Anwar Sadat was killed today by a group of Egyptian soldiers who attacked his reviewing stand with grenades and assault rifles during a military parade in Cairo. National Assembly Speaker Soufi Abu Taleb, who has been named, acting President, has declared a state of emergency for a year throughout the country. The naming of Speaker Taleb as acting President was announced by Vice-President Hosni Mubarak in a radio-television address. A new leader will be elected within 60 days, Mr. Mubarak said, in the first official statement on Mr. Sadat's death to be broadcast in Egypt. Mr. Mubarak said the Cabinet was unchanged. Groomed by Mr. Sadat to be his successor, Mr. Mubarak pledged that Egypt would continue Mr. Sadat's foreign and domestic policies. He remains in charge of the armed forces and was expected to exercise strong powers in the interim Government. One of the President's military aides and at least one of his bodyguards were also killed in the hand grenade-and-automatic weapon attack during the military parade.Mr. Hosny Mubarak, Defence Minister General Abdel Halim Abu Ghabale, the Chief of the General Staff, Gen. Abdel Rab El-Nabi Hafis and several diplomats including the Ambassadors of Australia and Belgium, were wounded in the attack. The Belgian Ambassador, Mr Claude Ruelle, was in extremely serious condition in hospital, a Belgian Foreign Ministry spokesman said in Brussels. Egypt's Ambassador to Washington, Mr. Ashraf Ghorbal, said his Government had told him that three of the attackers were killed and three were captured alive. An Egyptian Foreign Ministry official, who requested anonymity, said many Foreign Ministry officials and others were wounded. Three members of a US military delegation were wounded, the Defence Department said in Washington. The delegation headed by the chief of the U.S Rapid Deployment Force (RDF) Gen. Robert Kingston, were on the reviewing stand. Gen. Kingston himself was not wounded. Mr Sadat, who broke with the rest of the Arab World to make peace between his country and Israel, was assassinated on the anniversary of his greatest military triumph. Eight years ago on this day Egyptian troops launched a successful surprise attack across the Suez Canal into the Israeli-occupied Sinai peninsula. The official in the Presidency said he had lived several hours after being hit in today's shooting. The source could give no further detail.As a convoy of trucks towing artillery weapons passed about 20 metres from where President Sadat was taking the salute, several-hand grenades were thrown at the President’s dais, one of the trucks stopped and about six young soldiers in blue berets leapt out and sprinted towards Mr Sadat, their Kalashnikov assault rifles blazing.  Bullets sprayed into the grandstand as people crashed to the floor amid tumbling chairs.After a brief but fierce gun battle, several of the soldiers were overpowered and dragged off amid a kicking, struggling crowd.People were piled up in a bloodstained tangle on the floor of the stand from where Mr Sadat had been watching the parade and several appeared to have serious wounds.Mr Sofi Abu Taleb, the Speaker of the Egyptian Parliament who was sitting nearby, told Reuters the President was hustled away in the pandemonium. Mr Sadat was flown to hospital in a helicopter.Defence Minister Ghazala took control as the gunbattle abated, calmly issuing orders to guards and officers around him.Among those carried away on stretchers were Bishop Samuel, a leader of Egypt's Christian Coptic Church, Belgian Ambassador Claud Ruelle and one of Mr Sadat's closest aides, Sayed Marei. Diplomats who were only metres away from the President said it appeared Mr Marei and Mr Ruclie were both seriously wounded.They also reported an American officer, Lt.-Col. Charles Luney, and a member of an Omani delegation injured. Angry soldiers hustled foreign correspondents from the scene as ambulances carried away the injured had it appeared that at least a dozen people had been hit by bullets.Cairo Television cut its live coverage of the parade, after a number of explosions were heard. A Cairo Radio announcer shouted "traitors" and interrupted his description of the scene.Neither the radio nor the television explained what had happened. The television and radio later reported that the parade had ended and that President Sadat had left the scene. Neither mentioned the shooting.When President Gamel Abel Nasser died on Sept. 28, 1970, he left a void few thought could be filled. In stepped Mr Anwar Sadat, a virtually unknown Vice-President and Egypt changed direction.While Mr Nasser had led the Arabs in losing wars against Israel, Mr Sadat led them in what he hailed a "glorious Arab victory" in the 1973 West Asia war. Then at the risk of condemnation by other Arab leaders, he became a peacemaker in November 1977 by visiting Israel.The trip by the Egyptian President shattered Arab precedent.Within three years after taking office, Mr Sadat crushed one internal revolt, expelled 15,000 Soviet advisers and started turning Egypt's orientation from the Soviet Union to the United States.In November 1977 he declared he would go to "even to the Israeli Knesset to discuss peace if it would save even one Egyptian soldier."Less than two weeks later, Mr Sadat was in Israel. The visit culminated in the 1978 US-mediated Camp David accords that established peace between the two nations.  Mr Sadat waged an off-again, on-again relationship with Col Moammar Khadafy, leader of Libya, Egypt's western neighbour and one of Mr Sadist's harshest critics.In July 1977, Egypt and Libya clashed for five days along the border from the Mediterranean Sea south into the desert. The skirmishes subsided, but the rhetoric heated up from time to time.In August 1976, Mr Sadat won Parliament's unanimous nominations for another six-year term. He vowed to liberate all Arab lands taken by the Israelis in the 1987 West Asia war and to establish a "Palestinian entity." After the 1973 West Asia war broke out, Mr Sadat was hailed as a hero. In October, he sent his troops storming across the Suez Canal in an operation that caught the Israelis by surprise.While Mr Sadat was waging war and questing for peace, he turned his countrys economy from Mr Nasser's socialist to an ever-widening open-door policy in search of West money and products.In 1974, he launched a policy of economic liberalisation and invited Western companies to do business with Egypt. Mr Sadat held several posts under President Nasser, including Secretary-General of the Islamic Congress. He was named Vice-President less than 10 months before Mr Nasser died.Mr Sadat, third President of Egypt, was born on Dec. 25, 1918, in the poor Nile delta village of Mit Abu Al-Kom. His father was a civilian clerk in the army. His mother was Sudanese. His family later moved to Cairo and Mr Sadat entered the military academy and graduated in 1938. One of his classmates was Nasser. After World War II, Mr Sadat was jailed twice for involvement in assassination plots against royalist politicians but was acquitted both times. Released from jail in 1948, he drove a truck and worked as a journalist for a time.Mr Sadat was well-educated and taught himself English, German and Persian. A dapper man, he leaned to British-tailored suits and smoking jackets. His dazzling smile came across well on television: he has used his rural roots to build a "man of the people" image.Many say his subtle elegance was due to his half-English second wife Jiban, by whom he had three daughters and a son. Under Islamic law, Mr Sadat still was legally married to his first wife, who lived in the delta. He had three daughters by her, all of whom married army officers.When Mr Sadat took over from Mr Nasser, many critics claimed he had little executive experience and referred to him as "Colonel Yes Sir," referring to his deference to Mr Nasser. In May 1971, plotters led by leftleaning Vice-President Aly Sabry decided to act before Mr Sadat became too powerful, introducing reforms, cutting prices and developing a folksy image. Mr Sabry and two of Mr Nasser's henchmen, Presidential Affairs Minister Sami Sharaf and Interior Minister Sharawi Goman, who controlled the police and the intelligence apparatus, forced a confrontation when Mr Sadat agreed to federate with Libya and Syria. At a meeting of the leadership, Mr Sadat was outvoted. He then fired Mr Sabry. When six Cabinet Ministers, including Mr Sharaf, Mr Goman and the War Minister resigned in an attempt to convince him, he put them under house arrest. They were later convicted of treason and sent to prison. Dissolving the Arab Socialist Union, the country's only political party, Mr Sadat ordered new elections. He held a referendum on the federation and a new Constitution. Both passed with 99 per cent of the vote.To reassure the Russians, Mr. Sadat signed a 15-year treaty of friendship and co-operation. But he sent the Russian military advisers home in July 1972, saying the Soviet Union, despite his four visits to Moscow, would not provide the equipment needed to wage a war against Israel. Expecting his dramatic initiative to budge Washington, Mr Sadat was disappointed when the stalemate continued. At home, a wave of internal dissent hit campuses, the Muslim and Christian communities and the army, but Mr Sadat rode it out. As 1973 drew to a close, Mr Sadat counselled Egyptians to be patient. In April, he decided there was no alternative to war. During a secret visit to Damascus in August, he and Syrian President Hefez Assad set D-day. Mr Sadat also worked that summer to shore up the Arab alliance in preparation for the battle, abandoning a union with Libya in favour of solidifying ties with Saudi Arabia. He urged the Saudis to use their vast ad wealth to pressure the US when hostilities came. One of Mr Sadat's boldest moves was the signing in September 28, 1978, in the US of the Camp David accords with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and former US President Jimmy Carter. Although the accords called for a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, it urged further negotiations on creating a form of autonomy for Palestinians living on Israeli-occupied land. That contentious issue resisted agreement between the two nations and talks resumed only this year.Although the treaty evoked the Opposition of almost the entire Arab world and resulted in the Arab boycott of Egypt, Mr Sadat and Mr Begin were awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1978.On March 26, 1979, Mr Sadat signed the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty with Mr Begin and Mr Carter.Last month, citing an alleged plot to incite Muslim Christian strife, Mr Sadat ordered the arrest of 1,536 political opponents, including Muslim fundamentalists, Coptic Christian leaders, Opposition party leaders, journalists, lawyers and former politicians. Mr Sadat later expelled the Soviet Ambassador, six top Soviet diplomats and about 700 Soviet advisers working in Egypt, accusing the Soviet Union of efforts to incite sectarian strife.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/videos/world-news/ht-this-day-october-7-1981-president-sadat-assassinated-101633545571359.html

That’s just not true,” Mark Zuckerberg wrote.The Facebook founder went on to say the business model of the company was nothing like the picture painted of it by Frances Haugen, whom he did not name in the long post. “The argument that we deliberately push content that makes people angry for profit is deeply illogical,” Mark Zuckerberg said, adding, “We make money from ads, and advertisers consistently tell us they don’t want their ads next to harmful or angry content.”Mark Zuckerberg has few friends on Capitol Hill, home to US Congress, and none whatsoever at the subcommittee that heard and agreed with much of Frances Haugen’s testimony, as they sought more details from her, a former product manager, and her suggestion on what she thinks needs to be done.Many senators pointed out that as the subcommittee heard Frances Haugen’s testimony, Zuckerberg was out sailing with his wife and friends. He had himself posted a video of that but the hearing was clearly on his mind.Haugen called Facebook’s decision “disastrous” for children, public safety, privacy and democracy and urged the lawmakers to “help” the social media giant fix its issues, which, she added, the company cannot do on its own.To back her allegations, Frances Haugen has given US Congress thousands of documents containing internal research findings, which she also provided to the Wall Street Journal and US market regulators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-zuckerberg-says-frances-haugen-s-claims-do-not-make-sense-101633494935876.html
07-10-2021||India||Bengaluru civic body eases curbs on Durga Puja festival||The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) on Thursday relaxed restrictions on Durga Puja after outcry by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders and other Hindu groups who raised objections over the guidelines. The BBMP said that its chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta spoke to senior officials and Durga Puja associations and then revised the guidelines.“The restriction of installing Durga idols not more than 4 feet is removed. During the pushpanjali and sandhi puja, one has to follow all Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and allow only 50 people in batches. There is no restriction on the total number of batches,” the BBMP said in a statement on Thursday. The BBMP also added that a ward can have more than one idol with the permission of the joint commissioner. “During the prayer rituals, musical instruments like drums use are allowed,” the BBMP said. Tejasvi Surya, the BJP MP from Bengaluru south on Wednesday had said that there was tendency to put restrictions on Hindu festivals. “There is a general tendency in sections of the bureaucracy to think that it’s OK to put any and every kind of restrictions on Hindu festivals. This is a colonial relic. Post 2014, the awakened Hindu resists such attempts. This colonialism must end too,” he said in a Twitter post on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-civic-body-eases-curbs-on-durga-puja-festival-101633631286517.html
07-10-2021||India||BJP names candidates for Oct 30 by-elections in Karnataka||In a bid to get its cadres focus on winning the upcoming elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday announced its candidates for the October 30 bypolls in two constituencies of the state, ending weeks of hectic lobbying. While the candidate for Sindgi bypoll is Ramesh Bhusanur, Shivaraj Sajjanar has been named for the Hanagal bypolls, with just one day to go before the deadline for nominations. Bhusanur came in second in the 2018 assembly elections behind MC Managuli of the JD(S). Sajjanar is a former MLA from Haveri and is said to be close to former chief minister BS Yediyurappa. The selection of Sajjanar also comes as a surprise as Shivakumar Udasi, the son of late CM Udasi, was lobbying hard to secure the ticket for his wife, Revathi Udasi. It was Udasi’s demise in June this year, which had necessitated the bypolls in Hanagal constitiuency. By denying Shivakumar Udasi’s wife a ticket, the BJP is also trying to circumvent allegations of continuing dynasty politics even though it had fielded the wife of late Suresh Angadi in the Belagavi bypolls in May. The Sindgi constituency also fell vacant after its MLA MC Managuli from the Janata Dal (Secular) passed away this January. However, Managuli’s son has since joined the Congress and has been announced as the party’s candidate from the constituency, according to the All India Congress Committee on October 5. The JD(S) has fielded a candidate from the Muslim community in Sindgi. “JD(S)’ target is the Congress and not the BJP,” Siddaramaiah, the leader of the opposition said on Thursday. He implied that the JD(S) fields minority candidates to help the BJP. “I am not saying that you (JD(S)) should not field a minority candidate. But they don’t do it where they are supposed to,” Siddaramaiah said. He added that the JD(S) will not field a Muslim candidate in Mandya and Hassan, the stronghold of the regional outfit, since their main support base, the Vokkaligas are found in large numbers here. The bypolls come at a time when the Basavaraj Bommai-led BJP government has been facing increasing pressure from Hindu groups over restrictions over the Durga Puja celebrations and temple demolition in Nanjangud. The Bommai government is also under pressure from dominant communities like the Panchamasali, the largest sub-sect within the Lingayats, to change their reservation status and continues to give the administration new deadlines to yield to their demands. Bommai was made chief minister on July 28, replacing Yediyurappa, but has not been able to come out of the latter’s shadow. Yediyurappa, people aware of the developments said, remains firmly in charge of the government and its ministers who are all considered close to the 78-year-old former chief minister. The three political parties are trying to consolidate its respective support base in the bypolls that will precede the yet-to-be announced Zilla and Taluka panchayat elections and the 2023 assembly polls.The BJP is hoping to up its tally in the lower house and the upper house of the state legislature to continue its dominant position and ensure the easy passage of contentious bills despite opposition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-names-candidates-for-oct-30-by-elections-in-karnataka-101633631228245.html
07-10-2021||India||Karnataka high court gives civic body 2 weeks to submit report on potholes||The Karnataka high court on Thursday pulled up the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) for its inability to fill potholes in the city. The court directed the civic agency to ensure that filling up potholes are taken up at the earliest and submit a status report within two weeks. A division bench of acting Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum, while hearing a petition on the condition of Bengaluru’s roads said that the pothole problem in the city resurfaces within two to three months of filling. “BBMP shall also ensure that quality is maintained while filling up the potholes because it is noticed that the potholes which are filled up, again become a pothole, after two to three months,” said the bench. The counsel for BBMP told the bench that it had entered into an agreement with a single agency to fill up potholes and that this was being done every day. “Every day we are attending to filling up potholes in the entire city. However, because of heavy rains, we could not achieve the target. Wherever necessary we are doing it,” said the BBMP counsel. The counsel further reassured the court that a status report with all photographs would be filed before the high court. In response, the bench said that the process adopted by the BBMP for repairing the potholes is not very transparent. “You see potholes only on this Kumara Krupa road, the road in front of 7 ministers’ bungalow, the road towards the high court. But you don’t see potholes of other localities, where the common man lives,” the bench observed orally. The court also granted the BBMP counsel’s request for two weeks’ time to submit a status report. “Time of two weeks is granted to file a status report. He will also file all documents relating to the procedure adopted to filling up potholes,” the court observed. Bommai on Wednesday said that a task force has been created to fill the potholes on the roads. “They will look into the condition and repair history of all roads in Bengaluru and report. This will be the first part. The refilling of potholes and other repairs will take place at the same time. We have asked BBMP to finish these works in a scientific manner. We will finish the work of filling all potholes as soon as the rains are over,” the CM said. When questioned why the work won’t be finished before monsoons are over, Bommai said that the priority was to have a permanent solution to the pothole problem. “From our experience so far, we know areas where there are (pothole) problems. So, we want to fix them properly,” he said. Karnataka revenue minister on October 1 had said that that all roads in Bengaluru will be pothole-free in 30 days, setting another deadline, after many missed ones, to provide one of the most basic amenities to the residents. R Ashok, Karnataka’s minister for revenue and interim in-charge of Bengaluru city, said an additional ₹1,000 crore has been released for the purpose of fixing roads in the newly added localities of Bengaluru, where damaged roads have added to the nightmarish experience of residents, especially during monsoons. According to government data, Bengaluru has 13,847 km of arterial and sub-arterial roads, of which only 295 km are said to be in good condition and another 246 km have now been ridden of potholes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-high-court-gives-civic-body-2-weeks-to-submit-report-on-potholes-101633631166631.html
07-10-2021||India||I-T raids close aid of Yediyurappa, others across Bengaluru||The Income Tax department on Thursday carried out raids and searches across Bengaluru and other places in connection with a possible scam by the irrigation department during BS Yediyurappa’s term as chief minister in Karnataka, according to people aware of the developments in the IT department. The IT department confirmed multiple raids in Bengaluru but did not divulge details. The raids were said to be against contractors, material suppliers and chartered accountants among others. “Among those raided was Umesh, a contractor and close aide of Yediyurappa,” AH Vishwanath, the BJP MLC from Karnataka said. Vishwanath on Thursday said that the raids were “welcome” as he had made complaints against corruption in various departments of the government at the behest of BY Vijayendra, the son of Yediyurappa. In June this year, Vishwanath, the former state president of the Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S), who defected to the BJP in 2019 along with 16 others, alleged a large scam in awarding the Bhadra Upper Canal project (DATED?). He said that the tender for ₹21,473 crores was prepared without any clearance from the financial department or meeting of the state cabinet. He said that around ₹2000 crores were given as kickback to Vijayendra and others for awarding these tenders without due process. “Before Yediyurappa gave up his post as chief minister, I had spoken about this scam in the Bhadra Upper Canal project. Without the clearance of the finance department, they (Vijayendra and others) had prepared tenders and would receive ₹2000 crore in kickback,” Vishwanath said on Thursday. Vishwanath said that even Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that it was Vijayendra who was responsible for Yediyurappa losing his chair. “No one other than Yediyurappa’s son was the reason for him stepping down. All these (including Umesh) are Vijayendra’s disciples,” Vishwanath said, adding that the son would get his people in every department of the government. “Yediyurappa had given his tongue and his pen to his son and the BJP got a bad name, the government collapsed and the father too was discredited. The person responsible for all this is Vijayendra,” Vishwanath said. The role of Yediyurappa’s family in alleged scams has come out more than once during his four stints as chief minister since 2008. Basanagouda Patil (Yatnal), the BJP legislator from Bijapura city, also made similar allegations against Yediyurappa and his family in the past. Yatnal, a vocal critic of Yediyurappa has constantly alleged that the former chief minister and his family indulge in corruption and will be removed soon. The main cause for dissent within the BJP during Yediyurappa’s last term as chief minister was primarily attributed to the involvement of his son in government affairs, including allegations that he was running a parallel administration at the behest of his father, according to multiple BJP legislators since 2018. Though Yediyurappa stepped down from the chief minister’s post in July, people aware of the developments said that they remain wary of the former chief minister and his plans in Karnataka ahead of the 2023 assembly elections. “Income tax persons can raid anyone. But don’t know why Yediyurappa’s close aides were targeted,” Siddaramaiah, the Congress’s leader of the opposition said on Thursday. HD Kumaraswamy, the former chief minister and Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) leader said that the IT raids before the October 30 polls could be because of any specific information or the possibility to control the former chief minister. “IT has conducted these raids before the bypolls. They probably did it based on some information,” Kumaraswamy said. He added that the raids were conducted against Yediyurappa’s close aides which may be due to the internal relations within the party and possibly because they want to control the former chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-raids-close-aid-of-yediyurappa-others-across-bengaluru-101633631164289.html
07-10-2021||India||Woman, 4-yr-old daughter found murdered in Bengaluru||A 36-year-old woman and her four-year-old daughter were found murdered in their south Bengaluru apartment on Wednesday, police said. The deceased have been identified as Yamuna aka Chandrakala, 35, and her daughter has been identified as Ratanya, 4. Police said the bodies of the mother and daughter had signs of assault and multiple stab wounds. The murder came to light around 6.30 pm when Chandrakala’a sister Chaitra came to the apartment in Chowdeshwari Layout near Begur. In a statement to the police, Chaitra said that the door of the apartment on the third floor was open when she arrived. As soon as she entered the house, she found the body of the Chandrakala in the hall, while the child was found in one of the rooms in the house. Chaitra then called husband of the deceased Channaveeraswamy and the police. Chandrakala, her husband, and two children had moved to Bengaluru from Chitradurga district four years ago after her husband got a job in a garment factory in the capital city. “One of the children was in a hostel and the family was living in an apartment in Chowdeshwari Layout. Yamuna used to work as a marketing agent for an ayurvedic company,” said a Begur police official. The murder is said to have taken place after her husband went to work around 9.30 am. “We have some evidence that a person had entered the house in the morning after Chandrakala’s husband Channaveeraswamy went to work. This person who entered the house in the morning left around noon. He is a prime suspect in the case and the investigation is on,” said a Begur police official. A case of murder under section 304 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) has been registered at the Begur police station. The cops are getting CCTV footage from the surrounding areas to get clues about miscreants who have entered the house of the victim. Police also said that since there were no signs of any forced entry, it is suspected that the attackers were known to the victim. “There was no sign of forced entry into the house. But it’s not clear if Chandrakala had locked the house from the inside or just shut the door,” said a Begur police official. Sniffer dogs scoured the area while fingerprint and forensic experts collected samples. According to police, Chandrakala and her daughter were stabbed more than 20 times and their throats were slit. It is suspected that some gold and other valuables are missing from the house. Additional commissioner S Murugan said that four special teams have been formed to investigate the case. “As per the preliminary probe, it is suspected that the murder took place in the afternoon. The house is ransacked, and hence, we are suspecting it could be a case of murder for gain,” the officer told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-4-yr-old-daughter-found-murdered-in-bengaluru-101633631112375.html

They urged the Left government to increase the compensation amount for those who die or are injured in the wildlife attack and to implement a special insurance scheme for those living in the fringe areas.The government has the responsibility to protect not just wildlife but also human beings, they said while raising the issue during the zero hour demanding a discussion stopping other House proceedings.Congress legislator Sunny Joseph, who sought a notice for the motion, said a serious situation was prevailing in many parts of the state as several people had been killed and injured and crops damaged widely due to the attack of wild animals which strayed into human settlements.Leader of opposition in the state Assembly V D Satheesan drew the government’s attention on the need to evolve a comprehensive programme to check the wildlife menace on a time-bound manner without losing any more lives.“The programme should be formulated in consultation with the global and national experts after taking into account the geographical peculiarities of Kerala. A special wing should be formed under the Chief Conservator of Forest for this purpose,” he said.However, Forest minister A K Saseendran admitted the absence of a scientific programme to end the man-animal conflicts in human settlements. He said the department was making all efforts to erect solar fencing and trenches in all possible areas to check wild animals entering the human habitats.Compensation would be given to those farmers who are ready to shift from the forest-fringe settlement areas, he said, adding that over 200 vigilant committees had been set up as part of efforts to regulate the menace and monitor the situation. He also said the government could not give permission to kill wild animals indiscriminately.In view of the reply of the minister, speaker M B Rajesh denied permission to leave for the motion||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/udf-demands-plan-to-end-man-animal-conflict-in-kerala-101633630985853.html

07-10-2021||India||Cauvery majorly polluted by pharma industry: Study||A team of researchers from IIT-Madras in a study have found that river Cauvery and its tributaries are polluted by a range of contaminants that includes pharmaceutically active compounds, personal care products, plastics, flame retardants, heavy metals, and pesticides, among others. The findings of the study, which the team said is “alarming” was published in an international peer-reviewed journal, Science of the Total Environment in their August issue. Pharmaceutical contaminants included anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen and diclofenac, anti-hypertensives (atenolol and isoprenaline), stimulants like caffeine, antidepressants such as carbamazepine, and antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin. There was significant contamination by metals such as arsenic, zinc, chromium, lead and nickel. Freshwater intake points were also found to be loaded with extraordinarily high concentrations of pharmaceutical contaminants.According to the paper co-authored by Jayakumar Renganathan, Insamam Ul Huq S, Kamaraj Ramakrishnan, Manthiram Karthik Ravichandran, and professor Ligy Philip, the team monitored the water quality of the Cauvery River for two years to assess the seasonal variation of emerging contaminants, especially pharmaceutically active compounds. The Study commenced in 2018 and the process of taking samples was completed by 2020, said a spokesperson for the institute.“Our observations are alarming. So far, not much is known about how pharmaceutical contaminants affect human health and the ecosystem over time,” said Philip. According to the environmental risk assessed by the team, it shows that pharmaceutical contaminants pose medium to high risk to aquatic life forms in the river. SIGNIFICANCE OF CAUVERY IN TAMIL NADU & KARNATAKA? WHICH MAJOR CITIES USE THEIR WATER? The team collected water from 22 locations along the entire stretch of the river, which originates in Karnataka and also irrigates the rice bowls of Tamil Nadu. Cauvery river has been mired in disputes between the two neighbouring states for decades. “We also set up 11 sampling stations near discharge points of partially treated or untreated wastewater and 11 locations near intake points of water supply systems. The quality of water at the catchment sites was also monitored,” Philip said.Pointing out that river networks contribute to 0.006% of global freshwater serving for domestic and industrial usage, whose quality across the world has been deteriorating, the institute stated that south India’s Cauvery river has been subjected to the constant human threat. “Of these, pharmaceutical contamination is serious in India, which is the second-largest pharmaceutical manufacturing country in the world,” the institute said in a statement. “These drug compounds, when released even in minuscule amounts into water bodies, can harm human beings and the ecosystem in the long run.”The team found that the monsoon season influences the quality of water quality and levels of pharmaceutical contaminants. “The post-monsoon period showed an increased level of various types of contaminants, including pharmaceuticals, due to reduced riverine flow and continuous waste discharge from multiple sources,” their statement read.The quality examination of the river water was done to understand the factors that influence the distribution of contaminants and their impacts on the ecosystem. The team said that the study shows it is essential to regularly monitor rivers and their tributaries and upgrade the wastewater treatment systems to reduce the levels of emerging contaminants in receiving water bodies such as rivers. The findings of this work also point to the need for more research into assessing the long-term impacts of emerging contaminants on human health and the environment.Experts said that the polluting situation in the Cauvery basin and its tributaries have gone from bad to worse. President of SaciWATERs and former professor of Madras Institute of Development Students, S Janakarajan, who has conducted several surveys on the Cauvery river basin and delta since 2003, said, “As far as Cauvery in Tamil Nadu is concerned, it has got four-five major tributaries. Whatever pollution load that is let into the river, goes up to the delta and then to the sea.” Noyyal, Kodaganar, Amaravathi and Bhavani are the major tributaries, which are located along with polluting industries such as dyeing and bleaching units. “In the Cauvery basin, where several towns are located starting from Mettupalayam, Coimbatore, Tripur and downstream Trichy, the sewage, solid waste, debris is all dumped into the river and its tributaries. Because of the sewage and effluents that the river carries, it looks black in the summer.”This study has been carried out with joint funding from Water Technology Initiatives of the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India and the UK Natural Environment Research Council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cauvery-majorly-polluted-by-pharma-industry-study-101633630926924.html
07-10-2021||India||Tamil Nadu MP urges state post offices to print scheme forms in Tamil, English||Continuing with his opposition against imposition of Hindi in Tamil Nadu, Lok Sabha MP from Madurai, S Venkatesan has ensured that forms in postal saving schemes, which are currently in English and Hindi, will be printed in Tamil as well. Responding to Venkatesan’s letter, the department of posts on Wednesday said that they have issued instructions to officers to get all customer related forms in post offices to be printed bilingually in Tamil and English. These will be distributed immediately to all post offices in the Tamil Nadu circle. “It stops the imposition of Hindi. More than 40 forms used across 14,000 post offices operating in Tamil Nadu will be in Tamil. Post office officials have told us that it will be fully effective in a month,” said Venkatesan. Venkatesan took up the issue with postal forms as the public found it difficult to fill them and they had to depend on others for making deposits under postal saving schemes. In his letter sent to the chief postmaster general of Tamil Nadu, dated September 22, Venkatesan said that money order forms, payment slips and withdrawal slips were previously available in Tamil but were discontinued after digital forms were introduced. “First, our country is having multi-lingual diversity and government departments have to be sensitive with regard to make customers comfortable in communications. Regional languages would ensure that,” he said in his letter. “But a government entity which has to perform like blood vessels to connect common man with the society is not doing it. How this attitude be termed- indifference or bias or imposition?” Language is a sensitive issue in Tamil Nadu, where anti-Hindi agitations date back to the 1930s. In August, based on a petition filed by Venkatesan, the Madras high court directed the Union government to strictly follow the provisions of the Official Languages Act mandating the use of English for official purposes of the Union and Parliament. The MP belonging to the Communist Party of India (Marxist), an ally of the ruling DMK had filed a petition seeking adherence to the law after a central ministry responded to his letter in Hindi. He sought action against officials who reply in Hindi without English translation, saying it violated the rights guaranteed under the Constitution as well as the Official Languages Act. The Union government at that time told the court that replying in Hindi was “was inadvertent and not intentional”.

Annamalai also gave the state government an ultimatum to roll back the decision in ten days. “If they do not do it, we don’t have a choice than to go against the government and all its activities,” Annamalai told reporters. “We will take to the streets, and this government will not have a choice other than to listen to people’s voices.”Annamalai led the demonstration in front of Kalikambal temple in Chennai’s Harbour constituency, from where the minister for Hindu religious and charitable endowments (HR & CE) Sekar Babu was elected. “They are pushing their ideology into people’s personal space, and our sacred temples in the name of Covid control,” the leader of the saffron party said. “The second wave is pretty much contained in Tamil Nadu. Vaccination has crossed 4.7 crores. Seroprevalence also says we are in safe territory,” he said.He said that the DMK government “has shown urgency” to open cinema theatres and schools, accusing chief minister MK Stalin’s family of controlling the movies production and party cadre of running private schools. He added that the government should have allowed temples, churches and mosques to continue being open. “This is the same government who, when they were in opposition, said that if they come to power, they will not follow the Centre’s rules related to Covid-19 because a state has to decide on its own in a federal set-up. But now, they’re showing the advisory circular of the Centre to justify their ways. When it suits them, they go by the advisory but when they don’t require it, it’s DMK’s habit to blame the Centre. When our rights are being dismissed, BJP has no other option but to turn this into a people’s protest,” Annamalai said.He added that the closure of places of worship was an advisory and not an order from the Centre. Coincidentally, Stalin’s wife Durga on Thursday prayed at Trichy’s famous Srirangam temple. Reacting to the protests, Babu said that though temples were closed from Friday to Sunday, required poojas were being conducted during the weekend. “Once coronavirus abates, the chief minister will re-open temples,” he said. “Those who are protesting are doing so blindly when they should also understand the importance of saving lives during this time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scrap-weekend-curb-on-temples-tamil-nadu-bjp-to-govt-101633630924321.html
07-10-2021||India||Physical hearings to resume at Supreme Court on 2 days in a week from October 20||The Supreme Court will begin physical hearing of cases on Wednesdays and Thursdays from October 20 while continuing with the earlier arrangement of having hybrid hearings on Tuesdays and hearing of cases on Mondays and Fridays strictly through videoconferencing/teleconferencing. The decision taken on Thursday was released by the Supreme Court Registry on the official website of the Court. As per the new arrangement, Thursday’s circular said, “In view of the encouraging response from the Bar and with a view to further facilitate hearing through physical mode, all the matters listed on Wednesday and Thursday, as non-miscellaneous days, would be heard only in physical presence of the counsels/parties in Court-rooms.”Even on such days, if the judge presiding in a courtroom feels that in a particular matter, the number of lawyers is more than the working capacity of the courtroom as per Covid-19 norms, the hearing of such matters shall be facilitated through video/teleconferencing/hybrid mode.For hearing on Tuesdays, the new rules said, “All the matters listed on Tuesday, as a non-miscellaneous day, would also be heard in physical mode; however, on prior application by the lawyer for the party, appearance through video/tele-conferencing mode will be facilitated.” The lawyer will have to apply for the link by 1.00 p.m. on the previous working day.Three lawyers per party shall be permitted to appear before the judges and entry into the high security zone of the Court will be by way of proximity cards already issued to lawyers practicing in the Supreme Court. Litigants who have to appear shall be issued photo identity cards by the Supreme Court Registry near the entry gates. Every party will be allowed to have one clerk for carrying the files, books and law journals.The new rules marked a departure from the earlier standard operating procedure (SOP) issued on August 28 when the Court allowed hybrid (physical and virtual) hearing for interested lawyers/litigants. However, the SOP attracted dissent from the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) as a non-starter as the SCBA President senior advocate Vikas Singh demanded full-fledged physical hearing. He also opposed the rules requiring lawyers to get a Special Hearing pass made and demanded that proximity cards alone should be allowed for facilitating entry of lawyers.All persons entering the court will have to wear masks, maintain social distancing, and undergo thermal check and other Covid-19 protocols, the new circular stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/physical-hearings-to-resume-at-supreme-court-on-2-days-in-a-week-from-october-20-101633630266586.html
07-10-2021||India||School principal and teacher killed by terrorists in J&K||A teacher in a government school and its principal were shot dead by terrorists in the city’s Eidgah area on Thursday, as a string of targeted attacks against civilians, minorities and outsiders continued in and around Jammu & Kashmir’s capital.Thus far, five people have been killed by terrorists in three days. Police said Satinder Kour, the principal of Government High School Eidgah, and a teacher at the school, Deepak Chand, died on the spot when they were fired upon inside the school premises by unknown assailants. Chand was from Jammu, and both he and Kour, a Sikh, lived in Srinagar’s Aolochi Bagh area.Police said that the militants are aiming to create an atmosphere of fear and that an attempt is being made to give these incidents communal colour.One of Kaur’s relatives said the two were profiled and then killed. “This is a blot on our Kashmir. For the last three days there have been targeted attacks on the members of the minority community. What was their fault? They have left their home to teach the students.”The Resistance Front (TRF), which police say is front for terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility for the attack on both the teachers and said that Shaheed Gazi Squad carried the attack. A statement circulating on social media from the terror group said the teachers were killed for their role in getting students to participate in the “ function at school on August 15”, India’s independence day. TRF also claimed responsibility for the killing on Monday of one of Srinagar’s best-known pharmacists, Makhan Lal Bindroo, who refused to leave the erstwhile state even when most Kashmiri Pandits were forced to flee. Monday also saw street vendor Virender Paswan from Bihar’s Bhagalpur, and Muhammad Shafi Lone, a taxi driver and taxi union head, being shot dead at separate places in Srinagar. Since last week, seven civilians have been killed in Srinagar alone. The killings in the city have spread panic and many leaders have raised questions over security in the city.“After back to back attacks there is panic in city and these attacks has exposed the claims that situation has changed in Kashmir. These incidents indicate that the situation is worrisome,” said Shabir Ahmad a resident of RajbaghLt Governor Manoj Sinha on Thursday condemned the killing of the two teachers.“I strongly condemn the barbaric killing of two of our teachers, Supinder Kour and Deepak Chand by terrorists. A befitting reply will be given to the perpetrators of the heinous terror attacks on innocent people,” Sinha said in a tweet.“The terrorists & their patrons will not succeed in disturbing peace, progress & prosperity of J&K UT. My deepest condolences to the bereaved family, friends and colleagues,” he added.J&K’s director general of police Dilbag Singh, who visited the spot along with inspector general Kashmir, Vijay Kumar, said that police has already got some viable leads in the killings of civilians . “Our investigation is underway. We got some leads in the previous attacks on civilians in Srinagar and people responsible for the attacks will be unveiled.”Singh told reporters that militants are targeting innocent people. “The aim of the killings is to create atmosphere of fear and attempt is being made to give these incidents communal colour to damage communal brotherhood in Valley. This is being done on the behest of agencies that are based in Pakistan. “The targeting of Kashmiri Pandits, Sikhs, and outsiders has created ripples in the respective communities. All Party Sikh Coordination Committee chairman Jagmohan Singh Raina said that the killings are part of the conspiracy hatched to create a wedge among the majority and minority communities living in the Kashmir valley. “People should be vigilant about the elements who want to exploit the situation for their own ulterior political motives.” He asked the Sikh youth working in different government departments to boycott their duties and sit at their homes as long as their security is not ensured by the government and also asked members of the majority Muslim community to intervene and secure the lives of minority community members.In Thursday’s attack, teachers at the school said: “We heard gunshots and attackers were shouting ‘now raise flags’”, an apparent reference to hoisting of national flags in hundreds of government buildings across Jammu and Kashmir on Independence Day. The hoisting of the national flag on August 15 was made mandatory for all government institutions, including schools this year.Former chief minister Omar Abdullah said condemnation was not enough for this inhuman act of terror. “Shocking news coming in again from Srinagar. Another set of targeted killings, this time of two teachers in a government school in Idgah area of the city. Words of condemnation are not enough for this inhuman act of terror but I pray for the souls of the deceased to rest in peace.”In a tweet, the People’s Democratic Party of former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti said: “Terrible news of killing of two teachers in Srinagar coming to fore. When will this dance of death come to an end. Will the administration stop trumpeting the hollow slogans of ‘Normalcy’ now. Deepest condolences with the families.”Former minister Sajad Lone tweeted: “Reports of cowardice emerging. Two teachers shot dead. It is important to understand that terrorists have no religion. Muslims have been killed too. I personally had a killing in my family. This is a lunatic fringe which is a curse for Kashmir. May Allah rid us of this curse.”Srinagar mayor Junaid Mattu wrote on Twitter: “Heartbroken, devastated and shattered by the news of the brutal killing of two school teachers at a school in Eidgah. No words can express my anger and anguish. My heart goes out to their families. I stand by them in this hour of grief and trauma. Inconsolable tragedy!”Soon after the attack, security around the city was strengthened and police established checking points at several places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/school-principal-and-teacher-killed-by-terrorists-in-jk-101633629844948.html
07-10-2021||India||Gauhati HC directs Assam govt to file affidavit on eviction drive that claimed 2 lives||The Gauhati High Court on Thursday directed the Assam government to file a detailed affidavit on last month’s clashes during an eviction drive in Darrang district which claimed two lives and injured nearly 20 others including 11 policemen. Acting on a PIL filed by Congress’s legislature party leader Debabrata Saikia and another suo motu petition, a bench comprising Chief Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia and Justice Soumitra Saikia asked the government to file the affidavit within three weeks. The next date of hearing on the petition is November 3. “The court took the matter seriously and directed the state government to respond on its policy regarding evictions and rehabilitation. The court rejected the advocate general’s contention that the petition was politically motivated since I am the Leader of Opposition in assembly,” petitioner Saikia said. Appearing on behalf of the petitioner, advocate Chander Uday Singh sought compensation for those evicted and also an inquiry into the killing of the two civilians by the police. On the other hand, advocate general Debajit Saikia mentioned that on September 23, the plan was to evict 125 families, but nearly 20,000 people including outsiders and with doubtful credentials gathered at the site and attacked the policemen, which in turn led to retaliatory action. In his PIL, Saikia had sought court’s intervention on conducting mandatory social impact assessment and ensure that the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 is followed in the state. The petition mentioned that those who were being evicted at Dholpur were from marginalized and socio-economically disadvantaged sections who were forced to migrate due to floods and erosions. The eviction drive at Dholpur was carried out following a state government plan to start an ambitious agriculture project on nearly 77,000 ‘bighas’ of government land. The petition, however, challenged the eviction stating that it was “arbitrary, violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution, violative of parts IX and IXA of the Constitution which requires democratization of economic and social planning, in contravention of Panchayat Act, 1994”. It added that on September 23 there was use of “excessive, illegal and disproportionate force and firearms by police officials, allegedly in response to the protests against the eviction drive”. The Assam government has already ordered a judicial inquiry on violent eviction drive at Dholpur 3 village on September 3 where clashes erupted while police were trying to forcibly remove settlers from government land. The deceased included a 12-year-old boy and a 33-year-old man. A photographer engaged by the district administration, seen jumping on an injured civilian in a viral video, has been arrested. Three residents of the area have also been arrested for instigating violence during the drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gauhati-hc-directs-assam-govt-to-file-affidavit-on-eviction-drive-that-claimed-2-lives-101633629487587.html
07-10-2021||India||Will accept India’s vaccine certificate, says UK days after Delhi’s tit-for-tat||NEW DELHI: The UK said on Thursday it will begin accepting India’s vaccine certificates from October 11, ending a row that had resulted in British nationals facing a 10-day mandatory quarantine on arrival even if they are fully vaccinated. New British guidelines on approved Covid-19 vaccines and the requisite proof of vaccination said India would be added to a “list of countries and territories with approved proof of vaccination [from] 4 am [on] Monday 11 October”. British high commissioner Alex Ellis tweeted there would be “no quarantine” for Indian travellers who were fully vaccinated with Covishield or any other UK-approved vaccine, and thanked the Indian government for its close cooperation on the issue over the past month. “From Monday... a traveller from India to the UK, double jabbed with Covishield or another vaccine recognised by the UK regulator does not have to quarantine. It will be easier and cheaper to enter the UK. This is great news,” Ellis said in a video statement. The move was in line with the comprehensive strategic partnership agreed to by the prime ministers of two countries in May, he said. Britain has issued thousands of visas to students, business travellers and tourists in recent months, Ellis added, while calling for further opening up of travel between the two sides. “Some of the noise about this issue over the last few weeks just shows how keen people are to travel to the UK and I’m delighted by that. So, let’s now go further. Let’s open up more flights between the two countries, let’s get British tourists able to come in to India... let’s facilitate business travellers who are trying to come in to India with e-visas,” Ellis said. Indians arriving in the UK before October 11 must follow the “rules for people who are not fully vaccinated”, according to the new guidelines. “If you arrive after that, you can use a vaccine certificate to prove your vaccination status,” a government notification said. Earlier in the day, India had said it was hopeful of finding a solution to the vaccine certification row. “Discussions are ongoing and we remain hopeful that some solution may emerge,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a regular news briefing. He described Britain’s travel restrictions on Indian nationals with valid vaccine certificates as “clearly discriminatory” and said measures imposed by the UK from October 4 were “not right”. He added, “We took up the issue with the UK at various levels but without success.” Once the British travel rules came into force on October 4, India imposed “reciprocal measures” that apply only to UK nationals arriving in India from Britain. The measures kicked in as the UK government didn’t make a call on accepting India’s vaccine certification more than 10 days after the conclusion of technical discussions between the two sides. The row erupted because Indians travelling to the UK had to undergo 10-day home quarantine under new rules. The British government’s failure to recognise Covishield, an Indian version of the Britain’s AstraZeneca jab, had also given rise to allegations of vaccine racism. The UK subsequently included Covishield in its list of approved vaccines. As part of an update of its travel rules, the UK also removed 47 countries and territories from its “red list”. From October 11, the red list will be reduced to seven countries, and proof of vaccination will be recognised from 37 new countries and territories, including India, Brazil, Ghana, Hong Kong, Pakistan, South Africa and Turkey. Eligible travellers vaccinated in these 37 countries and territories will “be treated the same as returning fully vaccinated UK residents, so long as they have not visited a red list country or territory in the 10 days before arriving in England”, an official statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-accept-india-s-vaccine-certificate-says-uk-days-after-delhi-s-titfortat-101633629244415.html

He must decide now," she told reporters.Asked if she is inviting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader to join the Congress, Lamba said, "I am no one to give any invitation to him, it will be Varun Gandhi's decision."Varun Gandhi shared a video clip purportedly of the Lakhimpur Kheri incident on Twitter on Thursday showing an SUV belonging to the convoy of a BJP leader crushing protesting farmers."The video is crystal clear. Protestors cannot be silenced through murder. There has to be accountability for the innocent blood of farmers that has been spilled and justice must be delivered before a message of arrogance and cruelty enters the minds of every farmer," the Pilibhit MP of the BJP said.The 37-second video clip showed a speeding Mahindra Thar running over people. Two SUVs -- one black-coloured and another white -- were seen following the Thar, while there was a commotion of people shouting and crying in the video.Eight people were killed in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence on Sunday. Of the eight, four were farmers, who were allegedly knocked down by vehicles driven by BJP workers travelling to welcome Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to an event in the area.The other four were two BJP workers, a driver of Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Kumar Mishra and Raman Kashyap, a journalist working for a private television channel.An FIR under section 302 of the IPC (murder) has been registered against the Union minister's son, Ashish Mishra, and others in connection with the incident but no arrest has been made so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-you-re-honest-about-fighting-for-farmers-quit-bjp-lamba-tells-varun-gandhi-101633628205402.html

The senior BJP leader’s associate, Umesh, was among the several raided during the day.Confirming the operation, Yediyurappa said the truth would be out a day later and then he would react to the issue. “A raid has taken place at Umesh's residence. He was not working with chief minister Basavaraj Bommai but with me. Truth will come out tomorrow morning and then I will react," Yediyurappa told reporters, adding that officials of the Income tax department never spared a wrongdoer."They never spare anyone. They have taken action as per law," the former chief minister said.When asked the reason behind the raid, Yediyurappa said he was not aware of it and knew only what had been reported in the media. He said I-T officials had summoned Umesh at 11am on Friday, following which he would be able to know the reason behind the raids.He, however, refused to drag any politics into the raids at a time when the bypolls were round the corner. "I don't want to link the raid with politics. I-T raids are different from politics. The raids keep happening normally. There is no need to find reasons unnecessarily."Sources in the I-T department said contractors in the irrigation department were the prime target of the coordinated raids. The taxmen also conducted searches at the residences and offices of a few chartered accountants. The sources said the raids took place in over 50 places across Bengaluru, Bagalkote, Belagavi, Vijayapura and Davangere.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-raids-on-premises-of-bsy-s-close-aide-ex-cm-refuses-to-drag-politics-on-op-101633628299328.html
07-10-2021||India||India, Nepal sign agreements to boost cross-border train services||India and Nepal have signed two agreements aimed at boosting cross-border train services and reviewed ongoing railway projects as part of efforts by the two countries to improve regional connectivity and trade. The agreements were inked as the two sides held the fifth meeting of a joint working group and the seventh meeting of a project steering committee in New Delhi during October 6-7 to review the implementation of cross-border railway links and bilateral cooperation in the railways sector. The signing of the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for starting passenger train services on the Jaynagar-Kurtha section will help finalise the technical aspects of running passenger trains in this region. The SOPs will also serve as a guiding document for the early start of services in upcoming cross-border railway links. The two sides also signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for a final location survey (FLS) for a proposed broad gauge railway line between Raxaul and Kathmandu. This proposed link is aimed at boosting connectivity between the two countries, the external affairs ministry said in a statement on Thursday. The officials of the two countries reviewed progress on the Raxaul-Kathmandu railway link and discussed several phase-II railway link projects. Both sides agreed to enhance technical cooperation in the railways sector, including in the areas of capacity-building, logistics support and training of Nepal’s railway personnel. Both sides also discussed ongoing work on the Jaynagar-Bijalpura-Bardibas and Jogbani-Biratnagar broad gauge cross-border railway lines, which are being developed with grant assistance from the Indian government. The technical preparedness of a 34-km section of the railway line from Jaynagar in India to Kurtha in Nepal for starting passenger train services was also reviewed. The Nepali side said the required regulatory framework will be put in place to facilitate early operationalisation of services. The Nepali side said it will facilitate the completion of the 17.25-km railway line from Kurtha to Bilajpura at the earliest. Both sides also agreed to expedite work to complete the 18.6-km railway line from Jogbani to Biratnagar. The Indian side at the JWG meeting was led by Manoj Singh, executive director (traffic transportation-freight) in the railway ministry, while Anurag Bhushan, joint secretary in the external affairs ministry led the Indian side at the PSC meeting. The Nepali team for both meetings was led by Keshab Kumar Sharma, joint secretary in the ministry of physical infrastructure and transport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-nepal-sign-agreements-to-boost-cross-border-train-services-101633627744104.html

07-10-2021||India||What message is PM Modi conveying by not sacking Union minister, asks Priyanka Gandhi||Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Thursday wondered what kind of message was Prime Minister Narendra Modi sending out by not removing Union minister Ajay Kumar Mishra whose son was an accused in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case in which at least eight persons, including farmers and a journalist, were killed on Sunday.Vadra said by allowing Mishra, a junior minister in the home department, to continue in his post, Modi was giving the message that those in power could do anything.“PM Modi needs to think what kind of message he is giving to the nation. Why is he (Mishra) still in the PM’s government? Doesn't he (PM Modi) have any moral responsibility? Why has the minister not been terminated yet?” the Congress leader was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Also read | UP Police manhandled me, tried to force me into their vehicle: Priyanka GandhiThe Union minister's son, Ashish Kumar Mishra, and others have been booked in connection with the violence that erupted during a farmers' protest on Sunday. On Thursday, police said the minister’s son had been summoned before the crime branch on Friday. Unable to find him, they pasted a notice outside the Union minister’s residence later in the evening.Vadra said if the minister of state for home did not resign or if the government failed to sack him, it would prove that one could get away with anything if the individual was a person of power or a minister. Vadra said at Moharnia, where she met family members of Gurvinder Singh, one of the four farmers killed in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence."There is no justice for the common people, the poor, farmers, Dalits and women. I want to tell Narendra Modiji that this is the message that he is giving to people," the Congress general secretary said.Also read | 'Why is this man free?'

Everyone says they are not bothered about the compensation, they are only concerned about the dismissal of the minister of state for home and the arrest of the criminals."She also said the families of the victims had some video clips of Sunday's incident that showed what had transpired that day. "The family members have said that they want justice," she added.Gandhi's convoy of vehicles was stopped by the district administration near the Ghaghra Ghat bridge as soon as it entered Bahraich from Barabanki as Section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) was in force and the Congress workers accompanying her raised slogans against the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh in protest.The magistrate and the police officers present on the spot subsequently allowed only Congress leaders Naseemuddin Siddiqui and Tanuj Punia, who had come with Vadra to proceed along with her to meet the families of the deceased farmers.The Congress general secretary, who has so far met the family members of five of the eight people killed in Sunday's violence, said she also wanted to meet the kin of the BJP workers who lost their lives."I had asked the IG to enquire if they (the BJP workers' families) were ready for the same, but was outrightly told that they do not want to meet me. I then asked him to convey my sympathy to them," she added.On her way to Bahraich, Vadra also performed a "puja" at a temple in the Arjunganj area of Lucknow.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-message-is-pm-modi-conveying-asks-priyanka-gandhi-on-mos-mishra-101633625908368.html

"Good evening! From Monday, 11th October, travellers from India to the UK, double jabbed by Covishield or any other vaccine recognised by the UK regulator does not have to quarantine. So it will easier and cheaper to enter the UK. This is great news," Alex Ellis said in a video message, thanking the Indian government for the continuous cooperation with the UK government. No quarantine for Indian 🇮🇳 travellers to UK 🇬🇧 fully vaccinated with Covishield or another UK-approved vaccine from 11 October. Thanks to Indian government for close cooperation over last month. pic.twitter.com/cbI8Gqp0QtThe UK is open for Indian travellers for months and processed thousands of visas to students, business travellers and tourists, the British high commissioner said in his message. "Some of the noise about this issue in the last few weeks just shows how keen people are to travel to the UK and I am delighted by that... Let's open up more flights between the countries..." he said.The issue started after the UK tweaked its travel rules from October 4 and did not initially mention Covishield in the list of its accepted vaccines against Covid-19. Then the UK government accepted the Covishield vaccine as it is a formulation of the Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine, already recognised by the UK regulatory authority,  but did not accept India's vaccine certificates, generated by Cowin. Several rounds of talks were held between India and the UK government to end this stalemate as not recognising India's vaccine certificate means travellers vaccinated with both doses of Covishield have to undergo the mandatory quarantine in the UK. While the talks went on, India also imposed a similar restriction on people coming to India from the UK.

Last year, some British lawmakers raised the farmers’ protests against the three farm laws in the UK Parliament last year.Birla said that every nation has its own sovereignty which other nations should respect, a statement released by the Lok Sabha Secretariat quoted Birla as saying. Birla said that no country should raise the internal affairs of other nations in its parliament unless those matters affect the interest of that country.Birla is leading an Indian parliamentary delegation to the G20 Parliamentary Speakers’ Summit in Rome. He also held a bilateral meeting with his British counterpart Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker of the House of Commons. Hoyle and Birla agreed that members of their parliaments should exchange views through parliamentary diplomacy and seek measures to strengthen democratic institutions in the interest of the people.Birla also spoke at the first working session on ‘Response to the Social and Employment Crisis caused by the Pandemic’, where he underlined that to deal with future global disasters it is necessary to treat the world as one family.

He said he will expose more wrongdoing of the agency in a press conference on Friday. Earlier, the Maharashtra minister alleged that the recent raid was a forgery and was influenced by BJP leaders. On Thursday, as Aryan Khan and seven others arrested with him were sent to 14-day judicial custody, Nawab Malik said both Rhea Chakraborty and Aryan Khan were arrested for publicity. Rhea Chakraborty was arrested by the agency in a drugs case in connection with Sushant Singh Rajput's death."Through high-profile BJP leader Manish Bhanushali, a network of NCB are trapping & extorting people," the minister alleged.Aryan Khan arrest: Nawab Malik releases new videos, questions WankhedeThe Maharashtra minister released videos of KP Gosavi and Manish Bhanushali claiming they were present during the raid and afterwards, which the agency should not allow, he said. KP Gosavi is the person with whom Aryan Khan's photo went viral after Aryan was arrested by the NCB on Sunday. The agency clarified that the person in the photo was not NCB staff. Then what was he doing there, Nawab Malik asked.Reports said Gosavi and Bhanushali were there as independent witnesses and the duo might have been NCB's informer in this particular case. Bhanushali has admitted that he is a BJP leader and he cooperated with the NCB by providing them information about the rave party that he knew was going to be held.The NCB on Wednesday reacted to the allegation and said the agency did nothing wrong. The party can approach the court if it wants, the NCB said. "Some allegations levelled against the organisation are baseless and seem to have been with malice and probable prejudice that may have been harboured in retaliation against earlier legal action carried out by NCB," the agency said in a veiled reference to the arrest of Nawab Malik's son-in-law in a drugs case early this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whether-rhea-chakraborty-or-aryan-khan-nawab-malik-now-accuses-ncb-of-extortion-101633625218745.html

Construction of the bridge will reduce the distance between Palashbari, located 27 km from Guwahati, and Sualkuchi, the centre of Assam’s silk production, located around 35 km from Guwahati. The bridge is expected to cost ₹3,094 crore. Making the announcement at a function in Guwahati, Sitharaman, who was on a day’s visit to Assam, said that the bridge would reduce travel time to Guwahati from districts Nalbari, Barpeta and Baksa located on the north bank. Earlier, the Union minister also inspected the construction of an 8.4 km long six-lane bridge connecting Guwahati with North Guwahati. To be constructed at a cost of ₹2,608 crore by the state PWD department, the foundation stone of the bridge was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2019 and it is expected to get completed in 2023. Launching the web-portal of Right to Public Services, Sitharaman said that the service would bring the public close to development without them having to run after government systems and procedures. “This web-portal is a way forward towards electronic delivery of public services to the people as a means of real time governance,” Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on the occasion adding that it will ensure that nobody is left behind from development agenda. Earlier in the day Sitharaman conducted ‘bhoomi pujan’ of the 120 MW hydro-electric project on the Kopili River at Dima Hasao district. The Asian Development Bank funded project is expected to be completed by 2024.

Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi and other Congress leaders visited Lakhimpur Kheri on Wednesday and met the families of the deceased. The Congress on Thursday submitted a memorandum to UP governor demanding the arrest of the accused in the incident. भाजपा नेताओं और उनके बेटों को लगने लगा है कि कृषि आंदोलन से निबटने के लिए किसानों को गाड़ियों से कुचल देना चाहिए। pic.twitter.com/m6mB02IeFlThe Lakhimpur Kheri violence led to national outrage as one of the accused in the incident is Ashish Mishra, the son of Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni. Ajay Mishra, the junior minister of the home department, met Union minister Amit Shah on Wednesday. No action has been taken so far against either the minister or the son.The Uttar Pradesh police on Thursday arrested two in connection with the violence and asked the minister's son to appear at the crime branch office on Friday.Earlier on Thursday, the Supreme Court termed the Lakhimpur Kheri incident as 'unfortunate and asked the UP government to submit a report on Friday informing how many arrests have been made in the case.Union minister Ajay Mishra has maintained his claim that his son was not there in the car. The minister claimed that the driver of the car lost balance after being attacked by protesters who were pelting stones. He admitted that some protesters came under the car as the car lost balance. However, a recent video that has now come to thesurface claims that there was no attack on any car.

07-10-2021||India||India hopeful of resolving vaccine certification row with UK||India said on Thursday it is hopeful of finding a solution to a vaccine certification row with the UK that has resulted in British nationals facing a 10-day mandatory quarantine on arrival even if they are fully vaccinated.“Discussions are ongoing and we remain hopeful that some solution may emerge,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said.He described Britain’s travel restrictions on Indian nationals with valid vaccine certificates as “clearly discriminatory” and said measures imposed by the UK from October 4 were “not right”.He added, “We took up the issue with the UK at various levels but without success.”Once the British travel rules came into force on October 4, India imposed “reciprocal measures” that apply only to UK nationals arriving in India from Britain.The reciprocal measures put in place by India marked an escalation in the vaccine certification row between the two sides. The measures kicked in as the UK government didn’t make a call on accepting India’s vaccine certification more than 10 days after the conclusion of technical discussions between the two sides.The row erupted because Indians travelling to the UK have to undergo 10-day quarantine under new British rules. The British government’s failure to recognise Covishield, an Indian version of the Britain’s AstraZeneca jab, had also given rise to allegations of vaccine racism.The UK subsequently included Covishield in its list of approved vaccines, but the process for accepting India’s vaccine certification is expected to take longer.The mandatory quarantine by UK nationals has to be done at home or at the destination address.All UK nationals travelling to India will also have to undergo a pre-departure Covid-19 RT-PCR test within 72 hours before travel, another RT-PCR test on arrival at the airport, and a third RT-PCR test on the eighth day after arrival.People familiar with developments said the British side is considering the issue and a resolution is expected soon. The British high commission spokesperson has said the UK is continuing to work on expanding its travel policy to countries and territories in a phased approach. “We are continuing to engage with the government of India on technical cooperation to expand UK recognition of vaccine certification to people vaccinated by a relevant public health body in India,” the spokesperson said. Britain’s decisions on vaccine recognition are made by ministers after taking into account public health factors. The UK is looking at ways for people who have been fully vaccinated elsewhere to enter the country. Visa applications from all categories of Indian travellers continue to be processed and they don’t need to be vaccinated to travel to the UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-hopeful-of-resolving-vaccine-certification-row-with-uk-101633621623764.html

07-10-2021||India||First LUH military variant to make maiden test flight next August||After wrapping up rigorous flight testing of prototype helicopters in challenging conditions, state-run plane maker Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) has set August 2022 as the deadline for carrying out the maiden test flight of the first chopper in the indigenous light utility helicopter (LUH) limited series production, senior officials familiar with the development said on Thursday. LUH will replace the army and the Indian Air Force’s ageing fleets of Cheetah and Chetak helicopters whose safety record has been blemished by a string of crashes --- two army pilots were killed last month in the latest Cheetah crash near Patnitop in Jammu and Kashmir. Around 15 Cheetah and Chetak helicopters have crashed during the last 10 years killing several pilots. Chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat (then a lieutenant general) survived a Cheetah crash in Dimapur on February 3, 2015. “The first test flight of the LUH in the limited series production (LSP) will be carried out next August, in the 75th year of the country’s independence. HAL is on the verge of getting an order for 12 LUHs --- six each for the army and IAF,” said one of the officials cited above. At his annual press conference on October 5, IAF chief Air Chief Marshal Vivek Ram Chaudhari said the air force would soon place an order for six LUHs. The design of the Cheetah and Chetak helicopters is more than 50 years old, and their airworthiness was questioned once again after the Patnitop crash. HAL expects the army and IAF to place combined orders for at least 187 light helicopters in the coming years (126 for the army and 61 for IAF). “All trials on the four LUH prototypes are over. The last set of trials to establish LUH’s extra manoeuvrability concluded in Ladakh this week. The army and IAF wanted some changes and LUH performed much better than expected,” said a second official. HAL is expected to deliver the first set of LUHs to the two services in two to three years of the signing of the contract. Subsequent orders will be executed at a faster pace as LUH production will also begin at HAL’s new helicopter factory in Tumakuru in Karnataka. LUH’s first test flight will be carried out from the Tumakuru facility. The Bengaluru and Tumakuru facilities will be capable of rolling out 100 light helicopters every year, the second official added. “The Cheetah and Chetak replacement has been long overdue. They were designed in the 1960s. LUH has proved its capabilities in multiple rounds of trials in extreme conditions in the northern sector. It’s quite an achievement in indigenous helicopter manufacturing,” said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies. Currently, the Cheetah and Chetak helicopters are a critical lifeline for troops in high-altitude areas, including the Siachen glacier. HAL has licence-produced 625 Cheetah and Chetak helicopters. It no longer builds them but is responsible for their maintenance and repair. The Army Aviation director general Lieutenant General AK Suri on Thursday visited aviation squadrons in forward areas including Leh and flew a test sortie in LUH whose trials have been successfully completed, the Udhampur-based Northern Command said. India is also looking at jointly building with Russia the Kamov-226T light helicopters in the country. The Kamovs are also expected to replace the Cheetah and Chetak helicopters. However, the $1-billion programme under which Russia will supply 60 helicopters in flyaway condition and the remaining 140 will be manufactured in India is yet to kick off. The army, IAF and navy together need around 500 light helicopters. HAL is also awaiting a contract from the defence ministry for 15 light combat helicopters (LCHs) and expects follow-on orders as the army band IAF have a combined projected requirement of 160 LCHs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-luh-military-variant-to-make-maiden-test-flight-next-august-101633618863623.html

All you need to know||Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan was not granted bail on Thursday after the court heard all the parties in a hearing that went on for hours and sent all eight to 14-day judicial custody. Aryan Khan's interim bail plea will be heard tomorrow. Aryan Khan and the other seven arrested in the case will spend tonight at the NCB office as their RT-PCR test will be done before his judicial custody begins. The case that was before the court today was a collective one for all the eight arrested. The interim bail plea that will be heard tomorrow pertains to only Aryan Khan and he might be given bail as no drugs were found on him, reports said. On Thursday, the court heard the Narcotics Control Bureau and all the lawyers of the arrested eight people. In its order, the court said that no custodial interrogation is required as sufficient time was already granted for investigation.No bail for Aryan Khan, sent to 14-day judicial custody in cruise rave party caseWhat NCB saidThe Narcotics Control Bureau sought custody of all the eight arrested and said their custody is required as they will have to be confronted with each other. Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh said that the main supplier has been intercepted.1. The custody of Aryan Khan and 7 others was required to make them confront Achit Kumar who was named by Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant as the supplier.2. Satish Maneshinde (Aryan Khan's lawyer) argued as if no one knows anyone. It is not right to claim that these eight are not connected.3. Considering the seriousness of the crime further custody is required. The investigation is at an imminent stage and the accused are required to be confronted.4. Question of these persons at one spot where drugs are found cannot be ignored, the NCB said.5. Achit, who has been arrested and sent to NCB custody, is part of a racket, the NCB said.What Aryan Khan's lawyer Satish Maneshinde said1. There is no need for custody as Aryan Khan can be called anytime to be confronted with Achit, the dealer. Also, the agency had enough time to do so as the arrested were in NCB custody only.2. The investigation has not progressed much in the past few days and Aryan Khan has not been interrogated by NCB officials in the past two days.3. Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant are friends but they did not plan to attend the party together.4. Aryan Khan can be held hostage because the NCB wants to reach the main culprit.5. Just knowing a person does not mean that one had dealt with him, Aryan Khan's lawyer said in connection with Aryan Khan knowing Achit.The court found NCB's custody plea weak and said that the agency had enough time to confront the arrested with those who have been arrested afterwards. Hence, the NCB was denied custody and all the arrested have been sent to judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-aryan-khan-was-not-granted-bail-today-why-ncb-was-denied-custody-101633617203822.html

One of these 23 districts is Kolkata, capital of West Bengal, and Kasaragod in Kerala.Also Read | Double vaccination mandatory to take part in Durga puja rituals, says Calcutta HCMeanwhile, of the 34 districts, Kerala accounts for 13, followed by Mizoram at seven, Sikkim at four, and three each in Meghalaya and Manipur, among others. “There is a need to consistently work for bringing down the case positivity rate in these 34 districts,” Agarwal said. “It is important to understand that the fear of infection still persists in the country,” he noted during the press briefing, adding that to a large extent and in several regions of India, it is being presumed that the dip in active case count means “Covid-19 is over.”Agarwal cautioned against showing any laxity, and said that there are “not one or two but many states,” which still have a high weekly case positivity rate.During the press briefing, the Centre emphasised that although India’s declining Covid-19 graph may “give comfort,” the challenge is not over yet.“While weekly positivity was 21.48% during the second wave, it is now 1.68%,” Agarwal said, adding that citizens need to remain alert during October, November and December.India on Thursday reported 22,431 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking the overall tally of the country to 3,38,94,312, according to data by the Union health ministry’s bulletin.

07-10-2021||India||Double vaccination mandatory to take part in Durga puja rituals, says Calcutta HC||The Calcutta high court on Monday relaxed some of the curbs on Durga Puja festivities while allowing local residents to take part in puja rituals, such as pushpanjali and sindur khela, provided they were fully vaccinated. “The court said that local residents, who have already received their double doses, may take part in puja activities such as sindur khela and pushpanjali. The certificates of double vaccination would have to be submitted to the organisers. Police would conduct spot verification. All other curbs imposed by the court in its earliest order remain the same,” said Sabyasachi Chatterjee, advocate. The court has already banned the entry of visitors in the puja pandals. A cap has also been put on the number of organisers who can enter the pandals at one go – while for a bigger puja the number is 60, for a small puja the number is 15. The puja committees need to put up barricades - 10 metres away from the outer end of the big pandal and five metres away from the outer end of the smaller pujas – to make the pandals a no-entry zone for visitors. This is the second year that the Durga Puja would be held in a muted manner because of the high court orders to check the spread of Covid-19. Last year the court had banned pushpanjali and sindur khela. Joint teams comprising senior officers of the Kolkata Police, fire brigade department and the power supply corporation among others have been visiting some of the biggest puja pandals to check if the court directions were being followed. At least 36,000 community pujas are held across the state, while in Kolkata alone 2,500 community pujas are held by various clubs. These are just the clubs that are registered with the state government. This apart there are pujas held in housing societies and residences. There are around 1,500 pujas which are organised by women only. Durga Puja is the biggest annual festival in West Bengal. Even though the five-day-long Durga Puja starts this year from October 11, the festivity starts much before and it extends for more than a week every year. The immersion process will start on October 15 and continue till October 17. The state government has cancelled the puja carnival during the immersion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/double-vaccination-mandatory-to-take-part-in-durga-puja-rituals-says-calcutta-hc-101633616823677.html
07-10-2021||India||Vandalism at Kabul gurdwara concern for India and world community: MEA||India on Thursday said the vandalisation of a gurdwara in Kabul by armed men is a matter of concern and the world community must insist on the protection of the human rights of all segments of Afghan society. Suspected Taliban fighters entered the Gurdwara Karte Parwan on October 5, tied up guards and destroyed CCTV cameras. The men also briefly occupied the building, smashed several locks and conducted a search, triggering concerns within the Sikh minority. “The reports of vandalism and intolerance raise concerns not just for us, but across the world,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a regular news briefing. “It is important that the international community continues to insist on the fulfilment of goals outlined in the UN Security Council resolution 2593,” he said.He was referring to a Security Council resolution adopted on August 30, when India held the rotational presidency of the UN body.He said the resolution guides the world community’s collective approach towards Afghanistan, and states that all countries should ensure that Afghan territory isn’t used for terrorism and that the rights of all Afghans, including women and minorities, are protected.The resolution also encourages all parties to seek an inclusive and negotiated settlement in Afghanistan, he said. Bagchi said the regional security situation, including Afghanistan, had figured in US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman’s talks with her Indian interlocutors on Wednesday.“We highlighted our perspective on the role of Pakistan and what our concerns are regarding that,” he said.In response to several questions, Bagchi said the issue of resumption of commercial flights to Afghanistan for the evacuation of Indian nationals and return of Afghan citizens is a sensitive issue. The visas of Afghan citizens stuck in India, facing problems for their return, are being automatically extended, he said.He further said India is yet to decide on the level of its participation in a meeting on Afghanistan convened by the G20 on October 12. He added that there was no information about India being extended any invitation for a meeting on Afghanistan being organised by Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vandalism-at-kabul-gurdwara-concern-for-india-and-world-communitymea-101633616403600.html

07-10-2021||India||No bail for Aryan Khan, sent to 14-day judicial custody in cruise rave party case||Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan was denied bail in the cruise rave party case, as the metropolitan magistrate court on Thursday sent Aryan and seven others arrested with him to 14-day judicial custody. Aryan Khan's lawyer Satish Maneshinde filed an application for an interim bail soon after the verdict, which will be heard on Friday. Aryan Khan and seven other accused will be spending the night at NCB office as jail requires compulsory RT-PCR reports and vaccine details before admitting the inmates. The Narcotics Control Bureau sought the custody of the arrested till October 11 claiming that the agency is making progress in the investigation and had recently arrested Achit and a foreign national in connection with the case. The lawyers of the arrested individually countered NCB's plea and made it clear that the investigation has not progressed much.'Longest in custody': 5 points Aryan Khan said in court through lawyerThe court in its verdict rejected NCB's plea for custody and decided in favour of judicial custody. “As per the submissions made by the prosecution, they want to confront Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant with Achit Kumar who was arrested recently. I don't do not want to go into that aspect and discuss the fact that why despite a statement given on the first day itself, they arrested Achit now…Each remand cannot be given NCB custody going through the investigations. Considering of the past custody given. No custodial interrogation is required as sufficient time was given to the agency,” the verdict said. Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh who appeared from the NCB said the agency has made progress in the present case as it has intercepted organisers, suppliers named by the accused. Praying for an extension of the custody of the eight, including Aryan Khan, the Singh said the extension of their custody is needed to establish the entire operation of the gang.One Achit Kumar who was arrested by the NCB in the same case has been sent to NCB custody till October 9. Achit was named as the supplier by Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant and the NCB sought his custody to probe into the drug case further.Contesting the prayer of the NCB that the custody of Aryan Khan and others need to be extended so that they can be confronted with Achit Kumar, Aryan's lawyer Satish Maneshinde asked the NCB why it has not been done so far. "If they have arrested someone (Achit) based on my statement, any senior officer will make him confront with me on the first day to ascertain if there is any association," Maneshinde said."The question of confronting me with someone cannot be the only ground to remand me to custody. Now they have arrested cruise organisers. Now conspiracy will be if I have any association with anyone else on the ship," Maneshinde said on behalf of Aryan Khan.Aryan Khan's lawyer also contested that the NCB does not require his client's custody as Aryan Khan was not interrogated in the last two days that he spent at NCB custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aryan-khan-bail-cruise-rave-party-case-shah-rukh-khan-satish-maneshinde-live-101633605534726.html

Scores of party leaders and workers that included state ministers Banna Gupta and Badal Patralekh besides legislators and other office-bearers and workers were denied entry by the UP administration, with the state police having barricaded the highway on the Wyndhmganj-Garhwa border. The UP administration stopped the Congress party contingent from entering the state at around 3 am on Thursday. “We were going to Lakhimpur Kheri to support the farmers and strengthen the protest being led by our leaders Priyanka Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. The Uttar Pradesh government did not allow us entry despite the fact that two state ministers were part of the contingent and we had informed the UP government on Wednesday of our plans. And the policemen who were at the border had no clue what to do and why they were stopping us,” said Jharkhand Congress president Rajesh Thakur. “The Yogi government and the BJP want to subvert democracy by using the brute force of the police but we will not budge. We will chalk out our plans again and reach Lucknow and Lakhimpur Kheri whenever required,” he added. The state Congress president led his workers back to the Jharkhand capital-- Ranchi after protesting for around six hours at the border. Others who attended the protest included party working president and legislator Bandu Tirkey, working president Shahzada Anwar, spokespersons Rajiv Ranjan Prasad and Kumar Raja. Reacting to the development, the BJP described it as ‘political tourism’ of the Congress ministers.“State agriculture minister Badal Patralekh is very concerned about farmers in Uttar Pradesh, but he is not bothered about dues to farmers against paddy procurement and black marketing of fertilisers in Jharkhand,” Jharkhand BJP general secretary Aditya Sahu told reporters last evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-govt-stops-jharkhand-congress-workers-heading-to-lakhimpur-kheri-at-border-101633613223357.html

The Narcotics Control Bureau on Thursday appealed for an extension of the custody of the eight arrested in the case to October 11 claiming that the agency is widening the probe and new revelations are being made every day. In particular, it mentioned the arrest of Achit, who was named as the supplier by both Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant. The agency said that it needs the custody of the arrested to crosscheck with Achit's statement.Aryan Khan produced at court for bail hearing, NCB seeks custody till October 11‘No progress in investigation’Aryan Khan through his lawyer Maneshinde said that there has been no progress in the investigation though they are in custody since October 2. “I readily agreed to one-day remand first.

07-10-2021||India||Former model held in hit-and-run case in Guwahati remanded to police custody||A former model arrested for injuring nine people with her vehicle in an accident in Guwahati last week was on Thursday remanded to police custody by a city court. Rejecting her bail application, the court of chief judicial magistrate Abhijeet Kumar Baruah remanded Rajkanya Baruah, a former model and Femina Miss India finalist, to a day’s police custody. Guwahati police had sought five days police custody of the former model. The court also directed the police to cancel the driving license of Baruah, who had knocked down nine persons with her car on the early hours of October 2 during Covid-19 curfew. She was arrested on Wednesday from a private hospital in Guwahati in connection with a new case after a medical board ruled out “any serious or acute condition that warranted her to be admitted into a hospital”. “There are two cases that have been registered against Baruah now. She managed to get bail in the first case registered after the accident. We have added two new charges under sections 308 and 326 of IPC to that case,” informed Subhrajyoti Bora, DCP (East), Guwahati. The new charges are for culpable homicide not amounting to murder and voluntarily throwing or attempting to throw acid. Earlier, the police had slapped charges of causing injury due to rash and negligent driving. “We have also registered a fresh case under sections 294, 325, 394, 427 and 506 of IPC against Baruah with regards to an alleged attack on one more person who is at present admitted in hospital. Both cases have been lodged at the Dispur police station in Guwahati,” said Bora. The new charges are for uttering obscene words in public place, voluntarily causing grievous hurt, voluntarily causing hurt, causing damage as part of mischief and criminal intimidation. The 29-year-old who reportedly works on cyber security issues and runs a luxury flower boutique was admitted in semi-intensive care unit (ICU) of the private hospital on Tuesday after getting summons from the police to join investigation. “After she was summoned, her mother wrote to police saying she is not well and can’t join investigation for two weeks. That’s why we requested Guwahati Medical College Hospital to probe her illness as we were also concerned about her well-being and it could affect the case as well,” Guwahati commissioner of police Harmeet Singh said on Wednesday. “We will look at all aspects of the case and will also ask the private hospital under what basis was she hospitalized. Our officers are conducting investigations,” he added. Eight of the injured persons were on their way to carry out some road repair works in connection with Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu’s visit to the city when the auto-van carrying them was hit by the car driven by Baruah. The accident took place during night curfew imposed due to Covid-19 and the former model was reportedly inebriated at that time. Both legs of another person, who was reportedly hit by Baruah’s car after hitting the vehicle carrying the labourers, had to be amputated. The incident as well as the bail granted to Baruah allegedly due to flimsy charges labelled against her led to a public outcry on social media forcing Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma to state that appropriate action would be initiated. Two police sub-inspectors from Dispur police station were ‘closed’ to the police reserve for allegedly slapping bailable charges on her and not adding provisions of Disaster Management Act in the charges for violating Covid-19 curfew. As per police, this is not the first time Baruah has come under police probe. In 2017, she had hit a former BJP MLA’s son with her car following a quarrel and a year later another case was lodged against her for hitting a policeman posted outside a bar. Both incidents took place in Guwahati.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-model-held-in-hit-and-run-case-in-guwahati-remanded-to-police-custody-101633608843498.html
07-10-2021||India||Mehbooba Mufti, J-K DGP condemn series of attacks on civilians||Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti on Thursday condemned the series of attacks carried out by terrorists on minorities in the Union Territory. The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) chief said that the security situation in the Valley was deteriorating.Mufti’s response came via a tweet after two teachers were killed on Thursday morning. “Disturbing to see the deteriorating situation in Kashmir where a minuscule minority is the latest target. The government of India's claims of building a Naya Kashmir has actually turned it into a hellhole. Its sole interest is to use Kashmir as a milch cow for its electoral interests,” Mufti tweeted.Junaid Azim Mattum, the mayor of Srinagar, expressed his condolences over the killing.Junaid said he was heartbroken and devastated after receiving the news of the killing of the school teachers in Eidgah. “No words can express my anger and anguish. My heart goes out to their families. I stand by them in this hour of grief and trauma. Inconsolable tragedy,” the Srinagar mayor tweeted.Two teachers, Supinder Kour, a resident of Alochi Bagh area, and Deepak Chand, a resident of Jammu, were shot dead when terrorists shot dead two school teachers at Sangam Eidgah. No students were present at the time of the killing. This comes two days after terrorists in three separate attacks killed a renowned pharmacy owner, a bhel puri seller and taxi stand worker in Srinagar. Of the five victims, four belonged to minority communities of Jammu and Kashmir. One of the victims who was killed on Thursday was a woman.Jammu and Kashmir lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha said that a befitting reply will be given to the terrorists. Jammu and Kashmir director general of police Dilbag Singh said that it is an attempt to defame Kashmiri Muslims, “These recent incidents of targeting civilians are to create an atmosphere of fear, communal disharmony here. This is a conspiracy to target local ethos, values and defame local Kashmiri muslims. This is being done on instructions from agencies in Pakistan,” Dilbag Singh was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehbooba-mufti-j-k-dgp-condemn-series-of-attacks-on-civilians-101633608002230.html
07-10-2021||India||Congress opted to deal with Lakhimpur Kheri violence politically||A section of Congress leaders in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh prepared a three-point legal plan to take on the Uttar Pradesh government over the violence in Lakhimpur Kheri that left eight people dead on Sunday. But the party’s top leadership instead chose to deal with the issue politically and mount pressure on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the farmers’ plight, two Congress leaders aware of the matter said.The violence was triggered when a car ran over a group of farmers protesting against the three farm laws enacted last year. Local farmers have blame junior home minister Ajay Mishra Teni and his son Ashish Mishra for the violence. Farm groups say a Mahindra Thar owned by Mishra mowed down protesters from behind. The minister and his son have denied the charge. Some unverified videos of the incident have appeared to back the farmers’ version of the incident.The Congress leaders cited above the legal plan involved an appeal to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), moving the Supreme Court for a monitored probe into the incident and challenging the imposition of Code of Criminal Procedure Section 144. The section bans the assembly of over four people and was cited to detain Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and prevent her from visiting Lakhimpur Kheri to meet the farmers killed there. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra eventually visited Lakhimpur Kheri on Wednesday along with Rahul Gandhi.“We even prepared the legal note,” said one of the two Congress leaders, requesting anonymity. The leader added leaders including both Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi instead decided to fight it politically.“So far, no mainstream Opposition party has gone to the NHRC to seek its intervention in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident. But we had a plan. ...even within our own organisation, a section was sceptical...” said the second leader on condition of anonymity.The plan to move the court was kept in abeyance as the party felt that it was important for the Congress leaders to first reach Lakhimpur Kheri to step up pressure on Uttar Pradesh’s Yogi Adityanath government.“The state government has ordered a probe by a retired judge. Thus, at this stage, a fresh demand for a court-monitored probe was found unnecessary. But we can make a demand for a court-monitored probe at an appropriate time if we see the investigation is not progressing in the right direction.”Also Read: Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu taken into custody at UP borderWhen asked about the probe ordered by the government, Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday avoided a direct answer. “First of all, I want to go there and understand the matter and what is the ground reality. ...no one knows yet, first of all, we want to go and understand that...”A former Union minister, who was in touch with Priyanka Gandhi, communicated to other leaders involved that she too wants to continue the political fight. “Anyways, a sub judice matter can take away the political sheen,” said the second leader.Regarding challenging the imposition of Section 144, the first leader cited a 2020 Supreme Court order saying it cannot be applied to restrict citizens from assembling peacefully. “It cannot be a tool to prevent legitimate expression of grievance or exercise of any democratic rights.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-opted-to-deal-with-lakhimpur-kheri-violence-politically-101633608302994.html

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stayed from the event with its leaders saying it did not carry any special significance.Banerjee, who was sworn in as the chief minister on May 5, needed to be elected to the assembly by November 4 to continue holding the post. She lost the March-April assembly polls from Nandigram.The oath-taking ceremony on Thursday was preceded by a tussle between the state government and the Raj Bhawan. According to the convention, it is the speaker who administers the oath to legislators while the governor to ministers.The governor withdrew the speaker’s power to administer the oath a few days before the September 30 by-polls to three seats in the state. On October 1, the government wrote to the governor, requesting him to authorise the speaker to administer the oath. But Dhankhar sought a gazette notification on the poll results. Because of the governor’s decision, the oath-taking ceremony could not be held on October 4.Also Read: The Rahul versus Mamata versus Arvind battleFormer lawmaker Sabyasachi Dutta separately quit the BJP to return to the TMC.

The shooting killed the school's principal and a teacher, taking the toll from targeted attacks on civilians in Kashmir to five since Tuesday.The latest attack has sparked countrywide condemnation, while many raised concerns over the targeted killing. A relative of the school teacher identified as Deepak Chand, also expressed his anguish and said that the valley, renowned as heaven on earth, has become a "hell." "We are still receiving threat calls. Kashmir is not heaven, it's hell. We're been targeted for the last 30 years," news agency ANI quoted the relative as saying.Meanwhile, the government has assured of a befitting reply to the perpetrators. "I strongly condemn the barbaric killing of two of our teachers, Supinder Kour and Deepak Chand by terrorists. A befitting reply will be given to the perpetrators of the heinous terror attacks on innocent people," tweeted Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha after the attack.Jammu and Kashmir DGP Dilbag Singh reacted to the killing and said that the civilians are being targeted to create communal tension in the Union Territory (UT). "These recent incidents of targeting civilians are to create an atmosphere of fear and communal disharmony here. This is a conspiracy to target the local ethos and values to defame local Kashmiri Muslims," Singh said.Srinagar Mayor Junaid Azim Mattu also condemned the civilian killings and appealed to all communities to stand together on this matter. "The elements backed by Pakistan are behind this. We should all come out on the streets and take a stand as a society that we will not allow this," the mayor said, as per the ANI report.Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti also expressed her condolences and said, it is "disturbing to see the deteriorating situation in Kashmir where a minuscule minority is the latest target."This is the third such attack over the last four days. Earlier on Wednesday, a street hawker was shot dead by terrorists in Srinagar. The incident took place near Madina Chowk, Lalbazar in Srinagar where terrorists fired upon the victim, identified as Virender Paswan.On Tuesday, a businessman was killed by terrorists near Iqbal Park in Srinagar. The terrorists fired upon the owner of Bindroo Medicate namely, Makhan Lal Bindroo.

07-10-2021||India||India, Asean should focus on resilient supply chains, sustainable recovery: Jaishankar||India and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) should focus on cooperation to ensure resilient supply chains and sustainable recovery to address vulnerabilities exposed by the Covid-19 crisis, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Thursday. Businesses can also play a key role in forging new partnerships for collaboration in areas such as vaccine and pharmaceutical production to cope with the inadequacies in the global health system brought out by the pandemic, Jaishankar said during his virtual address at the inaugural session of the Indo-Asean Business Summit. The business summit, organised by the external affairs ministry and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), saw envoys of Asean states and India’s ambassadors to the region participating in brainstorming sessions on strengthening business links between India and the 10-nation grouping in order to drive post-pandemic recovery. The pandemic provides the backdrop for how most countries approach their economic policies and global outlook because it disrupted supply chains, impacted manufacturing, affected trade and “veritably ruined many services sectors”, Jaishankar said. “From the prolonged crisis of the last two years, four areas have come into sharp focus for international business cooperation – resilient and reliable supply chains, health security, digital for development and green and sustainable recovery. They should constitute the core agenda for us,” he said. He added, “Covid-19 has brought out many inadequacies in the global health system. Meaningful partnerships, sharing of advanced technologies, collaboration in vaccine and pharmaceutical production, capacity-building and transparency in health information are all part of the answers.” Jaishankar also said that the uncertainties arising from Covid-19 cannot be seen as a one-time phenomenon, and countries will have to plan for the future. “A large part of the answers – both short-term and beyond – lies in diversification, expansion and transparency. De-risking our national economies will only be possible if we achieve a strong measure of success quickly in that regard,” Jaishankar said. He added that while India’s “Look East” policy has matured into “Act East”, there is a need to re-imagine India-Asean cooperation following the pandemic. “There is no doubt that Asean is one of the major hubs for India’s global economic engagement. As it develops, it is natural that we would like to revisit the level of ambition that we have set for our partnership,” he said. Also Read | India, US ready to compete with China: US diplomatIndia’s success in developing the first DNA vaccine for Covid-19, its role as a major global vaccine production centre, and the Quad vaccine partnership could lead to significant benefits for countries in the Indo-Pacific region, Jaishankar said. At the same time, strengthening of digital connectivity with Asean and the larger Indo-Pacific has assumed greater importance, and India can offer science and technology-based innovations to help the region, he added. Jaishankar said that the pandemic has given additional impetus to diversification of the global value chain, and India’s campaign for self-reliance will make it a trustworthy partner for global industrial resiliency. “At the same time, we need to take full advantage of building back better by ensuring a greener economic recovery,” he said. He added that India has a strong record on climate action and an ambitious vision for renewable energy sources and green hydrogen. “It is important that we – India, the Asean and our relationship – we recognise that a different world awaits us. It is one that puts greater premium on trust and transparency, resilience and reliability, as also on choices and redundancy,” Jaishankar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-asean-should-focus-on-resilient-supply-chains-sustainable-recovery-jaishankar-101633600862687.html

Police said the two are close aides of Asish and more raids are going on. Their arrest come hours after the Supreme Court on Thursday asked the UP government to submit a report within a day on how many arrests have been made so far in connection with the case. "In the status report also tell us about the eight persons who have been killed. Farmers, journalists etc. It is an unfortunate incident. Tell us whom you registered FIR against. How many have you arrested," the Supreme Court said as it heard a case on Lakhimpur violence. "The grievance is that you are not registering a proper FIR and a proper investigation not taking place," Chief Justice NV Ramana said.The Lakhimpur Kheri violence has triggered a major political storm as the main accused Asish Mishra, who has been named in police FIR, is the son of the minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni. As the opposition leaders are raising demand for the removal of Ajay Mishra, the minister of state on Wednesday met Union home minister Amit Shah in New Delhi. Ajay Mishra has been claiming that his son was not there in the car which ran over the protesters. He claimed the driver lost the balance after being attacked by stone pelters and then some protesters came under the car. Later, his driver was lynched and the car was set on fire, the minister has claimed.The FIR has named Ashish Mishra and said that he was driving the car which ran over the protesters. According to the FIR, Ashish also opened fire after getting down from the car and then he went into hiding. However, a fresh video of the incident suggests that three cars were involved in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence and those cars were not under any attack. The first car rammed a group of protesters who were walking with flags at an unexpectedly high speed, followed by the two other cars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-2-arrested-minister-s-son-untraceable-101633599529070.html

Bhanushali was seen with Aryan Khan's friend Arbaaz Merchant. Nawab Malik claimed Bhanushali is a BJP leader. The NCB on Wednesday said if the party has any problem, it can approach the court as the agency did not do anything wrong.Cruise rave party: Who took the selfie with Aryan Khan? What did NCB say?Training the gun on NCB official Sameer Wankhede, Nawab Malik questioned a video in which Wankhede said 8-10 people have been arrested by the NCB in connection with the cruise rave party case. The Maharashtra minister said at that time eight people were arrested. "Why was he not sure about the number of arrests. Did they have an intention to frame 2 more people?" Nawab Malik said. Sameer Wankhede's statement where he said 8 to 10 people have been arrested by the NCB, while 8 people were arrested. Why was he not sure about the number of arrests?Did they have an intention to frame 2 more people? pic.twitter.com/28A8uoXUuiHere’s the video of Kiran P Gosavi and Manish Bhanushali entering the NCB office the same night the cruise ship was raided. pic.twitter.com/25yl9YsrSJA day after Nawab Malik raised suspicion over the functioning of the Narcotics Control Bureau, the issue of Shah Rukh Khan's arrest has snowballed into a political controversy with the Maharashtra Congress demanding action against NCB officers for violations of norms laid down in the NCB handbook. “There are discrepancies in the statements given by the NCB officers related to the seizure of the drug and about the private persons present during the raids. The officers said that Manish Bhanushali was an independent witness while Bhanushali himself has stated that he was an informant in the case. The officers have not followed the law while handing over the custody of the accused to a private person. We demand an internal inquiry by DG, NCB to clear the air. Otherwise, there will be room to believe that the agency is working to implement political agenda to defame the Maharashtra government,” Congress leader Sachin Sawant said. Who are KP Gosavi and Manish Bhanushali?According to reports, KP Gosavi is a private investigator and Manish Bhanushali is a BJP leader. Both of them might have been NCB's informer pertaining to this particular case. NCB did not clarify their identity; it neither commented on their presence during or after the raid. It just said the man in the photo was not an NCB official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aryan-khan-arrest-nawab-malik-releases-new-videos-asks-2-questions-to-wankhede-101633596614856.html

I-T sleuths searched official and residential premises of the linked individuals in Mumbai, Pune and Satara.Also Read: Aryan Khan’s NCB custody ends today, will seek bail in drugs caseThe tax department has not revealed names of business entities or individuals being raided. However, Pawar himself told journalists that the I-T department was raiding places linked to him and his three sisters. He also said he doesn’t know the purpose of these raids as he was tax compliant. I-T sources said premises of a company linked to Pawar’s son Parth was also searched on Thursday’s operation. “It is true, I-T has raided a few firms related to me. It is their right…I don’t know whether they were conducted for political purposes or they want more information as we have been paying taxes on time. However, my only grief is that they conducted raids on the premises related to my three sisters. One stays in Kolhapur and the other two in Pune after getting married 35 to 40 years ago.I could not understand the reason behind raids on them,” said the deputy CM. “If they are getting raided because they are my sisters, then the people of the state should ponder about the extent of misuse of central agencies. I am repeating that I have no complaint over raids on sugar mills [related to me], they [I-T department] can do whatever they feel like but I am feeling bad for those who are not related [to my businesses] in that context and [if] people can go [to] this level…Raids were conducted on sisters [establishments] even when they have no relation with my firms and politics,” he said.Reacting to the I-T raids, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief and Pawar’s uncle Sharad Pawar, said, “I came to know about IT raids on three of my nieces but don’t know why as they are not related to politics. As raids are still going on, I would be able to comment only after they are over,” Pawar told reporters before the raids ended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/itax-raids-at-premises-linked-to-maharashtra-dy-cm-ajit-pawar-kin-101633595522414.html

Since last week, seven civilians have been killed in Srinagar alone.Top police officers rushed on the spot as the shooting was reported but remained tight-lipped about the fresh killings as condemnations poured in. Former chief minister Omar Abdullah said condemnation was not enough for this inhuman act of terror. “Shocking news coming in again from Srinagar. Another set of targeted killings, this time of two teachers in a Govt school in Idgah area of the city.

07-10-2021||India||Home alone: Helping pets deal with anxiety||Caesar the Labrador is never home alone. When he first came home as a puppy, last year, his parents were working remotely due to work-from-home routines brought on by the pandemic. They didn’t leave his side for even a second. He was a part of every celebration and sad moment. And Caesar is not an exception as he represents a host of pandemic puppies and Covid kitties that are used to lots of quality time with their human friends. Indeed, with vaccination coverage getting better and cases dropping, such pets may now need to be prepared to spend more unsupervised time alone.Dr Kalpana Pawar, veterinarian, Wiggles, believes that post-pandemic period’s separation anxiety is one of the biggest concerns that pet owners face today. “These thousands of so-called ‘pandemic pets’ have never experienced a full day away from their humans,” she says.Pets have played a major role in the lives of many families during the past year. “Over the last 18 months, the number of pets in our neighbourhoods have increased exponentially. Deprived of human company during lockdown, we choose to turn towards our furry friends,” says Divya Singh Vishwanath, pet parent, lifestyle blogger and stylist. “I’ve a 1.5 year old cat that I adopted in October last year. The purpose was to bring company home for my daughter. However, we did not realise cats can feel lonely too. Once things started getting normal, we realised he had lost weight and was diagnosed with anaemia. After prolonged medication, she is now doing well,” says Tanushree Roy Chowdhury, a cat mum, who is dealing with her cat’s anxiety.As pet parents return to work, pets may be at risk of developing or displaying signs of separation distress. “Some pets cry when their humans leave but just need time and a bit of training. But some have genuine separation anxiety—to the point where they start tearing up the blinds or barking non-stop. They’re not just upset, they are terrified,” says Dr Aditti Tiwari, veterinarian.But if dealt properly there can be a smooth transition for the pets. “If you need to step out, ensure that someone known is at home. Alternately, pet boarding facilities are also a great option,” says Kushal Chipkar, dog trainer, Wiggles.Your dog or cat will need time to build up their confidence and be ready to spend time alone, so start prepping them beforehand. Schedule waking up, feeding and walking as you might for your expected workday routine, then introduce a consistent departure schedule that builds on that routine. “Make sure the transition is gradual. Don’t suddenly pull the plug on the attention you give your doggo. Friendly treats and toys always help calm the nerves and it’s important to make sure your work schedule doesn’t majorly affect your pet’s meal times. It is important that your pet feels secure and well fed,” adds Vishwanath.“Healthy and nutritious food is known to calm pets. One of the most reliable and natural ways is to include Hemp Seed Oil as it has naturally calming and healing properties. Include essential fatty acids like Omega 3 and 6 in their diets, as a deficiency affects a pet’s mood, behavior and immunity,” says Dr. Pawar.What your dog eats has a major effect not only on his health and well-being but may also give your dogs a sense of calm. “Blueberries, Turkey,fishes like Atlantic Salmon, mackerel, sardine and anchovies. Grains like whole oats and brown rice. You can also administer Bach flower remedies to your dogs under the guidance of your nutritionist or a pet homeopath, Bach flower remedies are completely natural and safe and available in good homeopathic stores,” suggests Akershika Mishra Clinical pet Nutritionist.An exercised pet (especially dogs) will likely find it easier to relax while you’re away. Keep their mind busy with activities like food-dispensing toys—it keeps them from getting bored while you’re away. “Involve them in agility training, confidence-building exercises, teach them new tricks, get them enrichment toys, puzzles for indoor activities,” suggests Chipkar.By adjusting our routines now, the transition back to office will be easier for pets and for people. Tips to prep your pet—Start practising to give them a routine and sense of predictability, taking small steps incrementally. Take walks without them and don’t take them on every car ride. If you don’t drive, find another venue to create space.—Provide them with toys and treats to focus on while you work in a different room.—Even if the weather isn’t good for driving, pull your car out of the parking area and sit for a while making your pet familiar with the routine.-Leave the TV on or play music—the background noise can help soothe your pet. You can also install a camera to check on your pet during the day.-Sometimes a blanket or shirt with their pet parent’s scent helps comfort pets, consider adding one to their safe space.- Keep departures low key, as prolonged goodbyes may increase your pet’s anxiety. A swift approach helps your dog or cat stay calm and teaches them to worry less when you’re gone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/home-alone-helping-pets-deal-with-anxiety-101633589462943.html

Several videos have emerged over last two days that show a convoy of vehicles linked to the minister’s son Ashish Mishra run over a group of farmers walking on a rural road in Lakhimpur Kheri. The Uttar Pradesh police has registered a case against Mishra’s son and others but no action has been taken against them as of now. Several political leaders have accused the Centre of insensitivity and questioned why the accused has not been arrested and the minister removed.The BPRD had initially suggested on Wednesday that the event, ‘7th national conference of heads of prisons of all states/union territories’, organised at its headquarters in Mahipalpur, had been put on hold.However, the event took place and Mishra attended it as the chief guest as per the original programme and even addressed the officers present there. The content of his speech was not provided to the media.Also Read: Jharkhand Congress workers on way to Kheri stopped at UP borderEight people, including four farmers and a local journalist Raman Kashyap, died on Sunday in violence that broke out when at least one car, allegedly driven by the minister’s son, hit protesting farmers, prompting an angry crowd to burn two vehicles and lynch the occupants of one of the vehicles. Farmers have sought the arrest of father-son duo.

He added the situation is under control and peace talks between the two communities are going on.Around 70 people have been arrested for rioting.On Tuesday, the curfew was imposed when violence broke out after a clash over the removal of religious flags from a thoroughfare.

07-10-2021||India||A year on, assembly poll defeat to steal sheen from Bengal BJP’s Durga Puja||October 22, 2020 was a significant day in Bengal politics as Prime Minister Narendra Modi virtually joined the commencement of the first Durga Puja the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) organised at the campus of the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre (EZCC) in Salt Lake, a township located on eastern outskirts of Kolkata. No other prime minister had inaugurated a Durga Puja in Bengal.As Modi invoked the goddess in Bengali and talked of female empowerment, laws to curb crime, Jan Dhan accounts for 22 crore women and Central schemes such Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao (save and educate the girl child), the speech was streamed by the party to its supporters at all 294 assembly constituencies of the poll-bound state.EZCC, which is the under the Union ministry of culture, wore a festive look with innovative decor, cultural activities and live performance by esteemed artists, drawing people from all over.Buoyed by the party’s record performance in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, in which the BJP bagged 18 of the state’s 42 seats, leaders from the state and national executive committees did their best to turn the five-day puja into a grand event.However, months after the BJP ended up winning only 77 assembly seats in the keenly watched March-April assembly polls, many in the saffron camp are now apparently trying to distance themselves from the puja.“It is not the BJP’s puja. BJP does not organise pujas,” the state unit’s former president Dilip Ghosh, who was recently made a national vice-president, said on Monday.Hours later, Sukanta Majumdar, Ghosh’s successor to the state president’s chair, said, “The puja will be held. Tradition and religious customs rule that if you do it once, you must continue for two more years.”Also Read: Modi completes 2 decades in public office, BJP to hold day-long eventsBJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu, a resident of Salt Lake, said, “I may pay a couple of visits to EZCC. I did the same last year. I was never involved in organizing the event.”Another state BJP leader who resides in the Salt Lake area did not even want to comment on record.President of the state Mahila Morcha (women’s wing) of the BJP and legislator from the Asansol South assembly constituency, Agnimitra Paul, told HT that the women’s unit will take the entire responsibility.“The Mahila Morcha did everything last year. The Yuva Morcha (youth wing) helped us. We expect their cooperation this year as well. But the festival will be scaled down. The reason is not what people are perceiving. The BJP increased its tally from three to 77. This cannot be called a defeat by any stretch of imagination. Mamata Banerjee is scared of holding an assembly session because she knows our legislators will raise uncomfortable questions and pin her down,” said Paul.“We are in no mood to celebrate because more than 45 of our workers have been killed in post-poll violence. Women have been raped. Also, thousands are suffering in the districts because of the floods for which Banerjee is falsely blaming the Centre. We see no joy in this festival,” Paul, who is also a noted fashion designer, added.BJP leaders said the possibility of Modi addressing the commencement of the event next week is thin.Sabyasachi Dutta, the former mayor of Salt Lake who switched over to the BJP after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, actively participated in the puja last year.“The BJP state office sought permission from the EZCC for holding the puja in 2020. The permission was later routed through the police and fire services department. This year, however, I don’t see any serious effort being made. If the puja is downsized, critics will say last year’s grandeur and the Prime Minister’s speech were only aimed at the elections,” Dutta told the media on Wednesday.After the 2019 polls, the BJP tried to associate itself with community Durga Pujas in Kolkata and the districts to reach out to people but the assembly elections have altered the equations, a section of party leaders feels.The BJP’s tally in the legislative assembly came down from 77 to 75 immediately after the polls as two MLAs from north Bengal did not take oath and preferred to retain their Lok Sabha seats. By-polls in these constituencies, Dinhata and Santipur, will be held on October 30. Furthermore, the BJP’s tally has come down to 71 since June as four of its legislators have joined the Trinamool Congress (TMC).The ruling party, on the other hand, has increased its numbers from 213 to 215 by winning two seats in Murshidabad, where elections could not be held in April-May because of the death of two candidates. These results were announced on Sunday along with that of the Bhawanipore by-poll which Mamata Banerjee, a self-declared patron of community pujas, won.Bollywood singer-turned politician Babul Supriyo, who joined the TMC after being dropped from the Union cabinet, played a key role in the cultural events held at EZCC last year. He enthralled the audience with his popular numbers.On Wednesday evening, Supriyo was found accompanying Mamata Banerjee at the launch of the festival number of the TMC’s mouthpiece and an album of songs composed by the chief minister.While the event was in progress, Supriyo presented the chief minister a melodica, a wind instrument that works on the principles of the harmonica but comes with a keyboard into which wind has to be blown through a long pipe.“I have never used this. I cannot blow into the pipe. Let Babul do it and I will play the keys,” said the chief minister.As the former BJP Lok Sabha member from Asansol blew into the melodica, the TMC president played a few lines from a Tagore song. “Babul you must sing,” insisted the chief minister, making it apparent that changes in the political scenario will reflect on Bengal’s biggest festival in less than a week||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-year-on-assembly-poll-defeat-to-steal-sheen-from-bengal-bjp-s-durga-puja-101633581301972.html

Retired Allahabad high court judge Padeep Kumar Shrivastava will probe the incident and submit the report in two months.A notification signed by Additional chief secretary Awanish Kumar Awasthi said that the one-man commission has been constituted on the opinion of governor Anandiben Patel, who said that a probe is needed for the public importance.Eight people were killed in the violence in Tikunia in Lakhimpur Kheri on Sunday. Four of them were farmers.The Supreme Court, meanwhile, registered a public interest litigation on its own on the violence on Wednesday. A bench headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana and also comprising justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli will hear the case today.The suo motu (on its own motion) case has been registered as “In Re Violence in Lakhimpur Kheri (UP) leading to loss of life”.Local farmers blame junior home minister Ajay Mishra 'Teni' and his son Ashish Mishra for the violence that left four cultivators dead. Farm groups say a Mahindra Thar owned by Mishra mowed down protesters from behind while they were returning from a demonstration on Sunday afternoon.The minister and his son deny the charge and say farmers pelted the car with stones that led the driver losing control of the vehicle. They also accuse the protesters of lynching two Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers and the car's driver.Ashish Mishra and 20 others have been booked for murder but farmers continue to press for his arrest.The opposition parties started attacking the BJP-led Uttar Pradesh government after the incident. A number of leaders from Congress, Samajwadi Party and other outfits tried to visit Tikunia, but were stopped the by Uttar Pradesh Police citing prohibitory orders in the area under Section 144 of the CrPC. Finally, the state government lifted the curbs on Wednesday and allowed all the politicians to visit the village.After the relaxations, Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, along with Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, his Punjab counterpart Charanjit Singh Channi, AICC general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal, party MP Deepender Hooda and Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) president Ajay Kumar Lallu, reached the remote village - roughly 10km from the India-Nepal border.“Shared grief with the family of Lovepreet. But until justice is not done, this satyagraha will continue. Won’t forget your sacrifice, Lovepreet,” tweeted Rahul Gandhi.

The tourist bus reached Baburi village on Kisan Path in the Deva Kotwali area around 5.30am on Thursday when a truck heading towards it from the opposite end “suddenly went berserk” and collided against it head-on. Splinters came off from the heavyweight vehicles, according to eyewitness reports, owing to the fact that both the bus and the truck were travelling at very high speeds.Police personnel and officials from the district administration rushed to the spot on receiving news of the accident. As per a report by HT's sister publication Live Hindustan, emergency responders managed to cut off portions from the bus and retrieve the injured from the accident spot. When the injured people were dispatched to the district hospital, the doctors declared nine of them dead on arrival, as per the report.

Mishra made this observation while delivering his remarks on the second day of the New India Urban Expo in Lucknow, on Wednesday.“In 2047, when the country marks the 100th year of its independence, we will have Metro trains running in at least 100 cities. The total length of the Metro network in the country currently stands at 500 kilometers. By 2047, its length will have increased 10 folds to 5000 kilometers,” Mishra said, according to Hindustan Times’ sister publication Live Hindustan. The official also projected that once the Covid-19 pandemic is over, the daily ridership of this mode of transit, across all networks, will rise to 10 million. “Before the pandemic, up to 8.5 million people were travelling on Metro trains each day. At present, their number is at around 3-3.5 million,” he further said. Mishra also heaped praise upon other related modes of transit such as Metrolite, Metro Neo and Water Metro, saying that these cost less than a Metro project.At present, India’s Metro network is the fifth-largest globally, with trains operating in cities such as Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kochi, Jaipur, Gurugram, Noida, Lucknow etc. Projects are lined up in various other cities as well. Kolkata Metro, launched in 1984, is the oldest while Delhi Metro, which commenced operations in 2002, is the second-oldest, as well as the largest and busiest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-least-100-cities-in-india-to-have-their-own-metro-networks-by-2047-says-top-official-101633578454285.html

The Congress won 19, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) 15, Shiv Sena 12, and Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi eight. The BJP’s tally has gone down by nine seats. The Congress, NCP, and Shiv Sena, which are part of the state’s ruling coalition, together won 46 of the 85 district council seats. They gained 10 seats.The Congress won the highest--36--of the 144 panchayat samiti seats for which by-polls were held. The BJP won 33, Shiv Sena 23, and NCP 18. Smaller parties and independent candidates won the remaining 34 seats.The by-elections were held after the Other Backward Classes (OBC) members were forced to vacate their local bodies seats won in January 2020 in Dhule, Nandurbar, Akola, Washim, Nagpur, and Palghar as the Supreme Court quashed the quota for them. The court said the 27% quota in seats for OBC in the local bodies can be continued only if it is backed by empirical data. It reiterated the quota introduced in 1994 taken together with the reservation for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes cannot exceed the 50% cap.The by-polls were held months before local bodies’ elections including in Mumbai are due in February. Experts say the results show the OBC community has not voted decisively for or against any party. The BJP has blamed the Uddhav Thackeray-led government for the Supreme Court order against OBC reservation saying it failed to convince the court on why the community needed it.Also Read: Experts say Covid-19 spike can’t be ruled out in Maharashtra, advise cautionSoon after the court’s order in March, the government promulgated an ordinance granting up to 27% reservation to OBC candidates in rural local bodies. It is expected to promulgate another ordinance to ensure political reservation in urban local bodies.“It is clear that the (ruling) MVA (Maha Vikas Aghadi) parties will have to come together if they want to keep BJP out of power in the next assembly elections. It would also make sense for them to contest next year’s local bodies’ polls together. Not only do they have a chance to win more seats, but it would also provide stability to the Thackeray-led government,” said political analyst Surendra Jondhale. “...the results show (the BJP is) still in a better position that other parties...” He added there could be disappointment among the OBCs that the BJP-led central government is not helping them. “In Vidarbha, the OBCs have probably voted for the Congress. This could be an opportunity for the MVA to win over a large chunk of OBCs provided it takes concrete steps to restore the community’s political reservation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtras-ruling-alliance-partners-improve-tally-in-local-bodies-bypolls-101633578841100.html

These assets include land, hotels, bank balance, and demand drafts attributed to the Rose Valley Group.The agency initiated a money-laundering investigation after FIRs were registered by West Bengal Police against the group and its chairman Gautam Kundu and others. Subsequently, ED arrested Kundu in 2015 in Kolkata. Gautam Kundu’s wife, Subhra Kundu was also arrested earlier in January this year by the Central Bureau of Investigation. Trinamool Congress parliamentarians Sudip Bandopadhyay and Tapas Pal were also arrested by CBI in 2017 in connection with the case.As reported earlier by Hindustan Times, the ₹17,000 crore Rose Valley scam is the biggest in Bengal in terms of money involved. The Supreme Court had asked the CBI to investigate the scam and the role of influential people earlier in 2014.“The group had collected huge amounts of money from the common gullible public by floating fake and fictitious schemes and defaulted on repayments,” the ED said in the statement released on Wednesday.

07-10-2021||India||Trade unions to protest against National Monetisation Pipeline today||A joint platform of trade unions is scheduled to hold protests on Thursday against the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP), a scheme introduced by the central government to raise as much as $81 billion by leasing out state-owned infrastructure assets over the next four years. According to the Union ministry of finance, the NMP will help fund new capital expenditure without putting pressure on government finances. However, the trade unions call the plan a “destructive” and “nefarious design” to hand over public infrastructural assets to private hands at little to no cost.The joint platform of trade unions consists of the All-India Trade Union Congress, the Indian National Trade Union Congress, the United Trade Union Congress, the Labour Progressive Federation, the Self Employed Women's Association, as well as the Hind Mazdoor Sabha, the Trade Union Coordination Committee, and the All-India United Trade Union Centre.Also Read | National Monetisation Pipeline: What is it and how will it benefit the country?In a statement issued last month, the trade unions alleged that the National Monetisation Pipeline announced by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is merely a scheme to hand government assets to private hands “virtually free”. They said that the NMP enables the private players to generate revenue without any obligation of capital cost; only a small part of that “huge revenue” will be shared with the government, they claimed.In accordance with this discontent, the trade unions plan to carry out an awareness campaign today to voice their protests against the NMP scheme. The unions have also dubbed October 7 as “national protest day”, having planned agitations at the district level.Meanwhile, according to the government vision, NMP is envisaged to serve as a medium-term roadmap for identifying potential monetisation-ready projects, across various infrastructure sectors. The NMP has been prepared after insights, feedback, and experiences consolidated through multi-stakeholder consultations undertaken by Niti Aayog, the finance ministry, and the infrastructure line ministries.For now, the government has only included the assets of infrastructure line ministries and CPSEs working in the infrastructure sectors. Monetisation through disinvestment and monetisation of non-core assets have not been included in the NMP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trade-unions-to-protest-against-national-monetisation-pipeline-today-101633572824139.html

These 35 PSA oxygen plants are being set up across the 35 states and Union Territories.The Prime Minister’s Office said that 1224 such oxygen plants have been financed by PM CARES all throughout the country and 1,100 of these plants have already been commissioned, providing an output of over 1,750 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen per day. PM Modi tweeted to say that oxygen plants were ‘vital healthcare infrastructure’ and added, “I would be in Devbhoomi Uttarakhand tomorrow, 7th October. 35 PSA Oxygen Plants across various States and UTs would be dedicated to the nation. This is vital healthcare infrastructure for larger public benefit.” During the second wave of Covid-19, India faced a debilitating shortage of medical oxygen with more than 10,000 metric tonnes (MT) required daily due to the exponential surge in infections and deaths. Since these demands could not be met, the government banned the industrial usage of oxygen, airlifted oxygen from those industrial plants and ran oxygen supply trains.Also Read: Modi completes 2 decades in public office, BJP to hold day-long eventsHowever, a political blame game ensued over government’s claim that no state had reported even a single death caused by the shortage of oxygen during the ongoing second wave. on Monday, the Supreme Court refused to order a nationwide investigation into the shortage of medical oxygen and said that while it may be convenient for some to criticise the government, the top court will not conduct a “legal post mortem” of past events to “demoralise authorities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmmodi-to-dedicate-35-oxygen-plants-funded-by-pm-cares-to-nation-101633574400656.html

This comes a day after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said a spike in cases could not be ruled out completely due to upcoming festivals and seasonal migration. Mumbai also reported seven deaths, taking the city’s Covid related death toll to 16,136 out of the total 746,703 infections it has registered so far. The city’s recovery rate is at a healthy 96% and the fatality rate is 2.16%. The city has 5,451 active cases and it reported 1.50% positivity rate on Wednesday.On Monday, BMC was reported to have told the Bombay high court that the vaccination drive was progressing smoothly with there being no shortage of vaccines now and the municipality didn’t see a third wave of the disease coming. However, it added that a spike in cases cannot be ruled out.”The situation in the city is very comfortable right now and it is maybe safe considering we are able to handle the caseload very well and there is adequate health infrastructure to handle cases. However, we cannot completely rule out any further spike. There are festivals including Navratri, Dussehra and Diwali coming, where there will be gatherings,” Suresh Kakani, BMC’s additional municipal commissioner told HT on Tuesday. “We cannot make any claim that a third wave will not come. In Ahmednagar district, several villages are facing a spike and we cannot claim anything on the above lines. We have to remain cautious and continue following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, and get vaccinated, considering it is definitely helping in controlling the spread,” Kakani added, clearly articulating that BMC was not in a position to rule out a third wave of Covid infections.Experts on the other hand had indicated that while there was likely to be a spike in cases due to extensive unlocking, a third wave in the metropolis was unlikely now.Also Read: Religious places in Maharashtra to reopen from todayMoreover, the number of cases in Maharashtra are on a declining trend currently with weekly positivity rate dropping to 2.07% from last week’s 2.11%.

It is the proportion of the total tests that turn positive in that region. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that this should remain below 5% for an outbreak to be considered under control. Maharashtra currently has 11 districts, which have positivity rates above the state average of 2.07% but under the 5% threshold.Maharashtra on Wednesday recorded 2,876 Covid-19 new Covid cases and 90 deaths, taking the state tally to 6,567,791 infections so far.

Khan and two others are in the custody of Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), which first detained and then arrested them after a raid on the ship off the coast of Mumbai.Khan's custody is ending today (October 7) and his counsel will again apply for bail.Watch: NCB says more arrests made in drugs caseAt the last hearing on October 4, the NCB told the Esplanade court that it found WhatsApp chats, which it claimed were discussions with peddlers and sought custody of Aryan Khan, Arbaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha to investigate the links. The court then extended the trio's custody till October 7.The lawyer of the 23-year-old, son of actor Shah Rukh Khan, told the court that Aryan Khan was invited to the ship as a guest and that he was not even allotted any seat or cabin. The lawyer Satish Maneshinde denied Aryan Khan's link with peddlers and accusing the NCB of basing its case solely on WhatApp chats without finding recovering from his client.Meanwhile, the NCB said that it has so far arrested 16 people in connection with the case. NCB Mumbai director Sameer Wankhede on Wednesday said that there are some links related to Bitcoin.The NCB raid was conducted on October 2.A political slugfest has started, with Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) - part of the three-party ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance - terming the raids as "fake", alleging no drugs were found during it, even as it questioned the presence of two persons along with the NCB team during the raid, claiming one of them was a member of the Bharaitya Janata Party (BJP).Both the NCB and BJP denied the NCP charges as "baseless".“One of them is Manish Bhanushali, who claims to be a BJP office-bearer and the other is KP Gosawi, who claims to be a private detective," Maharashtra minorities affairs minister and NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said at a press conference on Wednesday.“According to the Bhanushali’s Facebook profile, he is a BJP vice president and has photos with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, BJP chief JP Nadda...,” Malik claimed.Bhanushali later told a TV channel that he was a BJP worker and that the NCB conducted the raid based on his tip.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aryan-khan-s-ncb-custody-ends-today-will-seek-bail-in-drugs-case-101633565056786.html

07-10-2021||India||India, US ready to compete with China: US diplomat||The US and India are like-minded partners, and the two are ready to compete vigorously with China, US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman said, cautioning “economic coercion” could hamper efforts to build a strong international economy -- a message seemingly aimed at Beijing.“We do ask that countries understand that economic coercion is not the way forward to build a strong international economy and a global prosperity and security,” she said on Wednesday while addressing a session at the US India Business Council along with India’s foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla.Sherman said she had “very extensive” discussions with foreign secretary Shringla, and she also met national security adviser Ajit Doval on various matters of mutual interest.“I had excellent meetings here, and I think we all are ready to do the work that’s necessary to ensure prosperity, peace and stability in the world,” she said while replying to a specific question related to China. Sherman and Shringla were delivering keynote armchair conversation on ‘Strategic Convergence – Aligning Our Economies and Our Indo-Pacific Ambitions’ at USIBC India Ideas Summit.She said that the two partners have shared democratic values, which are the “bedrock of US-India relationship” as the two are the oldest and largest democracies in the world. “And we reaffirmed our strategic partnership over several past administrations,” she said. “And we built a strong network of Indo-Pacific alliances and partnerships as well and they are all based on the international rules-based order,” she said.“We have a shared interest where major defence partners concluded four major defense-enabling agreements in recent years,” she added.Commenting on China, she said: “Regarding the PRC [People’s Republic of China], we’ve been clear. We’re ready to compete and compete vigorously, but we want a level playing field and you heard U.S. trade representative Tie [Katherine Tai] talked about this.Tai on October 4 said the US will take “all steps necessary” to protect it against the “waves of damage inflicted over the years through unfair competition”. The USTR remarked at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), outlining the Biden-Harris Administration’s new approach to the US-China bilateral trade relationship.“China’s lack of adherence to global trading norms has undercut the prosperity of Americans and others around the world,” Tai said adding that the US will continue to “work with allies” to shape the rules for fair trade in the 21st century, and facilitate a race to the top for market economies and democracies.Sherman on Thursday spoke on similar line. “We’ll compete vigorously with China, where we should... I think, we and India are like minded in that regard. We don’t ask countries to choose between the United States and the PRC, but we do ask for a level playing field,” she said.Speaking at the event, secretary Shringla said, “India considers its relations with the United States to be of paramount importance” not only for the respective nations but to ensure a “free, open, inclusive, and prosperous” Indo-Pacific.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-us-ready-to-compete-with-china-us-diplomat-101633562951897.html

Three accounts were being operated from Islamabad and one from Rawalpindi, said CID additional director general Sanjeeb Panda.The officer said investigators had been able to trace back the accounts to Pakistan, adding that she used proxy IPs (Internet Protocol) of the US, India and Germany. Some of the accounts are currently active and she is still chatting with some people, he added.The suspected Pakistani agent had 7 Facebook accounts under different names and was in contact with the five accused . She even had proposed to two accused. The woman had been using a UK phone number and chatted with the accused to get "valuable information" on missiles test-fired at DRDO’s testing range facility in Chandipur area of Balasore district.Last month, five people, Basanta Behera, Hemanta Kumar Mistry, Tapas Ranjan Nayak, SK Musafir and Sachin Kumar, were arrested by police in Balasore district. Panda said investigation is underway to get details of the UK phone number and the bank account in Dubai, from where one of the accused received a cash transfer of around ₹38,000. He said efforts are underway to know if the accused received more money from any other source.The CID has sought technical data from the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team under the Union ministry of electronics and information technology.The CID is yet to identify the woman but has found her videos and photographs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cops-trace-4-facebook-accounts-of-woman-handler-in-drdo-espionage-case-to-pak-101633551869026.html
07-10-2021||India||SC directs high courts to provide data on convicts eligible for early release||The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed all high courts in the country to segregate criminal appeals filed by life convicts and other convicts along with the period of their incarceration to enable a uniform approach on early release of prisoners found languishing in jail without bail or remission for a sustained period.The order came on a suggestion of three lawyers assisting the top court as amicus curiae who examined the position in high courts of Delhi and Chhattisgarh where such an exercise was successfully conducted by the respective legal service committees.The three lawyers, Gaurav Agrawal, Devansh Mohta and Liz Mathew, carried out the study on pending jail petitions, criminal appeals in high courts and remission pleas for premature release under consideration with state governments.In Delhi High Court, 232 appeals were pending where the prison sentence ranged from three to 20 years. Another 129 appeals from convicts serving life sentences were pending. In Chhattisgarh high court, the pendency was divided into two categories – 1,162 appeals where the sentence is up to 10 years and 2,878 appeals where the sentence is above 10 years.Impressed by the work done by the two high courts, the bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh ordered a similar exercise to be undertaken by the legal service committees of all high courts. It further directed the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) to circulate this order and monitor the exercise in each high court.As for Delhi and Chhattisgarh, the court asked the respective legal service committees to identify appeals where the prisoner has undergone more than half the period of actual punishment and above eight years in case of prisoners serving a life term.The court also directed the legal service committees to explore if convicts who have undergone a substantial amount of their sentence are agreeable to withdraw their appeal from the high court and get released. This, however, will be voluntary and will not affect the prisoner’s right to file an appeal, the bench clarified.A similar exercise could be undertaken for life convicts seeking premature release or remission after crossing the threshold sentence required for consideration under the respective state policies.Agrawal pointed out that a similar exercise had also been undertaken for 300 jail petitions pending in the Supreme Court. Since no cooperation was forthcoming from SC Legal Services Committee, the court directed the court registry to find out the status of convicts who filed jail petitions – whether they are still in custody or released on bail. The bench further directed NALSA to examine cases where convicts are eligible for premature release or bail in cases where a substantial period of the sentence was over.About remission cases, advocate Liz Mathew said the NALSA scheme for time-bound disposal of remission requests was rolled out in three states, Chhattisgarh, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, by July 7 order. While Chhattisgarh assured that the remission received till August 1 will be decided before February 2022, no information was forthcoming from UP. The Bihar government filed a late response that could not be considered by the court.The bench directed UP to provide details of pending remission pleas within a month or else said it will summon the state chief secretary in the matter. The court posted the matter for further hearing in February next year.The court orders came on a petition filed by one Sonadhar who had undergone 14 years imprisonment but had to wait for three years for his remission to get decided. The court directed NALSA to study the pendency position across the country in the context of remission applicants and discovered over 1,649 prisoners were languishing in prison awaiting an order on their remission petition for premature release.NALSA informed the court that the delay was due to the absence of a deadline to decide the remission pleas. The court directed NALSA to consider a timeframe and on July 7 implemented it initially in three states as a pilot project. This required states to identify and collect data about eligible prisoners within three months, recommendation by Sentence Review Board within next three months and two months for the state government to issue final orders.From November this year, the court directed NALSA to roll out the scheme in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-directs-high-courts-to-provide-data-on-convicts-eligible-for-early-release-101633550415072.html
07-10-2021||India||Good Samaritans to be rewarded for taking road accident victims to hospital||The Union government has launched a scheme for ‘Good Samaritan’ under which anyone who saves the life of a road accident victim by rushing them to a hospital within the “golden hour” will get a cash reward of ₹5,000, the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) said in a statement on Wednesday, adding the scheme will be implemented from October 15.According to the guidelines issued by the ministry, each Good Samaritan would also receive a certificate of appreciation besides ₹5,000 in cash for saving a road accident victim. An individual could be awarded a maximum of five times in a year, the guidelines added.The ministry also said there will be 10 national-level awards each year for the worthiest Good Samaritans, who would be selected from all those who have been awarded during the whole year and they would be given an award of ₹1 lakh each.The guidelines further stated that if more than one Good Samaritan saves the life of more than one victim, the amount of award would be ₹5,000 per victim saved, subject to maximum ₹5,000 per Good Samaritan.To start the scheme, the Centre would provide ₹5 lakh as an initial grant to the transport department of all states and Union territories for rewarding the Good Samaritans.The term ‘golden hour’ generally refers to the one-hour time period following a traumatic injury. It is during this time period that the likelihood of preventing death by providing prompt medical care to the victim is the highest.Piyush Tewari, founder and CEO, SaveLIFE foundation, said the scheme would help in creating role models and encourage more people to come forward and help road accident victims. “We appreciate the latest scheme launched by the Government of India to recognise and reward Good Samaritans. It will certainly create role models and encourage more people to come forward to help the injured.”“However, as the original petitioners in the Supreme Court judgment that initiated the Good Samaritan Law in India, we urge the government to also implement Section 134 of the Motor Vehicle Amendment Act 2019 to insulate Good Samaritans from police questioning, detention and mistreatment at hospitals and prolonged court procedures. While the government has released rules in this regard, the implementation at the state level has been found to be lacking,” Tewari added.The latest guidelines state that in case the Good Samaritan informs the police about the accident, the latter would provide an acknowledgement to the person after verifying details from a doctor on an official letter head. The copy of the acknowledgement would then be sent to the appraisal committee formed at the district level under the chairmanship of the district magistrate by the concerned police station. Besides, a copy would be marked to the Good Samaritan.If the Good Samaritan takes the road accident victim to the hospital directly, the hospital will provide all the details to the concerned police station. The police will then provide an acknowledgement to such Good Samaritan, the guidelines added.According to Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari, a total of 366,138 road accidents occurred in India during the 2020 calendar year, causing 131,714 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/good-samaritans-to-be-rewarded-for-taking-road-accident-victims-to-hospital-within-golden-hour-101633550217942.html
07-10-2021||India||Police begins probe||LUCKNOW Lakhimpur Kheri police on Wednesday began its probe into Sunday’s incident in which four farmers were allegedly mowed down by a vehicle belonging to Union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni while four others were killed in violent clashes, during a protest against the contentious agricultural laws, officials familiar with the developments said. The development came as a fresh video showing the vehicle ploughing into a group of protesters surfaced later in the day. The latest 46-second video, which provides a clearer picture of the incident than the previous one, shows a huge crowd yelling and shouting as the vehicle rams into them. The identities of those in the video could not be ascertained. HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the clip. A seven-member investigation team led by assistant superintendent of police (ASP) Arun Kumar Singh visited the spot at Banbirpur village under Tikonia police station limit and interrogated some villagers. No arrests were made so far, a senior police official said on condition of anonymity. The official added that the panel examined the spot and collected evidence related to the incident. The committee comprises two deputy superintendent of police, three inspectors and a sub-inspector. Eight people, including four farmers and a local journalist Raman Kashyap, died on Sunday in violence that broke out after at least one car from a convoy of three hit protesting farmers, prompting an angry crowd to burn two vehicles and widen their agitation. Farmers maintain Teni’s son, Ashish Mishra, was in the lead car that ran over people. On Monday, the Uttar Pradesh police booked Teni, his son and others on murder and other charges based on the complaint lodged by farmers. The video contests the minister’s claims that their vehicle was under attack as protesters pelted stones, due to which the driver lost balance and the vehicle turned turtle, leading to the accident. Additional director general of police, law and order, Prashant Kumar said: “All the videos and photographs of the Lakhimpur Kheri incident surfacing up will be authenticated and included in the investigation.” The district police also issued a helpline -- 9454403800 -- and urged villagers to share videos, photographs and information related to the incident. The identity of those sharing information will be kept secret, the official cited above said, adding that leads could also be shared via mail on spkhi-up@nic.in. The official further appealed to villagers to not exchange any unverified information. “In fact, they could share such videos with the police,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-begins-probe-101633548296929.html

07-10-2021||India||Govt charts rehabilitation plan for residents in flood-hit areas||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Wednesday said that the government is working on a rehabilitation programme for those living in flood-affected areas in the city. Talking to reporters in Bengaluru, Bommai also said that a task force has been set up to fix the potholes in the city as well. “There are at least two to three issues when it rains in Bengaluru. Low-lying areas get flooded, areas around lakes get marooned and stormwater drains overflow. Instead of acting when flooding takes place, we have asked the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) commissioner to find a permanent solution and to carry out rehabilitation works in these areas,” he said. Elaborating on the rehabilitation plans, the chief minister said that a survey will be conducted to identify vulnerable areas and alternate land for those who will be rehabilitated. BBMP commissioner Gaurav Gupta on Wednesday said that the civic agencies had identified 539 sensitive areas in the city last year and the numbers have been reduced to 185. Stating that low-lying areas are a concern he said, “There are nearly 750 major stormwater drains in the city. We have built retaining walls in about half of these SWDs. The wall prevents overflow of water during heavy rains and is a permanent solution to control any damages,” he said. He further added that 63 control rooms at the sub-division level have been set up to address rain and flood-related damage and will be operational till October-end. Gupta also said that a disaster management plan has been prepared. A survey has also been taken up to access the extent of rain damage and what needs to be done, he added. Bengaluru city on Sunday recorded the highest rainfall in October since 1997, as the withdrawing monsoon triggered a heavy downpour and thunderstorms that flooded several neighbourhoods. BS Nagaraj Dhanya, former secretary of the Bangalore Hotel Association and Karnataka Hotel Association, was killed in the downpour in the wee hours of Monday. Power cuts and waterlogging at several low-lying areas of the city was also reported. According to BBMP, 31 water logging complaints and instances of trees falling were reported in the city. Bommai on Wednesday said that a task force has been created to fill the potholes on the roads. “They will look into the condition and repair history of all roads in Bengaluru and report. This will be the first part. The refilling of potholes and other repairs will take place at the same time. We have asked BBMP to finish these works in a scientific manner. We will finish the work of filling all potholes as soon as the rains are over,” the CM said. When questioned why the work won’t be finished before monsoons are over, Bommai said that the priority was to have a permanent solution to the pothole problem. “From our experience so far, we know areas where there are (pothole) problems. So, we want to fix them properly,” he said. Karnataka revenue minister on October 1 had said that that all roads in Bengaluru will be pothole-free in 30 days, setting another deadline, after many missed ones, to provide one of the most basic amenities to the residents. R Ashok, Karnataka’s minister for revenue and interim in-charge of Bengaluru city, said an additional ₹1,000 crore has been released for the purpose of fixing roads in the newly added localities of Bengaluru, where damaged roads have added to the nightmarish experience of residents, especially during monsoons. The chief minister had even revealed in the upper house of the state legislature in the recently concluded monsoon session that the state government had spent ₹20,060 crore on various road works in Bengaluru in the last five years. Bommai, who holds the Bengaluru portfolio, said that there were only 1,344 kms of roads out of the over 11,200 kms of roads that were motrable in the city, admitting to the one of the biggest infrastructural challenges gnawing at India’s IT capital for perpetuity. Successive governments have often fallen back on the same excuse of “developing city” as a way to circumvent taking responsibility for its apathy on providing motorable roads without potholes, slush, dust and no life-threatening stretches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-charts-rehabilitation-plan-for-residents-in-flood-hit-areas-101633547937507.html
07-10-2021||India||Haridwar sees major influx of pilgrims on Pitra Amavasya||There was a major influx of devotees at the ghats of the Ganga on the occasion of Pitra Amawasya, the concluding day of the two-week Shraddh Paksha, dedicated to offering of special prayers to ancestors. At the sanctum sanctorum of Brahamkund, Har-Ki-Pauri, devotees were seen going towards the Ganga ghat for a sacred dip in the holy river from the wee hours of the morning. The pilgrims also performed a number of rituals and prayed to their forefathers.Heavy vehicular traffic has been prohibited from Tuesday midnight till Wednesday midnight in the wake of the expected turnout of devotees by the local police and district administration. According to Senior Superintendent of Police, Yogendra Singh Rawat, deployment of traffic and police personnel was done at the core Mela zone of Har-Ki-Pauri, National Highway 58, 72, Ganga ghats and vital intersections leading towards Har-Ki-Pauri. “Post Covid-19 induced lockdown in March 2020, barring Mahakumbh fair Shahi festive baths; a major turnout of devotees was witnessed.  Local priests performed the rites from morning till evening and the Char Dham pilgrims’ free entry directive has also led to a substantial increase in footfall,” said Ganga Sabha president Pradeep Jha. At revered Shri Narayani Shila, considered among only three places to offer rituals to deceased along with Brahamkapal in Badrinath and Gaya in Bihar, devotees from Kumaon, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and other states arrived in  large numbers. In the wake of Covid-19 guidelines, the annual fair held at Narayani Shila premises in Devpura was cancelled for the second successive year. Police also carried out drives to clear encroached spaces and unauthorised vehicular parking on stretches leading to Har-Ki-Pauri Ganga ghats. Tow-away vehicles were also pressed into service to clear parked vehicles obstructing vehicular and on-foot pilgrim movement. Haridwar Hotel Association president, Ashutosh Sharma said, that traders, hoteliers and travel-tour operators are quite pleased as Char Dham pilgrimage has been opened for all and the Pitra Amawasya turnout indicates a good Navratri, Durga Puja, Deepawali festive season in the pilgrim city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haridwar-sees-major-influx-of-pilgrims-on-pitra-amavasya-101633547513795.html
07-10-2021||India||Tejasvi asks civic body to reconsider Durja Puja Covid guidelines||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member of Parliament Tejasvi Surya on Wednesday said that he has asked the city administration to reconsider their Covid guidelines on Durga Puja celebrations in Bengaluru after prominent right wing personalities questioned the restrictions on Hindu festivals. “I spoke to @BBMPCOMM & asked him to revisit the Durga Puja rules which are discriminatory, arbitrary & illogical. He assured me that these rules will be reviewed forthwith & sentiments of devotees will be given utmost importance. Let’s celebrate with all fervour!,” Surya said in a post on Twitter.The statements come after the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) issued guidelines to public on the celebrations. The BBMP and the Basavaraj Bommai-led state government have been trying to keep a lid on festivals as the threat of the third wave of Covid- 19 pandemic looms large over the state.“There is a general tendency in sections of the bureaucracy to think that it’s okay to put any and every kind of restrictions on Hindu festivals. This is a colonial relic. Post 2014, the awakened Hindu resists such attempts. This colonialism must end too,” Surya added.The BJP government has been under attack by it’s own legislators and partymen over what they call “targeting of Hindu festivals”.The BBMP, in its guidelines, has specified that the height of the idol cannot exceed 4 ft and a maximum of 50 people can participate during prayers.The civic body also said that the idol in public places must have the approval of the joint commissioners and that people should maintain Covid appropriate behaviour like wearing of masks and social distancing among other measures. The BBMP has also put a ban on orchestra, processions and the presence of any DJs. Several people even took to Twitter to criticize the BBMP on its guidelines.Bengaluru counts a large number of migrants from Bengal who celebrate the festival in a grand manner with pandals, food and music among other activities. The BBMP has said that the all organizers of pujas must mandatorily do sherman screening, keep sanitizer bottles and sanitize chairs, tables and floors at least four times a day. The BJP government had been at the receiving end of criticism over the Ganesha festival rules and even the demolition of the temple in Nanjangud of Mysuru district, attracting the ire of it’s own elected representatives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tejasvi-asks-civic-body-to-reconsider-durja-puja-covid-guidelines-101633547766077.html
07-10-2021||India||Protest will go on till accused held: Tikait||Lakhimpur KheriBharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait on Wednesday said his agitation against the killings of “five farmers” -- he included the deceased journalist among farmers-- in Lakhimpur Kheri has not ended, adding that the government has eight days to arrest the accused. “We will wait till the ‘ardas’ (prayers performed on the 10th day after the death of a person belonging to Sikh community) for the arrest of the accused and resignation of the minister (Union minister of state for home, Ajay Kumar Mishra),” Tikait said while addressing a press conference at a gurdwara in Lakhimpur Kheri on Wednesday. He warned that a nationwide agitation would be launched if the demands were not met by the deadline. The BKU spokesperson and the face of farmers’ protest against the three central farm laws, Tikait left Lakhimpur Kheri after an agreement was reached between the farmers and the Uttar Pradesh authorities on October 4. The farmers then allowed the postmortem of the four deceased farmers. However, he returned to Lakhimpur Kheri after relatives of one of the deceased farmers, 22-year-old Gurvinder Singh , refused to cremate him raising doubts over the postmortem report. On Tikait’s intervention, a second postmortem was conducted on Tuesday night by a team of experts from Lucknow. Singh was cremated on Wednesday in the presence of Tikait. Eight people, including four farmers, were killed in Lakhimpur Kheri district on Sunday, in the bloodiest clash since the farmers’ protest over the Centre’s three contentious agricultural laws started last year. The farmers were allegedly knocked down by a convoy of vehicles, one of which belonged to Mishra. Two BJP workers and a driver were allegedly pulled out of the vehicles and lynched by angry protesters. A journalist working for a private TV channel, Raman Kashyap, also died in the violence. The farmers allege that Mishra’s son was in the convoy. When asked if there were any differences over the agreement he mediated on October 4, Tikait said, “The agreement was reached after consultation with and consent from the aggrieved family members, local community members and the Samyukta Kisan Morcha officials.” Responding to a question regarding killings of two BJP workers and a driver, Tikait said they fell prey to mob fury. “When four-five persons were killed and 15 to 20 persons got injured (under the wheels), the furious mob expressed its anger,” he said. The farm leader also dismissed Union minister of state Ajay Kumar Mishra’s statement that he and his son were not present at the site of violence. “It is only the minister who is defending himself and no one else (is backing his claims). “ He also sought the minister’s resignation. Tikait also said that bullet shots were fired in Tikonia violence and that videos substantiating this are available. To be sure, no such video has as yet emerged. Commenting on the ongoing agitation against the three farm laws, the BKU leader said, “The agitation will continue till the repeal of three farm laws and enactment of law on minimum support price (MSP).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protest-will-go-on-till-accused-held-tikait-101633547764936.html
07-10-2021||India||Farm unions threaten to intensify protests in UP ahead of polls||Farm unions opposing the Union government’s three agricultural laws are set to launch a more forceful agitation against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Uttar Pradesh, where eight people , including four farmers, were killed on Sunday, in an incident they blame on a Union minister and his son. Protesters in large numbers are moving to Lakhimpur Kheri, the site where a convoy of vehicles crushed farmers to death on October 2. A widely circulated video captured the incident in which a jeep ran over a group of protesting farmers from behind on a dusty rural road. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a platform of farm unions involved in yearlong demonstrations against the Modi government, has alleged the vehicles belonged to Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra and son Ashish Mishra. The minister and his son have denied involvement, but police have registered a case against Ashish Mishra. The farm unions held an emergency meeting soon after Sunday’s incident. Their agitation will target all BJP leaders in Uttar Pradesh, where polls are due next year, a farm leader said. “We will protest, gherao and show black flags to any BJP leader whenever and wherever they show up in public. But we will do it peacefully,” said Gurnam Singh Chaduni, a farm leader. The SKM has demanded the resignation of the Union minister and his son Ashish. “The Samyukt Kisan Morcha demands that Uttar Pradesh government should immediately impose cases with murder charges against all those involved from the side of Ajay Mishra Teni. The Union MoS should be dismissed immediately,” Chaduni said. Farmers insist that the son was present in the vehicle that ran over people. Several SKM leaders have left from different locations for Lakhimpur Kheri. The agitating farmers will target the BJP’s campaign for the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. “We will expose their lies and resist them. Farmers will not allow them to put up their posters and campaign material. We will gherao them,” said Ajay Singh, a leader of the Tehri Kisan Andolan, part of the protests.  SKM has written to President Ram Nath Kovind, demanding the dismissal of the Union minister as well as Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar for inciting violence against farmers. Khattar was caught on video asking farmers in favour of the farm laws to take up “sticks” and take on those opposing the laws. “The whole country is outraged by the incident of the brutal killing of farmers in broad daylight by mowing them down with vehicles in Lakhimpur Kheri (Uttar Pradesh) yesterday on 3rd October 2021,” the letter states. “Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Ajay Kumar Mishra ‘Teni’s’ son and his goon accomplices carried out this murderous attack in a brazen manner which shows a deep conspiracy of Uttar Pradesh and Central Governments. Ajay Mishra had already built a context to this attack by giving inflammatory and derogatory speeches against the farmers. It is no coincidence that on the same day, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar is publicly inciting his party workers to take up lathis and indulge in violence against farmers,” the letter further states. SKM leader Tajinder Virk was grievously injured in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, Chaduni said. The injured leader was admitted to Medanta Hospital in Gurugram and is reported to be out of danger now. The SKM has said that the Supreme Court questioning the farmers’ protests when the court was hearing several matters related to the farm laws would not affect its agitation since it is not a party to the case. “The observation of the honourable Supreme court was regarding a matter related to Kisan Mahapanchayat, which has no connection with the SKM. So, the observations of the court don’t have any relations to SKM,” said Yogendra Yadav, a key leader of the SKM. “The court said ‘first farmers come to court and then they protest on streets’. I would like to clarify we have never approached the court. For us, this is a matter between farmers and the government,” Yadav added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-unions-threaten-to-intensify-protests-in-up-ahead-of-polls-101633547577333.html
07-10-2021||India||Lakhimpur violence: Farmer’s kin cremate body after 2nd autopsy||The body of Gurvinder Singh, one of the four farmers killed in Lakhimpur Kheri violence, was cremated on Wednesday morning in Bahraich district of Uttar Pradesh following the completion of a second post-mortem examination as per the demand of the family, officials said.With this, the bodies of all the four farmers who died in the incident have been cremated, officials said.Rakesh Tikait, who reached Bahriach late on Tuesday evening after the Gurvinder’s family refused to cremate the body unless a second post-mortem was done, spent the night with the family and demanded the arrest of Ashish Mishra, the son of Union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar Mishra.Farmers have alleged the vehicles of convoy that crushed four famers on October 2 belonged to Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra and son Ashish Mishra. The minister and his son have denied involvement. However, the police have registered a case against Ashish Mishra but no arrests have been made so far.Families of Daljeet (42) and Gurvinder (22), both Bahraich residents killed in Lakhimpur violence, had initially declined to cremate the bodies on Monday night but Daljeet’s family relented on Tuesday following the district administration’s effort to convince them. Upon Gurvinder’s family’s insistence on a second post-mortem, alleging the first one tried to hide a bullet injury that they claimed caused his death, the administration agreed.The second post-mortem was done early on Wednesday morning with a panel of doctors from Lucknow observing the process. Besides, the panel of doctors from Lucknow, two local doctors designated by family members were also present. This second post-mortem examination happened at 4 am on Wednesday at the Bhariach medical college and the cremation was done at the family’s agriculture field in the Mohraniya village.Sukhdev Singh, the elder brother of Sukhvinder said: “We were satisfied with the second post-mortem in Bahraich on our demand (the first one was done in Lakhimpur Kheri).But our biggest demand is not fulfilled yet. The demand is the justice for Gurvinder. The culprits should be arrested and punished”.Sukhvinder Singh, the father of Gurvinder Singh said: “My son is not deceased. He is a ‘Shaheed’ (martyr) who was killed in Lakhimpur violence while he was fighting for a cause. He was peacefully participating in the movement when he was crushed to death. So don’t call him a victim, call him a martyr.”Sukhvinder said the government had fulfilled its first promise by providing a cheque of ₹45 lakh as compensation. “However, no money can compensate the loss but we have no option. Everyone has to depart when the time comes but the untimely and unexpected demise of my son hurts. I hope the government would fulfil the other promise of providing a government job to a family member”.Family members of two other deceased farmers, Lovepreet Singh and Nachhatar Singh, who had initially refused to perform the last rites alleging that the administration may tamper with the post-mortem reports after the cremation, too had cremated the bodies on Tuesday in Lakhimpur Kheri.While the cremations of the four farmers happened on Tuesday and Wednesday, the other four Shyam Sundar (BJP worker), Shubham Mishra (BJP worker) and Hariom Mishra (driver) were performed in their respective villages on Monday morning. And local journalist Raman Kashyap’s body was cremated on Monday afternoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-violence-farmer-s-kin-cremate-body-after-2nd-autopsy-101633547527792.html
07-10-2021||India||Centre set to allow girls in RMC, RIMC: SC told||The Union government has told the Supreme Court that girls will get inducted not only in the National Defence Academy (NDA), but also in the Rashtriya Indian Military College (RIMC) and the five Rashtriya Military Schools (RMS) in the country. Like the NDA, RIMC and RMS have also been traditionally all-boys establishments that act as feeder institutions for the armed forces. Submitting its affidavit on Wednesday, the Centre conveyed its agreement to induct girls in RIMC and RMS with effect from academic session 2022-23 after bringing about necessary infrastructural and logistical changes. For RIMC in Dehradun, the affidavit pointed out that those in the age group 11.5 to 13 years join the institution after clearing an All-India competitive exam, which is held bi-annually for 25 seats each. The government said it will start inducting 5 girls every six months starting January 2023 for which the girls will be allowed to take the entrance exam in June 2022. “It will be at 20% increase in strength every year. This increase can be affected with some infrastructure modification and additional staff to support the girl cadets,” said the affidavit, calling it the first phase of their plan. In the second phase, the government said, the capacity of RIMC will be increased to a total of 350, which will include 100 girls. “For this, it is submitted that girls will be allowed to take entrance examination six scheduled in June 2027 for entry into RIMC for the term starting in January 2028... this increase will need major infrastructure expansion and additional staff to support the increased strength,” said the affidavit. Apart from appropriate medical standards and training curriculum for the girl cadets, the government said, several other modifications and restructuring will have to be done to accommodate and facilitate the living of girls with respect to privacy, safety and security. The affidavit added that a board of officers is examining all the pertinent issues to ensure that a girl-friendly infrastructure and support staff is approved by the government and the work commences so that the girl feels welcome into the portals of RIMC. RIMC was inaugurated in March 1922 by Prince Edward VIII, the Prince of Wales. On RMS, which are located at Chail (Himachal Pradesh), Ajmer (Rajasthan), Belgaum (Karnataka), Bengaluru (Karnataka) and Dholpur (Rajasthan), the government pointed out that these schools add as a feeder institution for NDA and to provide quality education and training from Class 6 to 12 for the wards of the Indian soldiers. The admission test is conducted in December every year for approximately 350 seats. The government proposed to start by reserving 10% of total vacancies in each school for girl candidates for entry into class 6, in accordance with various reservations applicable in RMS, with effect from the academic session 2022-23. In the second phase, the government said it will reserve 10% of total vacancies in each school for the girl candidates for entry into class 6 and class 9 with effect from administration 2023-24. RMSs have been operating since the 1950s. A bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M M Sundresh will examine the government’s affidavit on Thursday. On September 22, the bench had asked the government to come clear on the issue of induction of girls in RIMC and RMS as it heard a petition by advocate Kailash Udhavrao More, who raised the issue of gender discrimination and bias in not allowing girl cadets in these premier institutions. More’s petition was heard along with the plea on entry of women in NDA, in which the bench had directed that women shall be allowed to sit for the upcoming NDA entrance exam on November 14 after rejecting the government’s request to delay the first-ever examination for them. While seeking the exemption for this year’s admission, the government had earlier said that women can sit for the NDA entrance exam in April-May next year and join the academy in January 2023. But the court was emphatic that there cannot be a request from the authorities to make the aspiring women skip the upcoming exam in November. “We will not put this train in reverse gear... we will not set the clock back. A beginning has to be made now. Having given some hope to women that they can take exams in November, we don’t want to belie that hope by saying they will have to wait for one more year and then something may happen. The exam cannot be postponed,” the bench had said. Under the current eligibility criteria, only male candidates who have cleared Class 12 level or its equivalent, and are in the age group of 16-and-a-half and 19 are eligible to apply. Those who clear the NDA exam are called for interview by the Service Selection Board (SSB), and following a medical exam, candidates are recruited in the army, navy, and air force wings of NDA, and for the INA course for pre-commission training. NDA was commissioned in 1955.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-set-to-allow-girls-in-rmc-rimcsctold-101633547397245.html
07-10-2021||India||Do away with requirement of data for quota in promotion: Centre to Supreme Court||The Union government on Wednesday urged the Supreme Court to do away with the requirement of collecting quantifiable data by the Centre and states to determine the representation of people belonging to Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) while implementing reservation in promotion.According to Attorney General KK Venugopal, there is a roster system in place in every cadre of the government departments to ascertain the posts required to be filled up by SCs/STs, and therefore the prerequisite of quantifiable data, as was laid down by two Constitution bench judgments of the apex court, should not remain.“It is a fact of life. In 75 years, we have not been able to bring the SCs/STs to the same level of merit. The time has come to hold that so far quantifiable data is concerned, it is not concrete and not down to earth,” the AG told a bench led by justice L Nageswara Rao.In 2006, a Constitution bench’s ruling in the M Nagaraj case made it incumbent upon the state to collect quantifiable data showing inadequacy of representation of a section of people in public employment in addition to maintaining overall administrative efficiency. The aspect of quantifiable data was endorsed by another Constitution bench by its 2018 ruling in the Jarnail Singh case which also mandated the exclusion of the “creamy layer” before providing for reservation in promotions.The top court on Tuesday called it “disturbing” that the Union government did not discontinue reservation in promotion for people belonging to SC/STs even after their numbers exceeded the upper ceiling of 15% and 7.5% respectively, of positions in some classes of central government jobs.Presenting the Centre’s views on a clutch of petitions raising various legal issues on the subject, Venugopal sought to convince the court that the roster system, based on the proportionate population of SCs/STs, has been working quite well in all government departments and that the condition of collecting quantifiable data on inadequacy of representation of SCs/STs may not be required at all.“The time has come for this court to give a concrete basis for SCs/STs to fill up posts. There is no need to verify any further or collect quantifiable data after the roster system. In a roster system, automatically posts can get filled up. I sincerely say that Your Lordships may consider whether this is not an appropriate method,” Venugopal told the bench, which also comprised justices Sanjiv Khanna and BR Gavai.About the aspect of overall administrative efficiency, the AG said that government employees are promoted only on the basis of their ACRs (annual confidential reports) and that there is no need to lay down any additional criteria.When asked what should be a time period for the government to revisit the reservation policy after ascertaining the percentage of posts occupied by SCs/STs, the AG said that a periodic review should happen after every 10 years when a census is done.Additional solicitor general (ASG) Balbir Singh, who also appeared for the central government, tried to answer the court’s queries on posts occupied by SCs/STs in excess of the upper ceiling.“Adequacy test is to be applied at a larger level. As a society we have to meet the requirement of Article 16 (1) instead of going into granular levels. Equal opportunities are to be created and upliftment of society are ways to look at it. Equal opportunities are to be created and upliftment of society are the ways to look at the reservation policy,” Singh told the bench.The ASG added that there are more than 15% and 7.5% representation of people belonging to the SCs/STs in Group C and D only because the reservation in policy has continued. “The picture will change drastically from the next year if we stop it now,” said Singh. He also supported the AG in saying that 10 years could be a right period to look at changes in a society and chart out the way forward.The bench will continue hearing the case on Thursday.The top court was hearing the batch of petitions arising out of judgments from 11 different high courts, which had delivered rulings on various pertinent reservation policies in the last 10 years. Some of the states from where these judgments arose included Maharashtra, Bihar, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Tripura, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab.The Union government has been pressing for reservation in promotion proportionate to the population of SCs and STs as per a 1995 judgment by the top court in the RK Sabharwal case, and wants it to be left open to the Centre and states to decide on promotional avenues for SCs and STs. It claims that the condition regarding collection of quantifiable data to show inadequacy of representation of SCs/STs is “vague”.On the other hand, representing general category candidates, senior advocates Rajeev Dhavan, Meenakshi Arora, Gopal Sankaranarayan and lawyer Kumar Parimal have contended that the reservation cannot be for an indefinite period and that it must stop as soon as the upper ceiling has been reached.Further, they have emphasised that reservation in promotion should be cadre-based only after quantifiable data is collected and the creamy layer has been excluded. Additionally, the general category candidates have said that posts meant for SCs/STs cannot be kept vacant indefinitely and should be filled up by other candidates after three years, as laid down in the M Nagaraj judgment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/do-away-with-requirement-of-data-for-quota-in-promotion-centre-to-supreme-court-101633547277136.html
07-10-2021||India||Russia’s S-400 dangerous, hopeful of resolving issues with India: US||A top American diplomat on Wednesday described the Russian-made S-400 air defence system as “dangerous” but said the US is hopeful of resolving problems with India on the issue through discussions. US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman told a small group of reporters after her meetings with foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval that a final decision on possible sanctions on the S-400 deal will be made by President Joe Biden and secretary of state Antony Blinken.“We’ve been quite public about any country that decides to use the S-400. We think that is dangerous and not in anybody’s security interest,” she said.“That said, we have a strong partnership with India. We want to be very thoughtful about the ways ahead, and discussions between our countries try to solve problems and I hope we will be able to in this instance as well,” Sherman added.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the US side raised the S-400 deal during the discussions on Wednesday and there was a feeling on both sides that there was a need for further talks on the issue to reach some sort of common ground. Russian ambassador Nikolay Kudashev had said last month that his country is expected to deliver the first batch of S-400 air defence systems under a $5.4-billion deal by October. There were no issues with the timeline for delivery of the systems, he had said. The Indian Air Force chief, Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhry, also told reporters on Tuesday that the first batch of S-400 systems is expected to arrive within this year.Sherman’s remarks about resolving differences over the S-400 deal reflected a softening of the US position.The previous Trump administration had threatened to slap sanctions on the deal under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).The US has already imposed secondary sanctions under CAATSA on China and Turkey for military deals with Russia.The Indian side has said it is determined to go ahead with the S-400 deal in view of its national security interests and plans to create an air defence shield for key cities such as New Delhi and Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/russias-s-400-dangerous-hopeful-of-resolving-issues-with-india-us-101633547217179.html
07-10-2021||India||Lakhimpur violence: Congress delegation meets families after visit furore||Lakhimpur Kheri When a Congress delegation led by Rahul Gandhi walked into Tikunia village on Wednesday evening, they found a region simmering with tension and anger over the deaths of eight people in violence three days ago.Throughout the day, farm groups protested against Union minister of state for home, Ajay Mishra Teni, who owned the car that allegedly mowed down four farmers on Sunday, and his son Ashish Mishra, who was booked for murder and criminal conspiracy. “It has been three days but the state government failed to arrest Ashish Mishra, who is the main accused in the killing of innocent farmers,” said Mandeep Singh, son of Nachhatar Singh, a 50-year-old farmer killed in Sunday’s violence.Minister Mishra and his son deny the charges and say they weren’t even at the spot on Sunday. They blame farmers for the violence and say protesters lynched two BJP workers and a driver. A local journalist also died in the violence.After heated altercations with Uttar Pradesh forces in the morning and afternoon, Rahul Gandhi and the Congress delegation reached the village.He was accompanied by Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who was in detention for trying to reach Lakhimpur Kheri, Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, his Chhattisgarh counterpart Bhupesh Baghel and party general secretaries KC Venugopal and Randeep Surjewala. Also in the delegation were senior leaders Deepender Hooda and Ajay Kumar ‘Lallu’.They met the families of the deceased farmers and the journalist, hugging the next of kin and expressing their support. “Shared grief with the family of Lovepreet. But until justice is not done, this satyagraha will continue,” tweeted Rahul Gandhi.Their first stop was home of deceased farmer Lovepreet Singh, 18, in Palia tehsil. From there, they left for the house of journalist Raman Kashyap, AGE, in Nighasan tehsil. Then, the delegation proceeded to the home of Nachatar Singh in Dhauraha tehsil. Palia is about 80 km from Lakhimpur town, and Nighasan is another 15-20 km and Dhauraha is a further 60-70 km from there. Lakhimpur Kheri is around 225 km from state capital Lucknow.Senior Congress leader Sachin Pilot was detained around Moradabad. “We have broken no law, we were merely going to meet the families of the farmer victims and the intention was to bring peace and calm in the area,” he said.The Bharatiya Janata Party condemned the Opposition. “Rahul Gandhi must have been very young when in independent India’s history mass killings of Sikhs took place with a Congress government at the helm. The same government sat through emergency. So, all this fake talk of showing solidarity with Sikh farmers won’t cut much ice,” BJP leader Sidharth Nath Singh said.The farmers had gathered on Sunday to protest UP deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya and laid siege to the helipad, leading to cancellation of the meeting. As farmers returned from the protest site, a speeding convoy of three ripped through the crowd around 2.30pm, protesters said. It had a Mahindra Thar in the lead, a Fortuner, and a smaller car, as mentioned in the case FIR registered by local police. In the village, internet services continued to be suspended after being briefly restored on Tuesday evening. “I still remember the loud noise of the engine of the SUV that hit me from behind,” said Shamsher Singh, 28, an injured farmer. He said he was injured by the car leading the convoy.“I jumped to one side, but my right leg came under the left front wheel of the vehicle. I lost consciousness after the incident,” he added.Dr CS Singh, chief medical superintendent of the hospital, said Shamsher Singh’s lower right leg was fractured at three places. “We have put a temporary plaster, but he may need surgery to correct the alignment of the broken bones,” said the doctor. The kin of some other injured people blamed the farmers for the violence. Shekhar Bharti was in one of the three cars but was attacked by the protesters, said his uncle Dinesh Bharti. “The miscreants among the farmers attacked Shekhar with sticks and swords, but he somehow managed to escape from the spot,” Dinesh Bharti said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-violence-congress-delegation-meets-families-after-visit-furore-101633547100929.html

07-10-2021||India||IS propaganda case: NIA files charge sheet against Madurai man||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday filed a charge sheet against Abdullah alias Saravana Kumar in the ISIS-Madurai Hizb-ut-Tahrir module case. The 31-year-old Madurai based man is accused of furthering ISIS ideology on social media, instigating people against India and establishing Khilafat. “He was also seeking cooperation from other countries to set up an army to establish an Islamic State in Tamil Nadu through Jihad,” the agency said in a statement. Originally, the local police of Madurai city’s Teppakulam police station had first booked Abdullah on April 10 this year for his controversial post in support of the war against India. The FIR had charged him under various sections including Section 121, 121 A (attempting to wage war against the Indian government), 153 A, B and 505 (1)(c) of the Indian Penal Code for trying to promote enmity between different religious groups, Sections 15 (Terrorist Act) and 16 (Punishment for Terrorist Act) of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. The NIA took over the case in May and the agency’s officials conducted searches in the house of the accused. NIA interrogated the accused and found that he is a “highly radicalised” member of the Hizb-ut-Tahrir, a fundamentalist organisation banned in many countries. “He had knowingly and willingly associated himself with ISIS recruiters with an intention to further propagate and support the activities of the ISIS,” the agency said. “Investigation by the NIA revealed that accused Abdullah was uploading posts on his Facebook account to instigate people to establish Khilafat and threaten the unity, security and sovereignty of India.”The charge sheet was filed in the NIA special court in Chennai for his “incendiary” posts on Facebook in support of ISIS. The NIA has been after social media posts linked to terror in Tamil Nadu. In May, the NIA conducted searches at four places in Madurai in connection with its probe relating to incriminating Facebook posts by a suspect - Mohammad Iqbal alias Senthil Kumar. According to the agency, he is also believed to be an extremist advocating the ideology of ISIS and Hizb-Ut- Tahrir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-propaganda-case-nia-files-charge-sheet-against-madurai-man-101633546978441.html
07-10-2021||India||Hyderabad police nab six connected to Telugu Academy fraud case||Hyderabad police on Wednesday arrested six more persons, including kingpin Chanduri Venkata Koti Sai Kumar, in the ₹64.5 crores Telugu Academy fixed deposit fraud case.Apart from Sai Kumar, a city-based realtor, the others arrested in connection with the scam are administrative officer and in-charge accounts officer Segoori Ramesh, Canara Bank’s Chanda Nagar branch manager M Sadhana and realtors Nanduri Venkata Ramana from Tanuku in West Godavari, Venkateshwar Rao from Sathupallu in Khammam district and Somashekar alias Raj Kumar from Dharmavaram in Anantapur, the police said.Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar told reporters that the accused had swindled, in all, ₹64.50 crore belonging to Telugu Academy, deposited in the form of 43 fixed deposits in various banks, including Karwan and Santosh Nagar branches of Union Bank of India and Chanda Nagar branch of Canara Bank.“We could recover only a few lakhs from the arrested persons, as they had already spent most of the money by clearing their debts, investing in the real estate and on luxuries,” the police commissioner said. The police commissioner also said Sai Kumar, the mastermind in the racket, is a known offender, previously involved in similar financial scams in Andhra Pradesh and Chennai, and was facing cases from the Crime Investigation Department of Andhra Pradesh and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Anjani Kumar said Sai Kumar got in touch with Telugu Academy’s accounts officer Ramesh. Whenever the Telugu Academy planned to do fixed deposits, Sai Kumar would send his agents – Venkat Ramana and Somasekhar to collect the cheques from Ramesh and deposited the amount in the UBI and Canara Bank in the form of FDs for different amounts and different time periods.Joint commissioner of police (detective department) Avinash Mohanty said the accused used to print duplicate FDs with the help of Shaik Mastanvali of UBI and Sadhana of Canara Bank, who would inform the accused about the FDR numbers.Subsequently, the accused withdrew the FDs from these banks prematurely and transferred them into the accounts of AP Mercantile Co-Operative Credit Society in Agrasen Co-Operative Urban Bank Limited, a private bank, using these fake FD receipts. “From there, they withdrew the money in cash and swindled the same,” the joint police commissioner said.The fake account of Telugu Academy in A P Merchantile Co-operative Society was created with the connivance of Satyanarayana using fake ID proofs. In the opening of the account, Somashekar posed himself as Director of Telugu Academy.He said that the credit society got a commission of nearly ₹6 crore for parking the Academy’s money, and a majority of the share was taken by Sai Kumar, Ramesh and others.“We are suspecting the role of nine others in the entire racket. Further investigation is on,” the police commissioner said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabad-police-nab-six-connected-to-telugu-academy-fraud-case-101633546977037.html
07-10-2021||India||Tamil Nadu rural body polls record 74.37% voting in 1st phase||The first phase of the rural local body polls in Tamil Nadu’s nine newly carved districts progressed peacefully on Wednesday, barring a few stray incidents. The polls are being held to elect 78 district councillors, 755 union councillors, 1,577 village panchayat presidents, and 12,252 panchayat ward members. Voting began at 7 am, and as of 6 pm, when polling closed, the voting percentage was 74.37% at the end of the day on Wednesday. The last one hour of voting was specifically reserved for Covid-19 patients, as was the case during assembly elections across five states held in April. The polls were held in the districts of--Kancheepuram, Chengalpattu, Vellore, Tirupathur, Ranipet, Villupuram, Kallakurichi, Tirunelveli and Tenkasi.As per the state election commission, there are 200,551 voters eligible to vote in the first phase, which includes 407 transgender votes. As many as 76,59,720 voters are eligible to vote across the two phases for 27,003 posts. The ruling DMK and the principal opposition, the AIADMK, are facing off in most seats while the Left parties who are part of the DMK-led alliance are contesting alone in several districts. The cracks are wider in the AIADMK alliance as PMK is contesting on its own in all nine districts while the BJP is contesting alone in the Kallakurichi district. The PMK, a Vanniyar-caste-based party, which has a stronghold in seven of the nine districts is likely to affect the AIADMK’s performance. “If these elections are free, fair and democratic, the AIADMK would see a huge win,” said AIADMK’s spokesperson and former minister, D Jayakumar. Tamil nationalist S Seeman’s Naam Tamizhar Katchi (NTK), which came third in the assembly elections, fielded candidates in the maximum number of seats. “The reports that we are receiving from the locals and district party officer bearers is that people are happy with DMK’s performance, so they are likely to vote for the ruling party,” said DMK Rajya Sabha MP and spokesperson TKS Elangovan.In Ranipet district, local cadres of the DMK and AIADMK got into a scuffle with the latter accusing the ruling party of flouting norms by campaigning near the polling booth but were dispersed by the police. There was also heavy security in the southern districts, such as in Tirunelveli, which is known to be communally sensitive. “Polling went on peacefully. We didn’t get any reports of violence,” state election commissioner V Palanikumar told reporters in Chennai on Wednesday. “All the 3,000-sensitive polling stations are being watched via videos and CCTVs have been installed as per the order of the Madras high court,” he added. Police said that there were no untoward incidents. “Since there was a law-and-order issue last month in Tirunelveli, we had one of the highest securities here with more than 2,400 police officers on the ground,” said N Manivannan, superintendent of police, Tirunelveli.The AIADMK had filed a petition seeking free and fair polls following which a bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P D Audikesavalu had directed the state government last week to use technology for electronic surveillance. As many as 3,409 booths across the nine districts have been identified as sensitive by collectors, police and the election body. The polling process was video graphed and live-streamed from 1,132 booths and 12,318 have CCTVs. The second phase will be held on October 9 and results will be announced on October 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-rural-body-polls-record-74-37-voting-in-1st-phase-101633546922292.html
07-10-2021||India||DMK members meet Kerala CM over NEET||A delegate of DMK officer-bearers led by TKS Elangovan on Wednesday met Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in Thiruvananthapuram to seek support in opposing the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for medical college admissions. The meeting comes days after Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin wrote a letter to his counterparts in 12 non-BJP states to press for the same. “His (Vijayan’s) idea is that Kerala is not affected by NEET, but I told him about how education must be the right of the state and that this is about the larger question of federalism,” Elangovan, DMK’s Rajya Sabha MP, said over the phone from Thiruvananthapuram. “The state builds the infrastructure. Tamil Nadu runs more than 25 medical colleges. The state trains its teachers and students, and the Union government is taking away the state’s power. That is dangerous,” he added. The DMK delegation handed over a copy of the letter written by Stalin on Monday and a copy of the report of the Justice A K Rajan Committee to Vijayan. The report states that NEET favours privileged students and discriminates against students from rural and poor backgrounds, and thereby it is against the principles of social justice. The report also listed several recommendations for the Tamil Nadu government, based on which the assembly passed a Bill to ban NEET in the state. This would require the President’s assent. “He (Vijayan) said that he would go through the report and come back to us,” said Elangovan. One of the DMK’s polls promises is to scrap NEET, and after forming the government in May, Stalin constituted the Rajan committee comprising nine members. The committee worked for a month to examine the impact of NEET, where it received more than 80,000 responses from stakeholders opposing the conduct of NEET. Three medical students in Tamil Nadu died by suicide just last month fearing NEET, held on September 12. The recent deaths took a toll since 2017 – when NEET was introduced in Tamil Nadu – to more than 14 students’ deaths. Tamil Nadu seeks to go back to the pre-2017 methods where only class 12-board exam marks were used as criteria for admission. On Monday, Stalin wrote to the chief ministers of Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Telangana, West Bengal, and Goa. “We need to put up a united effort to restore the primacy of state governments in administering the education sector, as envisaged in our Constitution. I look forward to your cooperation in this crucial issue,” Stalin said in the letter. In the coming days, more DMK leaders will be visiting various chief ministers addressed in the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dmkmembers-meet-kerala-cm-over-neet-101633546920344.html
07-10-2021||India||Kavitha paves way for differently abled candidates in Tamil Nadu||A decade after her nomination was rejected due to a hearing impairment, 42-year-old A Kavitha on Wednesday contested as a candidate from the same ward number 4 in Navamal Kapperi village, Villupuram in the Tamil Nadu local body polls. Kavitha is now among 40-other candidates who are contesting for the ward councillor post, more than a dozen of whom are women with disabilities. After her nomination in 2011 was rejected by the state election commission citing her disability under Section 33 (3) of the Tamil Nadu Panchayat Act, 1994, Kavitha’s case paved the way for the law to be amended. After several protests and a case in the Madras high court, the legislation was amended in 2012 to allow people with disabilities to contest elections in the state. Kavitha’s father, V R Thangarasu is also a candidate with a disability contesting from the adjacent ward number 3 in the village. He recalled what has been chronicled from 2011. Their family, along with several disability rights activists laid siege, at the office of the state election commission in Chennai. “Kavitha asked at that time how is it fair that I’m eligible to vote but I’m not eligible to contest,” said Thangarasu. “Why can’t a disabled person contest? That’s our basic question. A year before her nomination was rejected (in 2011), the DMK regime under M Karunanidhi coined the term maatru thirunali (in Tamil meaning differently-abled). So we filed a case in the Madras high court, which came in our favour. The following year, after AIADMK came to power under J Jayalalithaa, they followed the orders and all disabilities, except those with mental illness were allowed to contest in Tamil Nadu.” Thangarasu is a leper, due to which he is paralysed in his right arm and his vision is affected in one eye. “When I was five years old, they made me sit alone in school. I felt ashamed and stopped going to school after that,” he said. The bitter experience made Thangarasu send his daughter to a government-run hostel for people with disabilities where she studied up to class 10 but in three places – Cuddalore, Tambaram and Kancheepuram. She now has a diploma in tailoring. With two tailoring machines, Kavitha stitches clothes exclusively for women. “So the people in the ward are extremely familiar with her. Even during campaigning, they are able to communicate with her using their actions,” he said. “I wanted her to be independent and self-made like me.” Kavitha’s husband, who is an electrician, didn’t have a job during the Covid-19 lockdown. “So she was the sole breadwinner and paid fees in a private school for their two sons.”As an independent candidate, Kavitha’s symbol for the polls is a ‘key’. Communicating over the phone on behalf of his daughter, Thangarasu said that she feels it’s symbolic of breaking open obstructions. “I will be representing people with disabilities. It’s a boost for us. And it will show that we can also work for our communities and we don’t have to be isolated,” she said using sign language.The 43 people with disabilities, who belong to an NGO, December 3 Movement, are contesting as independent candidates. Their decision to contest in the local body elections and not in assembly or parliamentary elections is deliberate. “This is where true democracy is,” said the founder of the December 3 Movement, TMN Deepak. “A disabled person, who is also poor, can truly understand the issues on the ground.”Thangarasu, who is 71-years-old now, has been a coolie taking up odd painting jobs. “I was ridiculed and discriminated against because of my condition,” he said. “Having faced all that, I’ve grown to contest in an election in Tamil Nadu. I think she has a better chance of winning. I’m happy that I was even able to contest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kavitha-paves-way-for-differently-abled-candidates-in-tamil-nadu-101633546918373.html
07-10-2021||India||In sync with India on Afghan terror concerns: Wendy Sherman||The US will have India’s security concerns “front and centre” in its approach towards Afghanistan and the Taliban setup in Kabul will have to do more if it wants to gain legitimacy, US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman said on Wednesday. Briefing reporters after wide-ranging talks with foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and national security adviser Ajit Doval, Sherman said the US has adopted a three-pronged approach of competing, challenging and cooperating to deal with China. Sherman’s remarks on the US approach to Afghanistan came against the backdrop of comments by external affairs minister S Jaishankar last week that the American side had not kept India fully in the loop regarding the peace deal concluded with the Taliban last year.“We understand India’s concern about terrorism spilling over not only into India, but to the entire region [from Afghanistan]...Our partnership on counterterrorism with India is part of that strong press to make sure that India’s security is first and foremost in our minds,” she said. “We will always have India’s security front and centre in our considerations of how the US proceeds,” she added. The US and India, Sherman said, are “absolutely of one mind and one approach when it comes to Afghanistan”. President Joe Biden, secretary of state Antony Blinken and all US departments and agencies have put together a “very robust programme” of over the horizon efforts to deal with the counterterrorism challenges emanating from Afghanistan, she said. Cooperation in this area will also be part of the meeting of the India-US joint working group on counter-terrorism during October 26-28 and a homeland security dialogue. Sherman said India is part of a group of like-minded countries that currently have a weekly video teleconference for sharing ideas and perspectives on approaching the Taliban. She also said the Taliban has to do much more if it wants legitimacy from the world community. “We have laid out together, and strongly supported by the international community, exactly the kind of parameters that India has laid out – which is that the Taliban must create an inclusive government, that they must ensure that Afghanistan not be a safe haven for terrorists, that the Taliban allow the safe and orderly travel of people who wish to relocate, that they subscribe to human rights, including the rights of women, girls and minorities, that indeed there not be reprisals or revenge, that this be a functioning government that lives by universal values in the universal declaration of human rights and in the international rules-based order,” Sherman said. “We believe that the Taliban must act, not just speak words. We have not seen them follow through on some of the things they have said verbally. It appears that their minds change on a daily basis, and indeed we have to see actions,” she added.“I believe...none of us are in a rush for recognition, let alone even legitimacy. We have to see actions, not just words.”People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity said the Indian side raised its concerns regarding Pakistan’s role in Afghanistan and terrorism and found a “lot of meeting of minds”. The feeling on the Indian side is that the US is “very far away” from granting any sort of recognition to the Taliban.The Indian side also conveyed its concerns about the movement of terror groups. The US side was clear that there is no fresh hyphenation of the relations with India and Pakistan, the people said. Responding to a question on how the US will respond to the challenges related to China, Sherman said her country has a “very complex relationship” with China that falls into three pathways.“One, we know that China will be a major competitor with the US in economics and in emerging tech and in the future going forward. We are happy to compete with China as long as there is a level playing field,” she said. The US trade representative’s planned talks with China are aimed at taking care of market access, ensuring a level playing field and working according to the rules.“The irony in all of this is that China has grown and developed because of that international rules-based order and now they want to change it,” Sherman said. “Secondly, we will challenge China where we must. We want to make sure there is a free, open and inter-connected Indo-Pacific, as does India. That means the PRC doesn’t get to decide who gets to use those waterways and who doesn’t, what belongs to the international community and what they claim belongs to them,” she said.Sherman referred to violations of Taiwan’s air defence identification zone by Chinese warplanes in the last few days as a “very dangerous action”. “Third, we will look for areas where we can cooperate and certainly we have worked together on the JCPOA on Iran, on counter-narcotics...on counterterrorism, and we certainly need to work together on global health,” Sherman said, adding a robust nationally determined contribution (NDC) was required from China to address the climate crisis.The people cited above said the issue of China came up and both sides shared their perspectives and current status of ties with China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-sync-with-india-on-afghan-terror-concerns-us-deputy-secy-of-state-wendy-sherman-101633546856543.html
07-10-2021||India||PM Modi issues e-property cards to 171k Svamitva scheme beneficiaries in MP||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday distributed e-property cards to 171,000 beneficiaries of 3000 villages of Madhya Pradesh under the Svamitva Scheme, a central scheme that aims to provide property rights to the residents of rural areas.Addressing the beneficiaries virtually during an event at Harda, the PM said, “Svamitva (Survey of Villages Abadi and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas) scheme will strengthen villages economically and also make the people self-reliant. As a pilot project, the Swamitva scheme was launched initially in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab and Karnataka. Now it will be introduced across the nation.”The scheme was introduced by the central government in April 2020 to provide property rights to the residents of rural inhabited areas through GIS mapping. The administrations are using drone technology for mapping during survey of the property and land. The scheme will allow the villagers to use it for taking loans from the bank.The PM praised the working of the state government under chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. “MP is a wonder and the pride of the country. Madhya Pradesh has a speed and desire for development. Under the leadership of CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan, all the schemes are being implemented in a better way in the interest of the people of the state. Every time I see this I feel very happy. Madhya Pradesh has emerged as a leading state by doing commendable work in the field of land digitization,” the PM said.Prime Minister Modi said the soul of India resides in its villages. “The land rights will strengthen the villages. People have to face land dispute and many difficulties for land. People spend their savings to fight the case in the court case. Gandhiji had also expressed concern about this situation. It is our responsibility to make improvements in this area.”Thanking the prime minister for the scheme, Chouhan said, “ Before him (PM Modi), no one had noticed that the land in the village should be given ownership, there was no paper, so the land had no meaning. But today, when the ownership of that land is being received in the form of a letter of authority, we have now seen that land can be availed in many ways.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-issues-e-property-cards-to-171k-svamitva-scheme-beneficiaries-in-madhya-pradesh-101633546797093.html
07-10-2021||India||Supreme Court steps in, CJI to hear Lakhimpur case||The Supreme Court on Wednesday registered a public interest litigation on its own on the violence that killed eight people in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri district three days ago amid simmering tensions in the region and a visit by opposition leaders to the victims’ kin. A bench headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana and also comprising justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli will hear the case on Thursday. The suo motu (on its own motion) case has been registered as “In Re Violence in Lakhimpur Kheri (UP) leading to loss of life”. The matter has been registered as a criminal writ petition, pertaining to investigation and prosecution. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta is also expected to join the proceedings on Thursday. According to people familiar with the development, the suo motu cognisance has been taken on the basis of some letters written to the CJI and media reports. The developments came on a day Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, along with Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, his Punjab counterpart Charanjit Singh Channi, AICC general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal, party MP Deepender Hooda and Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) president Ajay Kumar Lallu, finally reached the remote village – roughly 10km from the India-Nepal border – after trying for three days.“Shared grief with the family of Lovepreet. But until justice is not done, this satyagraha will continue. Won’t forget your sacrifice, Lovepreet,” tweeted Rahul Gandhi. Lovepreet Singh was one of the farmers who died in Sunday’s violence.Local farmers blame junior home minister Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’ and his son Ashish Mishra for the violence that left four cultivators dead. Farm groups say a Mahindra Thar owned by Mishra mowed down protesters from behind while they were returning from a demonstration in Tikunia village on Sunday afternoon.The minister and his son deny the charge and say farmers pelted the car with stones that led the driver losing control of the vehicle. They also accuse the protesters of lynching two Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers and the car’s driver. A local journalist was also killed in the melee.Some unverified videos of the incident appear to back the farmers’ version of the incident and show the Thar knocking down protesters from behind. On Wednesday, a new, clearer 45-second video showed the Thar plough through the farmers at high speed, with two vehicles in tow. The identities of individuals wasn’t clear and HT couldn’t independently verify the clips.Ashish Mishra and 20 others have been booked for murder but farmers continue to press for his arrest. “We will wait till the ‘ardas’ (prayers performed on the 10th day after the death of a person belonging to Sikh community) for the arrest of the accused and resignation of the minister,” farm leader Rakesh Tikait said.The government gave ₹45 lakh as compensation for each family and announced a judicial probe. Channi and Baghel also announced ₹50 lakh compensation each to the victims’ families. Since violence rocked the region three days ago, tensions have run high as the government ringed the village with police, clamped prohibitory orders, snapped internet and denied landing permission to Baghel’s and Channi’s flights. It also detained Priyanka Gandhi in the early hours on Monday, sparking a political row.Wednesday began with high drama. The state government initially appeared reluctant to allow Congress leaders to visit Tikunia and denied permission to them to reach Lucknow. Finally, Gandhi and the others were given boarding passes in Delhi and touched down in Lucknow at 1.30pm – only to run into a wall of policemen“I want to move out of the airport. They are not allowing me to move out. What kind of permission is this?” said Rahul Gandhi, sitting on a dharna at the airport. On Tuesday, Baghel had also been denied permission to leave the terminal.Minutes later, a heated altercation broke out between Gandhis and the security personnel over the choice of vehicle. “We want to go in our car, but they (police) want to take us in their vehicle. I have asked them to go in my personal vehicle. They are planning something,” said Rahul Gandhi to reporters. Around 3pm, the Congress delegation left the airport towards Lakhimpur Kheri, roughly 150km away, driving past Congress workers who shouted anti-government slogans. At 6pm, the convoy reached the Sitapur guest house where Priyanka Gandhi had been detained for nearly 55 hours. She joined her brother before the convoy drove towards Tikunia, where they met the families of the deceased farmers. “Those who crushed farmers are roaming free. The BJP government is silencing the voices of justice for farmers. We will not allow the voice of justice to go suppressed,” said Priyanka Gandhi in a tweet on Wednesday. The BJP accused the Congress of opportunism. “Irresponsibility is another name of Rahul Gandhi, Congress and Rahul are trying to incite violence. He is trying to spread rumours,” BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra said. On Tuesday, advocates Shiv Kumar Tripathi and CS Panda wrote to the apex court, seeking punishment for politicians allegedly involved in the ghastly incident. “Having regard to the seriousness of the killing of the farmers at district Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh, it is incumbent upon this Hon’ble Court to intervene in the matter as flashed in the press,” it said.On Wednesday morning, senior Congress MP Kapil Sibal posted a tweet requesting the court to take suo motu cognisance of the events. After the Supreme Court website confirmed the development, Sibal posted another tweet thanking the CJI. “This is the need of the hour. This and courts in India are temples of justice that can restore the faith of the voiceless who most often feel orphaned,” he said.Two days ago, attorney general KK Venugopal cited the Lakhimpur Kheri violence while arguing that farmers should not be allowed to protest when the top court is already considering the three contentious farm laws and also stayed their operation. Contemplating restrictions on the right to protest, the court observed that “nobody takes responsibility” when damage to properties and physical injuries take place during protests in response to the A-G’s reference to Lakhimpur Kheri.In the village, local residents continued to protest against minister Mishra and his son. A first information report filed by a local farmer on Monday alleged that Ashish Mishra was in the car that mowed down protesters, and that he fired shots at the farmers, killing one. Ashish denied the charge.Post-mortem reports of the farmers killed showed that there were no bullet injuries on any of the bodies, and that all four died due to shock, excessive bleeding and haemorrhage. The findings, experts say, are consistent with deaths arising from injuries, such as those caused in an automobile accident. The post-mortem reports stoked a row in the village, but after a second autopsy was conducted on farmer Gurvinder Singh’s body, his family finally cremated him on Wednesday. With this, all eight victims of the violence were laid to rest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-steps-in-cji-to-hear-lakhimpur-case-101633546736427.html
07-10-2021||India||Pakistan court allows India more time to appoint lawyer to represent Kulbhushan Jadhav||Islamabad: A top court in Pakistan on Tuesday allowed India more time to appoint a lawyer to represent death-row prisoner Kulbhushan Jadhav in the court to hear a review of his conviction and sentencing by a military court.Jadhav, a 51-year-old retired Indian Navy officer, was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017. India approached the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence.After hearing both sides, the Hague-based ICJ issued a verdict in July, 2019, asking Pakistan to give India consular access to Jadhav and also ensure review of his conviction.On Tuesday, a three-judge bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), comprising Chief Justice Athar Minallah, Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, heard the case by the law ministry regarding designating a lawyer for Jadhav.Attorney General for Pakistan Khalid Javed Khan reminded the court that it had passed an order on May 5 asking the authorities to make one more effort to contact India for the appointment of a counsel.He informed the court that the message was conveyed to India but there has been no response so far.Khan also told the court that India wanted consular access to Jadhav in a separate room, but the authorities cannot take the risk of leaving him alone with Indian representatives. “They can cause harm to him even by just shaking hands with him,” he said.He claimed Pakistan was making efforts for a complete implementation on the decision of review and reconsideration of the ICJ, but India was creating hurdles.Khan said due to Indian intransigence, the government had requested the court for the appointment of a counsel. “India wants to appoint a counsel from outside but our law disallows this, and so does India’s in its own territory,” he said.Chief Justice Minallah said that Pakistan wanted to implement the ICJ decision. “Would it not be better to give them another opportunity so they could put forth their reservations before the court,” he observed.The judge asked Khan to convey the message to the Indian government and Jadhav. “Send another reminder to Kulbhushan and the Indian government. If India has any reservations, it may convey them here, or someone from the Indian embassy in Pakistan may convey them. That might bring forth a solution,” the judge said.Later, the court adjourned the hearing of the case for an indefinite period.No progress was made on the review issue as India refused to appoint a local lawyer while demanding Pakistan to let an Indian lawyer represent Jadhav in the court.India has asked Pakistan to address the “shortcomings” in a bill brought out to facilitate reviewing the case of Jadhav, saying the proposed law does not create a mechanism to reconsider it as mandated by the ICJ.India has said the Review and Reconsideration Bill 2020 does not create a mechanism to facilitate effective review and reconsideration of Jadhav’s case as mandated by the judgement of the ICJ and the municipal courts cannot be the arbiter of whether a state has fulfilled its obligations in international law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-court-allows-india-more-time-to-appoint-lawyer-to-represent-kulbhushan-jadhav-101633546676991.html
07-10-2021||India||Fireworks, celebrations can’t be at the cost of life, says Supreme Court||No celebration can be allowed at the cost of life of others, said the Supreme Court on Wednesday as it justified the ban on the manufacturing and sale of traditional firecrackers, and implored people to shift to noiseless festivities ahead of Diwali. “We are not averse to celebrations, but we cannot celebrate at the cost of life of others. Where do we get that a celebration must happen by bursting crackers, making noise and pollution? We can have celebrations without noise too,” said a bench of justices MR Shah and AS Bopanna. The bench added that there are now green crackers that do not make noise. “Celebrations can also be from fuljhadi (sparkler), etc. It does not need to be noisy crackers only,” it remarked, when senior lawyers appearing for the firecracker manufacturers talked about striking a balance between celebrations and the right to life of people. The court was considering a clutch of applications for the implementation of its October 23, 2018, judgment that took note of the deteriorating air pollution in major cities and prohibited the production of all traditional firecrackers, including the joined crackers, also known as series crackers or laaris, using barium or its salts. Instead, only green crackers and improved crackers with reduced emissions were allowed to be manufactured and sold.Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for his minor son Arjun Gopal, who is one of the petitioners in the case, also pressed for contempt action against some manufacturers, citing alleged violations of the 2018 order by them.On the other hand, certain firecracker manufacturers came before the bench seeking approval from the central government authorities on their improved crackers ahead of Diwali in November. Typically, levels of air pollutants shoot up on the evening of Diwali as people set off firecrackers that often have compounds such barium that create a toxic smoke when ignited. This lingers due to meteorological conditions typical for this time of the year: low winds. To add to it, for close to a decade now, the air in the National Capital Region is usually laden with PM2.5 pollutants from fire fires, resulting in conditions that expert say is hazardous to breathe in.A report submitted recently by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on the use of toxic chemicals in producing firecrackers informed the court that six manufactures had used banned chemical barium or its salt, following which the bench on September 28 issued show-cause notices to the manufacturers. Responding, most of these six manufacturers, including Hindustan Fireworks and Standard Fireworks, claimed that they had purchased barium and its salts but did not use it in manufacturing firecrackers. “What they say is very surprising. They say that they purchased such a huge quantity of barium only to keep it their godowns but not to manufacture. They would not purchase it only for a show...they cannot even keep it in godowns,” observed the bench. It reiterated that the court’s earlier orders on a crackdown on the use of barium and its salt in firecrackers must be complied with by every state, as it wondered how the authorities have not been able to stop the laaris that are still burst in almost all celebrations. Sankaranarayan submitted that the CBI report has put forth a very disturbing picture where manufacturers can be witnessed breaching the law with impunity. At this, the court said that it will hear the issue in detail on October 26 after all the parties go through what the manufacturers have said in their replies to the show-cause notices. States such as Delhi and Odisha have already announced a complete ban on the sale and use of firecrackers during the upcoming festive season. The Delhi government has also prohibited the storage of firecrackers. This pre-emptive ban was imposed given the city’s deteriorating air quality over the past three years, said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a series of tweets on September 15.While banning the use of firecrackers through its judgment in 2018, the top court had encouraged the community bursting of crackers within fixed timings: from 8pm to 10pm on Diwali and festival days, and for half-an-hour after midnight on Christmas and New Year’s Day. It had held that only green crackers and improved crackers with reduced emissions will be allowed to be manufactured and sold. Barium and its salts in the making of firecrackers were banned owing to poisonous gases causing respiratory problems. The Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization was further directed to review the chemical composition of the firecrackers and submit its report to the court to guide on the chemicals that could be used to produce green crackers.During the last hearing on September 28, the court had observed that it cannot let people suffer because of air and sound pollution caused by firecrackers and that its ban must be implemented by all the authorities in letter and spirit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fireworks-celebrations-can-t-be-at-the-cost-of-life-says-supreme-court-101633546498174.html
07-10-2021||India||Assam: An 80-year-old woman till struggling to be ‘Indian’, 5 decades later||Bhandari Das is 80 years old. The most crucial piece of paper in her file of documents is a Relief Eligibility Certificate issued to her by the Union government in 1967. Three years later, in 1970, Das was enrolled as a voter in the Cachar district of Assam. Her name duly appeared in the 2019 National Register of Citizens (NRC). But on Monday, a foreigners’ tribunal in Assam -- hearing a case registered against her by the Superintendent of Police(Border), Cachar in 2008 alleging that she was an illegal immigrant -- deemed Das a “streamlined foreigner”. This means that she will lose her right to vote for the next decade.Despite this development, Das is not perturbed given the law states her name will be restored to the rolls after the expiration of a 10-year period. “In 10 years, me and my family members will be declared permanent Indian citizens,” she said.The case is symptomatic of the often fraught and complicated process of proving identity in Assam. Das has lived, and been a voter in India for over 50 years, entering the country to flee persecution. After battling a case for three years and having her documents scrutinised, she has lost her right to vote for a decade. And yet, she is pleased with the decision, happy with the bare minimum that she has not been declared an illegal immigrant.Das was 13 when she married Rajendra Das in Sylhet, Bangladesh in 1961, and crossed the border into India six years later. “We were being attacked from various sides because of our religious beliefs. Many of our neighbours had already left for India, and one day my husband decided to as well. It was the toughest time of our lives. When the notice came from the court three years ago, all I thought was that I would have to go back to Bangladesh, which I definitely did not want to do,” she said.They travelled for an entire day, with very little food or water, reaching a refugee camp near Siliguri by midnight. For three years, that’s where Das and her husband lived. “Finally we managed to get some work in Bholanathpur village near Silchar town, and shifted there. My two children were born in that village,” she said.Das’s husband Rajendra died in 2009 after years of being ill, and she now lives with her son Rajkamal and his family; her daughter is married to a farmer from a nearby village and has four children.Rajkamal Das said that his mother has developed a hearing problem over the past few years that causes her much pain, but the hurt is the strongest when she talks of the time she crossed over. “I was born in 1971 at Bholanathpur and my younger sister was also born here. Before that our parents went through a pathetic life and they only survived because they supported each other. We are a family of farmers and our father taught us to be ready to face anything in life. When the case was filed against my mother, our father’s words were what we remembered,” he said.The caseIn 2008, a case was registered against Das in 2008 by the Superintendent of Police (Border) Cachar, Silchar alleging that she was a foreigner who arrived in India after 25th March, 1971 from Udhopuz village under Ajmeri police station in Sylhet district of Bangladesh. While Das was unable to submit any document of her citizenship at the time, police officials said that, in 2018, the Foreigners Tribunal Court III in Cachar issued a notice asking her to prove her identity by producing adequate documentation.Das, who appeared before the tribunal several times over the past three years, relied on two key documents. First, a certified copy of the 1970 voters list where her name appeared, and second, the Relief Eligibility Certificate issued by the Government of India to her in 1967. In the final order issued on October 4, the FT-III member (judge) B K Talukder termed her as a “Foreigner Of The Stream 01-01-1966 to 25/03/1971” and asked her to enrol her name as an emigrated Bangladeshi in the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO). The order says the her husband, who is now dead, and her children will be required to do the same, within 30 days.In the order, Talukder wrote, “I have gone through the written statement, evidence and documents submitted by the lawyer of Bhandari Das carefully. My considered opinion is that the opposite party is a foreigner of the Stream 01-01-1966 to 25/03/1971. The OP (Bhandari Das) is directed to register her name along with her husband and children before the Foreigners Regional Registration Office, Cachar, Silchar.”Clause 5 of Assam Accord says that “All persons who come to Assam prior to January 1, 1966, including those amongst them whose names appeared on the electoral rolls used in 1967 elections, shall be regularised as citizens. Foreigners who came to Assam between January 1, 1966 and March 24, 1971 shall be detected in accordance with the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946. Names of those detected foreigners will be deleted from the electoral rolls in force. Such persons will be required to register themselves before the Registration Officers of the respective districts in accordance with the provisions of the Registration of Foreigners Act and the Registration of Foreigners Rules, 1939. For this purpose, Government of India will undertake suitable strengthening of the government machinery. On the expiry of a period of 10 years following the date of detection, the names of all such persons which have been deleted from the electoral role shall be restored.”SP Cachar, Ramandeep Kaur, who also holds the post of SP (Border) said, that names declared as “foreigner of the Stream 01-01-1966 to 25/03/1971” by Foreigner Tribunal Courts are entered into the FRRO. Kaur said that there are six Foreigners Tribunal Courts in Cachar. “It is difficult to find records and say how many such cases we have dealt with so far,” Kaur said.The DebateDas’s lawyer Tanmay Purkayastha said that the judgment was drawn as per the provisions of the Assam Accord. “Bhandari Das has proven that she has been staying in India since 1967 and the court has agreed that the documents she submitted are authentic. Now, after staying in India for more than five decades, she has to register her name as a migrant. We are part of this system and cannot criticise it but in my personal opinion, these people deserve better treatment,” Puryakastha said.Das though, was enthused with the order, and said that she did not want to leave a “bad legacy” for her children. Talking to HT, she said, “My only fear was to die without proving my Indian citizenship. I don’t want to leave a bad legacy for my children. Now the court has said that if I wait for 10 years, my family members and I will be declared as permanent Indian citizens. At the age of 80, I am not sure I will live for another 10 years or not. But even if I die before that, my children I will live a respectful life as genuine Indian citizens.”Senior advocate Soumen Choudhary however called this “extended harassment”. “It takes years for a person to prove his identity before the court because in many cases the document they submit needs verification. Various government departments delay these verifications which keeps the person waiting for a long time. But after facing all these processes, the Court calls the person streamlined foreigners, which in my opinion, is a half citizenship,” he said.Social activist Kamal Chakraborty said that there were other cases as well where people were declared “streamlined foreigners”, and that activists in the area were now trying to raise awareness on the documents that they need before a tribunal. “I know a family who have land purchasing documents from 1964 but they did not submit this before court so the court declared them streamlined foreigners. Now they have to appeal again and it may take another episode to solve the issue,” Chakraborty said.Last year, 104-year-old Chandradhar Das died in Cachar district without being able to prove his identity after fighting for more than four years. His only wish was to die as Indian and had submitted a citizenship card issued in his name in 1964 in Tripura. The Tribunal Court sent this card for verification which never came back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-an-80-year-old-woman-till-struggling-to-be-indian-5-decades-later-101633546316467.html
07-10-2021||India||After National Defence Academy, Centre to allow girls to be inducted in RIMC, RMS||The Union government has told the Supreme Court that girls will get inducted not only in the National Defence Academy but also in the Rashtriya Indian Military College (RIMC) and the five Rashtriya Military Schools (RMS) in the country. Like the NDA, RIMC and RMS have also been traditionally all-boys establishments that act as feeder institutions for the armed forces. Submitting its affidavit on Wednesday, the Centre conveyed its agreement to induct girls in RIMC and RMS with effect from the academic session 2022-23 after bringing about necessary infrastructural and logistical changes. For RIMC in Dehradun, the affidavit pointed out that those in the age group 11.5 to 13 years join the institution after clearing an All-India competitive exam, which is held bi-annually for 25 seats each. The government said it will start inducting 5 girls every six months starting January 2023 for which the girls will be allowed to take the entrance exam in June 2022. “It will be a 20% increase in strength every year. This increase can be affected with some infrastructure modification and additional staff to support the girl cadets,” said the affidavit, calling it the first phase of their plan. In the second phase, the government said, the capacity of RIMC will be increased to a total of 350, which will include 100 girls. “For this, it is submitted that girls will be allowed to take the entrance examination scheduled in June 2027 for entry into RIMC for the term starting in January 2028... This increase will need major infrastructure expansion and additional staff to support the increased strength,” said the affidavit. Apart from appropriate medical standards and training curriculum for the girl cadets, the government said, several other modifications and restructuring will have to be done to accommodate and facilitate the living of girls with respect to privacy, safety and security. The affidavit added that a board of officers is examining all the pertinent issues to ensure that a girl-friendly infrastructure and support staff is approved by the government and the work commences so that girls feel welcome into the portals of RIMC. RIMC was inaugurated in March 1922 by Prince Edward VIII, the Prince of Wales. On RMS, which are located at Chail (Himachal Pradesh), Ajmer (Rajasthan), Belgaum (Karnataka), Bengaluru (Karnataka) and Dholpur (Rajasthan), the government pointed out that these schools act as a feeder institution for NDA and to provide quality education and training from Class 6 to 12 for the wards of Indian soldiers. The admission test is conducted in December every year for approximately 350 seats. The government proposed to start by reserving 10% of total vacancies in each school for girl candidates for entry into class 6, in accordance with various reservations applicable in RMS, with effect from academic session 2022-23. In the second phase, the government said it will reserve 10% of total vacancies in each school for the girl candidates for entry into class 6 and class 9 with effect from administration 2023-24. RMSs have been operating since 1950s. A bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M M Sundresh will examine the government’s affidavit on Thursday. On September 22, the bench had asked the government to come clear on the issue of induction of girls in RIMC and RMS as it heard a petition by advocate Kailsah Udhavrao More, who raised the issue of gender discrimination and bias in not allowing girl cadets in these premier institutions. More’s petition was heard along with the plea on entry of women in NDA, in which the bench had directed that women shall be allowed to sit for the upcoming NDA entrance exam on November 14 after rejecting the government’s request to delay the first-ever examination for them. While seeking the exemption for this year’s admission, the government had earlier said that women can sit for the NDA entrance exam in April-May next year and join the academy in January 2023. But the court was emphatic that there cannot be a request from the authorities to make the aspiring women skip the upcoming exam in November. “We will not put this train in reverse gear... we will not set the clock back. A beginning has to be made now. Having given some hope to women that they can take exams in November, we don’t want to belie that hope by saying they will have to wait for one more year and then something may happen. Exam cannot be postponed,” the bench had said. Under the current eligibility criteria, only male candidates who have cleared Class 12 level or its equivalent, and are in the age group of 16-and-a-half and 19 are eligible to apply. Those who clear the NDA exam are called for interview by the Service Selection Board (SSB), and following a medical exam, candidates are recruited in the army, navy, and air force wings of NDA, and for the INA course for pre-commission training. NDA was commissioned in 1955.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-national-defence-academy-centre-to-allow-girls-to-be-inducted-in-rimc-rms-101633546257100.html
07-10-2021||India||British diplomat sexually harassed in Chandigarh, case registered||A woman diplomat posted at the British Deputy High Commission in Chandigarh was allegedly sexually harassed on Wednesday morning while she was on her way to play tennis, police said. A case has been registered and efforts are on to trace the accused, they added. In her complaint with police, the 60-year-old diplomat, who assumed office in February this year, said the incident took place when she left her residence in Sector 9 around 6.30am to walk towards Chandigarh Lawn Tennis Association (CLTA), near DAV College in Sector 10. The envoy alleged that she had crossed Jan Marg and was at the roundabout near Hotel Mountview when the man arrived on his motorbike and harassed her. “I was walking past the residential houses when a motorcycle came up behind me. The rider hit me hard with his hand or something on my back. I shouted at him and ran after him but he sped away,” she told police. On reaching CLTA, she said she informed her coach about the incident. “We can confirm that an official complaint has been registered and a police investigation is underway. We are grateful for the assistance provided by Chandigarh Police,” a spokesperson at the commission said on condition of anonymity. On the basis of the diplomat’s complaint, a case under section 354 A (assault or use of criminal force on any woman or abet such act with the intention of disrobing) of Indian Penal Code was registered at Sector 3 police station. “A case has been registered. The teams are scanning CCTVs installed in the area. The accused would soon be arrested,” Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police, Chandigarh, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/british-diplomat-sexually-harassed-in-chandigarh-case-registered-101633546197439.html
07-10-2021||India||Facilitating oil, gas exploration, pvt plantations in govt plans||The Centre has released a consultation paper on amending the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, to bring significant changes to how forest land is managed in India, a move that will facilitate private plantations and the extraction of oil and natural gas from deep beneath forest land by drilling holes from outside the forest areas, although some experts are worried that the changes could actually accelerate trade in what is unquestionably India’s most precious commodity -- land. According to the ministry of environment, forest and climate change, the amendment recognises considerable changes in the ecological, social, and environmental regimes in the country in the last 40 years. State governments have been asked to send their comments within 15 days.Clarity on use of private forestsUntil December 1996, provisions of the Forest Conservation Act only applied to the forests notified under the Indian Forest Act, 1927, or any other local law, and to those managed by the forest department. But after the Supreme Court judgement dated December 12, 1996, in TN Godavarman Thirumulpad vs Union of India and Others case, all areas that conformed to the dictionary meaning of forest were ordered to be considered as forests too.“Identification of such land is subjective and arbitrary to some extent. This leads to ambiguity and has been observed to have resulted in a lot of resentment and resistance, particularly from private individuals and organisations. Considering any private area forest would restrict the right of an individuals to use their own land for any non-forestry activity,” the ministry has said in its consultation paper, which is available on its website. Even when diversion of such areas is allowed, the owner must provide an equivalent area of non-forest land and other compensatory levies . This ambiguity has led to the tendency to keep most of the private lands devoid of vegetation, the paper said, adding that it is extremely necessary to define the scope of application of the Forest Conservation Act objectively. Fulfilling India’s climate commitmentOne of India’s nationally determined contributions (NDC) under the Paris Agreement is to create a carbon sink of 2.5–3 billion tonnes through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. “We also want to reduce the flow from foreign exchange for import of wood and wood derivatives to the tune of approximately ₹45,000 crore. We had a thriving market for timber and wood products which has disappeared. It has to be revived now so that local people can benefit from their own plantations,” a senior environment ministry official said on condition of anonymity. The paper said that to achieve the NDC, extensive plantations in all possible available land outside government forests are necessary. “But to ensure this, there is a need to dispel the apprehension among tree growers that vegetation or tree plantation raised on their private/ non-forest lands will attract the provisions of the FC Act,” the paper states.Keeping some forests intactThe environment ministry is considering introducing a provision in the Act to keep certain pristine forests “showcasing rich ecological values” intact for a specific period.Go ahead for projectsThe paper asks whether the use of forest land for strategic and security projects of national importance should be exempt from the need to obtain prior approval from the central government. Doing this will allow states to permit diversion of forest land for strategic and security projects that are to be completed in a given time frame, but also lends itself to misuse. Oil and natural gas extractionThe paper proposes to facilitate new technologies such as extended reach drilling (ERD) for extraction of oil and natural gas found deep beneath the forest land by drilling holes from outside the forest areas. The paper suggests that this will not impact the soil or aquifer that supports the forest. “Ministry considers use of such technology is quite environment-friendly and as such should be kept outside the purview of FC Act,”the paper says.Building in private forestsTo ease the grievances of people whose lands fall in private forests or within the purview of the dictionary meaning of forest, the ministry has proposed allowing them the right to construct structures for bona fide purposes, including forest protection measures and residential units up to an area of 250 sq mtr (2,690 sq feet) as one-time relaxation.“With these amendments, the environment ministry looks to unlock land for infrastructure development and plantations, both of which are high on economic priorities,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at Centre for Policy Research. She said that the 1996 Supreme Court order banned the use of domestic timber for wood-based industries, including sawmills, which hugely increased raw material imports as a trade-off to conserve plantations and important forest areas. “So, the underlying presumption is that private land, once released from the requirement of prior forest clearances, will incentivise plantation-based carbon sinks. In reality, these lands will become market commodities and tradable assets both for private parties to sell, and government to acquire on behalf of private parties,” Kohli said. The researcher added that on the infrastructure side, the environment ministry has prioritised the requirement of government agencies such as the National Highways Authority of India and the railways. “It assumes that land once acquired by these agencies should be allowed for unencumbered use. However, this does not explicitly consider that these acquisitions themselves may be based on unresolved land rights or may have created new livelihood bases for people brought in to raise, maintain and sell the plantations on government land.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amending-forest-conservation-act-facilitating-oil-gas-exploration-pvt-plantations-in-govt-plans-101633546136319.html
07-10-2021||India||29 million students don’t have access to devices: Govt report||A report released by Union education ministry on Wednesday said that 29 million school students do not have access to digital devices as per data collected from 24 states and Union Territories (UTs) until June -- data that highlights the extent to which these students have been disadvantaged over the past year-and-half when almost all education has been online in the shadow of the Covid pandemic. It is only now that some states have reopened schools, and that too only for some classes. The data from the ministry is the first official statistic on the digital divide. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many children from poor families have suffered as a result, with some dropping out. According to the data, which is a part of a report titled ”Iinitiatives by school education sector in 2020-21 for continuing teaching and learning”, released on Wednesday, as many as 29.6 million students from 19 states and five UTs were found to be without digital devices during the surveys conducted by these states and UTs. The numbers could be higher. Seven states and UTs, including densely populated Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, have not submitted the data , the report stated.Of the 29 million, 14 million are from Bihar, with the number translating into 58% of total students in the state. This is followed by 3.2 million from Jharkhand, which is 43% of total student strength in the state; 3.1 million from Karnataka, 27% of the total strength of students in the state; 3.1 million from Assam, 44% ofstudents in the state; and 1.75 million from Tamil Nadu, which is 14.5% of total student strength in the state. In addition to the 24 states and UTs, fivestates and UTs have submitted their data in percentage terms. Among those are Delhi (4% of total student strength), Chhattisgarh (28.27% of total student strength), Madhya Pradesh (70% of total student strength), Jammu and Kashmir (70% of total student strength) and Punjab (42.85% of total student strength).The ministry has also collected data from Central government run Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) and Navodaya Vidyalayas on the number of students without access to digital devices during the year 2020-21. As per the data, 7.47% of total 2,58,254 students enrolled in 661 Navodaya schools do not have access to digital devices. The percentage is better in KVs where only 2% of students do not have access to digital devices. The report also highlighted the efforts taken by the Central government and the states/ UTs to reach out to students during the closure of schools, with messaging platform WhatsApp emerging the most used across states for sharing study material. For students without digital access, the states and UTs took several initiatives such as door to door visits by teachers to distribute study material, mohalla classes, and mobile schools. . As many as 4.62 million devices were distributed among students by several states and UTs, the report stated. The report also highlighted that after Centre’s intervention as many as 3,50,021 “out of school students” have been identified at elementary level and 1,04,650 at the secondary level across the states and UTs and will now be induced to the mainstream education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/29-million-students-don-t-have-access-to-devices-govt-report-101633545716753.html

The family of a journalist, who was also killed in the incident, would also receive compensation from the two states.“My state is predominantly an agricultural state. We can’t stay silent if farmers are killed in a planned way. The Congress can’t stay quiet. Rahul Gandhi has come here today. I also understand my duty,” said Charanjit Singh Channi, announcing ₹50 lakh compensation for victims’ families. Next, Baghel made the announcement. “As Channi sahib just announced the compensation, Rahul Gandhi told us that the whole country is the country of farmers and Chhattisgarh is called the rice bowl. Chhattisgarh is also the state of farmers, so we all have to stand in this misery.”KC Venugopal, who had also accompanied Gandhi and the chief ministers to Lucknow, said, “This is a clear symbol of Indian National Congress’ support to the farmers of the country.

The Ramaganga river flows through the tiger reserve and is the lifeline of the reserve. In 1954-55, the reserve was briefly named as Ramganga National Park.The decision to restore the name of the reserve was taken by Union minister of state for environment, forest and climate change (MOEFCC) Ashwini Kumar Choubey during his visit on October 3, the director said.“The minister, during his visit to the reserve, said that Ramganga National Park is a good name instead of Jim Corbett National Park... so he asked us to initiate the process to do the same. If the forest ministry instructs us to prepare a proposal of this sort, we will act accordingly,” the director said. “Earlier, the reserve’s name was Ramganga National Park… it was renamed as Corbett Tiger Reserve in 1955-56,” he added. Another official at the forest reserve also claimed that the minister had asked the director to begin work for renaming the park and mentioned the same in the visitor’s book kept in the museum in Dhangarhi. A senior official from the environment ministry, however, said that Choubey had made a mere suggestion and the idea was not a formal plan. “This is not a formal plan. It’s only something the minister had written as a visitor in the register,” the official who did not wish to be named said. Choubey visited the national park on Sunday to conclude the tiger safari organised as part of ‘Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’ and Wildlife Week celebrations. The Corbett reserve was established in 1936 as Hailey National Park after Malcolm Hailey, former governor of the then Uttar Pradesh province. After Independence, it was renamed as Ramganga National Park in 1954-55. In the following year, it was renamed as Corbett Tiger Reserve after hunter and writer Edward Jim Corbett.The reserve is spread over 520 km and rich in flora and fauna; it is known for tigers, leopards, elephants, deer, bear and several species of other wild animals, reptiles and birds. Around three lakh tourists visit the reserve and the park earns around ₹10 crore from tourism every year, Rahul said.AG Ansari, a Kumaon-based wildlife activist, said, “It will be injustice with Jim Corbett if the CTR is renamed. Corbett was a member of the committee which had played a major role in setting up Hailey national park. He was one of the few at that time who taught the world how to conserve forests and protect wildlife.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhands-corbett-tiger-reserve-likely-to-be-renamed-as-ramganga-national-park-says-park-director-101633545236943.html

It also indicated that authorities may need a couple of months more to conduct the exam which was earlier scheduled for November 12 and 13 as the whole process needs to be changed. A bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and BV Nagarathna disposed off a batch of pleas of 41 post-graduate doctors after additional solicitor general (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati said that the revised pattern, which was announced on August 31, won’t be incorporated in the exams this year. “Having regard to the interest of the body of students who would have commenced preparations for the ensuing NEET-SS examination before the change in the pattern was notified, a decision has been taken by the Union government in consultation with the National Medical Commission (NMC) and the National Board of Examinations (NBE) to give effect to the modified pattern only from the academic year 2022-2023,” Bhati said.“The Centre will try to hold the examination within two months. But the whole process is expected to take some more time as the entire process under the new system needs to be changed,” she added. Earlier, the Centre had told the court that it had decided to defer the exam to January 10 and 11, to give ample time to students to prepare under the new pattern. However, following its submissions today, it is yet to confirm the exam dates. The Centre’s submission came a day after it was pulled up by the top court for bringing last-minute changes to the exam pattern. In their petitions, the doctors complained that the examination was notified on July 23, but on August 31, the NBE, which conducts NEET-SS, announced a change in the exam pattern for NEET-SS for admission to over 4,200 seats for DM (Doctorate of Medicine), M.Ch (Master of Surgery) and DrNB (Doctorate of National Board). The doctors said they had prepared for the exam based on the older pattern used since 2018.Recording the submissions of the ASG, the bench said: “Since the Union government and expert bodies have taken a decision to hold the ensuing NEET-SS examinations for 2021-2022 on the basis of the pattern which held the field until academic year 2020-2021, it is not necessary for this court to adjudicate upon the validity of the modified pattern proposed for 2022-2023… In the circumstances, the petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution are disposed of.” After advocate Prashant Bhushan, who appeared for one of the petitioners, said that issues pertaining to the revised pattern should be kept open as the same would be implemented next year, the bench said: “That issue (with regard to modified examination pattern for 2022-23) is kept open.”In their pleas, the doctors pointed out that the existing exam pattern tested the candidate on their knowledge of the super specialty stream that they wished to pursue. The examination asked 60% questions from the super specialty of the candidate’s choice while the remaining 40% tested the candidate on a mix of broad specialty courses of which one was general medicine.Under the new pattern, 100% questions were to come from the broad specialty course of general medicine. The petitioners submitted that clinical practice was an important component for admission into super specialty courses. Due to this, many doctors practised in the super specialty stream to get admission into the course of their choice. Some even left their jobs and prepared for the examination for over a year.The Centre, however, argued that the change in pattern was being considered with a view to reduce wastage of seats in private and government medical colleges. Last year, 805 out of 4,286 seats remained vacant while in 2019, the vacant seats totalled 545, Bhati said.As the bench sought a break-up of the vacancies, Bhati said that out of 805 vacant super specialty seats reported in 2020, 561 were in private colleges.A total of 414 colleges offer the super specialty course of which 296 are private-owned and 118 are run by the government, she said, adding that the Centre will require two months to conduct the examination as the whole process has to be reworked.“The doctors’ fraternity stands vindicated because of the Supreme Court’s sensitivity to our cause. It is unfortunate that despite the services rendered by doctors in the last two years during Covid-19, the government did not make things easier for us. Now, we only hope and expect that the exams, which are already much behind schedule, are held at the earliest, to ensure that an academic year does not go to waste,” advocate Javedur Rehman, who appeared for all 41 doctors, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/neetss-to-follow-old-pattern-this-year-centre-tells-supreme-court-101633544936982.html
07-10-2021||India||NCP leader Nawab Malik calls NCB cruise raid ‘fake’; agency, BJP hit back||The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Wednesday termed the Narcotics Control Bureau’s (NCB) raid on a cruise ship off the Mumbai coast on October 2 as “fake”, alleging no narcotic drugs were found during it, even as it questioned the presence of two persons along with the NCB team during the raid, claiming one of them was a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Both the NCB and BJP denied the NCP charges as “baseless”.Maharashtra minorities affairs minister and NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik on Wednesday claimed that the two men, who escorted Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan and another accused Arbaaz Merchant to the NCB’s Mumbai office were private individuals and not officers, adding that the arrest was a conspiracy involving the NCB and the BJP to defame Maharashtra, the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government and the film industry.“One of them is Manish Bhanushali, who claims to be a BJP office-bearer and the other is KP Gosawi, who claims to be a private detective,” said Malik at a press conference in Mumbai. Photographs of Gosawi, posing with Khan, went viral a few days ago.The NCP leader also released a few videos, purportedly of the raid.In one of the videos, KP Gosawi can be seen bringing Aryan Khan to NCB office and in the second, Manish Bhanushali can be seen bringing Arbaaz Merchant to the NCB office, Malik alleged.“According to the Bhanushali’s Facebook profile, he is a BJP vice president and has photos with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, BJP chief JP Nadda and other senior leaders including those from Maharashtra such as Devendra Fadnavis and Ashish Shelar,” Malik told reporters at party headquarters at Ballard Pier in South Mumbai.“He (Manish Bhanushali) was in Delhi to meet some ministers at their official residences on September 21. Between September 22 and 28, he held many meetings at Mantralaya situated in Gandhinagar, Gujarat. The dates September 21 and 22 are very important as during the same period a massive drug haul was caught at Mundra port situated in Gujarat. He was meeting whom in Delhi? He met which (BJP) ministers in Gujarat? What was he doing in Mantralaya in Gujarat? All this needs to be answered,” Malik said.“BJP is using NCB to defame people who are against them and also using its leaders and workers in raids. What is Bhanushali’s connection with the massive drug haul caught in Gujarat...BJP in connivance with NCB is defaming Maharashtra, MVA government and the Film Industry,” he alleged.Meanwhile, Bhanushali told a TV channel that he was a BJP worker and that the NCB conducted the raid based on his tip. “I did not bring Arbaaz to the NCP office but was accompanying the NCB officers as I was asked by them to come and sign documents as a witness. The raid was conducted with the help of the information provided by me about the drug party,” Bhanushali told ABP Majha, a Marathi news channel.Rejecting the accusations, NCB deputy director general Gyaneshwar Singh said panchanamas (filings) during the raid and while arresting the accused were made as per legal provisions. He added there were nine independent witnesses and Manish Bhanushali and Kiran Gosawi were two of them.“The allegations made against the agency are baseless and if anyone has any reservation, he or she can approach the court and we will appropriately reply to them,” Singh said. Without mentioning that the NCB had recently arrested Nawab Malik’s son-in-law in a drug abuse case, Singh said allegations were perhaps levelled by persons affected by the action taken by the agency.Meanwhile, the BJP said the NCP should clarify whether they are opposing or supporting the action against the drug mafia.Devendra Fadnavis, leader of opposition in Maharashtra assembly, said, “Everybody knows about the reason for Nawab Malik’s anger against NCB and why he is targeting the agency. Instead of raising questions on the people present there, he should ask whether there were drugs in the party or not? Whether the party took place or not? I do not want to speak more on Malik as he is not that important.”Keshav Upadhye, Maharashtra BJP spokesperson, said, “First of all, the NCP should clarify whether they support or oppose action against the drug mafia. We suspect Nawab Malik has other intentions behind making the allegations rather than supporting actor Shah Rukh Khan.”“It is up to the NCB to decide if they want to take action over involving private people in the raid. We have no objection to it. By having pictures with senior BJP leaders, one cannot become a BJP leader,” Upadhye added.Congress’ Maharashtra general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said the state government should probe the allegations levelled by Malik. “The truth behind the raids should come to the fore. Why were private persons there with the NCP officers? How can a BJP vice president accompany NCB officers during the raids? What are the links between BJP and NCB? How can a person who is facing criminal cases be part of the team raiding a party? All these questions need to be answered,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncp-leader-nawab-malik-calls-ncb-cruise-raid-fake-agency-bjp-hit-back-101633544878187.html
07-10-2021||India||Covid-19 global update: The good, the bad and the ugly||Earlier this week, the global toll from the coronavirus pandemic crossed 5 million, according to a Reuters tally, with unvaccinated people dying in large numbers as they remain exposed to the more virulent Delta variant. Despite a recent drop in cases and deaths the world over, the World Health Organization (WHO) stressed on Tuesday that “we’re not out of the woods yet”, even if many people think the battle is nearly over. “We’re not out of the woods. We’re very much in the middle of this pandemic,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, the technical lead for WHO’s Covid-19 task force.Despite a slowdown in recent weeks, Covid-19 infections are still rising in 42 countries and an average of around 7,000 people have lost their lives to the pandemic across the world over in the past week, data shows. A look at what has worked in the world’s fight against the disease, and what still remains to be done.The good: Cases at a 4-month low, but daily deaths lowest in 11 monthsContinuing a declining global trend that started around the final week of August, new reported cases of Covid-19 have been steadily dropping. There were 2.98 million new Covid-19 cases reported across the world in the past week, an 8% fall from a week-ago when there were 3.23 million new infections across the globe. The seven-day average of new cases, which denotes the global Covid-19 case curve, currently stands at 426,304 – the lowest it has been since July 7, or in nearly four months, according to data compiled by Worldometers.info. This drop clearly marks what appears to be the end of the global Delta (B.1.617, first reported in India) wave that has been ravaging the world since early June.But it is the drop in deaths that has been far more significant. The seven-day average of daily deaths in the world currently stands at 6,943 – the lowest it has been since November 1, 2020, or in more than 11 months.The world appears to be getting even better at saving lives, especially when seen in light of the fact that most people currently succumbing to the disease have not been (or have chosen not to be) vaccinated. At its peak during the Delta wave, the seven-day average of daily deaths touched 10,262, against the peak of daily cases at 659,615 (both in the last week of August). The drop in deaths (as well as cases) can be attributed to the spread of vaccines – resulting in each subsequent wave getting less fatal.The bad: More than half the world yet to receive even a single shot of the vaccineNearly 6.4 billion doses of various Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in more than 200 countries across the world till Tuesday night, according to a tally maintained by Our World In Data. At the global level, this translates into only 46% of the world’s population having received at least one dose of the vaccine – 33.4% have been fully vaccinated, while 11.6% have been partly vaccinated. This means that 54% of the world is yet to be administered even a single dose of the vaccine.The global number, however, glosses over massive national variations. Countries such as Singapore (80% population vaccinated), Spain (81%), Chile (81%), Portugal (88%) and UAE (94%) are among the nations with the best overall coverage of their populations. Meanwhile, at the other end of the spectrum lie at least 20 nations (most of which are in Africa) that have not even given a single shot to 1% of their populations, data shows.India lies slightly above the global average with 47.8% of its overall population (not just adult population) having been covered with at least one dose. But with 18.1% of its total population fully vaccinated against Covid-19, it lies much behind the global average of 34.4%.The ugly: Rich nations are covering their populations far fasterOne of the clearest takeaways to have emerged from the global roll-out of the vaccination drive has been that there remains a world of a difference in equitable distribution of coverage. As things stand, this distribution appears to be largely defined by wealth. More than 10 months since first the shot of the Covid-19 vaccine was administered across the world, access to vaccines (and their administration) remains out of reach for the poorest nations of the world.The chart here denotes the relationship between the per capita GDP of nations and their vaccination coverage. The x-axis depicts per capita GDP (in US$); the higher a country is located here, the richer it is. The y-axis is the proportion of the country’s population fully vaccinated – countries on the right have the best coverage, while those on the left fare the worst.While most of Africa lies clumped together on the bottom left (the poorest and worst covered by vaccines), as we move up the x-axis to the richer nations of the world, they start moving to the right. The trend line drawn on the chart shows that the rate at which a nation’s wealth increases the chances of it having better vaccination coverage. Of the 20 countries with the lowest coverage of vaccines, 18 are in the lowest quartile of per capita GDP. All 20 of these nations have overall coverage under 1% and 17 of these are from Africa – Haiti, Turkmenistan and Yemen are the only non-African countries in the bottom 20. Another 20 countries don’t even show up on this chart as they haven’t even administered a single dose of the vaccine.This chart is all the more important now as some western countries have already started administering booster doses despite repeated requests by WHO for them to pass on giving booster doses until at least the end of the year. The US, Britain, France, Germany and Israel are among the countries that have begun administering boosters or have announced plans to do so. On Monday, the European Medicines Agency gave its endorsement to EU countries offering a third dose to adults.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-global-update-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-101633539775080.html
07-10-2021||India||Little-known terror groups claim responsibility for Kashmir civilian killings||Little-known groups have claimed responsibility for the killing of three civilians, in three separate incidents, in Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday, even as police are yet to ascertain the terror organisation behind the attacks. Three persons, including a Kashmiri Pandit and owner of a prominent pharmacy, were killed by terrorists within a span of two hours in the Union territory. The deceased were identified as Makhan Lal Bindroo (owner of the medical store), Virender Paswan (a street vendor) and Mohammad Shafi Lone (head of a local taxi stand). The Resistance Front, an outfit affiliated with Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), was the first to claim responsibility for the attacks. In a purported statement on Tuesday, TRF spokesperson Umar Wani said the trio were killed for working with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological fountainhead of the Bharatiya Janata Party, and intelligence agencies. HT could not verify the authenticity of the statement.Another terror group, United Liberation Front, also came forward to claim responsibility. Another less-known outfit, Freedom Seekers of Kashmir, saidin a press release circulated on social media that itwas behind the attack on Lone as he allegedly worked for security agencies. A Jammu and Kashmir Police spokesperson said a probe into the attack is underway. “The respective areas have been cordoned and a search in these areas is going on,” the spokesperson said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/littleknown-groups-claim-responsibility-for-kashmir-civilian-killings-101633509158398.html
07-10-2021||India||Kejriwal to Modi: Why no arrests over Lakhimpur Kheri violence so far?||Demanding the removal of Union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni from council of ministers, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi why no arrest had taken place yet in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri clashes which left eight people, including four farmers, dead earlier this week. Alleging that the “entire system” was trying to protect the accused, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convenor also sought to know “why is there so much hatred against the farmers” who have been protesting against the three contentious agricultural laws since November last year. “I am talking to you (Modi) on behalf of the people of India. Why have the accused, who ran over the farmers, still not arrested? Why are they being shielded from punishment? Everyone has watched on TV how the violence unfolded. It appears as if the entire system is engaged in saving those who are behind the incident despite them murdering people in broad daylight and in front of so many others. We have seen such things only in Hindi movies,” Kejriwal told reporters here. “For the last one year, farmers have been sitting on a dharna. More than 600 farmers have died so far. And then farmers are crushed and killed by mowing them down under wheels. Why is there so much hatred against the farmers?” he asked the Prime Minister.Eight people, including four farmers, were killed on Sunday, in the bloodiest clash since the farmers’ protest over the Centre’s agricultural laws started last year. The farmers were allegedly knocked down by a vehicle owned by Teni, prompting villagers to go on a rampage and set fire to vehicles, and allegedly kill four others. On Monday, the Uttar Pradesh Police booked Teni, his son Ashish Mishra and others on murder and other charges based on a complaint lodged by farmers in connection with the incident. No arrest has been made so far.The state government also moved to bar Opposition leaders from moving from Lucknow to Lakhimpur Kheri, by deploying police and issuing orders under section 144 of CrPC, which restricts the movement or assembly of four or more people.Taking a swipe at the Union MoS’s claims that his son was not present at the spot at the time of the incident, as alleged by the farmers, Kejriwal said: “Today, people of this system are saying the vehicle involved in the violence did not have the minister’s son in it. After a week, this system will say there was no car in the incident, and in another week after that, they will say there were no farmers at the spot. The truth is that we do not have justice here. Today, every citizen is demanding justice.”Attacking the state government for imposing curbs in the district, Kejriwal said: “Pradhan Mantri (Prime Minister) Ji, on the one hand, the government is celebrating ‘Azadi Ka Mahotsav (festival of freedom)’ and on the other hand, opposition leaders are being arrested on their way to Lakhimpur. What type of freedom is this? Britishers used to take such actions,” he said. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had attempted to visit the affected families but was detained on Monday and later arrested on Tuesday. Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel was also not allowed to leave Lucknow airport to visit the district on Monday.After initially denying permission to political parties to visit Lakhimpur Kheri, the state government has now allowed political leaders to visit the district, news agency PTI reported. Earlier on Wednesday, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi left for the district from Lucknow airport in his own vehicle after staging a brief ‘dharna’ on initially being asked to travel in a police vehicle. Urging Modi to visit the kin of the deceased, Kejriwal said: “Every citizen of this country is today demanding justice for the farmers. The decision is in your hands.”“The families of farmers, who died in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, are inconsolable. If they meet their Prime Minister, it will bring in some relief,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kejriwal-questions-centre-s-indifference-towards-lakhimpur-violence-101633507898237.html
07-10-2021||India||India link in whistleblower’s complaint against Facebook||Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg hit back Tuesday at claims that the social media giant fuels division, harms children and needs to be regulated, saying the claim the company puts profits over safety is “just not true.”His remarks a came hours after a Facebook whistleblower told US lawmakers Tuesday that the social media giant fuels division, harms children and urgently needs to be regulated, drawing pledges Congress would take up long-delayed action.The testimony by ex-employee Frances Haugen has fuelled one of Facebook’s most serious crises yet. Haugen testified on Capitol Hill after she leaked reams of internal research to authorities and The Wall Street Journal.The documents submitted by Haugen reference research and findings by Facebook’s own researchers. Among those, some related to India, referencing what they said were fear-mongering and dehumanising content promoted by Facebook accounts purportedly believed to be either run by or associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological fountainhead of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“RSS (Indian nationalist organization Rashtriya Swayamswvak Sangh) Users, Groups, and Pages promote fear-mongering, anti-Muslim narratives targeted pro-Hindu populations with V&I (violence and inciting) intent...,” says the complaint filed with the SEC. The BJP and the RSS did not respond to queries seeking comment. An “Adversarial Harmful Networks – India Case Study” cited in one of the documents quotes the author of the report as saying: “...and we have yet to put forth a nomination for designation of this group given political sensitivities”.The document also shows that the categorisation of India is in “Tier 0” alongside only the US and Brazil as what the company calls “Top 3 Political Priorities”. Only 0.2% of the reported hate speech is taken down by automated checks, according to the documents cited, which also flags a lack of language classifiers, which will be able to check for translations as well. The complaint says that Facebook’s internal records show how this problem of lack of Hindi and Bengali classifiers meant much of the reported content, particularly the anti-Muslim narrative, was never dealt with or flagged by the systems.Facebook has over 340 million users in India, which makes for a large demographic of its 2.89 billion monthly active users globally.Classifiers are automated systems and algorithms that are designed to detect hate speech in content on Facebook.Facebook has faced allegations of inaction against content posted by certain groups in India. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) last year cited an internal report and said it termed Hindu nationalistic group Bajrang Dal a “dangerous” organisation. But the company did not act on the report because of financial and safety concerns, the report said. The controversy then grew to spotlight the role of the India policy team and its then head Ankhi Das. Facebook and Das maintained there was no wrongdoing at the time. Das subsequently left the company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-whistle-blower-s-complaint-details-importance-of-indian-polls-duplicate-accounts-hate-speech-101633501776720.html

07-10-2021||Today's||To increase the share of gas in its energy mix, India has diplomatic options||One of the last major political acts of German chancellor Angela Merkel before the end of her tenure was the decision to go ahead with the Nordstream II project. This will bring an additional 55 billion cubic metres (BCM) per annum of Russian gas to Germany through a pipeline under the Baltic Sea, and double the volume of gas Germany currently receives from Russia. She allowed neither American pressure nor Ukraine’s objection to override German interest in energy security. After her meeting with United States (US) President Biden on July 21, Merkel said, about Nordstream II, “We have come to different assessments”. She visited Ukraine to mollify the authorities. Ukraine, however, feels that the project will undermine the existing pipeline from Russia to Europe, which goes through the country.Gas is a bridging fuel for the transition to a low-carbon economy, as it is less polluting than coal. Most Western economies have retained gas as a substantial part of their energy basket. It accounts for 34% of the US’s primary energy consumption, 38% of the United Kingdom (UK)’s, and 25% of Germany’s. Germany also has the option of buying American liquefied natural gas (LNG), which Donald Trump was pushing for. But it preferred the pipeline option to meet the bulk of its needs since piped gas is cheaper than LNG for distances up to 2,000 km.Europe is undergoing a major energy crisis, as the price of electricity has shot up. It went up to $395 a megawatt-hour (MWh) in the UK and €131 a MWh in Germany. The immediate trigger was slowing wind speed. The UK (24%) and Germany (23.7%) depend on wind power to meet a large part of their electricity demand. But underlying this was the upward trend in gas prices since early this year. European politicians and the media have blamed Russia for the short supply, but Russia denies the charge. Deregulation of the energy market, and growth of the spot market, may have brought about greater competition. However, this has also introduced greater price volatility. The answer, therefore, lies in pipeline contracts, which are concluded on a long-term basis.India is an LNG importer, which plays a major role in the production of fertiliser and petrochemicals, along with fuelling power plants. Our import requirements are bound to grow. The government has a target to increase the share of gas in India’s energy mix from the current 6% to 15% by 2030. The success of this plan depends on the availability of cheap gas. LNG prices are subject to market dynamics. LNG is currently trading above $37 per metric million British thermal units (MMBtu) in Asian markets. The availability of piped gas will help introduce both competition and price stability. India needs both LNG and piped gas. The size of its import requirements is large enough to accommodate both. This is also required to diversify India’s import requirements and avoid undue dependence on one source. So, what are our choices? India signed an agreement with Turkmenistan to bring gas to India through the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline. This has been on hold due to political uncertainties associated with the route passing through Pakistan. With the rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan, the prospects of importing gas through TAPI have become even more remote. Myanmar has some offshore gas fields. GAIL has acquired a stake in some of these assets. However, the absence of a pipeline makes it difficult to bring the gas to India.India could bring gas from the Gulf or Iran through an undersea pipeline. SAGE, an Indian company, has done considerable work in exploring various options. Technology exists for laying deep-sea pipelines. Money could be raised from international markets, once an assurance for gas off-take is given. Oman is keen to supply gas. It is connected with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar through the Dolphin pipeline, and can draw upon its gas reserves. The UAE is developing its gas reserves, which will come on-stream in two-three years. The project is estimated to cost $4.5 billion and the 1,300 km pipeline can be completed in five years, if fast-tracked. It can bring gas worth 31.1 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) to India. Indian companies can produce steel pipelines for the project and will be an expression of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Make in India programme.An alternative route to India is from Iran. Iran has the second biggest gas reserves in the world. The two countries have earlier discussed an Iran-Pakistan-India (IPI) pipeline. This would have been subjected to threats of disruption in the case of an India-Pakistan war. This was a major reason for India’s decision not to go ahead with the project. Since then, Pakistan has pulled out of this project despite having signed an agreement with Iran. However, a sub-sea pipeline from Chabahar to India will not be burdened by geopolitical tensions. Iran’s proximity to India makes it a competitive source of supply. There could also be an agreement on the nuclear issue with the US. In the case of both routes, the landfall for the pipeline will be the Gujarat coast in India. Gujarat is the hub of the petrochemical industry. The biggest advantage of an under-sea pipeline is that this avoids the geopolitical risks associated with overland routes. India’s energy needs are increasing, as climate concerns mount. Gas is a bridge fuel to a low-carbon economy, and holds the key to India’s transition to one.
