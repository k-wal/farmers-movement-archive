For the past three months, authorities have been saying that the problem is due to a broken sewage line nearby, but that has still not been fixed. We protested to draw attention to our problem, but we are waiting to see if any action is taken.”Bhawna (who goes by her first name), another resident from Rajendra Park, took to social media and said, “It has been almost two weeks since a ticket was raised by Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) regarding the overflow of sewage water on the roads, but no action has been taken on the ground. Residents want to know when will this stop. With rain, it becomes even more difficult to enter our own houses.”Officials from GMDA said that the sewage work for these areas has not been completely handed over to them by Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) yet, so it will take some time to solve such problems.Officials of the HSVP could not be contacted for comment on the matter.“These areas come under the jurisdiction of the GMDA, but the sewage network has not been completely handed over to us. Some of the areas have been handed over to us and we have started work on the sewage network, but the whole process will take a few more months,” said an executive engineer from infrastructure-II division of GMDA, who is privy to the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/residents-of-new-sectors-in-gurugram-complain-of-sewage-overflow-101635272956383.html

26-10-2021||Other||Be vigilant, update ‘maal khana’ inventory on regular basis: IG, Agra range to cops||Agra Taking a lesson from the incident in which ₹25 lakh was stolen from the ‘maal khana’ (storage room) of Jagdishpura police station in Agra on October 17 and the death of the accused sanitation worker in police custody, Agra police authorities have asked cops deployed at police stations to remain vigilant about the ‘maal-khana’ and update the inventory on regular basis.“A letter in this regard has been sent to SSPs and the SPs of four districts (Agra, Mathura, Mainpuri and Firozabad) under Agra Range. These officials heading the respective districts are to communicate the police station in-charges to ensure the arrangements at ‘maal-khana’ with constant vigil. It has been noticed that at most police stations, there is no appointment of ‘maal-khana’ moharrir (care-taker). First of all, the vacancy should be filled by deputing one of the cops as ‘moharrir’ at every police station in Agra range,” said Naveen Arora, inspector general (IG) of police, Agra Range. “There are storage rooms at different police stations which have not been opened for months. Directions have been issued to open such storage rooms at police stations and prepare a list of goods and contents present there under the supervision of a committee constituted at the police station level,” suggested, IG, Agra Range. The additional director general (ADG) Agra Zone Rajeev Krishna has already ordered to shift valuables, including recovered jewellery and heavy cash to the treasury. “The inspection of ‘maal-khana’ should be conducted on regular basis and if anything goes missing, senior cops deployed at the police stations would be answerable to that,” said Arora. He also advised officials concerned to first of all assign the task to only those cops who were responsible and thereafter check the goods at ‘maal-khana’ and update the list, and then send it to him by November end. On October 17, ₹25 lakh cash was found missing from the ‘maal-khana’ and on suspicion, a sanitation worker Arun Valmiki was taken into police custody and ₹15 lakh was recovered from his residence. The sanitation worker was later was found dead in the custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/be-vigilant-update-maal-khana-inventory-on-regular-basis-ig-agra-range-to-cops-101635272839125.html
26-10-2021||Noida||Legacy waste mining: NGT tells Ghaziabad civic body to pay ₹1 crore in damages||Taking serious note of the “very slow pace” of processing the legacy waste at the two landfill sites in Shakti Khand and Pratap Vihar, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) came down heavily on Ghaziabad agencies and directed the Ghaziabad municipal corporation to deposit ₹1 crore as interim compensation for restoration of the environment. The order came on a petition filed by the Confederation of Trans-Hindon RWAs seeking the removal of solid waste dumped at the landfill site, which is located in a residential area. During the course of hearings, the tribunal also directed inspections by its oversight committee to monitor the legacy waste processing at the Pratap Vihar landfill, which was shut in January 2019. The Pratap Vihar site has about 4.5 lakh metric tonnes of solid waste while the Shakti Khand site has about 1.5 lakh metric tonnes of legacy waste. The corporation officials said the processing of legacy waste at Shakti Khand would be completed by November, while the clearing of legacy waste from the Pratap Vihar site will be over only by March 2022. The oversight committee inspected both sites about a fortnight ago to assess the progress of legacy waste mining. “This is yet another instance of disappointing performance by statutory authorities in scientifically managing the waste in Indirapuram, Vasundhara and Vaishali, Ghaziabad, to the prejudice of rule of law and the environment and public health. This is so in spite of continuous monitoring by this tribunal for the past about three years,” the tribunal said in its order dated October 25. The tribunal observed that the authorities have to be held accountable by way of the “polluter pays” principle and department action must be taken for being in breach of their constitutional obligation under the “public trust doctrine”, apart from the liability for prosecution under criminal Law. “Remedial action by higher authorities may include review of the postings of key officers dealing with the waste management, including commissioner, Nagar Nigam (municipal corporation), and fixing liability under the civil and criminal Law,” the tribunal further said. “The additional chief secretary, Nagar Vikas, Uttar Pradesh, may file compliance status after coordinating with authorities concerned after three months. Pending assessment quantification of compensation, the Ghaziabad Nagar Nigam may deposit interim compensation of ₹1 crore with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) within 15 days, to be utilised for restoration of the environment. The nigam is free to recover the amount from the salary of errant officers,” it added. The tribunal also directed the CPCB to submit an independent report on the issue of management of solid/liquid waste in the area in question and also said In the case of 10 sewage drains (flowing into river Hindon), the technologies adopted and their performance duly supported by the analytical results needs to be indicated. “Storm water drains are not to be used for disposal of sewage, as earlier held by this tribunal, as the same is prohibited under the Water Act. The performance of STPs and the gap between sewage generation and treatment may be mentioned (in the report),” the tribunal said. The 10 drains are the ones in Karhera, Hindon Vihar, Kaila Bhatta, Arthala, Sarvodaya Nagar, Rahul Vihar, Indirapuram, Dasna and Nandgram besides the one near the main gate of the city forest in Karhera. In connection with the drains, tribunal said failure to manage drains, adds to the pollution of river Ganga as the said drain first meets Hindon, which then flows into the Yamuna, a tributary of Ganga.The officials of the Ghaziabad municipal corporation said the slow pace of legacy waste mining was due to several factors, including the pandemic situation. “Even the oversight committee in its inspection a fortnight ago appreciated the progress we made. As per our estimates, the legacy waste disposal at Shakti Khand is likely to get over by November while the one at Pratap Vihar is likely to get over by March 2022. We are making all efforts from our end. As regards the environment compensation of ₹1 crore, we will appeal this before the Supreme Court,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner. The members of the petitioner association said legacy waste at the site is getting processed at a slow pace. “This gives rise to unhygienic conditions and fires also break out sporadically. Overall, it is a highly contaminated area in the middle of Indirapuram residential locality,” said Mohan Sangwan, general secretary of the federation that filed the petition.The tribunal also said that “crossing the timeline is a criminal offence” under the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, read with the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. “Thus, the tribunal cannot be party to permitting continuation of such criminal offence. The criminal and civil liability for the failure (to process legacy waste) lies with the authorities concerned as laid down,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/legacy-waste-mining-ngt-tells-ghaziabad-civic-body-to-pay-1-crore-in-damages-101635272837708.html
26-10-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Special task force for executing Kaushambi’s environment plan||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed for constituting a special task force for a high-level monitoring of the steps being executed under the environment management plan for the Kaushambi township. The NGT issued the order in connection with a petition filed by the Kaushambi Apartments’ Resident Welfare Associations (Karwa). The tribunal, during the hearing on October 25, interacted with different officers who were directed to be present. “We have interacted with the officers present who are senior enough in the hierarchy of the administration and are competent enough to remedy the situation. What is required is realistic approach and concern to tackle the problem, instead of shifting the blame to other authorities. The traffic management, waste management and action against encroachers need to be realistic and not mere show of compliance,” the tribunal said in its order. “Stringent steps are required for executing the environment management plan, including protection of the storm water drains and preventing unauthorised parking. This may require a special task force comprising responsible officers of proven ability and high-level monitoring at least once in a week, if not more frequent initially. Monitoring may include, among other indicators, improvement in air quality and reduction in noise,” it said. Karwa moved the NGT in 2015 with contention for stoppage of different sources of pollution affecting the township that has about 22 high-rises with an estimated population of about 20,000. The resident body said that pollution levels are high in Kaushambi due to its close proximity to Anand Vihar and Kaushambi inter-state bus terminals, Ghazipur landfill site and Sahibabad industrial area. “After several works remained incomplete, we filed an execution application in 2019. The Ghaziabad agencies filed their status reports recently. The environment management plan for Kaushambi was revised in mid of 2020. Now, different departments have started works and the tribunal has directed for formation of a special task force,” said VK Mittal, president of Karwa. In its execution application, Karwa sought enforcement of the tribunal’s order of August 20, 2018 and subsequent orders for remedial action against violation of environmental norms on account of unregulated traffic, illegal parking, encroachments, and unscientific solid waste management. The revised environment management plan was made by the UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) on the directions of the NGT. Under the plan, the state pollution board has suggested for conversion of state road transport buses into CNG, creation of noise barriers, repair of roads, mechanical road sweeping, proper solid waste disposal, and removal of encroachments, among others.“We will comply with the directions of the tribunal. We will direct the departments, which are working for different works related to Kaushambi, to expedite the works,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB, Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-special-task-force-for-executing-kaushambi-s-environment-plan-101635272836404.html
26-10-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram civic body to lift only segregated waste from November 10||Starting November 10, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) will collect only segregated waste from households in the city, officials said on Tuesday. The corporation has also issued directions to its sanitation wing and Ecogreen to make citizens aware in the next 15 days that they need to segregate waste at their homes. Ecogreen is MCG’s concessionaire for door-to-door collection of waste in the city. The officials said the decision was taken to ensure strict compliance to the waste management rules.“Segregation of garbage is an important and necessary task. There are various types of waste generated in homes, with wet and dry waste being the primary ones. It is the responsibility of residents to separate the waste into these categories and hand it over to the garbage collectors separately. From November 10, mixed waste will not be accepted by the MCG. So, citizens should make the process of segregating waste a habit,” said Mukesh Kumar Ahuja, municipal commissioner who took the decision on Monday.Acting on Ahuja’s directions, MCG additional commissioner Vaishali Sharma held a meeting with sanitation wing officials and Ecogreen representatives in the corporation’s Sector 34 office on Tuesday and directed them to start proceedings for storing segregated waste in garbage collection vehicles and inform residents that mixed waste will not be accepted after November 10.“Ecogreen representatives have been directed to ensure that wet and dry waste is collected separately from each household. For this, each garbage collection vehicle should have two different sections to store such waste so as to ensure they do not get mixed. They have been asked to make these changes within the next 15 days,” said Sharma.On December 25 last year, the MCG observed ‘zero waste day’ for the first time. On a zero waste day, only wet waste is collected from households. Since mid-March this year, the corporation has been observing zero waste days every Tuesday. The officials said that residents have been given six months of training in segregation of waste, hence it was decided to carry it out on a full-time basis ahead of the Swachh Survekshan 2022. ‘Kachra alag karo’ (separate waste) is one of the campaigns in the upcoming cleanliness survey, they said.The MCG officials further said that the segregation of waste is also aimed at converting wet waste into compost and recycling dry waste to the maximum possible extent so that the waste load carried to the overburdened Bandhwari landfill can be reduced. There are around 2.5 million tonnes of legacy waste at the Bandhwari landfill.The additional commissioner also said if Ecogreen vehicles come to the transfer station with mixed waste, then action will be taken against the concessionaire under the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016.Ecogreen officials said that around 380 garbage collection vehicles are equipped with compartments to store different types of waste.“In pursuance of the directions issued by MCG officials during a meeting with Ecogreen on Tuesday, we will run a campaign to spread awareness on waste segregation and inform residents about the November 10 deadline. The MCG has also informed us about the penalties if mixed waste is found at transfer stations, and the same will be conveyed to our staff,” said Sanjeev Sharma, spokesperson, Ecogreen.Residents said that the corporation should launch an awareness campaign on the waste segregation. “MCG should issue an advisory on social media as well as on RWA WhatsApp groups first informing residents about the November 10 deadline and explain about the various types of dry and wet waste,” said Dhruv Bansal, spokesperson, Gurgaon Citizens Council (GCC), an umbrella body of RWAs in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-civic-body-to-lift-only-segregated-waste-from-november-10-101635272776372.html

26-10-2021||Delhi||Gang that honey trapped men, extorted money from them busted; five held||The Delhi Police on Tuesday said they have busted a gang of extortionists led by a 42-year-old woman, who was previously convicted in a criminal conspiracy case, and arrested her and four of her associates for allegedly extorting money from men after threatening to frame them in bogus rape cases.The alleged accused befriended the victims through an online dating application and lured them to a house, where they drugged the man and clicked his objectionable photographs and videos with women in the gang. Police said the gang hatched elaborate plays to hoodwink victims and each gang member had specific roles. “We have recovered some police file covers, extorted money and other articles from the arrested persons. The gang members have confessed to extorting valuables from nearly 40 men in the past couple of years. We have recovered a diary containing details of 34 victims and their self written statement admitting guilt and a signed compromise agreement. All of them will be contacted during the probe,” said an investigator, who asked not to be named.On October 23, a businessman dealing in timbers in Dabri filed a complaint alleging that around a month ago, he received a call from a woman named Pooja, who wanted to purchase a ply board. On October 21, he was in Janakpuri area when the woman called him on WhatsApp and met him after five minutes.“She lured him to a house and gave a glass of water to drink. He fell unconscious after that and when he came to, the businessman found himself on a bed naked. Six women and three men present there assaulted him and robbed him of ₹15,700, his wristwatch and gold ring. They threatened to kill him if he did not pay them ₹7 lakh,” said deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Shankar Choudhary, adding that a case of extortion and threat was registered on the man’s complaint.During investigation, the police collected information about the gang and learnt that the crime was masterminded by Shivani alias Sonu Suri, who was convicted in a criminal conspiracy casein which she had used a woman to file a bogus rape case against a man. Suri was seven years’ imprisonment and she came out of jail after staying there for 19 months.The police arrested Suri and her four associates, identified as Revti Devi (33) and her husband Vaibhav (37), both residents of Jeewan Park, Sheetal Arora alias Pooja (40), a resident of Burari and Harbinder Singh (60), a resident of Tagore Garden.Suri’s interrogation, the DCP said, revealed that she used to get mobile numbers of targets using an online dating application. She used to provide their mobile numbers to Arora, who then invited the targeted person to the residence of Revti.“One of the gang members would have intercourse with the victim while others entered the house to threaten him and extort money. Singh played the role of a judge or legal consultant while Suri played the role of an NGO member. The other accused played the role of neighbours and family members of the woman who was with the victim. They extorted money from the victim on the pretext of filing a false rape charge,” said Choudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gang-that-honey-trapped-men-extorted-money-from-them-busted-five-held-101635272356238.html

The officials said the mastermind fraudulently used the government scheme meant for farmers to earn multi-crore profit.Sharing further details, a senior STF official said Gupta’s name surfaced in the fraud after the arrest of four people from Maharajganj district in February this year and he had been evading arrest since then. They said the Maharajganj police had also declared the reward of ₹50,000 on his arrest. He said Gupta had been living in a hotel in Deoghar district for several months on a fake identity.The official said the police would seek his custody remand to interrogate him further and unravel the entire nexus involved behind it. He said the role of many other private and government employees was likely to surface during the investigation.He said the matter came to light after the arrest of four people, including Bhalendu Chaturvedi, Shatrughan Pathak, Bhagwat Prasad and Vyasmuni Pathak, from Maharajganj district on February 17 this year.The official said the police had then recovered 243 activated SIM cards issued on identity of different people, 297 cheque books and 331 single cheques of different banks of Maharajganj and Gorakhpur. He said the police had then registered an FIR against them for committing a fraud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/maharajganj-paddy-purchase-fraud-stf-nabs-mastermind-in-jharkhand-101635270617286.html

It has registration certificate under the Clinical Establishment (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010."The affidavit has been filed in a petition seeking initiation of contempt proceedings for the Delhi government for allegedly not complying with the court's order to take action against illegal online health service aggregators operating in the Delhi-NCR and to regulate online pathological labs.The bench of Justice Najmi Waziri on Tuesday adjourned the matter for November 25, as the response filed by Gurugram Police was ‘not on records.’The same bench earlier asked the Delhi government to identify more such private laboratories which are conducting Covid-19 tests without licences, while issuing notices to the Delhi Police and Gurgaon Police and asked them to file replies.The Delhi High Court earlier too said that ICMR cannot be sitting in an ivory tower and said that it should look into the complaints relating to private pathology laboratories.Earlier, in an affidavit filed, ICMR informed the Court that National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) certification is a must for enrollment of private labs for Covid-19 testing, adding that monitoring of the activities of online health service aggregators does not come under its purview.ICMR submitted that as of August 16 2021, the ICMR has approved 134 (Govt. 35 and Private 99) labs at Delhi for RT-PCR, TrueNat, CBNAAT and Other M-NAT Testing Platforms.Advocate Shashank Deo Sudhi, who appeared for petitioner Dr Rohit Jain, had alleged that no action has been taken by the government and in fact, there is a grave violation of the Supreme Court order.He had also added that contempt is remedial jurisprudence and not adversarial and public welfare is the highest law.The Petitioner has alleged that the top official of respondents is equally responsible for restraining the illegal practices of online aggregators which are freely being carried out under the eyes of these officials in utter violations of the rules and regulations laid down by statutes and the guidelines issued by the respondents from time to time ever since the outbreak of deadly coronavirus."Several illegal online aggregators are advertising freely by offering attractive packages for the body check-up, including Covid-19 test through SMSs or various online modes. The applicant/petitioner has received an advertisement of the online aggregator through e-mail for getting tested," the plea stated."The acts of respondents clearly constitute the contempt of the court and appropriate contempt proceedings should be initiated against them for acting against the order dated August 6, last year of this court," the plea said."The respondent's officials have been playing with the precious lives of innocent people by promoting unqualified, unregistered medical practitioners to sign the pathological report and exposing the common people to the mercy of untrained and highly incompetent medical/ pathological professional," it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/healthians-lab-has-icmr-nabl-accreditation-gurugram-police-to-delhi-hc-101635264353331.html

I am innocent and my image has been tarnished. We live in Palghar for the past seven decades,” said Bafna.In his complaint, Bafna, a trader, claimed that he met Sail a few months ago and knows his brother Satish since 2019. “Satish had offered me two deals.

The vaccination drive will be held in Burari’s Ibrahimpur village.Puri was accompanied by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Manoj Tiwari. Later, Puri and Tiwari shared pictures of the campaign’s launch on Twitter. The Union minister also sought blessings for all from ‘Chhathi Maiya’ in Bhojpuri.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), in its order on September 30, prohibited the celebration of Chhath at riverbanks, water bodies and temples citing restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The DDMA, however, is expected to permit the festival at public places after its meeting on Wednesday.Tiwari said the decision to vaccinate ‘Chhathvratis’ (those keeping fast) was launched to ensure the festival will be celebrated safely. More than 10,000 people will be administered jabs across New Delhi during the campaign.“In this campaign, 10,000 devotees who would perform the puja but who could not get inoculated (against Covid) due to some reason would be covered,” Tiwari had said on Monday.Tiwari also said the vaccination programme will be carried out in association with an NGO named Delhiites. “In my constituency (Northeast Delhi), 4,000 vaccines will be administered to Chhath devotees, while 1,000 each will be distributed in the remaining six parliamentary constituencies of Delhi. We aim to conclude this special vaccination drive before November 9,” Tiwari was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Chhath is celebrated after Diwali by people from Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh and the ritual involves the offering of ‘Arghya’ by fasting women to the Sun god in knee-deep water.Earlier this month, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote to Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal requesting him to allow Chhath Puja in the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/drive-to-vaccinate-over-10-000-devotees-before-chhath-puja-launched-in-delhi-101635268740590.html

The CM should know that this decision impinges on the rights of the state and strikes at the core of federal rights. It should be rejected outrightly,” Sukhbir said, during a visit to the holy city during which he met with sections of society. “It is shocking that the CM is still contemplating on what to do on the issue,” the former deputy CM said, adding, “Under the Congress, governance has gone for a complete toss. Instead of resolving public issues, the Congressmen are busy in an internal feud between themselves. They are also simultaneously looting the state exchequer.”Badal also asked the CM not to delay payment of compensation to cotton growers afflicted by the pink bollworm attack. “The government must release compensation to the tune of ₹50,000 per acre to farmers and ₹15,000 per acre to khet mazdoors.” .The SAD president also met representatives of the trade, industry, doctors and other professionals. Badal also interacted with transporters and assured that the forthcoming SAD-BSP alliance government would form a Transport Welfare Board and restore transport unions. He said undue harassment being done unto truckers will be ended by issuing annual stickers to them. “Any truck carrying the sticker will not be stopped on road by anyone.” He also announced that if elected to power, he would come out with a separate policy for mini-buses and accidental insurance for drivers in consultation with stakeholders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/convey-no-to-increase-of-bsf-jurisdiction-in-punjab-to-centre-now-sukhbir-to-channi-101635267976025.html

26-10-2021||Mumbai||Cruise ship drug bust case: NDPS court grants bail to two guests||The special Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) court on Tuesday granted bail to two guests at the holiday cruise ship Cordelia — Avin Sahu and Manish Rajgaria. Both were arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in the cruise drug bust case.The special NDPS judge Vaibhav Patil granted bail to Sahu and Rajgaria, on furnishing personal bonds of ₹50,000 each and one or two sureties in the same amount.Sana Raees Khan, who argued for Sahu, had told the court that the only allegation against him was that he had consumed ganja twice while on the cruise. However, there was no medical report and nothing was found in his possession.“My case is slightly different from the case of Aryan Khan. In his case also there was no possession but there were chats or messages. In my case, there are no chats or messages. The only allegation against my client was he consumed ganja twice on the ship and the maximum punishment was one year’s imprisonment, even if the charge is accepted to be true. The material seized from others can’t be foisted on him. Section 29 of NDPS Act of conspiracy was applied mechanically when there was no meeting of minds between the accused.”Raees had further argued that Sahu had been made a scapegoat in this matter because it has become a high profile case and it was a clear case of malicious prosecution. He pointed out the Apex court rulings that the act of an accused cannot be used as evidence against the other.Advocates Taraq Sayed and Vikas Bhawaniya had argued for Rajgaria that nothing was found in his possession. They pointed out that in Rhea Chakraborty’s case also, the agency had arrested 33 people, however, not all of them were connected to each other. By adding the charge of conspiracy, the agency is claiming that whatever has been recovered from one, can be attributed to all, but the agency has failed to show any nexus between the accused.NCB’s counsel Advait Sethna and Ruju Thakker argued that even after the raid and detention of several guests, Sahu had consumed ganja twice and 2.4 grams of ganja was seized from the security guard. The guard claimed that the ganja was given to him by Rajgaria.Sahu and Rajgaria were arrested on October 5, after the holiday cruise returned from Goa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cruise-ship-drug-bust-case-ndps-court-grants-bail-to-two-guests-101635266475804.html

There are also children who do not have details of their father and face difficulties in getting these certificates. This is why we have decided to begin issuing caste certificates in the name of the mother as well,” Rajasthan’s social justice and empowerment department secretary Samit Sharma said.Sharma said Rajasthan may be the country’s first state to take this step. “The new provisions will empower children and women socially,” Sharma said.The change was proposed a few months ago when a non-profit that helps women, Mahila Punarvas Samuh Samiti, came across an instance where a woman, separated from her husband, could not get the other backward classes (OBC) certificate for her children with her name on it.“At our centre, a woman, a mother of two, approached us with an issue that her children cannot be admitted in school under OBC quota. She was separated from her husband, but schools were asking for the father’s name. There are many such cases where single mothers have to face such struggles. We have to stop such gender bias,” said Renuka Pamecha, activist and secretary of the NGO which approached the government for a change in format five months ago.Social activist Kavita Srivastav said this was an excellent initiative by the state government, but the key would be the effective implementation with no harassment to women. “Awareness about this must be made from the panchayat to the district level,” she said.Officials said the government will also issue income and asset certificates to divorced women. “This means that if the woman is entitled to any allowance or property then it will be counted in the income of the woman. In cases where the details of the husband are not available, the income of other family members will be factored into a decision to give the certificate for income and assets,” one official said.In Rajasthan, the social justice and welfare department issued around 20 lakh caste certificates and 2 lakh income and asset certificates in the last financial year.Caste certificates are used to get benefits of reservation in professional courses, competitive exams, admission to educational institutes, and public employment. Similarly, the economically weaker section (EWS) certificate leads to benefits on account of government schemes including those related to residential schools, post-matric scholarships and coaching.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-caste-certificates-to-list-mother-s-name-also-says-top-official-101635265455938.html

However, BMC has been unable to find the exact source of the leakage and will take up the waterproofing work owing to a risk of accidents.Last month, BMC had appointed Veermata Jijabai Technical Institute (VJTI) as a consultant to detect the exact source of leakage. The contract cost was ₹23 lakh. According to BMC officials, after the guidance and expertise provided by the consultant, they have now decided to go ahead with floating bids for the actual work. The entire project waterproofing work is likely to cost around ₹15 crore and the scope of work includes chemical coating and fixing of leakages, cracks and expansion joints etc.“It is unlikely that we will totally shut down traffic movement during the waterproofing work, but there will be a few diversions. We may also consider working in at night with the required lighting,” a BMC official said.The bid document floated by BMC reads, “As the work under this tender is to be carried out near the running traffic, it will be essential for the contractor to take all measures to ensure safety. The intending tenderer should carefully examine the site to understand the restrictions on availability of space and provision of safety measures.”The 16-km freeway, started in 2014, was constructed with an aim to cut travel time between Navi Mumbai and Thane to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) from one-and-a-half hours to 40 minutes. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) that built the freeway handed over the maintenance of the highway to BMC in May 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/eastern-freeway-traffic-diversions-ahead-as-bmc-plans-waterproofing-work-101635265335768.html

26-10-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena attacks BJP over misuse of central agencies||Continuing its attack against the Centre over the cruise drugs seizure case of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), the Shiv Sena on Tuesday slammed the Central government, saying the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) acts like it owns central investigation agencies, but it should not forget that in a democracy, owners do change. The Sena mouthpiece Samaana added that the alleged Rs25-crore extortion bid is just the tip of the iceberg. “The BJP acts like it owns the central investigation agencies. It should not forget that in a democracy, owners do change. There are examples of it in history. The party should not forget that it is like any other political party. It should also remember that political power comes and goes,” the Sena mouthpiece said in Tuesday. Leader of opposition and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis has however said that the central agencies and its officers are being targeted by the leaders of the ruling parties to divert the attention from the corruption cases. In a remark on the alleged extortion bid of Rs25 crore to let off Aryan Khan, an editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana asked how much bribe would have been offered to settle the seizure of 3,500kg heroin on Mundra port in Gujarat. “How much bribe amount was sought to settle the case of 3,500-kg heroin found at the Adani group-controlled Mundra port in Gujarat? This is a question that just have crossed the minds of the people. Nobody knew when that [heroin seizure] case was closed, but the Aryan Khan case is still going on,” the editorial said. Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Monday targeted NCB officials over the payoff claims made by independent witness Prabhakar Sail and alleged that there is extortion and money laundering by NCB. Devendra Fadnavis, leader of opposition in legislative Assembly, said that NCB officials are being targeted by the people who have been on the constitutional position and it is dangerous. “Ministers are targeting the investigating officers or witnesses in the key cases, which are under trial in courts. If this continues, it will be an attack on justice, jeopardising the cases. If there are any charges against the investigating officers, there could be an inquiry, but they cannot be targeted. The officers are being targeted by producing their personal information related to religion, by threatening them to send to jail,” he said.Fadnavis said the officials are being targeted to divert the attention of the people from the corruption charges against the ministers and leaders of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. “There are charges of Rs1,000 crore earned by the leaders of ruling parties, the investigating agencies have found Rs190 crore during raids, softwares are being used for extortion. All this will come to the fore after the investigation by the agencies. The attempt to malign the officials from these agencies is to divert the attention from these corruption cases,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-attacks-bjp-over-misuse-of-central-agencies-101635262515742.html
26-10-2021||Lucknow||Those who abused Lord Ram now visiting Ayodhya: Yogi||LUCKNOW Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday took a veiled swipe at his Delhi counterpart and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Arvind Kejriwal, accusing him of exploiting Lord Ram for vote-bank gains. Without taking names, he said: “Earlier, they abused Lord Ram. Now, with the elections approaching, they are coming to Ayodhya to pay obeisance to the deity after realising that they will not be able to sail through in the upcoming elections. This is good. At least they have accepted the existence and importance of Ram,” said Adityanath.“But let us not forget that there was no opposition leader in the country who didn’t criticize babuji (referring to the then chief minister Kalyan Singh) on December 6, 1992,” he added. The attack was timed with Kejriwal’s two-day Ayodhya visit during which he promised that the Delhi government would arrange for free Ayodhya visits for the masses. AAP is set to contest the 2022 UP polls early next year. Adityanath also targeted other opposition parties. “While the opposition parties vied over hosting iftaar, during Hindu festivals curfews forced by riots spoiled the show for the majority community,” he said. His attack on the opposition came at a social justice meeting comprising members of Lodh, the Other Backward Caste (OBC) community, to which former chief minister Kalyan Singh belonged. The chief minister also accused his Delhi counterpart of abandoning UP’s migrants, forcing them out of Delhi during the Covid-induced lockdown. “There is someone from Delhi who had forced people of UP out of the National Capital during the lockdown. Now, he is announcing freebies. Someone who couldn’t handle UP people in Delhi is positioning himself as one who could handle all of UP,” said Yogi Adityanath. Kalyan Singh, who belonged to the Lodh sub-caste of OBCs, was the chief minister of UP when the Babri mosque was razed by kar sevaks in December, 1992. He always maintained that he refused to give permission to the security forces to fire at kar sevaks who had gathered at Ayodhya, a point Adityanath has been raising in his speeches at BJP’s caste meets. On October 30, 1990, the police had opened fire at kar sewaks who gathered in Ayodhya on the call given by VHP, RSS and the BJP when the Mulayam Singh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party government was in power. “Had there been a BJP government in UP in 1990, no power on earth would have dared to fire at kar sevaks,” Adityanath has been stating repeatedly in his speeches. Adityanath also targeted the main opposition Samajwadi Party for tweaking its publicity tagline ‘main aa raha hoon (I am coming)’. “This simply means that lawlessness, anarchy, mayhem, goonda raj among other things is returning. That is why one should not vote for such parties,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/those-who-abused-lord-ram-now-visiting-ayodhya-yogi-101635262395692.html

The panchayat is associated with the Divya Jyoti Jagriti Sansthan (DJJS) whose head Ashutosh Maharaj has been declared clinically dead, but his body continues to be preserved inside a freezer in Nurmahal since 2014.The Punjab and Haryana high court had ordered the inquiry on October 6, after a plea from one Puran Singh, alleging that Divya Gram, a fake gram panchayat, had been formed only to siphon off funds that the 14th Finance Commission, the local area development fund and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) provide. The judge Rupinderjit Chahal adds in her report that the Divya Gram Panchayat falls within the revenue estates of Uppal Jagir and Uppal Khalsa villages. The report underlined that no family is permanently residing in three of five wards of the panchayat, which has 27 constructed houses under it. Judge Chahal visited all wards of the gram panchayat, along with officials, to check for permanent residents, adding that the panchayat came into existence in 2013, while the sarpanch and the member panchayats were elected the same year. During inspection, it was found that no family was permanently residing in ward number 1. Their accommodation had been allotted free of cost by the DJJS. Ward number 2 was divided into two blocks with 61 and 30 rooms, for males and females, respectively. The occupants were neither owners of rooms nor they were relatives by blood. Divya Gram sarpanch Rajwinder Kaur was residing in room number 10 here. In ward number 3, a ‘Peeli Kothi’ owned by Mohinder Singh has been left at the disposal of DJJS, the report adds, listing key details of all the wards. Advocate Baltej Singh Sidhu, the petitioner’s counsel, said the court had fixed the next hearing on October 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/divya-gram-panchayat-nurmahal-plea-on-status-panchayat-has-no-revenue-estate-only-27-houses-sessions-judge-in-report-to-hc-101635262275586.html
26-10-2021||Lucknow||Larvae samples collected in Kanpur sent to SGPGI for Zika virus detection||KANPUR To contain the spread of Zika virus, a major operation was underway in Pokharpur and Pardevanpurwa localities of Kanpur’s Chakeri area under the supervision of specialists from Lucknow. The operation included sanitisation, anti-larvae spray, identification of fever patients, screening of seriously ill people and pregnant women. The team collected 12 mosquitoes and larvae samples from 12 houses in the area and sent them for genetic testing to the SGPGI (Lucknow) to ascertain if these were carriers of the virus, said health department officials. These localities were divided into 10 zones and a team of the malaria control department was destroying the source of mosquito breeding, they said. The genetic analysis would help understand the kind of fever these mosquitoes could spread, said a health official, adding the report was expected in three days. Zika virus is transmitted to people primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito. These are the same mosquitoes that spread dengue and chikungunya viruses.Meanwhile, samples of a few people suffering from fever were collected in the city. These would be tested for Zika virus, malaria and dengue. The health department implemented the SOPs it adopted for containment zones. Chief medical officer (Kanpur) Nepal Singh said the focus was on making the area mosquito free. “We have collected the mosquitoes and sampled them. Till the mosquito breeding sources are not destroyed, the possibility of the spread of virus will always remain,” he said. Health department teams were also working on finding the source of Zika virus in Kanpur, which infected a 57-year-old warrant officer of the Indian Air Force. The officials said two possibilities were being explored, - one someone brought the virus from outside Kanpur and the virus, including the dengue one, had mutated. “It is important for us to ascertain how the IAF personnel was infected with this virus. We have sent five more samples for Zika virus test. The 22 others sent earlier tested negative,” said the CMO. Uttar Pradesh had on Sunday reported the first case of Zika virus. The case was reported from Kanpur after a warrant officer in the Indian Air Force (IAF) was diagnosed with it.The officer had been suffering from fever for the past many days and was also admitted to the Air Force Hospital in the city. His blood sample was collected and sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune, after the latter began showing some mysterious symptoms, said the CMO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/larvae-samples-collected-in-kanpur-sent-to-sgpgi-for-zika-virus-detection-101635261915533.html

The gesture will help four other people lead fuller lives even as four of the deceased’s organs have been retrieved.Dr Aarti Gokhale, central coordinator, Zonal Transplant Coordinator Committee, Pune, said, “It was a very difficult moment for the family as they had to decide about organ donation at a very sensitive time when they had lost their young son. According to the family, he was a normal, healthy child but suddenly collapsed one day while riding his bicycle with no prior symptoms of any illness or discomfort. He was rushed to the hospital but breathed his last on Monday due to severe intracranial bleeding. Of his two kidneys, one was found medically fit for donation.”The organs retrieved from the deceased’s body include his liver which was allocated to Sahyadri hospital, one kidney which was allocated to Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital, his heart to Mumbai’s Reliance hospital through ROTTO-SOTTO Mumbai, and his cornea to another donor for immediate use. Dr Gokhale said, “It is really crucial for everyone to understand that even in times of grief, one positive response too can change the lives of multiple strangers and bring a smile to many faces.

26-10-2021||Mumbai||Go to court, if you have solid evidence, Sameer Wankhede’s wife, sister tell NCP minister Nawab Malik||Hours after senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and state minister Nawab Malik made public an anonymous letter addressed to him, which claimed that a large number of people are being framed by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), family members of NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede asked him to go to court if he has got “solid evidence”. Wankhede’s sister Jasmine and wife Kranti Redkar, a Marathi actress, addressed a press conference on Tuesday refuting all allegations made by the minister and said that there can’t be a media trial in the matter. They said that if there is any evidence of wrongdoings then they must approach the courts.The anonymous letter claimed that several people have been framed in false drug cases and panchnamas were drafted at the NCB office. Malik had demanded an investigation into the allegations and has forwarded the letter to NCB director-general SN Pradhan and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. “I request him to go to court if he has got such solid evidence. Why are we wasting the time of media? We will respond in court,” said Jasmine. The NCB officer’s wife dismissed the letter and said such a letter can be written by anyone. “Anyone can write such a letter sitting at home. If someone has written the letter, then the person should complain, and let the due process follow. But if someone writes anonymous letters then it is baseless, it is all false.”Redkar also refuted Malik’s allegations that phone-tapping was done by the federal anti-drug agency. She said that the minister must approach the courts and not level allegations on Twitter. “I think this phone-tapping are false claims. If he has any proof about it, then I am sure he will present it before the courts. We can’t achieve anything by making allegations on Twitter. I can also write something against somebody, but it doesn’t become the truth,” she said.The anonymous letter comes a day after Malik claimed that Wankhede is a Muslim by birth, however, he has forged documents to show himself from Scheduled Caste, take benefit of reservation and enter the Indian Revenue Services in 2008.Redkar said that the family has shown all his documents, while Jasmine questioned who was Malik to seek his birth certificate. “We have presented all documents from birth certificate to details on his caste and religion. What more can we show? Government documents are everything in this country.” She added, “We are tired of giving proofs daily when I know my husband is not a liar... These are allegations made on Twitter, not in the courts. If you approach the court and it finds him wrong, then we can call him a criminal. How can there be a media trial of one person who has given 15 years of service.”Jasmine and Redkar added that they are facing death threats and are being trolled on social media. Redkar invoked the Marathi card and said that she is feeling unsafe in Maharashtra. “I am a proud Marathi and people are threatening me in my home state. I am getting messages of support from other states as well. The anti-Sameer Wankhede gang is giving us a hard time. We are being trolled. We are getting threats of being killed, being hanged, being burned alive.”Responding to the allegations of an extortion bid of ₹25 crore, of which ₹8 crore was to be paid to Wankhede, in the Aryan Khan case, Redkar said, “There is no evidence presented on this. When he (Prabhakar Sail) goes to the court and provides proof, then we can say something about it. This is all hearsay and we can’t comment on it.”The sister-wife duo added that Wankhede is an “honest” officer and many people want him out of his position. They added that the NCB officer will emerge “victorious” in this battle as all allegations are “baseless and false”.Redkar dismissed her husband’s alleged political leaning towards the party in power at the Centre. She also said that the Maharashtra government is “cooperative” and will realise the truth in the matter and stand beside him. “Sameer ji isn’t just apprehending celebrities and artists. They constitute around 3% of the people he apprehends. The remaining are peddlers and dons. I don’t think he is associated with any political party. He works in a central agency and is doing his duty neutrally,” Redkar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/go-to-court-if-you-have-solid-evidence-sameer-wankhede-s-wife-sister-tell-ncp-minister-nawab-malik-101635259095463.html

Also , the society has been accused of converting black money into white during demonetisation by changing cash books and accepting cash as deposits.An extract from the order reads: “It is clear that the cooperative society about which this complaint has been filed is neither owned nor controlled by the state govt and therefore, prima facie, it appears that provisions of the MPID Act are applicable to it. Therefore this court has the power to take cognisance of this. Investigation from the police is necessary.

26-10-2021||Delhi||Covid impact on migrants may be key Delhi civic body poll issue||The impact of Covid-19 on migrants and the urban poor living in the Capital will be a key issue dominating the forthcoming municipal elections scheduled for early next year, with various political parties already trying to curry favour with those affected by it. The civic polls will be crucial for all three political parties. For the Bharatiya Janata Party, it will be a battle to remain relevant in the city’s governance system, especially after its defeat in the 2020 assembly elections; for Aam Aadmi Party, it will be a statement on its performance (especially during Covid) in its third term in office; for Congress, it will be all about regaining lost ground in the city that it ruled for 15 straight years until 2013. Hoping for a fourth term in the corporations, BJP is eyeing the support of slum clusters, which are considered an AAP stronghold. The party’s Jhuggi Samman Yatra, a 45-day outreach campaign, which started from October 15 and is focused on highlighting the Centre’s “pro-poor schemes” and the Delhi government’s “failures”, has sparked off a political tussle with AAP and Congress dubbing it an “eyewash” and “farce”. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said that they have got tremendous response from residents during the yatras. “The success of our campaign has rattled both AAP and Congress. Both parties, for years, treated slum residents as a vote bank, but did nothing for their welfare,” said Gupta. He said that slum residents are the ‘Dil (heart) of Delhi’ as they are involved at the grassroots level in running the city, especially during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic. “But they were the worst affected during the pandemic, as the state government did nothing for them and stalled the Centre’s pro-poor schemes such as Ayushman Bharat, affordable rental housing scheme, etc. The ration scheme got delayed. The government completely mismanaged the Covid situation. While they paralysed the functioning of civic agencies by stalling funds, the worst part is that the government did nothing to improve the living conditions of people in slum clusters despite having funds,” Gupta said. The BJP, which has covered over 60 slum clusters so far as part of its campaign, plans to start ‘NaMo jhuggi seva kendras’ in the next few days to help people in availing benefits under various central government schemes. But AAP and Congress leaders say these are nothing but an attempt to cover for its failure in delivering better civic services despite being in power for 15 years. The Congress is planning a ‘Pol Khol Yatra’ from October 25 to expose BJP and AAP, while the AAP held an outreach programme ‘Aapka MLA, Aapke Dwar’ in September in which the party claimed to have held 3,000 public meetings to get people’s feedback and discuss the functioning of the municipal corporations. Congress leaders say that both the ruling parties have failed miserably in delivering essential services, especially during the pandemic. “A lot of people lost jobs during the pandemic. In Uttarakhand, (Delhi chief minister) Arvind Kejriwal has promised to pay a monthly stipend of ₹5,000 to the unemployed youth if AAP is elected. There are 13 lakh people registered with the Delhi government’s job portal. Why doesn’t the government give the same amount to people in Delhi? Similarly, the BJP has completely mismanaged the functioning of municipal corporations, making it difficult for common people to access essential services. We will expose both the parties in our pol khol yatras,” said Delhi Congress chief Chaudhary Anil Kumar. AAP shot back. Senior AAP leader Durgesh Pathak, who oversees municipal affairs in the party, said, “BJP and Congress have governments in various states. I give them an open challenge for a debate on which government did the maximum work during Covid. From providing rations to giving ₹5,000 compensation to ensure the best treatment to people, no one has done the kind of work the Kejriwal government has done during Covid.” Referring to BJP’s campaign in the slum clusters, Pathak added, “In the past 15 years, there has been so much corruption in the BJP-led corporations. There is no residential colony left in the city where their councillors have not taken money for allowing construction work. Frankly, the BJP can now only go to slum clusters to get support. But they will not get it as most slums are on DDA land and in the past few years, the land-owning agency has evicted many people. Moreover, they have not done a single thing for the welfare of slum dwellers despite being in power in the corporations for so long.” About 1.7 million people live in 675 slums and JJ (jhuggi-jhopri) clusters in Delhi, as per the Delhi Economic Survey-2020-21. While slums are scattered around the city, there are over 33 assembly constituencies and over 100 municipal wards with a high concentration of slums that are a significant vote bank. The BJP has been trying to get the support of the slum dwellers, who once supported Congress and later moved to AAP. Months before the 2017 municipal elections, the then Delhi BJP chief and Northeast Delhi MP, Manoj Tiwari, had started ‘Ratri Pravas’ (night stay) at slums in a bid to connect the party (which has upper and middle classes as its traditional voters) with the urban poor and migrants. The move had played a crucial role in BJP winning a third term in the civic bodies and improving its previous tally of 138 to 181. But in the 2020 Delhi assembly elections, AAP returned to power with 62 seats, riding high on its focus on education, healthcare and free electricity and water. The Congress hasn’t given up. “We might have lost the last assembly elections, but we are working hard on the ground. The increase in our vote share during the municipal bypolls earlier this year is an indication that people want Congress back as they acknowledge the work done by us when we were in power,” the Delhi Congress chief said. Political analyst Tanvir Aeijaz, who teaches political science at Ramjas College, said civic elections are fought on local issues that influence the outcome. “While all the welfare schemes such as free electricity, water, good education in schools have got the support of the people, it is also the work done by them during the pandemic, such as providing ration, etc, that is likely to help them in municipal elections. BJP, which has 15-years of anti-incumbency, will have to work hard to retain its upper and middle-class vote bank,” Aeijaz said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid-impact-on-migrants-may-be-key-delhi-civic-body-poll-issue-101635257657204.html

26-10-2021||Pune||Mula-Mutha project: after 5 years, estimated riverfront development project cost now ₹4,727 crore||PUNE: The general body meeting of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) gave its nod to the ambitious Mula-Mutha riverfront development project late night Monday after a hard-hitting discussion. The PMC initiated the project five years ago and the estimated total project cost at the time was ₹2,619 core. Now however, the project cost has gone up to ₹4,727 crore.The project will be executed in 11 stretches; during the first three years, the PMC will spend ₹700 crore on the first few stretches after which the project will be implemented as a public-private partnership (PPP). Srinivas Bonala, chief engineer of the projects department said, “The general body has sanctioned a proposal to execute the riverfront project. At present, we are making estimates of stretches that will be tabled before the standing committee and general body for approval. The actual work will start thereafter.”Congress leader Aba Bagul suggested implementing the project as a PPP and the same was accepted during the monthly general body meeting. Last week, the project was approved by the standing committee without much discussion following which concerns were raised over the irrigation department having clearly said that the PMC does not have the right to change the flood lines. The PMC however is changing the flood lines and creating land in the river. They are even planning to sell the government-owned 180 acre land around the river.The riverfront project will require 768 hectare land wherein gardens, jogging tracks and recreational areas will be built along the river. The project has already been cleared by the state government and environmental clearance has also been received. The state government has given its approval to the formation of a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for the project, and the PMC is working on the around 7 km first stretch from Sangamwadi (Engineering college) to Mundhwa.The Pune river development project involves building embankments for flood protection where low-lying areas along the river will be protected from flooding by building a variety of well-modulated embankments along Pune’s rivers. It also involves reducing the impact of indiscriminately built obstructions such as bridges and causeways on the water flow in Pune’s rivers.The project includes:• Building embankments for flood protection• Reducing the impact of man-made obstructions on the water flow of rivers• Creating a public realm along the river• Curbing pollution by drainage and sewage treatment works• Enhancing connectivity• Integrating the river into city life||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mulamutha-project-after-5-years-estimated-riverfront-development-project-cost-now-4-727-crore-101635257115227.html
26-10-2021||Mumbai||Rajasthan man becomes 3rd recipient in Mumbai to undergo hand transplant||On Monday morning, physiotherapists and nurses at Global Hospital in south Mumbai’s Parel area, helped 22-year-old Jagdev Singh stand on his prosthetic legs for nearly 12 minutes. Singh, a quadruple amputee, underwent a bilateral hand transplant procedure on October 15 and is now slowly recovering. It is a dual challenge for Singh – in addition to the recovery of his transplanted hands, he has to gradually learn to balance the weight and walk on his prosthesis.“His main challenge will be to balance the centre of gravity of the body,” said Dr Nilesh Satbhai, the plastic surgeon who led the hand transplant team that operated on Singh.“There is nearly 10-15kg of weight added to his body with the transplanted hands, the plasters and the bulky dressing. We have already started his chest rehabilitation, and will slowly move to build the core strength of his body,” said the surgeon who had also carried out Mumbai’s first hand transplant on train accident victim Monika More last August. The city’s second such procedure was conducted at the civic-run King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital. Singh, who hails from Rajasthan, is Mumbai’s third hand transplant recipient.Hands transplants are often termed as medical miracles, and can be transformative for double amputees. But the procedure is complex – a hand donation is hard to come by and the outcomes of the surgery are prolonged due to the extremely slow process of nerve recovery.“Every step involved in the hand transplantation – from the time of harvesting the limb from a brain dead donor to attaching it to the recipient – the process requires absolute precision,” said Dr Satbhai.The complexity of the surgery varies with the level of the amputation. Choosing the right candidate for a hand transplant is therefore crucial. A pre-operative assessment and work-up of an amputee involve x-ray, MRI, CT scan, angiography, cardiac and psychiatric analysis among other evaluations. The team of medical experts including the plastic surgeon, orthopaedic surgeon, vascular surgeon and others assess the amputation, the level of injury and the point at which healthy muscles are available. This assessment plan speeds up the procedure when a hand donation comes by.When a family of a brain-dead patient gives consent for a donation, and compatibility is ascertained, a team of doctors first harvest the hands, making way for other teams to harvest the internal organs. A University of Wisconsin solution, known as the UW Solution, is infused through the arteries of the hands in order to cool and preserve the tissues. Given the limited time available, surgeons harvest the hands at a slightly higher level than required.The hands are then wrapped using a ‘triple bag method’ – first in two bags and then in an ice-cold saline bag. At no point should the hands come in contact with water or ice as that can lead to tissue damage. Once harvested, the hands must have blood circulation restored within eight hours.Multiple teams working at the same time ensure that all the structures, including the arteries, veins, nerves, tendons etc, are identified in the donor hands as well as the recipient who is prepared for the surgery.“It takes a lot of coordination and large medical teams to conduct hand transplant procedures,” said Dr K Subramania Iyer, who carried out India’s first hand transplant in 2015 at Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences in Kochi. The transplantation procedure goes on for nearly 10-12 hours and sometimes more.“It takes about a year for the hand transplant patient to become independent,” said Dr Iyer, adding that full functionality depends on the level of the amputation. “The higher the level of amputation, the more time it takes in recovery,” he said.While there is no national registry of hand transplants, an estimated 18 such procedures have been carried out in the country. According to Dr Iyer, despite the surgical complexity, the biggest challenge in hand transplants is to get a donation.“Unlike internal organs such as kidneys, liver or heart, hand donation is a mutilating procedure and therefore, it becomes difficult for families to agree for it. As far as the surgery is concerned, we have gathered quite a bit of experience with more centres catching up,” he said.‘Hand transplant brought my life back’In March 2013, Kochi resident Manu TR, then a 28-year-old event manager, was on his way to a temple in Kollur, Karnataka, when he noticed some goons harassing a woman. When Manu intervened, he was pushed out of the train. He suffered severe injuries and both his hands were crushed in the incident. “I thought my life was over,” said Manu, who became India’s first bilateral hand transplant patient in January 2015 at Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences in Kochi. “Four days after the transplant, when I noticed some movement in my fingers, it felt like I had been given my life back,” he said. A year after his surgery, he was employed at the same medical institute as a counselling assistant for organ transplants. He married a nurse from the hospital and is now a father of two – an eight-month-old girl and a four-year-old boy. “The recovery was a slow process. By the third week, I was slowly eating with my hands and some support. In four months, I was able to use a pen and pencil to scribble. After eight months, I was able to do almost everything, I even worked on my farm,” he recalled.History of transplant•The first ever hand transplant in the world was attempted in 1964 at Ecuador. This transplant was performed without the availability of modern immunosuppression and the hand was rejected in two weeks•The world’s first successful hand transplant was carried out in Lyon, France in 1998. The recipient, however, faced rejection of the transplanted limb and he had to eventually undergo a graft removal procedure after two years•The first hand transplant in the US was carried out in 1999 by a team of doctors from Kleinert Institute in Louisville, Kentucky•India’s first hand transplant was carried out on January 13, 2015, at the Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences in Kochi•Globally, an estimated 200 hand transplants have been carried out. India has done about 18 such procedures, three of them in MumbaiAnatomy of human hand•Brachial artery: Main artery of the upper limb that runs through the arm till the elbow level. The artery divides in the proximal forearm into two main branches –radial and ulnar•3 main nerves: Median, ulnar and radial nerves control the sensory and motor functions of hands•27 bones•Multiple muscles and tendons•Multiple superficial veins and nervesTransplant procedure•Detailed preoperative assessment and planning•Dissection and preparation of donor and recipient hands as per the requirement and level of amputation.Step 1: Fixing bones with help of metal plates, screwsStep 2: Arteries are hollow tube-like structures that deliver oxygenated blood from the heart to the tissues. Veins are also hollow tubes, but thinner and more fragile than the arteries. They carry the deoxygenated blood from the tissues towards the heart. Attaching the arteries and veins restores the blood circulation to the transplanted limb. The procedure is carried out under a microscope, and the suturing is done with the use of micro-sutures, which are thinner than a strand of hair.Step 3: The muscle mass and tendons are then repaired with the help of strong sutures. Tension adjustment is crucial during this process for optimal hand function. Doctors describe this as achieving the ‘normal finger cascade’ or the natural alignment of fingers when the hand is at complete rest. Perfect nerve repair is vital to ensure the motor and sensory function as the patient recovers.Step 4: Suturing of the skinPost-transplantation care•Doctors monitor any signs of rejection of the transplanted limb, for example, rashes or boil on the skin of the transplanted hand•Biopsies are conducted at regular intervals and doctors monitor if the patient’s antibodies are activated to fight against the donor hand, which the body may identify as a foreign object•Most rejection reactions are controlled by adjusting medications. But in case of hyperacute rejection, the graft may have to be removed as it can cause a threat to a recipient’s life•Doctors assess the transplant in terms of immediate and delayed outcomes•Immediate outcomes may include vascular patency or normal blood flow through the graft, hair and nail growth etc•Delayed outcomes depend on the recovery of the nerves. Nerve recovery starts after three-four weeks of the transplant. Typically, the nerve recovery happens at the speed of one millimetre per day. This is why the functional recovery of the transplanted hands can take six months to one year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/22yearold-rajasthan-man-becomes-third-recipient-in-mumbai-to-undergo-hand-transplant-101635256995334.html

26-10-2021||Chandigarh||Go with the flow, trust the course but stay attuned||It’s often advocated to go with the flow. Events such as graduation, job, marriage and arrival of children are blessings. As we proceed on these, roadblocks come in the way, affecting the flow, and sometimes forcing one to proactively chart one’s own path. However, going with the flow does help. It’s most often worthwhile to trust the course of life. Also, it is to be realised that children have an innate sense of right from wrong, which makes it sensible to let them be instead of perpetually trying to change them. There is an incident narrated by my mother in this context that has left an imprint on my mind. When my mother was eight years old, an elderly woman on the street used to lie down in the courtyard of any random household. Someone or the other would bring her food. Her husband was no more, and her two sons had abandoned her. Once, my mother had gone to a far-off market for buying some items. She spotted the woman, who waved at her. When my mother went up to her, presuming she needed assistance, the woman grabbed hold of her hand and started asking around for alms! At that age also, my mother could sense that this was uncalled for behaviour and somehow escaped from her clutches. Another narrative is when I was pursuing my undergraduate degree in psychology, and had once interviewed a favourite professor for a project. She told me about a couple who had a girl child. The girl was born with a deformity in both the thumbs. However, as she grew up, she could manage all her tasks using the hands in a different yet effective way. The parents, though, got her operated. The surgery corrected her thumbs but hampered their functionality as by that time she had become so adapted and accustomed to using her thumbs-with-deformity, that her new thumbs were useless to her. She didn’t know what to do with them! This is not to undermine the value of taking timely action, of being preventive instead of being curative, and to work towards solutions; but to know whether and when to do these, calls for both intuitive and pragmatic wisdom. Generally, life will give enough hints and indications in this direction. Consistent gauging, too, comes in handy. To shout, in a way, is also to go against the flow. Plus, whenever one shouts, it’s usually because of his/her own hurt. We feel we deserve more, that life has been unfair, or that we are elder/superior. However, in our constantly changing world, no one is entitled. Even if something is wrong, shouting mutes the message we intend to give. It’s always better to stay calm, and deliver or convey the message politely later on. It’s bound to have a better effect. Especially with parents, this is often the case. For instance, I once read that a kid is more likely to say, ‘Please play with me’ instead of, ‘I had a bad day’. But indeed, mindfulness and attunement are essential to be able to read such messages given by life. The best way to live life is to flow with it; accepting what is, making sincere efforts to repair whatever needs fixing and trusting the process, as said by Avis Viswanathan, the life coach, author and speaker. I’ll take the liberty to add that a basic consciousness, while taking life as it comes, also goes a long way. reemaban@gmail.com The writer is a Jagadhri-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/go-with-the-flow-trust-the-course-but-stay-attuned-101635255915402.html

There were no casualties but 15 families were evacuated as a precautionary measure by the fire department and disaster management team.“At around 4.45am, a fire broke out in the fifth floor of Ascona Building in Raheja Gardens. The cause of the fire is still unknown. Cooling operations continued till 10am. We have evacuated around 15 families staying in the adjacent floors,” said a fire officer.DK Soman, a well-known astrologer and who stays on the same floor but in a connecting block, said, “Our society fire security alarms woke us up early on Tuesday morning. There were flames erupting from flat No. 503 and the society security immediately alerted the fire brigade and helped the residents of that particular flat to evacuate. The fire brigade arrived within minutes and started dousing the fire. As a precautionary measure, other families were also asked to evacuate.”Soman and his wife are in their 80s and as the situation was under control, they were asked not to evacuate. “It would have been difficult to climb down so many floors for senior citizens and as we had started dousing the fire, we asked them to remain indoors. Although residing on the same floor, they were in a separate block, hence were safe,” said a fire officer who was on site.According to residents, it was a short circuit in the air-conditioning unit in the bedroom of the Barve family that caused the fire. “The Barve family recently lost a family member due to Covid and the fire has occurred today morning, leaving the entire bedroom charred,” said another resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fire-breaks-out-in-residential-building-of-raheja-gardens-in-thane-101635255135260.html
26-10-2021||Mumbai||‘Keep me away from this’: Aryan Khan’s lawyer to HC on Nawab Malik vs Wankhede||MUMBAI: Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi on Tuesday argued Aryan Khan’s bail application before the Bombay high court claiming that the 23-year-old son of actor Shah Rukh Khan was arrested wrongly by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), as there was no recovery and no material to suggest consumption. Rohatgi submitted that Aryan, who has done graduation from California and returned since Covid started, was not a customer on the cruise, he was invited as a guest by one Prateek Gaba, who knew the organisers. There is no recovery from him and no medical examination was conducted to show that the 23-year-old had consumed drugs and therefore, there was no occasion to arrest him, said the senior advocate. “No recovery, no consumption, I submit I am wrongly arrested,” he added.Referring to the NCB’s claim that 6gm charas said to have been recovered from Aryan’s friend Arbaaz Merchant was meant for the consumption by both of them, and therefore Aryan was also in conscious possession of the contraband material, the senior advocate said, what somebody else is having in his shoes can’t be conscious possession. “They will have to prove that I knew about it,” he stressed.He pointed out that the statements recorded by NCB officers under section 67 of the NDPS Act are not admissible in evidence. Besides, he said, six grams is a small quantity and even if it is assumed for the sake of argument that there was conscious possession, the maximum punishment is just up to one year.Referring to the NCB referring to WhatsApp chats involving Aryan Khan, Mukul Rohatgi said these chats relate to 2018, 2019, 2020 and were not regarding the cruise party which started on October 2.“These WhatsApp chats have nothing to do with the incident. Those are earlier chats, when I (Aryan) was abroad and on the basis of which they are claiming that I (Aryan) was dealing with people, they suspect to be international traffickers,” said Rohatgi. He added that Aryan is a young boy with no antecedents. Law provides that in case of consumption, one has to be taken to rehabilitation. “Approach is not to keep people in jails, the (Union) social justice ministry is talking about reforms,” he added. The senior advocate maintained that the 23-year-old was not concerned with other accused arrested by NCB on charges of possessing intermediate quantity of drugs. “There is no meeting of minds,” he said as regards the charge of conspiracy levelled by NCB against the accused, including Aryan. As regards the simmering controversy over the purported revelations made by Prabhakar Sail, a panch witness in the case, Rohatgi said Aryan was not concerned with the affidavit. “I have no complaint against any NCB Officer. I am not concerned with the panch witness,” said the senior advocate, urging the court to keep the 23-year-old out of the controversy.“Kindly keep me away from me this. I don’t want to go with either the political personality or the NCB officers. They (NCB) are concentrating on Pooja (Shah Rukh Khan’s manager Pooja Dadlani) and trying to rub it on me. This unsavoury controversy between political leaders and NCB officials cannot be rubbed on me.”Rohatgi, a former attorney general, said the NCB was claiming to have arrested one Aachit Kumar, purportedly on the basis of statements given by Aryan and Arbaaz and has seized 2.6 gms of marijuana from him. The agency, however, did not seek his custody after October 9, he added. He pointed out that Aachit Kumar himself is a young boy and a college student. Aryan has communicated/chatted with him about online Poker. “They (NCB) are using it (to connect Aryan with drug dealing). The communications are 14 months old and are about online gaming. He maintained that these chats are irrelevant and you cannot keep somebody in jail for days together. Immediately after Rohatgi completed his arguments, a lawyer sought to intervene, complaining about the purported preferential treatment given to Aryan Khan for hearing his bail plea.“I am supporting the prosecution, but have an objection that privileges are given to such bunch of petition,” said advocate Subhash Jha. “This is the concern of the bar as well. People are languishing in jails, but preference is given to such petitions,” he added.Justice Sambre responded to the contentions saying he finishes his board and then take up such matters (requiring lengthy hearings). “Everybody is given circulation and is heard in my court,” said the judge. The court has now posted the bail applications of Arbaaz Khan and Munmun Dhamecha, also arrested in the cruise drug bust case, for hearing on Wednesday. A team of NCB officials, headed by the agency’s Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede, on October 2 searched passengers slated to take the cruise ship to Goa from the International Cruise Terminal at Green Gate in Mumbai and their rooms booked on the cruise ship. During the search, the agency claimed to have seized multiple drugs such as 13 grams of cocaine, 5 grams of mephedrone, 21 grams of charas, 22 pills of MDMA (ecstasy), and Rs. 1.33 lakh in cash.In all, NCB officials intercepted 14 people and after hours of interrogation placed 23-year-old Aryan, Arbaaz, 26, and Dhamecha, 28, under arrest on October 3 afternoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mukul-rohatgi-rebuts-ncb-to-seek-bail-for-aryan-khan-says-was-wrongly-arrested-101635255015152.html

26-10-2021||Mumbai||Colleges to upgrade infrastructure, conduct sanitisation, set up WiFi facilities, roster of vaccinated students and staff||Less than a week before officially closing for Diwali break, many colleges are busy setting up or upgrading their infrastructure to accommodate hybrid classes once classrooms reopen in the third week of November. Sanitisation and social distancing rules have, however, been implemented on campus.“Our teachers are proctoring online exams for second-year students at present, while they are also conducting classes at the same time because we had to restart physical classes as per the government orders. We are looking ahead and preparing for more students to join classes post-Diwali break,” said Marie Fernandes, principal of St Andrew’s College, Bandra. At her college, classes have begun but to a low student turnout. Many colleges are expecting to see a higher number of students attending lectures post-holidays and are prepping accordingly.“For hybrid classrooms, we will need WiFi across the campus so that the same lecture taught by a teacher in the classroom is relayed to students sitting at home as well. We are ensuring the infrastructure is in place, but are unsure of how many students will attend regular lectures,” she added.In the second week of October, minister for state higher and technical education Uday Samant announced the reopening of colleges starting October 20 only for fully vaccinated staff and students. In a statement made on October 13, Samant suggested that colleges should continue online classes for students who are not yet fully vaccinated.Most colleges on October 20, the first day of college reopening, wore a deserted look. While undergraduate students are currently appearing for online exams, postgraduate students could not attend lectures either because they are not fully vaccinated or because they are currently attending lectures from different cities and states in the country. “Unless the government makes it compulsory for students to physically attend colleges, a majority will pick online classes. Colleges are helpless and even if five students show up for physical lectures, we will have to continue hybrid lectures,” said the principal of a south Mumbai college. He added that they are still waiting for consent forms from nearly 85% of students who have not yet agreed to attend physical classes and have instead chosen online lectures.“Other than students, we also need to make sure our teaching and non-teaching staff is vaccinated. We have, therefore, started collecting data to understand how many of them are fully vaccinated and by when will the rest complete their second dose,” said Naresh Chandra, principal of Birla College, Kalyan. “We can run the institute smoothly only once the full strength of staff is in place.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/colleges-to-upgrade-infrastructure-conduct-sanitisation-set-up-wifi-facilities-roster-of-vaccinated-students-and-staff-101635252195143.html

26-10-2021||Mumbai||Nawab Malik’s allegations baseless, made to humiliate me, kin: Sameer Wankhede||The allegations of forgery made by NCP leader Nawab Malik are baseless and made with the sole intention to humiliate him and his family, Sameer Wankhede, Mumbai Zonal Director of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has said. “The allegations made by Nawab Malik are baseless and are made solely to humiliate me and my family, and to divert my attention from the investigation (into the drug case involving actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan),” he said while responding to the allegations. Wankhede also released caste certificates of several of his family members, including his father, uncles and first cousins, showing that all of them belong to Mahar, a Scheduled Caste. Malik on Monday accused the Indian Revenue Service officer of using a fake caste certificate to get a government job under reserved quota. Malik claimed that Wankhede is a Muslim but made a caste certificate by forgery and got a government job under the Scheduled Caste (SC) category. The NCP leader also tweeted a copy of a birth certificate, which he claimed to be that of Wankhede and showed his father’s name as “Dawood K Wankhede”. The NCP leader had earlier said that Dnyandev Wankhede converted to Islam before marrying Zahera Bano years ago. The couple had two children, one being Sameer. “They were brought up as Muslim. Sameer Wankhede had a nikah (marriage as per Islamic law) in 2006 with a girl. However, since his father comes from a Schedule Caste (SC) Hindu family, he got a job under the reserved quota, he also made a SC caste certificate and got a job as IRS (Indian Revenue Service) under reserved quota,” Malik said. The NCP leader said that Wankhede is a Muslim but got a government job on the basis of a fake SC certificate by hiding his original religion. “Forgery by Sameer Dawood Wankhede started from here. The officer, who started his career with forgery, will never work with honesty,” Malik said. In a written statement, Wankhede denied the allegations and stated that publishing his personal documents on twitter was defamatory in nature and unnecessary invasion of the privacy of his family. In the statement, he clarified that his father’s full name is Dnyandev Kachruji Wankhede, a Hindu and his mother was late Zaheeda and was a Muslim. “I belong to a composite multi-religious and secular family and I am proud of my heritage,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nawab-malik-s-allegations-baseless-made-to-humiliate-me-kin-sameer-wankhede-101635247156019.html

26-10-2021||Mumbai||Rehab, not jail: Mukul Rohatgi cites Centre's reform plans in Aryan's bail plea||Former attorney general of India, Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan’s son’s jailed son Aryan in the drugs seizure case, said on Tuesday the junior Khan was not a customer on the Goa-bound cruise from where the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) caught him following a raid and that he was only invited as a guest.Arguing before Justice Nitin Sambre in the Bombay High court, Rohatgi said there was no recovery of drugs from Aryan, nor any medical test conducted or consumption of drugs found -- hence, there was no occasion to arrest his client.“No recovery, no consumption, I submit I am wrongly arrested," the former AG said on behalf of the star-son, adding there was no material to show that Aryan financed illicit trafficking of drugs.“Penalty is for consumption or carrying it. I don't have it, possession of somebody else can't be my possession. Unless it is in my knowledge.”Citing the Central government's plans to bring in reform measures, the veteran lawyer further argued that Aryan being a young boy, he should be sent for rehabilitation and not put behind bars.“He is a young boy with no (criminal) antecedents. The law provides that if someone is found consuming drugs, one has to be taken to rehab. Approach is not to keep people in jails. The social justice ministry is talking about reforms,” the former AG argued.Rohatgi said controversy was rebounding Aryan Khan and urged that he be kept away from the same. He further said Aryan had no allegation against any NCB officer or had nothing to do with any political personality.“Controversy is rebounding on on me. Kindly keep me away from me this. I have a great great case to argue. I don't want to go with the political personality or the NCB officers. I am concerned with my case,” the veteran lawyer said.“I am not concerned with a lot of accused arrested in the case from whom intermediate quantity is seized. There is no meeting of minds.”The former AG and team of senior lawyers flew down to the country's financial capital on Tuesday to join an already massive group of legal eyes, including  Amit Desai and senior advocate Satish Manshinde.Rohatgi said that Aryan was a 23-year-old boy having completed his graduation in California and returning to the country since the Covid-19 pandemic hit.“Aryan was not a customer on the cruise, he was invited as a guest. Aryan was invited by a man called as Gaba, who knew the organisers,” he further said.Also read | As NCB continues to oppose Aryan's bail plea, his lawyers file counter affidavitStating that the submission made before the NDPS were inadmissible, Rohatgi said, "What somebody is having in his shoes can't be a conscious possession. They have to prove that I knew about it."The senior lawyer said the NCB's statement that they had recovered WhatsApp chats from Aryan's phone for years 2018, 2019, 2020, but none were regarding the said cruise party. “It is important to note they are not regarding the cruise party which started on October 2,” he said.“Whatsapp chats has nothing to do with the cruise terminal incident. It refers to earlier chats from which they are saying you know, you were dealing with people. When I was abroad also, they are connecting it with international traffickers. Trial court will decide if they are admissible or not,” Rohatgi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-recovery-no-consumption-mukul-rohatgi-says-aryan-khan-wrongly-arrested-101635246294922.html
26-10-2021||Pune||In my opinion: Anonymous call for rescue must not be lost in Aryan Khan drug case||The gold standard for pop-cultural references remains the mega-buster, Game of Thrones.Pop cultural references are a writer’s currency saver, allowing the cited reference to save the spending of 200 words on setting the mood, context or visual drama. Just write “Game of Thrones”, allow a second or two for the reader’s imagination to sketch it out, and then, deliver what the writer hopes will be the killer blow.Television’s next Game of Thrones can easily be the Aryan Khan drugs’ case. (Scriptwriters remember, you heard it here first).As the plot unfolds and then folds again on top of all that is believed to have been revealed, only to unfold further – like a kind of never-ending rendition of a pasta dough – the promise of “solved!” “At last!” “Thank God!” “The End”, keeps TRPs buzzing, column centimetres filled and social media hashtags on a never-ending loop of funny punch lines and smarter counter-punch memes.Amidst all the noise the real issues that the words “narcotics” and “addiction” might allow to surface are likely to be drowned out.Narcotic addiction, like alcohol, or any other “definer” you might pick as the addiction factor destroying a human being’s life (sex, food, gambling), is a real-life, real-time social issue that can ill afford luxuries like politicisation, criminal intent, rule of law or bail pleas.People die. Every day.This is not to undermine or downplay the importance of law and order or the due legal process involved when the law is broken. By all means, let the hammer fall.The fear is the hammer is banging away and drowning out what may be cries for help.For an addict there is help. Today. Right now. Here in Pune. In whatever deadly or depraved situation s/he finds her/himself in. There is help. A solution and design for living that works.Aryan Khan might now be the face of the “narcotics and youth” dinner-table discussion at least till the end of the year, but on the streets of Pune, or in one of the reopened nightclubs of Pune or at a hotel room rented for the party just for one night – an addict might have taken the “first hit” on the road to destruction, or possibly, “the toke” that could be his/her last.Twelve-step programmes as the one-day-at-a-time solution to addictions have been around since 1935. By that measure the 12-step programme has met the scientific rigour of testing.It has worked for over 75 years, in different time zones, cultures, languages, peoples, and beliefs. As an experiment goes, it has run the gauntlet and proved, “it works!”In no way, shape or form do the 12-step “de-addiction” programmes claim exclusivity or “being the only answer” to heal addiction.Science continues to push for that boundary-defining breakthrough where physical addiction can be altered by popping a pill or tweaking a gene.The 12-step programmes have more than their fair share of critiques; generally wherever a “higher power” is involved that is more than likely to happen.The answer for an alcoholic, a drug addict, a sex addict, a gambling addict, a food addict, a shopping addict… the list goes on, is there is a programme that works and the only reason for the existence of these programmes is to help you.Narcotics Anonymous (NA). The “anonymous” word is, as the textbook of the 12-step programmes, colloquially referred to as the “Big Book” explains it, the “spiritual foundation of all its principles”.Anonymity is key to the recovery programme. Like a cloak of protection. Protection from? Pride to begin with. But also, in the case of many global superstars who are members of 12-step groups, protection from the vagaries of publicity and the distraction of fame.Anonymity is not to be confused with secrecy or some sort of underground cult. Anonymity is a spiritual principle employed in all 12-step groups.Addiction kills. The 12-step programme saves lives. What is at stake here is much, much more important than the self-indulgent coefficient of “serves them right”, that cases like Aryan Khan’s expose.The arguments for decriminalising small quantities of possession deemed as “for personal use” are growing stronger. Holland and Portugal are the countries to google if you want a quick reference point in terms of the effect of decriminalising possession of narcotics for personal use.Every day a new Game-of-Thrones-type twist in the Aryan Khan script emerges.What must not be lost in all the “hungama” is that for the addict, there is a real help. A real answer. A programme for living that works, and has worked in Pune for hundreds of addicts and alcoholics, thousands across India and in the world, the numbers run into the millions.Twelve steps. One step at a time. One day at a time.At its core, the Narcotics Anonymous programme is one drug addict working with another drug addict each helping the other to stay clean and sober.Are you an addict? Or an alcoholic?If you have heard any person in your immediate circle – family or friends or at work – use the phrases, “drinking problem”, “substance abuse”, “always stoned”, “never there”… it is time to find out. Even if it has, just for a fleeting moment, crossed your own mind, it is time to find out.Aryan Khan found out the hard way. No matter who, where, or how big or cool (or small) you are, if addiction finds you or the other way around, it will destroy you.As a recovered alcoholic and/or drug addict will testify, anonymously if it is in public, there is an answer.In Pune to get in touch withNarcotics Anonymous call – +919673606686Alcoholics Anonymous call 1800 345 1500||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/in-my-opinion-anonymous-call-for-rescue-must-not-be-lost-in-aryan-khan-drug-case-101635245296168.html

He also claimed Wankhede engaged two private persons to tap phones of the people to frame them.Malik, who tweeted a copy of the four-page letter listing the 26 cases, said he has sent it to the NCB chief requesting him to look into the contents as part of the probe started by the agency’s vigilance department against Sameer Wankhede.NCB started probing on Monday allegations that Wankhede was part of a ₹25 crore extortion racket after the arrest of actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son, Aryan Khan, in a drug raid.There was no immediate response from Sameer Wankhede to NCP politician and Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik’s fresh claims.

The letter claims NCB allegedly planted drugs shown to have been seized in some of the cases.“The contents of the letter are very serious in nature and need thorough investigation. Since NCB has already started a probe against Wankhede, I will request...NCB (chief) to make the letter part of their investigation.”He said Wankhede was illegally intercepting the phones of some people with the help of two private people in Mumbai and Thane. “My fight is against injustice and not against NCB. I welcome the investigation started against Wankhede.”On Monday, Malik claimed Wankhede is a Muslim but made a Hindu caste certificate by forgery to get into the Indian Revenue Service (IRS) under the Scheduled Caste category.

The document shows his father’s name is Dawood K Wankhede while it is Dnyandev Wankhede as per the NCB website.Malik said a complaint will be filed in the alleged fake caste certificate case. “Many Dalit activists and organisations are in touch with me.

Do tune in,” Singh’s media adviser Raveen Thukral tweeted on Tuesday morning, extending an invite to the media. Capt Amarinder Singh was camping in Delhi last week and held detailed consultations with his supporters in the Congress. A week ago, he said that he planned to soon announce the launch of his political party and was hopeful of a seat arrangement with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) if the farmers’ issue was resolved. Though there is talk of his mediation between the central government and the farmers, the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) has denied being part of any such effort. Capt Amarinder Singh resigned as the Punjab chief minister on September 18 after a bitter tussle with state Congress chief and former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu amid infighting in the state party unit. The Congress later picked Charanjit Singh Channi as the chief minister. A big mistake, says deputy CM Randhawa Deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who had rebelled against Capt Amarinder and has been targeting him over his friendship with Pakistani journalist Aroosa Alam, said that no one can be stopped from charting his own political course, to stay in the party (Congress) or leave it. “Whether he is doing it because the BJP has asked him to or of his own accord, it will be a big mistake,” Randhawa said. He said the former CM’s exit will not dent the Congress in any way. “If he had so much sway, then he would have continued as CM,” the deputy chief minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-amarinder-likely-to-launch-punjab-lok-congress-tomorrow-101635242835324.html

The gangster, who faces 21 cases of murder, attempt to murder, dacoity, robbery and extortion in Haryana and Rajasthan was presented before the Narnaul additional district and sessions judge Sudhir Jeevan under tight security around noon. The judge sentenced him to life and fined him ₹10,000. Also read: Mufti links Pak T20 win against India with J&K status, Vij says DNA ‘defective’Ajay Choudhary, the lawyer appearing for victim Bimla Devi, said the court had convicted Gujjar on Monday. “I had sought death penalty but the court gave him life term. We respect the decision of the court. The forensic report of Bimla’s death confirms 23 bullet wounds,” he said. Gangster had killed woman’s son, father, too Gujjar is also accused of killing Bimla’s son Sandeep Fouji and her father, Sri Ram, in 2015 besides Bimla’s brother Mahesh in 2014, but the court acquitted him in the 2014 case due to lack of evidence. The gangster was brought to the Narnaul jail in Mahendragarh district of Haryana from Rajasthan’s high-security jail in Ajmer on September 29. The murder of Bimla Devi dates back to August 21, 2015, when assailants, led by Gujjar, shot her dead when she refused to a compromise in connection with the murder of her brother Mahesh and son Sandeep Fauji. Gujjar and his accomplices were booked under Sections 148, 149, 302 and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Arms Act for Bimla’s murder. The court acquitted six others in the case due to lack of evidence on April 12, 2018. Avenged the killing of his mentor Gujjar entered the world of crime in 2014. He wanted to be a wrestler and had started training under Shakti Gurjar, who later became his mentor. His mentor had a rivalry with Sandeep Fauji and the latter had given a contract for Gujjar’s mentor’s killing to one Surender. He had been killed on February 4, 2014. “Shakti Gurjar’s brother-in-law had asked Gujjar to avenge his mentor’s elimination by Sandeep Fauji. Gujjar joined a gang in 2014 and attacked Fauji’s mother, Bimla Devi, in March 2014 after barging into her house. Both her legs were broken,” a police spokesman said. “Her father Sri Ram and brother Mahesh had come from their native village of Biharipuri to take her to hospital. Ram boarded the ambulance, while Mahesh was on a motorcycle. He was killed on the way to the hospital. Gujjar’s name figured in the case but he was acquitted for want of evidence,” he said. He killed Sandeep, who had been arrested for Gurjar’s murder in January 2015, outside Narnaul court when he had come for securing bail. In August, the gangster killed Bimla. Three months later, he killed Sri Ram as well as he was witness to Bimla’s murder. Gangster’s accomplices kill policeman The gangster was arrested by the Mahendragarh police for four murders on February 12, 2016. His accomplices had fired at the police when he was being taken to a Narnaul court on September 5, 2017, killing a policeman. He managed to escape from police custody, but his brother Mintu was arrested and remains in jail. Rajasthan Police arrested him this year A special emergency response team of the Rajasthan Police arrested the dreaded gangster from a house at Kolhapur in Maharashtra in January this year. His arrest had come one-and-a-half years after he had escaped following a jailbreak amid police firing from Rajasthan’s Behror police station where he was being held in Alwar district. His accomplices, armed with AK-47 rifles, had freed him from Behror police station. A team of 26 policemen, including commandos of the Rajasthan Police, had arrested him along with a woman friend. On September 6, 2019, Gujjar was arrested by the Rajasthan Police from the Delhi-Jaipur highway, but he had hoodwinked the police by identifying himself as Sahil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-gangster-papla-gujjar-gets-life-term-for-brutal-murder-of-rival-s-mother-101635239954358.html

26-10-2021||Patna||Congress will go back to Lalu after Bihar bypolls: Sushil Modi||Former Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi on Tuesday termed the alleged rift between the Congress and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) in the state as “fake”. Modi claimed the fight between the Congress and the RJD is just a show and both the parties will unite on the last day of the upcoming assembly bypolls in the state.“Once the bypoll ends; wagging its tail, Congress will go back to Lalu...The two can't be separated, just pretending to cut NDA's votes... In the assembly polls people voted for the NDA not the RJD... This time too the NDA will win the bypolls with majority...,” news agency ANI quoted Sushil Modi as saying.Also read: Nitish says for us Bihar is family, for others family everythingModi also attacked RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav, asserting why would people listen to a leader who can't even control his own sons, pointing to the apparent power struggle between Tejashwi Yadav and Tej Pratap.The remarks by the BJP leader came a day after Tejashwi Yadav attacked Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar over "poor health facilities" in the state. He alleged that the bypolls are being conducted because the chief minister could not provide proper medical treatment to the MLAs of his own party.“In the NITI Aayog report, Bihar is the worst-performing state in Health. These by-elections are happening because CM Nitish Kumar's government didn't provide treatment even to their MLAs. So on what basis will Nitish Kumar ask for votes from the public,” Yadav told reporters, according to news agency ANI.There have been reports of fissures in the opposition Grand Alliance in Bihar. Lalu Prasad Yadav said that the RJD's candidates would lose their deposit in the elections if they remain in alliance with the Congress in the state ahead of the bypolls in two assembly constituencies, straining the relationship between the two parties. Meanwhile, Congress also fielded candidates for the two seats after the RJD announced its decision to contest the two seats, widening the rift between the two parties.Bypolls are slated to be held on the Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan seats on October 30, following the demise of the sitting MLAs, both from the JD(U).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/congress-will-go-back-to-lalu-after-bihar-bypolls-sushil-modi-101635224867211.html
26-10-2021||Patna||Bihar bye-elections: Ruling JD(U), main Opposition RJD gear up for intense fight||The ruling Janata Dal (United) and main Opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are gearing up for an intense contest in the October 30 bye-elections in Bihar for the two seats of Tarapur and Kushweshwar Asthan. Congress has also emerged as a key third player following cracks in the Opposition and a subsequent dispute in the allotment of seats. With a few days to go for the polls, campaigning for both the seats has been hectic, with both the JD(U) and RJD exchanging barbs on issues such as development, law and order and rising inflation. For the JD(U), the bye-elections are crucial as it had won both the seats in the 2020 assembly polls, and winning them this time will take the party’s tally of MLAs from 43 to 45. Defeat in any of the seats will be seen by many as an embarrassment for chief minister Nitish Kumar, who is running a government in alliance with the BJP, the HAM-S and the Vikashsheel Insaan Party (VIP) with a slender majority in the state assembly. The RJD, with 75 MLAs, is desperately seeking to win both the seats as such an outcome will send across a strong political message to its opponents of its mass support base in the two constituencies that have a high number of scheduled caste and OBC votes. The bye-poll’s outcome will also be significant for the RJD, given its rocky relations with the Congress, especially because RJD national president Lalu Prasad Yadav and son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav desperately want to win to justify their decision of denying the Kushweshwar Asthan seat to the grand old party.“For the RJD, winning the Kusheshwar Asthan seat is now a prestige issue to convey how the party has large support among Dalits and OBCs. If that does not happen, Congress would get a ready handle to accuse RJD of weaking secular forces,” said a senior leader of the Opposition grand alliance (GA), requesting not to be named. Also Read: Nitish says for us Bihar is family, for others family everythingChief minister Nitish Kumar, while holding his first election meeting at Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan, attacked the RJD, targeting the former ruling party by labelling its track record as “jungle raj”. It’s a widely used criticism of Lalu Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi’s 15-year spell at the helm of Bihar from 1990 to 2005.Nitish Kumar said people haven’t forgotten the state of law and order in Bihar before his government came to power in 2005. Nitish Kumar underlined his government’s development initiatives, speaking about roads and infrastructure also getting a boost, apart from law and order. He also spoke about women’s empowerment through reservation in panchayats and its impact. “You vote for me or not, I will continue to work for Bihar’s development,” he said at an election meeting. Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav has been steering his party’s campaign for the past one week in both the seats, especially travelling extensively in Kushweshwar Asthan. He accused Bihar’s CM of ignoring the general condition of roads in the last 16 years, apart from raising issues such as migration, unemployment and rising inflation as he slammed the ruling JD(U)-BJP led government. “I dare the chief minister to travel on road in the constituency. I am confident the experience will be back-breaking. The so-called development work by the Nitish Kumar government is all sham and people of Kushweshar Asthan are witness to it. The chief minister has only visited the constituency by helicoptrer,” Tejashwi said. The RJD is pinning its hopes on the charisma of RJD national president Lalu Prasad Yadav, who will address back to back rallies at Tarapur and Kushweshwar Asthan. Lalu Prasad, who is recuperating from an illness, returned to Patna on Sunday and took updates of election meetings held by his son and senior party leaders. Caste equations are expected to be the key in both the constituencies. The JD(U), supported by LJP leader and minister Pashupati Kumar Paras, is banking on Kushwahas and Vaisyas to clinch the Tarapur seat, while it is depending on upper-caste and Dalit votes in Kushweshwar Asthan. The RJD is banking on Yadav votes in Tarapur along with those of Muslims even as its decision to field a candidate from the “Musahar” community in Kushershar Asthan is seen as a strategic move aimed at getting a sizeable number of scheduled caste, OBC and Muslim votes. Poll observers feel the Congress, having fielded candidates from both the seats, is a challenge for the RJD and the JD(U) as it may cut into the voter base of both the parties. The polls will also be a test for LJP leader and Jamui MP Chirag Paswan, whose faction, the Lok Janshakti party (Ram Vilas), has fielded candidates in both the seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-bye-elections-ruling-jd-u-main-opposition-rjd-gear-up-for-intense-fight-101635233174352.html

26-10-2021||Delhi||Ghazipur mandi #flowerpower: Diwali achchi ban rahi hai iss saal, say sellers||New Delhi Rose, lily, mogra, marigold, orchid, chrysanthemum, carnation, glide or tuberose (rajnigandha) — you name it, and Delhi’s Ghazipur flower market has it! Known for its extraordinary variety of flowers, this wholesale market on the Capital’s outskirts usually gets fresh flower supply from almost every possible location within India and even abroad. But that changed a bit since Covid-19 hit the Capital. Today, flower isn’t coming in as much variety and not from everywhere, but still there’s lots to stock, in the market that’s operational on all days of the week. “Diwali ke time par khoob zyada bikri ho rahi hai. Diwali achi ban rahi hai. Idhar koi zyada response nahi hai mahamari ka. Aur yahan sabko teeka (Covid-19 vaccine) lag chuka hai,” says Dilip Kumar, a worker in one of the shops in the market, which supports over 400 licensed vendors — who make everything from wedding jaimalas (garlands) to bouquets. Eagerly waiting for the wedding season that begins from mid-November, and getting ready for the Diwali rush in the near future, Teg Singh Chaudhary, president, Ghazipur Flower Trade Center, informs, “Market is Covid compliant... The real rush starts as we get closer to Diwali and the wedding season. The prices depend on demand, and will increase a lot during the weddings. Flowers like orchids get imported, and we have to pay thrice the flight fare for them now (as compared to pre-Covid times). And local flowers like gerbera, carnation, rose, lily, glide, and genda (marigold) will see a price hike of 30-50%. So if the glide flower is being sold for ₹50 per bundle now, it can go up to ₹100 during peak demand.”Enter the market and the sight of ready bouquets and flower arrangements welcome the visitors, alongside a row of stalls selling garlands in flowers of all possible colours. Venture deeper into the mandi, and flower quantities get bulkier and deals, sweeter. “Karwa chauth se tezi aani shuru hui hai. Aur shaadi season mein saare type ke phool bikte hain, as they get used in the decorations,” says Liyaqat Ali, a vendor in the heart of the market. Rakesh Yadav, another vendors, adds, “Abhi bikri badh jayegi Diwali ke paas. Weddings will start from November 15 so mehenga rahega sab. Jaise purple daisy selling for ₹100 a bundle will be retailed for ₹200 in two-three weeks.” And Pintu, another flower seller in the mandi, also highlights the issue of low supply as he sprinkles water to freshen up his stock of flowers. “Imported flowers like tulip, orchid and portia, have been coming in neither required quantities, nor at desired cost prices.”Ruing how intimate wedding celebrations due to Covid-19 has reduced business opportunities for the florists, Vijay Pratap, a flower seller in the market, says, “Why would anyone decorate extensively when just 50 guests are allowed? Aaj ki shaadi 2019 ke sagai function se bhi chhoti hai. Of course it means there’s much less space for our flowers. Par iss saal market mein paisa lauta hai kyunki ab jo log ruke huye the badi shaadi karne ke liye, uske liye phoolon ki demand aa rahi hai.” Many like Pratap have kept their hands folded in prayers for the return of the Big Fat Indian Wedding, this season. And away from these worries can be spotted some older women and young girls plucking petals out of flowers such as roses and pink oleander (kaner), which are used to stitch together garlands for weddings and other occasions. Sonam, one of the young girls, sits plucking petals with other women folk who are on duty here everyday from 4am to 11am. She explains, “Phoolon ki pattiyon se mala banti hain. These are also for weddings, flower showers, and even shraddhanjali to those who have died.” But the buyers aren’t complaining. Reena Roy, a retail florist with her 40-year-old shop in Delhi’s Ashok Vihar reveals she’s only buying 8-10 bundles for now, but may buy more when closer to Diwali. “Abhi response kum hai. Covid ne grahak kaat diya hai humara. But even for retail, we are seeing some pick-up with festivities and weddings approaching. People have begun to make bookings for various functions.”Author tweets @siddhijainnFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ghazipur-mandi-flowerpower-diwali-achchi-ban-rahi-hai-iss-saal-say-sellers-101635230995413.html
26-10-2021||Mumbai||'My name is ...': Sameer Wankhede's father hits out at Nawab Malik||Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) official Sameer Wankhede's father has slammed Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik, who suggested that the agency's zonal director forged personal documents, including his birth certificate. Malik also claimed on Monday that Sameer Wankhede is a Muslim by birth and that his real name is "Sameer Dawood Wankhede" as he accused the NCB official of forgery.Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Malik has been attacking Sameer Wankhede who allegedly seized drugs onboard a cruise ship on its way to Goa on October 2 during a raid and arrested Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan and others the next day.Wankhede's father said that Malik was playing very low-level politics. “It is an absolute lie that my name is Dawood Wankhede. I think there is some malafide intention of Malik behind releasing that birth certificate of Sameer Wankhede and defaming us. My name is Dnyandev Wankhede since my birth and it is still the same,” he said while speaking to a regional news channel, according to news agency PTI.Also watch | ‘If you send a hunter…’: Nawab Malik on why SRK & not Aamir Khan is ‘targeted’“I completed my graduation and post-graduation and even served in a state government department. How is it possible that none of them knew my name was not Dnyandev and it was Dawood? How come Malik alone gets the suspicious document?" he asked.'Have proof'Wankhede senior said that his wife, who died six years ago, once made an affidavit in which mentions that his name is Dnyandev Wankhede. "I even have a valid caste certificate with me. And not just me, even my relatives have similar documents to establish it," he added.Dnyandev Wankhede's comments came after Sameer Wankhede denied Malik's allegations of forging documents. He said that his father Dnyandev Kachruji Wankhede retired as senior police inspector with the state's excise department in 2007. His father is a Hindu and his late mother Zaheeda was a Muslim, the NCB official said.Also read | NDPS court disposes of NCB plea against interference in Aryan Khan caseSameer Wankhede also mentioned that he married Dr Shabana Qureshi in 2006 under the Special Marriage Act and divorced mutually in 2016. He married Kranti Redkar in 2017.“When my son and his first wife had a son, even on the latter's birth certificate my son's full name is mentioned in which my name is stated as Dnyandev Wankhede. Those people (Malik) should understand it. God knows from where Malik drew this connection,” he said.“It looks like Nawab Malik was hurt after his son-in-law (Sameer Khan) was put behind bars by the NCB earlier. He never uttered a word against the NCB when his son-in-law was in jail. Malik started speaking out only after he was released,” the Wankhede senior said.Also read | Aryan Khan ‘has hope’ as he is Shah Rukh Khan’s son, says Arbaaz Merchant’s dad‘Will come out of this’When asked about the allegations of pay-off raised by Prabhakar Sail, an NCB independent witness, he said if Sameer Wankhede wanted a bribe from Shah Rukh Khan, he would have asked the actor to deliver it at home. "He would not have arrested his (Shah Rukh Khan's) son and then demanded it.”Prabhakar Sail seemed to have been beaten up and then forced to give the statement. “While talking Sail is coughing, drinking water. All these are signs of getting beaten up severely. Why was he quiet for so many days if he was made to sign some blank papers (after the alleged cruise ship raid by NCB officials)?” he asked.Sail, in a statement to the media on Sunday, claimed that ₹25 crore was demanded by an official of the NCB and other people, including absconding witness KP Gosavi, to let off Aryan Khan in the drugs raid case. Sail said he overheard Gosavi telling one Sam D'Souza over the phone about a demand of ₹25 crore and "to settle at ₹18 crore as they have to give ₹8 crore to Sameer Wankhede".Sameer Wankhede has denied the allegations and said they are a bid to scuttle the probe in the drugs raid case. The NCB is probing the extortion charge against Sameer Wankhede. Dnyandev Wankhede compared his son to Abhimanyu, a character in the epic Mahabharata who is surrounded by enemies, and said that he will come out of this chakravyuh or a multi-tiered military formation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/my-name-is-sameer-wankhede-s-father-hits-out-at-nawab-malik-101635221599543.html

A total of 841 coronavirus infections were reported on May 5 last year. The positivity rate in the state has dropped significantly as well during this period, down to 1.05% from 12.82%.The Covid-19 caseload was low also because relatively fewer tests were conducted in the last 24 hours. Fewer tests are conducted over weekends, while the turnaround time for the test results to be delivered also becomes longer. A total of 84,460 Covid-19 tests were carried out. On May 5, 2020, 6,561 tests were done, showing a positivity rate of 12.82%.Maharashtra’s overall tally of confirmed Covid-19 cases reached 6,603,850 on Monday.Also Read: Covid-19: To travel to United States, get fully vaccinatedRahul Pandit, an intensive care specialist and a member of the state’s Covid task force, cited two reasons for the fall in numbers - fewer infections of late and fewer tests being done on Sunday. “The number of cases is definitely decreasing. In addition, we always get lesser cases on Monday as fewer tests are conducted on Sundays. The factual indication is the numbers from Wednesday onwards,” said Pandit.Ameet Mandot, another doctor, attributed the decreasing numbers to the Covid-19 vaccination drive. “The mass [coronavirus] vaccinations taking place in Maharashtra have been effective in containing the virus.

In such a situation there can be no governance and this is why the chief minister is limited to making announcements only with not a single rupee being released to give any relief to the people,” he said.“The chief minister has even claimed credit for releasing money to farmers whose crops were destroyed due to pink bollworm, but not a single farmer has been paid any compensation,” he added.Later, during an interaction with the district Bar association, Sukhbir said they would form a lawyers’ development board to fast-track infra facilities and work for the betterment of the legal community if their government comes to power in the state.Earlier, led by hundreds of motorcyclists, the SAD president participated in a massive roadshow in Gurdaspur city.

He cautioned people to remain steadfast in maintaining amity and brotherhood, especially on the face of the machinations being perpetrated to create fear, psychosis and a wedge between different segments of society. He said the National Conference had surmounted these challenges since its inception by pursuing the cherished philosophy of secularism and democracy. “This has been the strength of this party in a diverse state like Jammu and Kashmir,” he said. “The atmosphere is aimed at polarisation to garner votes. This is the tested tool of those who want to remain in power at all costs”, he said, adding that politically mature people will not get swayed by hate being spread by divisive forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/spurt-in-militancy-exposes-centre-s-claims-of-normalcyfarooq-101635193449430.html

26-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Police trace gang behind theft from cash van||More than two weeks after a trunk carrying ₹39 lakh was stolen from a cash van in Sector 34, Chandigarh Police have arrested one member of the interstate gang involved in the crime. The accused has been identified as Satiyaseelan, 27, who belongs to Ramji Nagar in Trichy, Tamil Nadu. He was arrested from his home town and brought on transit remand to the city. With his arrest, police have recovered ₹4 lakh and also identified his five accomplices. “The accused was among six persons who committed the theft. He is a member of a well-organised gang that targets cash vans or people outside banks. His role was to conduct recce and then transport the stolen money to Chennai,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Chandigarh. Bhupinder Singh, who works as a custodian with a security firm based in Sector 47, had lodged a complaint regarding misplacement of the trunk from a cash van on October 8. Under stress after being questioned by police, the driver of the cash van had committed suicide by jumping in front of a train on October 11. How the gang was busted Police procured the CCTV footage of the route taken by the cash van. The footage collected from Sector 34 showed three men carrying the trunk while the cash was being loaded at an ATM. “The driver was sitting in the van when a member of the gang approached him and told him that the engine oil is leaking. As the driver got down, the other gang members took out the trunk by opening the passenger-side window. The driver was alone in the vehicle while his three colleagues, including the gunman, had gone to load the cash,” said a police official. All six accused had then left on foot in separate groups. Police said that apart from the footage, a call made by the main suspect helped trace them. The accused had thrown the mobile phone, but police traced the SIM card to Trichy. According to police, Ramji Nagar is notorious for gangs involved in crimes executed by diverting the attention of their victims. The gang involved in the present case has set up its base in Delhi and targets different cities in Punjab, Delhi, Chandigarh and Rajasthan. After committing the crime, the gang members leave for Haridwar where they reassemble. Satiyaseelan acted as the “receiver” in the present crime. His role was to transport the stolen cash to Chennai and hand it over to the wife of the gang leader, who would then distribute the money.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-police-trace-gang-behind-theft-from-cash-van-101635192133895.html

Alam, a defence journalist from Pakistan, has been in the midst of a controversy after deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Randhawa said that the state government will conduct a probe into her alleged links with Pakistan’s spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Singh, who termed it a “baseless investigation”, posted on Facebook about a dozen purported photos in which Alam is seen with Congress president Sonia Gandhi, former external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, former UP chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav, actor Dilip Kumar and film director Mahesh Bhatt, among others. “I am posting a series of pictures of Mrs Aroosa Alam with various dignitaries. I suppose they are all also contacts of the ISI. Those who say so should think before speaking (sic),” Singh wrote on Facebook. The ex-CM further said that unfortunately visas were banned at the moment between India and Pakistan otherwise he would have invited her again. “Incidentally, I am going to be 80 in March and Mrs Alam 69 next year. Narrow minded ness seems to be order of the day (sic),” he added, taking a dig at those raising questions over their friendship. Singh was made to resign from the chief minister’s post in September following months of rift and turbulence in the state unit. The Congress leaders have stepped up their attacks on the two-time former chief minister after his announcement that he would form his own political outfit and have an understanding with the BJP for the upcoming state polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/think-before-speaking-capt-posts-aroosa-alam-s-pictures-with-politicians-actors-101635192132670.html

Police had to resort to lathicharge and use of water cannons to disperse them as they tried to march towards Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s residence in Chandigarh. During the melee, eight cops, including five men and three women, were also injured. Earlier, the protesters had gathered in Sector 5 for their three-day “maha andolan” under the banner of Haryana Vocational Teachers Association. Their main demands include better salaries, no involvement of contractors in employment and job security.The protesters left the spot around 3.45 pm to move towards Chandigarh but were met with police blockade near the Housing Board Chowk. After the police action, the protesters claimed that around 30 of them were injured.Anoop Dhillon, state president of the association, said: “We were just moving to gherao the CM’s residence in Chandigarh.

26-10-2021||Chandigarh||BSF jurisdiction: Parties agree on special assembly session to reject Centre’s move||Strongly criticising the Union government’s decision to extend the jurisdiction of BSF from 15km to 50km along the international border in Punjab, political leaders, at an all-party meeting chaired by chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, on Monday agreed for a special assembly session to reject the move, besides challenging it in the Supreme Court.The BJP abstained from the meeting, while representatives of the Shiromani Akali Dal, Aam Aadmi Party, Lok Insaaf Party and other parties were present.“By calling the Vidhan Sabha session, all (the parties) will jointly reject the notification. All parties are unanimous on it,” Channi said, while asserting that law and order was a state subject. Two resolutions were unanimously passed in the meeting, one against the BSF jurisdiction and another against the three farm laws.Channi assured all political parties that the posts of chief minister and ministers do not matter to them when it came to safeguarding the interests of Punjab. “We are ready to make any sacrifice but will not allow Punjab’s interests to be looted,” he said. The decision about convening the Vidhan Sabha session will be taken in the next Cabinet meeting, he said.The chief minister said the Centre’s three “black” laws on farming will also be rejected in the coming assembly session.When told that the Opposition was blaming him for agreeing to the extension of the BSF jurisdiction during his meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah, Channi rejected the charge and said he had raised several issues, including the curbing of drugs smuggling from across the border, with Shah.Talking to the media, Punjab Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu accused the Centre of “weakening the federal structure by creating a state within a state”. He also slammed it for “disregarding the democratic rights of the people of Punjab” by extending the BSF’s jurisdiction and expressed fear of “torture, false cases, arbitrary detention and illegal arrests” against them.He called it a “political move” of the central government for its “vested interests” while questioning the timing of its move just a few months ahead of the assembly polls. “After CBI, ED and various other institution now BJP will use the BSF to interfere in the autonomy of states ruled by opposition parties. As BJP can never win Punjab, it is creating unrest, so that peaceful elections don’t happen in Punjab,” said Sidhu.AAP blames Cong, SAD Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) attacked the chief minister for his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah before the Centre handed over half of Punjab to the BSF.“The NIA Act and Clause 2 of sub-section of the BSF Act 139, was introduced during the then Manmohan Singh government. With what mouth is the Congress opposing it now?” said AAP’s state chief Bhagwant Mann. He said when these Acts were enacted, SAD-BJP coalition government in Punjab did not oppose the move.First set your own house in order: SAD to Channi The SAD delegation asked the Congress government to first set its own house in order as some of the leaders, including former CM Capt Amarinder Singh, have appreciated the Centre’s move.The delegation also asked chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi to clarify on his meeting with home minister Amit Shah as there were apprehensions in the minds of Punjabis that he had agreed to the move.“Former Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar had also accused the chief minister of handing over half of Punjab to the Centre,” the Akali leaders said.Petty politics, says BJP The Punjab unit of the BJP, on the other hand, accused the Congress government of playing petty politics over the issue of national security. Senior party leader Manoranjan Kalia said the move of extending the BSF’s jurisdiction is meant to protect the national interests.Another Punjab BJP leader Subhash Sharma accused the state government of using the national security issue for petty politics and alleged that it was trying to divert attention from the burning issues of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bsf-jurisdiction-parties-agree-on-special-assembly-session-to-reject-centre-s-move-101635191590364.html
26-10-2021||Chandigarh||HP bypolls | BJP transferred 3.5 lakh employees within a year:Harshwardhan Chauhan||With just three days left for the bypolls, Congress described the Bharatiya Janata Party government as anti-employee and alleged that over 3.5 lakh employees had been transferred within one year during the BJP regime. Shillai MLA Harshwardhan Chauhan said, “The transferred employees had no choice but to seek relief from courts. The outcome of the poll will be a referendum of chief minister Jai Ram Thakur’s regime and the BJP’s policies. The claims of the BJP government are just on paper, nothing has translated on ground,” he said. “Himachal’s GDP in 2017 ,when the Congress was in power, was 7.5. It subsequently dipped to 6.5, 4.5 and minus 6.5 in 2020-21,” he said, while slamming the government for inflation. Petrol prices have crossed ₹100, while cooking gas cylinders’ price has crossed ₹1,000. “The BJP is blaming the Congress for all the bad things that happening during its regime. They have been in power for over seven years in the Centre and also have a government in the state . They should tell people what the double engine government has done to give relief to the common man,” he said.“People from outside the state are being given jobs, especially at a time when unemployment is very high, which speaks volumes about the concern the BJP regime has for the educated jobless youth,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hp-bypolls-bjp-transferred-3-5-lakh-employees-within-a-year-harshwardhan-chauhan-101635191349716.html
26-10-2021||Lucknow||Inflation the latest brake to potters’ wheel in UP’s Nandpur||After the Covid-19 crisis and the government restrictions, now it’s inflation that is giving nightmares to the potters of Nandpur village. Nandpur is barely a mile away from erstwhile pottery hub of Chinhat, on the outskirts of Lucknow.While highlighting the issues they face, the potters said that the non availability of mud and skyrocketing prices of cow dung and other fuels are adding to the cost of earthenware.“There seems no respite for us. In the previous years, it was the Covid-19 crisis that left us hand to mouth, and this time, it’s inflation that is breaking our backs,” said Mohammed Afsar, a traditional potter from Nandpur village.Of the other issues, the availability of mud is the biggest one in recent times, the potters of Nandpur said. “We are all traditional potters and it’s just because it is our ancestral trade, we are into it and keeping it alive. Initially, we used to depend on the mud from the Chinhat area that used to be a rich source of the ‘chikni mitti’--a special kind of mud used in pottery-making. But almost a decade back, the rising colonisation affected that resource and the shortage of mud started hitting us,” said Jafar Ali, another potter from Nandpur.Ali said that now they have to get the ‘chikni mitti’ from Barabanki which is around 52km from their village. “Other than the cost of the mud, the transportation costs have also increased, especially after the recent rise of diesel and petrol prices,” said Ali.He said that this was not the end of the story. Once unloaded, the raw earthenware needs proper baking and this phase again costs much money. “In order to bake the earthenware, we need to heat up the oven for which fuel like cow dung cakes or wood is required. The cost of the fuel has again gone up. Cow dung cakes that used to cost us ₹1.30 paisa each are now costing ₹3. In one shift, if we bake earthenware with a sale price of ₹6,000, the cost of fuel required is around ₹2,500, which is too high,” he added.The potters said that owing to the peculiar nature of the business, they can’t increase the cost of the earthenware much as it would affect sales. “But there is no profit in the business left at all. It’s just because it’s our ancestral business, we are keeping tradition alive by continuing it,” he said.Not only the potters of Nandpur, but the potters from Chinnhat too are badly affected by the issues. They demanded government intervention. “We have heard our Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji emphasising on earthen lamps on Diwali. This year too, he has appealed to people to light at least two diyas at every house. In such a situation, the state government should pay a little attention to our dwindling trade.The UP government, too, is making efforts to boost the dwindling business. Last year, the state government’s department of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) had provided space to roadside potters to showcase their talent and had organised a fair for them.Recently, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had held a meeting with the people of the Prajapati community which largely includes potters. In the meeting, the CM recounted the measures taken by the UP government to boost their dwindling business. Besides, the CM also said that the government has made pond mud, used in pottery-making, duty free. He also assured all help to the potters and said that they would be provided with the electric wheels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/inflation-the-latest-brake-to-potters-wheel-in-up-s-nandpur-101635191112143.html

The chief minister said after elections his government will compensate the apple growers of Kinnaur who have suffered losses due to the recent snowfall.“I have heard that apple trees were damaged in parts of the district. I can very well understand this loss to the fruit growers and efforts will be made to compensate them,” he said. Thakur said he also comes from a remote area and he can understand the difficulties faced by the people of Kinnaur in their day-to-day life.He hailed the people of Kinnaur for their contribution in the fight against Covid by achieving a 100% vaccination target among all districts in India.Launching a stinging attack on the Congress, the chief minister said the Congress was in power for 50 years, but did nothing to upgrade the health infrastructure. “Before the BJP government took reins, there were only 30 ventilators and two oxygen plants in the health institutions across the state. Today the there are about 900 ventilators 30 oxygen plants,” he said, alleging that the Congress was continuing to play petty politics even during the pandemic and did nothing to help the state cope.“Congress leaders even raised fake bills worth crores to extract money from their party high command,” he alleged. “Today, the same Congress has made people, who were accused of sedition, its star campaigners in the state,” he added.He urged people of Kinnaur to support BJP candidate Brigadier Khushal Thakur and make his victory as grand as that of former MP Ramswaroop’s victory in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-getting-immense-support-in-tribal-areas-himachal-chief-minister-jai-ram-101635190873387.html

26-10-2021||Chandigarh||Covid situation stable in Chandigarh tricity; health officials advise precaution||Even amid the ongoing festive season , there was no major change in the number of Covid cases recorded last week. In the week ending on Sunday (October 24), a total of 51 Covid cases surfaced in the tricity, as compared to 50 in the previous week. However, between October 4 and October 10, the tricity had reported only 47 cases, the lowest weekly tally since the second wave.Though the rise is marginal, health department officials have cautioned that complacency, especially during the ongoing festival season, can cause the caseload to shoot up further.Of the 51 cases, Chandigarh and Mohali reported 21 each while only nine people tested positive in Panchkula, where no cases were reported on three days of the week. The tricity also reported no death owing to the virus for the 19th straight days on Sunday.At the peak of the second wave in May, the tricity had recorded 46,245 cases and 790 deaths in just one month. With restrictions on public movement being put in place, the curve started flattening thereon and only 50 cases were recorded in the last week of July. The weekly cases have been fluctuating ever since, but have never crossed the 100 mark. Mohali civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur, said, “Cases in Mohali are fluctuating every week and even if the transmission rate is under control, people must follow Covid-appropriate behaviour as any complacency can lead to another surge, especially after the festive season. We have increased testing and are concentrating on contact tracing to avoid infection spread.”Dr Jagat Ram, director, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) said, “For the last one month, more severe Covid-19 patients are getting admitted to PGIMER. Vaccination is the key to avoid getting severely infected and it will automatically avert the third wave. Increase in cases at this time will be risky and not only children, but adults will be equally prone to getting infected.”Slight uptick in daily casesThe tricity on Monday recorded six fresh infections, against the four cases on Sunday. All the three areas reported two infections each. Also, no death was recorded for the 20th consecutive day.In Mohali, the cases surfaced from Dhakoli and in Chandigarh, the infected patients are residents of Sector 5 and 16.Meanwhile, at 1.19%, Panchkula’s positivity rate crossed 1% mark on Monday.

26-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: School students attending virtual classes feel neglected||Students of Chandigarh schools, who are still attending classes virtually, feel that those attending physically are being given preference over them. It has been three months since schools reopened for students of Class 9 onwards for physical classes and then subsequently for lower classes. A parent, whose ward attends a private school in Sector 26, on condition of anonymity, said, “Students present for offline classes are being preferred to get all students to attend school. Many times, doubts of students attending virtually remain unanswered as teachers ignore them.” Nitin Goyal, president of the Chandigarh Parents Association, added, “Once teaching begins, it is not possible to admit students into online classroom and many times, they are unable to get their questions answered. Schools should make helplines for parents if they face issues and an IT team must help them. There are some complaints, but parents remain wary of coming forward.” Goyal added that many parents will not send their kids for offline classes until they can get vaccinated and the schools must be asked to adjust and cooperate with them. President of the Independent School Association HS Mamik said, “Schools are not pushing parents to do anything and we continue to take both classes simultaneously even though it’s double the work for teachers. Our association has approached the administration over switching to either completely online or offline classes, as it will make it easier for the teachers and students to follow.” District education officer Prabhjot Kaur, said, “Although I have received no such complaints from parents, those facing such issues should write to us with the name of the school and we will ask the school for an explanation.” No school buses add to parents’ woes Due to financial reasons and low footfall, buses of private school aren’t operation yet, even as offline classes have started. Many working parents are unable to send their children to school even if they want to as they don’t get time to drop and pick them up. General secretary of the Chandigarh School Bus Operators Association Jiwan Rattan Sharma, said, “While classes have started, the footfall of students isn’t enough for us to run our buses.” He added that during the pandemic, bus operators had faced many issues and had demanded the government to exempt them from taxes and increase the life span of the buses. Vivek High School in Sector 38-B remains one of the only schools running its buses, with around five of them plying for the last few weeks. Mamik, who is also the chairman of the school, said, “Right now, we are financing the buses ourselves and helping out bus contractors, as it is important that children don’t miss out on school. We will continue this till schools reopen properly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-school-students-attending-virtual-classes-feel-neglected-101635190093702.html

For the first time in October, not even a single city in state was in the list of places with poor, very poor and severe air quality.As per the CPCB, AQI between 0 to 50 is considered good, 51 to 100 satisfactory, and 101 to 200 moderate, 201 to 300 poor, 301 to 400 very poor, and it crosses over to severe zone at 401 AQI.The improved air quality ahead of Diwali has brought a major relief for officials of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board which is appointed to monitor air pollution.Last week, the air quality of Haryana’s Ballabgarh had reached very poor category and that of 15 other cities was poor owing to the continuous rise in stubble burning cases in state.Officials of the state agriculture department said incidents of stubble burning have declined considerably due to rains as only 38 active fire locations were reported on October 24.They said there is around 53% decline in farm fires this year as the state has reported 1,764 active fire locations between September 15 and October 24 against 3,773 of last year.Haryana State Pollution Control Board member secretary S Narayanan said they expect that the air quality will be better in coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-residents-relieved-as-air-quality-of-most-cities-returns-to-good-category-101635189369935.html
26-10-2021||Delhi||Centre to respond on altering land use of bus depot, park for Central Vista revamp||The Supreme Court on Monday sought a response from the central government on a petition questioning the change of land use of a public park and a bus depot in the national capital’s Central Vista to build residences of the Prime Minister and the Vice President.The petition was filed by lawyer Rajeev Suri, who had earlier challenged the clearances given for the Central Vista project, resulting in an elaborate judgment of the top court in January that allowed the government to proceed with the construction.The Central Vista project includes building a new Parliament that would seat 1,200 members of both Houses, and 10 buildings that will house 51 ministries. The January judgment did not deal with the change of land use of plot number 1, the land meant for the residences of the Prime Minister and the Vice President, which was approved on October 10, 2020.The Prime Minister’s residence will be built behind the South Block, while the Vice President’s residence will be located behind the North Block. These areas are now used as a public park and a bus depot. The petition questioned the change of land use from part recreational to residential, resulting in a loss of public recreational space for citizens.“The government must show how the change of land use is justified in public interest,” said lawyer Shikhil Suri, arguing for the petitioner. A bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar issued a notice to the Centre. “The petitioner wishes to pursue only one contention, namely, before modification of the plan concerning plot No. 1, it had provided for public recreational area also, as noticed from the public notice. However, now that has been completely done away with and the land use stands converted to residential only.” The central government will file an affidavit in three days, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said. Posting the matter for Friday, the bench said, “The respondents may file a short affidavit to deal with this contention…including to justify the necessity for such modification.”The petitioner informed the court that the land at plot number 1 has a facility for transportation spread across nine acres, while the park consists of six acres, which will be lost to the residences. The bench asked the Centre whether any alternate recreational space has been considered while acquiring the present plot. “From the petition it is clear that the public recreational area is not available now. Are you giving it up completely or is it being shifted to any other place?” the bench asked. “If Parliament is coming up nearby, from the security point of view, there cannot be any recreational spot,” Mehta said, arguing for the government. The work on the new Parliament will be completed before India’s 75th Independence Day next year, according to estimates by the Central Public Works Department. The Central Secretariat complex will be built by 2024. The residence of the Prime Minister, along with a building to house the special protection group will be completed by December next year, while work on the Vice President’s house is expected to completed by May 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/centre-to-respond-on-altering-land-use-of-bus-depot-park-for-central-vista-revamp-101635189189270.html

On Monday the state government approved the plan and the money, as drafted by the SPPU.Shalini Kadu, project director, District Rural Development Agency said, “The entire plan is drafted to cost ₹39 lakh of which the District Planning committee has already approved ₹21 lakh and the state government approved ₹18 lakh on Monday.” Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer (CEO), Zilla Parishad (ZP) said, “The central government has allocated every district a product which they must take up and deliver, not just as a raw agricultural goods but also as a finished product and add value to the same. Pune received the product, tomato, which is produced in large quantities in Narayangaon. However, instead of just going with tomatoes we decided to add 74 more products and produce them as fully processed or at least semi-processed goods, which could be then delivered to factories or consumers. All these brands will be marketed under the name Savitri to honour Pune’s very own Savitribai Jyotiba Phule.”Kadu added, “This plan was submitted about two months ago and we have got approval. The SPPU will now draft an action plan as to how we can take the processed products forward and find a market for the same. The university would act as a consultant and help us to ensure that the women who work in various self help groups earn more and use their skills in a better way.” At least 200,000 women who work in 23,000 self help groups (SHG) would benefit from this scheme and it would primarily be run by women.

26-10-2021||Pune||BH-series: Same number plate valid in all states... now available in Maharashtra||The Maharashtra government on Monday announced the launch of the BH (Bharat)-series number plates for vehicles that move from one state to another. This, according to government, will enable hassle free inter-state re-locations.Satej Patil, minister of state for Transport, Home and Information Technology, said that BH-series registration has started in Maharashtra from Monday and people can now take their cars and relocate from one state to another. “BH-series registration has been started in Maharashtra. Now you can take the delivery of your car happily before Diwali and enjoy a long drive from one state to another without any hassle. @CMOMaharashtra @advanilparab,” Patil tweeted on Monday.In order to free vehicle owners from the hassle of procuring an NOC from the current state and then re-registering the vehicle in the next state while relocating, the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways had earlier notified the Bharat series or “BH” series of registration which people can opt for. Until now, according to the Motor Vehicle Act 1988, a vehicle registered in a state when kept in another state for a period of more than 12 months is subject to assignment of new registration. The registration process which was tedious in nature, has now been done away with after the launch of BH-series.This means when a person is to relocate to another state taking his vehicle along, he or she had to first get a no-objection certificate from the state where the vehicle is currently registered. The government calls it the “parent” state of the vehicle. The parent state’s NOC is a must for assignment of a new registration in another state. Subsequently a new registration is a must because under Section 47 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, a vehicle can reside in another state with the same registration for 12 months during which it has to be re-registered in the new state. The vehicle owner can also apply for refund of the road tax in the parent state on a pro rata basis. “Our department could launch this scheme because of the great support and encouragement from the CM. Our minister Anil Parab too played a key role in it,” Patil said.Earlier on Thursday Patil has said that the module was ready and the trials are underway. “Maharashtra Government has initiated implementation of BH series in the state and its on our top priority. The module is almost ready & trials are going on so it will run smoothly once it’s launched, in a few days the government will start the BH registration. @CMOMaharashtra @advanilparab,” he had tweeted on October 18.On the question about to the GST on registration, Patil has said, “As per the law, the GST is paid on homologation price which is given on the Vahan Portal, and Motor Vehicle tax is calculated at the end. We will ensure that this is strictly followed in Maharashtra.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bhseries-same-number-plate-valid-in-all-states-now-available-in-maharashtra-101635188469338.html

Last week, EOW had registered the first FIR in the case for cheating Axis Bank of ₹206.35 crore.The latest cheating and forgery case has been registered against Talwalkars Better Value Fitness Ltd (TBVFL) and Talwalkars Health Clubs Ltd, its directors and others – Girish Talwalkar, Prashant Talwalkar, Vinayak Gawande, Anant Gawande, Harsh Bhatkar, Madhukar Talwalkar, Dinesh Rao and Girish Naik.“The accused company had taken money from the private bank for one purpose but utilised the funds for some other use with fraudulent intent and this has clearly surfaced during the preliminary inquiry. We have now registered a case against the directors of the group,” said Niket Kaushik, joint commissioner of police, EOW.Panirselvam A, the vice-president of the bank’s treasury department had lodged the complaint against Talwalkars, following which a case was registered at Shivaji Park police station. EOW’s banking-3 unit has now taken over the investigation.As per the FIR, between 2016 and 2019, the two accused companies had submitted false information, concealed their real financial condition and accepted investments from Laxmi Vilas Bank by issuing debentures.“The accused companies and their directors fraudulently hyped credit worthiness of the companies to convince the bank to invest in their business. Initially, the bank received some interest, but later the accused companies started defaulting. The bank claims by doing so, the accused companies caused wrongful loss of about ₹180 crore to it,” said an EOW inspector, who is part of the investigation.He added that during the inquiry, multiple financial irregularities and illegalities emerged, and accordingly, the statements of witnesses were registered.While commenting on the earlier complaint, Prashant Talwalkar had said, “When the alleged irregularities took place, we had no access or control over the financial dealings of the company. We have conveyed our side of the entire matter to EOW officers. We have faith in police and the judiciary. As the matter is sub-judice, I won’t be able to comment further.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/second-fir-against-mumbai-based-talwalkars-for-defrauding-private-bank-of-180-crore-101635187990591.html
26-10-2021||Pune||Baner-Pashan residents see red over garbage segregation at amenity space||PUNE: Residents of Baner Pashan Link Road (BPLR) – a congregation of 60 societies – are fed up of the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC’s) apathy towards their problem of garbage segregation and organic waste dumping being carried out at what are meant to be amenity spaces, repeated complaints notwithstanding. According to the residents, the available amenity spaces are being used for activities like dumping of organic waste and segregation of garbage even as their locality continues to be devoid of utilities such as playgrounds and gardens. Rajendra Chuttar, president, BPLR Welfare Trust, said, “The PMC is blind and is not ready to look into the problems of residents. Or they are pretending to be dumb. Since the past over three years, we have repeatedly complained but it is very surprising that there is no response at all. People are paying heavy taxes but getting a big zero in return…”Ravindra Sinha, secretary, BPLR Welfare Trust, said, “There are two amenity spaces for the welfare of citizens for creation of a garden or playground. At one place (open plot near Regent Plaza), SWACH is carrying out segregation of garbage. While the space has been allotted to them by the PMC, the surrounding buildings are facing a lot of problems.”There is another amenity space near Star Bazaar where residents have been demanding a garden for more than five years now. However, the PMC is using it to dump organic waste and one can see biomass and vermiculture residue falling outside.Sinha said, “The concern is that these spaces which are being used for dumping of organic waste and segregation of garbage are actually meant to provide residents with amenities. What is happening is illogical. The PMC claims they will keep the area clean but being an open air space, it is creating problems for residents. There should be a properly covered segregation plant but they are carrying out segregation in an open space.”As mohalla meetings have ground to a halt due to Covid-19 restrictions, residents are filing complaints on online portals.Meanwhile, Sandip Khalate, Aundh-Baner ward officer, claimed, “The garbage segregation plant is there on a temporary basis and will be removed. It was an open plot and there was no budget issued for the garden so it is being used for garbage segregation. In future, a garden will be built there.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/banerpashan-residents-see-red-over-garbage-segregation-at-amenity-space-101635187989360.html
26-10-2021||Pune||Action committee claims debris dumping as blocked nullah in Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary||PUNE The Dr Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary, a treat for bird watchers and nature enthusiasts, is situated by the river between Yerwada and Kalyani nagar. The sanctuary is once again facing the dumping of debris on its precincts. Residents and activists from the area have complained and claim the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials are not paying any heed to the issue.The Dr Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary Action Committee on Monday alleged that despite repeated complaints made at the PMC ward office there has been no action at all, as a result of which a nullah in the bird sanctuary is now blocked. “Before the pandemic, the area was very well taken care of by bird watchers. We had planted trees and carried out cleanliness drives in the stretch near the Mula-Mutha river. However, during lockdown, there has been a decrease in the number of visitors to the sanctuary. Now, we can see that there is debris being dumped in the region,” said action committee volunteer Meghana Baphna. Once popular among birdwatchers within and outside Pune as the “Yerawada Birding Point”, the spot, in its heydays, used to feature at least 30 different species of birdsm including the ruddy shelduck, red wattled lapwings and black headed ibis. However, due to massive garbage dumping and polluted river water, it is no longer frequented by birds, or bird watchers, in large numbers. Pradeep Raheja, another volunteer of the action committee said that there was a natural nullah in the sanctuary. “This nullah is now blocked due to debris dumping in the area. Blocking of such a natural nullah can cause flooding when there is intense rainfall It has also led to mosquito breeding here. Authorities should take action immediately to stop this dumping,” said Raheja. Sameer Nikam, another volunteer from the action committee said that the members will stage a fast on October 30 to highlight the issue. “We have written to several authorities, but no immediate relief has been given. Debris is being dumped as we speak now. To protest this, we will be organising a one day fast on October 30 to spread awareness about the issue and bring attention to this matter,” said Nikam. Assistant municipal commissioner Suhas Jagtap said, “The bird sanctuary is under the forest department. We are looking into the matter of debris dumping. And we will take action against those who are dumping debris in the region.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/action-committee-claims-debris-dumping-as-blocked-nullah-in-salim-ali-bird-sanctuary-101635187874399.html
26-10-2021||Delhi||With private vends shut in Delhi, liquor prices in Gurugram shoot up unbridled||In this season of cheer, Gurugram’s liquor store owners are discovering that their “cup runneth over” , with the fact that almost 40% of Delhi’s liquor stores being shut allowing them to charge a premium. The result: prices of imported liquor and Indian-Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) have increased in the city after private liquor shops were shut in Delhi from October 1, a closure that coincided with a seasonal spike in demand on account of the festive season. The price of imported scotch was up by between ₹400 and ₹1,200 for a 1 litrebottle, and that of IMFL whisky by between ₹250 and ₹400. Even beer has become more expensive, by up to ₹300 for a case of 12.  Haryana does not have maximum retail price on liquor bottles, and shopkeepers are selling at a premium. Many store owners said they suffered losses during the pandemic and hope to make good now. The hike in price is because of a transition to the Delhi government’s new excise policy due to which 40% or 260 of the city-state’s liquor shops, all the private owns shut on October 1 and will stay closed till November 16. During the transition, only government-run liquor outlets will remain open. And on November 17, all (including the government owned ones) will reopen under new private management. That’s worked out very well for Gurugram’s liquor store owners, who previously offered discounts to match prices in Delhi which were lower. Sonu Yadav, who owns a liquor store on Golf Course Extension Road said the number of customers has increased, causing a shortage of some kinds and brands of liquor. “We have increased the prices as we have limited stock of the Scotch, which is high in demand. Most of the people are Delhi residents who are buying liquor for gifting purposes.” Shashank Sangal, owner of Aralia Beverages Pvt Ltd claims sales are up almost 40%. Gurugram has almost 400 liquor shops, mostly in prime locations. Ran Niwas Rathi, a resident of DLF Phase 1, said liquor prices differ from shop to shop , and that discounts in the city have now stopped. “For the last 10 days they have stopped giving any discounts and have increased the prices. A single malt which was sold for around ₹5,800 is now being sold at ₹7,000 and shops have stopped all discount offers they had planned for Diwali.” Excise officials have formed teams to keep a check on prices but said they were yet to receive any complaints. VK Beniwal, the deputy commissioner of excise and taxation, Gurugram (east), said the owners of liquor shops have been directed not to charge exorbitant prices and to keep a check on the salesmen as they often try to make money on the side by charging more. “We can only check minimum retail price but if anyone is selling above that, there is no such policy to stop or take action against them,” he said.Delhi residents, meanwhile said they were resigned to travelling to cities in the National Capital Region for their stock.“It will not be wrong to say that liquor is just not available in Delhi any more. Only a few government shops are open which have almost not stock. They only have low-range alcohol on offer. So, people are left with no option but to purchase from Gurugram or Noida. All of us are doing that,” said Akash Tyagi, a resident of Ashok Vihar in north Delhi. A manager at one of the government liquor shops in Malviya Nagar acknowledged that many customers are returning empty handed because the popular brands are unavailable. “The stock of premium liquor is almost nil because manufacturers have signed new contracts with the new licensees which will start operations from November 17. They are on the verge of ending their contracts with the government, so the balances are getting cleared at present,” said the official on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/with-private-vends-shut-in-delhi-liquor-prices-in-gurugram-shoot-up-unbridled-101635187689449.html

Kureshi had received the money in her account.Pune Police had issued a lookout circular to prevent Gosavi from leaving the country. While speaking to news channels, Gosavi over the phone said he is planning to surrender before the police.When contacted, the deputy commissioner of police Priyanka Narnavare said he had not yet approached them.“We came across reports in media in which he is heard saying about surrendering.

26-10-2021||Delhi||Capital just 30mm rainfall away from eclipsing all-time record||Sunday’s sudden downpour dumped 27.5mm of rain in Delhi, taking the volume of rain recorded in the Capital this year to beyond 1,500mm for the first time since 1933 — and only a little over 30mm shy of the all-time record.Since January 1, the Safdarjung weather station – representative of weather records for the city – has recorded 1,502.8mm of rain. In a typical year, Delhi gets 779mm, which means 2021 has brought the city close to twice the amount of rain as a normal year. The year 1933 is when the city received the most rain over a year at 1,534.3mm.Experts say one or two spells of ‘moderate’ rainfall due to La Nina conditions in the next two months could not only see this record tumble, but bring a harsher, colder winter as well.
26-10-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The pied piper of B block||The dainty ornamental park at the B block in genteel Hazrat Nizamuddin East is ringed by trees. All day long they swell with the twittering of birds. The surrounding bungalows remain cocooned in quietude.But this morning a different tune is wafting through the air. It can’t be coming from the red house in A block, whose dweller daily practices the piano accompanied by an opera singer’s accomplished voice. This sound is of a bansuri. Has a flautist move into one of these homes?And suddenly the mystery is resolved. The musician is sighted. He is carrying a bouquet of flutes in one hand; the other hand is holding the flute he is playing. The tune, inspired from an old Hindi film song, is extraordinarily calming. One is tempted to suspend whatever one is doing, and settle down into a rocking chair with eyes closed.Qurban Ansari is a hawker of flutes. He commutes from Gurugram to Delhi everyday on hawai chappals. At 18, he has only a whisper of soft moustache lining his upper lip. He lives with parents near the town’s bus stand, and supplements the family income with his street hawking. “I can easily sell the flutes within Gurgaon alone, but I like travelling to great distances.” Mr Ansari’s voice is as markedly dolce as his flute rendition, though he has no familial history with music of any kind. “Father works in the office.” Standing beside a parked car, the young man confesses thar his vending career could have centered on any consumable item “but I always liked bansuri…. even in my childhood, I repeatedly watched the film songs in which the hero played bansuri.” Nobody taught him to play the instrument. “I learnt gradually as I started to sell these (flutes) two years back.”Mr Ansari follows a different itinerary every new day. Today he boarded a bus to Sarai Kale Khan, from where he crossed the rail tracks to reach this central Delhi neighbourhood. He lands here four or five times a month. Showing his flutes, he informs that they are made in Mathura town. “This one is for ₹750 and this one is for just ₹40.” Very often, “instead of buying bansuri, people give me ₹100 or even ₹500 after hearing me play a song.” Once, while walking through B block, he was invited to a residence, and was generously remunerated for his impromptu drawing-room concert.Mr Ansari plans to end the day in Mandi House “where I will board the bus to Kapashera… from there I will get a shared auto to home.” He now walks ahead, with a new tune—this one is of a love song from the film Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-pied-piper-of-b-block-101635187282649.html
26-10-2021||Noida||Amrapali project in Noida: Fully paid-up buyers told they have pending payments||On September 5, Amit Tiwari woke up to a rude shock. The 42-year-old insurance professional, owner of a flat in Noida’s Amrapali Sapphire housing project, figured in a list of 10,000-odd homebuyers in a newspaper advertisement. They had all been asked to enter their flat transaction details on an online portal and settle any outstanding amounts within 15 days. Failure to pay up, the advertisement warned, would result in cancellation of their flat allotments. Alarmed, Tiwari rushed to the office of the court receiver (CR) – senior advocate R Venkatramani who was appointed by the Supreme Court in July 2019 to revive and finish all Amrapali housing projects after the real estate developer went bankrupt in 2017-- who had issued the notice. He explained he had paid the full amount of for his flat in Sapphire (as per builder buyer agreement), and its conveyance deed (a document that transfers property rights) was registered in 2020 after being duly verified and cleared by the court receiver himself. “I was told I had not paid ₹18,000 in service tax. But why would the builder (Amrapali) hand me over my flat without full payment?” he asked. Tiwari isn’t alone. Rajiv Punetha, who owns a flat in Amrapali Silicon City, is the first name on the list published on September 5. He said he had made full payment and has been living in the flat since 2015. “There are around 50 flat owners in Amrapali Sapphire alone whose names appear on the list. All their papers have already been verified by the CR office, some once, some twice. At least 18 of them have even got their conveyance deeds registered with CR’s approval post verification,” said commodore R K Srivastava (retired), who heads the Apartment Owners’ Association of the housing society. The notice and associated problems with getting conveyance deeds registered represent the latest hurdle for homebuyers who have spent years hoping to move into their flats and later battled legal tangles due to Amrapali’s alleged financial misappropriations. Amrapali declared bankruptcy in 2017, plunging thousands of homebuyers in Noida and Greater Noida into uncertainty. On July 23, 2019, a two-member Supreme Court bench of justices Arun Mishra and UU Lalit ordered the arrest of promoters Anil Sharma and Shiv Priya, and tasked Venkatramani with reviving seven Amrapali projects in Noida and nine in Greater Noida, which are currently in various stages of development. “It’s a classic case as it set the template for resolution of future disputes between developers and homebuyers. It’s the first case where the Supreme Court took it upon itself to complete the project. The only other template is the case of Unitech where its board of directors was dismissed and replaced with central government nominees for reconstruction of company assets,” said senior advocate ML Lahoty, who represents homebuyers in apex court proceedings. And yet, for the 42,000 people whose dreams of owning a home were put in a limbo by Amrapali’s financial woes, the last two years have brought forth unexpected challenges. Registration of deeds At the time of the Supreme Court order in 2019, around 9,000 Amrapali homebuyers had already moved into their flats after making full payments. In the same order, the apex court also directed that conveyance deeds of all such buyers must be registered within a month. Two years later, hardly 1,600 such deeds have been registered, mostly in the two phases of Amrapali Sapphire, Princely Estate and Platinum, all in Noida, according to data compiled by various residents’ associations. There is no data available on the number of registered deeds on the CR’s portal. Many flat owners say that they are nowhere close to getting legal property rights documented despite endless rounds of document submission and scrutiny. “At least five camps for verification of papers have been held in Silicon City since the Supreme Court order, but we haven’t seen any real progress. No updated data is available. It’s unending torture,” a homebuyer said on condition of anonymity. In a hearing in early 2019, before it appointed Venkatramani as court receiver, the apex court ordered a forensic audit of all transactions of Amrapali group. The report, which contains the list of “undervalued” flats and suspicious transactions, is yet to be put up on the CR’s portal. To be sure, the challenges before Venkatramani were staggering. He had to walk on a legal minefield -- same unit sold to more than one persons, benami transactions, undervalued flats, owners untraceable, arbitrary change in areas of flats for which promoters collected money etc. Another serious problem, allege a cross-section of homebuyers, is the retrospective pricing of flats. For instance, a buyer who managed to get a discount from the erstwhile promoters of Amrapali at the time of booking is being asked to pay the difference now, even though they have made full payments as per the builder-buyer agreement. “This amounts to altogether trashing a legal contract entered into buyer and seller years ago,” said a flat owner, not wishing to be identified. Asked about the fate of homebuyers whose names appeared in the September 5 notice, Venkatramani said, “We are going slow on this. We will take our next action only after a committee appointed by the Supreme Court meets.” He didn’t give a timeline. Stalled projectsVenkatramani informed the Supreme Court on September 3 that a consortium of six banks -- Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of India, Bank of India, UCO Bank, and Punjab and Sind Bank-- had agreed to fund stalled Amrapali projects, which account for 33,000-odd housing units. “We already have funds for works in six projects -- Silicon City-1, Silicon City-2, Crystal Homes, Centurion Low Rise, O2 Valley and Tropical Gardens. Work is going on smoothly and we hope to deliver units on time,” said KP Mahadeva Swamy, the executive director of NBCC (India) Ltd, a Navratna central public sector enterprise assigned the task of project monitoring and construction by the apex court in its July 2019 order. But some residents of partially completed projects have raised doubts over the NBCC’s quality of work, complaining of waterfalls in basements, long power shutdowns without sufficient notice and general lack of accountability. “On September 11, there was a minor blast at the electrical substation at Silicon City that left two of the workers injured and around 10,000 residents in 2,500-odd flats sweating it out without power for over 17 hours. Over the last 2-3 months, the housing society has faced over 100 hours of power shutdowns announced at very short notices,” one of the residents said on condition of anonymity. Asked for a response on NBCC’s working, Venkatramani declined to respond. An NBCC official, asking not to be identified, blamed the delay on the lack of cooperation by electricity distribution companies and other agencies. The official, however, declined to comment on the poor quality of work. Lahoty blamed the delay on paucity of funds despite the Supreme Court’s repeated pleas to the banks. “For the last one year, the court has been asking banks to consider lending for Amrapali projects, but lenders have been shy of committing funds. In one of the recent hearings, the Supreme Court went to the extent of saying that the highest court of the land was the guarantor, after which banks have agreed to release loans. Things look bright now,” he added. No Amrapali representative was available for comment as its directors are still in jail and its offices have been sealed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/amrapali-project-in-noida-fully-paid-up-buyers-told-they-have-pending-payments-101635187389242.html
26-10-2021||Delhi||East Delhi likely to soon get two more CNG crematoriums||East Delhi may soon get two more crematoriums equipped with CNG furnaces. A proposal to set up the facilities in Seemapuri and Jwala Nagar, with the help of NGOs, was cleared by the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) on Monday. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the corporation had set up CNG crematoriums in Ghazipur and Karkardooma Shamshan Bhumi, where two furnaces each are currently operational. The pandemic — especially the second wave when 13,210 people died of Covid-19 in the months of April and May, as per government records— had brought to the fore the glaring need for additional crematoriums.A senior EDMC official from the public health department said the CNG units will provide eco-friendly, economical and faster cremation options. The house also cleared several other policy proposals on Monday including the project of allowing milk booths/kiosks in municipal parks in lieu of handing over the maintenance of select parks, EDMC spokesperson Rakesh Gupta said. The corporation also cleared the proposal to appoint an agency for carrying out bio-mining of 50 lakh tonnes of legacy waste accumulated in Ghazipur landfill site. The agency, which will be selected after inviting open bids, will also be responsible for disposal of excavated material, reclamation of land and development of new engineered landfill facility at the same site. Gupta said a period of 27 months has been fixed for the entire process. The dumpsite in Ghazipur was established in 1984 and it is one of the major landfill sites in the country that has accumulated over 14 million tonnes of legacy waste. The landfill site is spreads over 70 acres and a deadline of September 2024 has been fixed for clearing the entire space. Mayor Shyam Sunder Aggarwal had granted anticipatory approval to this proposal on September 30, 2021.The EDMC house on Monday turned down and “referred back” the proposal from the executive wing to lease out the office space in newly constructed zonal headquarter building in Karkardooma. With construction work of the 12-storey office space nearing completion, the municipal commissioner had proposed to lease out office space of around 1 lakh square feet for revenue generation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/east-delhi-likely-to-soon-get-two-more-cng-crematoriums-101635187332499.html

Officials on Monday said the work on these projects has been completed. Diwali this year will be celebrated on November 4. One of the major projects is an underpass (with a budget of nearly ₹59.33 crore) located at the traffic intersection between sectors 71-72 and 51-52.The officials said that the Noida authority will provide “much-needed relief” to the thousands of daily commuters who have been facing traffic snarls at this point since the work started, as vehicles had to be diverted to the service lane.“The work on the 780metre-long stretch along the road above has been completed and painting works will be finished prior to its opening ahead of Diwali this year. This underpass will provide a smooth commute to at least 50,000 motorists every day on this stretch, which connects Noida with Greater Noida West,” said Rajiv Tyagi, chief general manager of Noida authority.Once ready, the underpass will make the ride from Vikas Marg, the arterial road linking Noida to Greater Noida West, and Vishwakarma Marg, which connects the expressway in the city to Ghaziabad’s Indirapuram, much smoother, officials said.In June 2019, the Noida authority had started working on the project and the original deadline was set for December 2020. It got delayed because of the restrictions in place following the Covid-19 outbreak, according to the officials.The other five projects on the list are a mini stadium in Sarfabad (built at a cost of ₹54.16 crore), developmental work in industrial areas in sectors 145, 151 and 158 (at a cost of ₹39.59 crore), an entry gate at the Noida-Greater Noida border (built at a cost of ₹4.99 crore), and an entry gate between sectors 157 and 159 (built at a cost of ₹1.6 crore).The Noida authority will also inaugurate seven more projects worth nearly ₹480 crore by December-end 2021, before the model code of conduct is put in place in view of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections in 2022, officials added. These projects include a bus terminal in Sector 82 for ₹204 crore, three underpasses on the Noida Expressway for ₹204 crore, resurfacing on the Noida Expressway for ₹61.54 crore, a cow shelter near the Sector 15A park for ₹7.12 crore, and an entry gate at the Kalindi Kunj Delhi-Noida border for ₹2.72 crore.“Thousands of commuters, who use the Noida Expressway, will be benefitted once these underpasses are opened for the public. The work has been fast-tracked, and the projects are scheduled to be ready for use by December-end,” Tyagi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/noida-authority-to-inaugurate-six-infra-projects-before-diwali-101635187329204.html
26-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi man stabbed, friend injured in argument over payment for gutka||In yet another instance of murder and violence over a trivial issue, an 18-year-old man was killed and his friend injured after they were attacked with a sharp weapon on Sunday night in north-east Delhi’s Seemapuri, allegedly by a shopkeeper and his two associates following an argument over payment for a packet of chewing tobacco (gutka).The main attacker, identified as Narsingh, 45, was arrested along with his cousin, Hemant,28, and friend, Mohammad Amir,30. Narshingh and Amir were drunk at the time of the crime, police said. A pair of scissors that Narsingh used to attack the two men has been recovered, the police said.Deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram said around 11.30pm Sunday, the police received information from Guru Teg Bahadur (GTB) hospital that two persons were admitted there with stab wounds. A police team reached the hospital and learnt that one of the injured men, identified by a single name as Shoaib, was declared brought dead. He had suffered a stab wound to the chest, which punctured his heart, the DCP said, quoting doctors. His injured friend was identified also by a single name as Suhail,18, and he suffered a stab wound to his abdomen, the DCP said. A case of murder and attempt to murder was registered and investigation was taken up. During the investigation, the victims’ two friends, Anees and Subhan, told the police that their friend Sameer had gone to buy gutka from a shop in Old Seemapuri around 9.30pm. The kiosk was run by Narsingh, who was consuming liquor with his friend Amir.“Narsingh’s cousin, Hemant, was present at the shop when Sameer went to buy gutka. An altercation broke out between the two over payment for gutka. Hemant put a towel around Sameer’s neck and pulled him. Sameer left after threatening Hemant,” said the DCP, quoting the statement of the arrested persons as well as the victims’ two friends.Police said Sameer informed his friends Anees, Subhan, Suhail, Shoaib and Arshad about the altercation. Thereafter, all six persons went to Narsingh’s shop to teach Hemant a lesson. They overpowered Hemant and began assaulting him. As Amir tried to intervene, they assaulted him as well.“Seeing that, Narshingh picked up a pair of scissors and stabbed Shoaib and Suhail. The six people panicked and ran away. On the way, Shoaib and Suhail complained of breathlessness. They were taken to a local doctor, who referred them to GTB hospital,” said the DCP, adding that the police are looking for Sameer to get his version of the events that led to the fight.This is the sixth case of murder over trivial issues in the city this month. On October 8, a 30-year-old taxi driver was stabbed to death allegedly by his friends after he turned down their request to give them a free ride to their homes in his cab in north-west Delhi’s Sawan Park near Ashok Vihar. Both the alleged attackers were arrested – one by the public from the crime spot and the other following police raids the same night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-man-stabbed-friend-injured-in-argument-over-payment-for-gutka-101635187209082.html

This year, the district also reported the first dengue death on October 19, after a 14-year-old boy died of the vector-borne disease.Rajesh Sharma, district malaria officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, said, “The total number of dengue cases this season has reached 338 so far. There are 52 active cases, and others have been cured. A 14-year-old boy died of dengue on October 19 -- the first such death in the district.”The 14-year-old lived with his family in Noida Sector 12, and was admitted to a nearby private hospital, where he died during treatment. A team from the health department in Gautam Budh Nagar has launched a fogging exercise Noida in Sector 12 following the boy’s death.The rising number of dengue cases in the district is a matter of concern as the number of such cases in Gautam Budh Nagar this year is the highest in the past decade.According to official data, the district health department recorded 14 dengue cases in 2012, 69 in 2013, nil in 2014, 176 in 2015, 17 in 2016, 13 in 2017, 28 in 2018, 40 in 2019, and 28 in 2020.VB Joshi, manager of Kailash Hospital in Noida Sector 27, said that the patients of viral fevers are on the rise this year. “There are nearly 150 patients with viral fevers, and with similar symptoms in the hospital. Some of them are most probably suffering from dengue. We have put additional beds to cater to these patients,” he said.“Dengue cases are being monitored daily, and the situation is under control as the patients are recovering quickly. There are also fewer critical cases... We are carrying out testing in areas where fresh cases are being reported, and conducting extensive fogging and anti-larvae medicine spraying drives,” Sharma said, adding that five rapid response teams (RRTs) have been formed in the district and block levels, to inform and take action on viral fever cases immediately.“We have also advised the people to take precautions to be safe from catching dengue. People should regularly clean areas and prevent mosquito breeding. They should use mosquito nets while sleeping so as to avoid mosquito bites. They should consult doctors if they suffer from symptoms of fever, body ache, joint pain, skin rashes among others,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/with-12-fresh-cases-dengue-tally-in-gautam-budh-nagar-hits-338-1-death-so-far-101635187149158.html
26-10-2021||Other||Uttar Pradesh: Discoms asked to adjust interest on security deposit in electricity bills||Lucknow: Power consumers’ long wait to get the bank interest on their security deposits that they paid to the UP Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) while taking an electricity connection seems to be over now. The UPPCL has finally set in motion the process of feeding the amount of the security deposits in official records and then start paying the same to them, albeit, in a staggered manner. UPPCL managing director Pankaj Kumar has written to all the five state-owned discoms asking them to immediately start feeding consumer’s security deposit amount in computers and start adjusting the same in the electricity bills as per the formula chalked out by the Board of Director on July 29, 2021. According to an estimate, in UP there are around 50 lakh power consumers whose security deposit data have not been fed and never got annual interest payable to them since 2003 when the Electricity Act came into being mandating discoms to pay interest on the security deposit at the prevailing RBI bank rate or more once a year. The UPPCL has not been regular and consistent in paying the interest to other consumers as well. Kumar, in his circular dated October 21, has asked the discom MDs to ensure that the data related to amount of security deposit of 12,10,698 consumers who subscribed to an electricity connection prior to 1993 was entered into official records at the division level within next two months. “Discoms will also ensure feeding of the security deposit amount of 37,94,465 consumers having electricity connections of 2kw and below within two months,” he added. The MD further said that there were 29,725 consumers using power load above 10kw. “These are the consumers whose power connection date is fed, but the security deposit amount is not fed. Discoms must see to it that the interest amount is calculated in respect of all such consumers,” he said, asking discoms to rectify another 16,028 consumers’ inflated security deposit amount. Welcoming the UPPCL’s move, UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad, chairman Awadhesh Kumar Verma, who filed several petitions in the UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) demanding payment of interest to consumers, said, “It is a good decision that will enable lakhs of power consumers to get their lawful due.” A year ago, the consumers’ consolidated security deposits which the five discoms had together stood at ₹3,164.03 crore in 2019. The commission, a few months ago, had also passed an order asking the UPPCL to pay interest on security deposits and warned of action in the event of non-compliance. Security deposit that is refundable on surrender of the power connection is charged, in the case of domestic consumers, at the rate of ₹300per kw. The amount is much higher in case of commercial and industrial consumers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/uttar-pradesh-discoms-asked-to-adjust-interest-on-security-deposit-in-electricity-bills-101635187091366.html

26-10-2021||Other||{Drugs charges on cops} Punjab wants sealed cover reports on role of officers examined||Chandigarh The Punjab government on Monday moved the Punjab and Haryana high court seeking the opening of some sealed cover reports filed on the role of Punjab police officers in drugs cases. The application was taken up by the bench of justice AG Masih and justice AK Verma and posted for hearing on Tuesday, when the main case on the state’s drugs menace, Bhola Drugs Racket is to be taken up for hearing. The court is to examine on Tuesday whether the sealed cover reports on role of influential persons on drugs trafficking submitted in 2017-2018 by the state Special Investigating Team (SIT), the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and a government panel can be opened. Now, the court will also take up Monday’s plea from the state in which government is seeking that one report submitted by another SIT led by S Chattopadhyaya and a report signed singularly by him be opened. These reports were submitted on May 8, 2018. It also demands opening of two more status reports filed on January 30, 2018 and March 15, 2018 submitted by the SIT. All these reports are lying in a sealed cover before registrar judicial of the high court. “The investigating agency could not proceed further against the delinquent officers/ persons whose role has been inquired into at the asking of this court and the reports submitted by the SIT headed by S Chattopadhyaya as well as by (then) STF head Harpreeet Singh Sidhu are lying in sealed covers,” Punjab’s plea says adding that there is urgency to file this plea in public interest, so as to control the drug mafia operating in Punjab and to bring the “delinquent to book”. The Chattopadhyaya, led SIT was roped in by the high court in December 15, 2017 to probe a case involving then Moga SSP Raj Jit Singh Hundal. In this case an inspector and a former DSP were accused. The case was being probed by then special task force on drugs headed by HS Sidhu. As Hundal alleged “implication” at the hands of Sidhu, the high court constituted fresh SIT for this case with Chattopadhyaya and two others, IPS officer, Prabodh Kumar and former IPS officer Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh, as members. TWO REPORTS FILED ON SAME DAY IN 2018 One of the two reports filed on May 8, 2018 by the then Chattopadhyaya before high court in Hundal’s case, deals with the “role” of the then DGP, Suresh Arora and DGP, Dinkar Gupta. However, two other members of SIT Prabodh Kumar and Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh had not associated themselves with this report, which talks about “role” of these two. The second report was signed by all three officers. On May 23, 2018, the high court while taking both the reports on record had said that “all these reports need to be examined in conjunction with reference to the issues formulated by this court or the task assigned to the SIT by way of orders passed from time to time.” The then advocate general Atul Nanda had opposed the report, filed singularly by Chattopadhyaya. After this hearing, the issue of these reports has not been taken up. Pertinently, it was during the hearing of Hundal’s case that Chattopadhyaya, in March 2018, had alleged that he was being “implicated” in the suicide case of Inderpreet Chadha, son of former Chief Khalsa Diwan president Charanjit Singh Chadha, due to his investigation into the drugs case. Acting on his plea, the high court had stayed probe against Chattopadhyaya in the suicide case. Chadha shot himself on January 3, 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/drugs-charges-on-cops-punjab-wants-sealed-cover-reports-on-role-of-officers-examined-101635186848856.html

26-10-2021||Delhi||During Delhi’s Master Plan 2041 public hearing, DDA’s ‘haste’ draws flak||From noise pollution concerns to problems with mixed land use policy, the issues raised by residents on Monday, during the third public hearing on the draft Master Plan of Delhi 2041 (MPD-2041), touched upon the five key subjects of economy, shelter, environment, transport and mobility, and physical infrastructure.The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has divided the public hearings, which are being held online between October 18 and November 10, into nine parts. On Monday, DDA officials invited over 1,200 people to discuss MPD-2041 chapters related to economy, shelter, environment, transport and mobility, and physical infrastructure. The draft MPD-2041, which is the vision document for the city’s development for the next two decades, was put in the public domain in June this year.During the hearing, many questioned the urgency shown by the DDA in completing the entire public consultation process in a hasty manner to finalise the master plan. “The DDA plans to decide the future (the development over the next 20 years) of Delhi citizens in 20 seconds. When there are no Covid restrictions, why is the DDA insisting on holding public hearings online? Why do they want to rush everything? Those belonging to the economically weaker sections are unable to present their views, as they don’t have the equipment or access to internet,” said Vishal Ohri, general secretary, LSC Federation of Delhi, a traders’ body.Refuting the claims made by residents, a senior DDA official said on condition of anonymity, “This is incorrect. All people were given adequate time. Many of them spoke multiple times also.”BS Vohra, president of East Delhi RWA joint front, said he got less than two minutes to put forward his point before DDA officials during the public hearing. Vohra said the entire process is faulty, as the DDA has no data or assessment on existing population, housing, transport requirement, water availability and increase in demand. “They are planning for the next 20 years based on the 2011 Census data. The DDA doesn’t have any data about existing housing. What is the projected demand for housing? How will the water requirement be met? These are questions that DDA should answer first. The MPD should link provision for new developments to availability of water,” said Vohra.Another pressing concern raised by residents’ welfare associations was regarding the provision of mixed land use. Rajiv Kakria, convener of Save Our City campaign, said, “Despite the strong protest of all RWAs and observations by multiple courts, the DDA has not done away with the provision of mixed land use. This provision will turn entire Delhi into a marketplace. This non-stop commercialisation of residential areas needs to stop.”Other RWA members and trader bodies of planned commercial complexes also raised the issue. They said planned commercial centres will not develop if the conversion of residential property for commercial use is allowed.From the Walled City (Old Delhi) areas, traders demanded that the new MPD-2041 have the special area regulations so that properties are protected from the stringent action taken by municipal corporations. “Due to ambiguity in master plan provisions, traders have to live in the fear of sealing. The MPD-2041 should clearly state provisions for pre-1962 markets and properties in Walled City,” said Sanjay Gupta, who has an office in Chandni Chowk.The draft MPD-2041 proposes new policies such as redevelopment of unauthorised colonies, provision for night time economy, promoting nightlife etc. But people said the land-owning agency should fix a timeline for implementing these policies.Bhupender Bazad, member of master plan committee, Delhi Dehat Vikas Manch, said, “There are so many policies such as transit oriented development, land pooling etc., which were proposed in 2013 but are yet to see the light of the day. What’s the point of planning policies, when there is no mechanism in place to ensure its timely implementation? It is the people who suffer due to lack of implementation of policies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/during-delhi-s-master-plan-2041-public-hearing-dda-s-haste-draws-flak-101635186008812.html

The raids were conducted in Delhi, Haryana and Rajasthan by the police’s crime branch.All the accused 32 jail officials were posted in jail number 7 of Tihar, where the Chandra brothers were lodged until the morning of August 28, before being shifted to Arthur Road and Taloja jails in Maharashtra on the orders of the Supreme Court.The accused jail officers include one superintendent, one deputy superintendent, seven assistant superintendent, 10 head warders, 11 warders and two contractual employees. One of the contractual employees is a data entry operator and another is a nursing orderly. Police said they seized cell phones, bank statements and other documents of all the accused during the raids.Confirming the raids, Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said, “Prominent places where crime branch teams conducted search and seizure operations include residences of Unitech Ltd owners, Ramesh Chandra, Ajay Chandra, Sanjay Chandra, and their employees. Search and seizure have also been conducted at the residences of former Superintendent of Tihar Jail No 7, former deputy superintendent, assistant superintendents, head warders, warders and contractual staff of Tihar Jail.”Biswal also added that police have seized evidence in the form of mobile phones and documents: “The investigation is underway.”The Supreme Court had on August 26 asked police commissioner Rakesh Asthana to personally conduct an enquiry and look into the role of jail officers who helped the former Unitech promoters violate prison rules. As part of the probe, Asthana had recorded statements of all jail officers, inspected jail 7 in Tihar and also questioned the former Unitech promoters at the two jails in Maharashtra. After reading Asthana’s enquiry report, the Supreme Court had on October 6 ordered the government to suspend the officers named in the report, and also register an FIR in the case.The Chandra brothers were arrested in April 2017 for duping homebuyers in 74 Unitech projects. The two are also being probed by the Enforcement Directorate. The ED in a report to the apex court in August had said that the two men were instructing their people outside on how to transfer the proceeds of crime. The ED had said that it also unearthed a secret underground office’ in Delhi, which was being operated by erstwhile Unitech founder Ramesh Chandra and visited by his sons Sanjay and Ajay, when they were on parole or bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/raids-at-residences-offices-of-former-unitech-promoters-32-tihar-jail-officers-101635185830163.html

They have not been arrested so far, police said. The incident, latest in a series of snatching cases in which the victims suffered fatal or serious injuries besides losing their property, came to light on Monday.On Monday, Tashi Yangzon Bhutia, who is a native of Darjeeling, visited a private hospital where the doctors told her that she will have to undergo a surgery for her fractured left collarbone that will cost around ₹1 lakh, police said.She said her friend, Tsering Wangmo, who had come to Delhi from Madhya Pradesh’s Indore to buy readymade garments for her business, suffered injuries to her legs and hands. Wangmo returned to Indore on Sunday.Police said the auto driver, identified as Monu, suffered serious head injuries as he was trapped under the toppled auto-rickshaw.According to Delhi Police data, Delhi reported 5,108 snatching cases till 15 this year -- 851 more than what was reported during the same period in 2020.When contacted over phone about Friday’s snatching incident, Wangmo said she was travelling in an auto with Bhutia towards Majnu Ka Tila in north Delhi from East of Kailash in south Delhi. Bhutia was seated on the left side of the rear seat, and was holding her iPhone in her hand. Around 1 pm, when the auto was crossing the Sarai Kale Khan flyover, two bike-borne men wearing helmets started riding parallel to the auto.“Suddenly, the pillion rider tried to snatch my friend’s (Bhutia’s) iPhone from her hand. When she resisted, she slipped and her left leg came out of the auto rickshaw. The sudden jerk caused by my friend resisting the snatchers led to the auto driver losing control over the vehicle. The auto overturned and both of us fell on the road. The auto driver, however, came under the vehicle. The snatchers fled with my sister’s phone,” said Wangmo.According to Wangmo, some passersby stopped and helped them. One of them used her phone to inform the police about the crime. A police team arrived and rushed the three injured to Lal Bahadur Shastri hospital.“After treatment all the three injured were discharged from the hospital. The statements of the injured persons were recorded and accordingly a case of voluntarily causing hurt in committing a robbery and common intention was registered under Indian Penal Code’s sections 394 and 34 at the Sunlight Colony police station. An investigation is on,” said deputy commissioner of police (southeast) Esha Pandey.Bhutia, who has been living in Delhi for the past 11 years and runs a hair extension business, said this is the second such violent incident that she has faced in the city in the past couple of years. According to her, she faced another snatching in north Delhi’s Civil Lines areas, however she did not remember the year.“That time, I was travelling in a cycle-rickshaw and my daughter was sitting in my lap. The criminals tried to snatch my purse. I resisted their attempt. They gave up because my daughter was in my lap and we could have fallen down from the moving rickshaw,” said Bhutia, refusing to speak further on the incident, saying she was in extreme pain because of the fracture.In a series on crime in Delhi in March, HT reported that unemployed, illiterate, school drop-outs, arrested for the first time are common threads that connect almost every person arrested for snatching in Delhi since 2018, highlighting how one of the most serious concerns on the streets of the national capital is also its biggest gateway crime.On February 27 this year, a woman was stabbed to death in north Delhi’s Adarsh Nagar even as she held her two-year-old daughter in her arms while trying to defend herself against snatchers.On August 22, a 38-year-old woman suffered injuries and later succumbed to them after she fell out of a moving e-rickshaw, and dragged on the road by two bike-borne snatchers in outer Delhi’s Mangolpuri. The snatchers fled with her purse containing her cellphone and other articles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/three-injured-as-auto-rickshaw-flips-during-snatching-bid-in-south-delhi-101635185590909.html

26-10-2021||Patna||Bihar bypolls: On fodder from Lalu, Cong tweaks strategy||The state Congress has tweaked its strategy in the middle of campaigning for the October 30 bypolls in Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly constituencies in the wake of its bitter fallout with ally Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), party leaders said.In its bid to paint disparaging remarks by RJD chief Lalu Prasad against All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge of Bihar, Bhakta Charan Das, as an assault on the Dalit self-respect, the state Congress has decided to field senior leaders of the community, including former Lok Sabha speaker Meira Kumar, for the campaign for its nominees, Atirek Kumar and Rajesh Mishra from Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur, respectively.Meira Kumar is likely to join the campaigning from Tuesday. Other party MLAs hailing from scheduled castes (SCs), like Rajesh Ram, Poonam Paswan, Murari Gautam, have been given block-wise responsibility to mobilise Dalit votes for the party. “The outbursts of Prasad reflect RJD’s anti-Dalit mentality,” said former Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Anil Sharma.Former Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU) leader Kanhaiya Kumar, who recently joined Congress, has already been holding public meeting with packed crowds in Tarapur ever since he reached the state on October 22. “Kumar has addressed two public meetings in Kusheshwar Asthan, where he would stay till the last date of campaigning,” said party MLC Prem Chandra Mishra, who has been camping there.The party, insiders say, has also decided to “expose” the anti-Muslim role the erstwhile Janata Dal, of which RJD is an off-shoot, allegedly played in the aftermath of Bhagalpur riots in 1989. BPCC working president Kaukab Quadri is out with his teams of senior Muslim faces of the party, they said. “Popular Urdu poet Imran Pratapgarhi would also adding spice to the party’s electioneering from Tuesday,” said BPCC chief spokesman Rajesh Rathore.Accusing the RJD of back-stabbing minorities, Sharma alleged that then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi took serious exception to the Bhagalpur riots and removed the party’s chief minister and ordered a judicial inquiry. “But Janata Dal not only protected the perpetrators of the riots, but also awarded key conspirators,” alleged Sharma, adding that the Congress has finally freed itself of RJD’s clutches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-bypolls-on-fodder-from-lalu-cong-tweaks-strategy-101635178208106.html
26-10-2021||Lucknow||Health infra mission will prepare country to fight future pandemics, says PM||VARANASI Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said that the ₹64,000-crore Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission will also prepare the country to fight future pandemics.“Ayushman Bharat Mission has been launched to give strength to the health infrastructure of the country, including UP, so that there are high level preparations to prevent and deal with future pandemics. This also aims at bringing self-confidence and self-reliance in our healthcare system,” said Modi while launching the national medical infrastructure mission during his visit to Varanasi.The PM also inaugurated various development projects worth more than ₹5,200 crore for his constituency, while addressing a public rally in Varanasi. “No other place could be better than Kashi for launching the mission as it is the abode of Lord Shiva and Shakti,” he said. “After independence, for a long period, health facilities and infrastructure were not given much attention. The previous governments deprived the country’s healthcare system of facilities,“ alleged Modi. He said villages lacked hospitals while hospitals at block level lacked testing facilities and district hospitals didn’t have facilities for treatment of serious diseases.“In big hospitals, there were long queues and patients had to wait for long. There were shortcomings in the healthcare system,” he added. The PM said there were three major aspects of the Ayushman Bharat Mission to address gaps in the health sector. The first was related to the creation of elaborate facilities for diagnostics and treatment. Under this, health and wellness centres were being opened in villages and cities to provide facilities for early detection of diseases. The second aspect of the scheme was related to the testing network for diagnosis of diseases. A total of 730 districts of the country would get integrated public health labs and 3,000 blocks would get block public health units. Apart from that, five regional national centres for disease control, 20 metropolitan units, and 15 BSL labs will further strengthen this network, said Modi.The third aspect, according to the PM, was the expansion of existing research institutions that study pandemics. The existing 80 viral diagnostic and research labs will be strengthened, 15 bio-safety level labs will be operationalised, four new national institutes of virology and a national institute for health were being established. “This means, through PM Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission, an entire ecosystem for services – from treatment to critical research will be created in every corner of the country,” he said.“Our government understands the pain of the exploited, deprived and backward lot. Earlier, public money used to go into scams, but today it is being used for big projects, said the PM. He added: “The speed with which new medical colleges are being opened in UP will have great impact on the number of medical seats and doctors. Due to more seats, children of poor parents will also be able to dream of becoming doctors and fulfill it.” .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/pm-health-infra-mission-to-prepare-country-to-fight-future-pandemics-101635173467524.html
26-10-2021||World||Urging all Europe govts, rest of world to help us get evacuated Afghan athletes new home: FIFA||FIFA is calling on the international community to step up efforts to help permanently rehome Afghan athletes after the Taliban takeover of their country, its president Gianni Infantino said.More than 150 members of Afghanistan's sports community -- including 50 female footballers -- and their families were evacuated this month with the help of Qatar, in coordination with the global football body.Hundreds remain in Afghanistan, pleading for help to leave the country."I really call on all the governments in Europe, in the rest of the world, to help us (in) getting a new house, a new home" for those evacuated, Infantino told AFP in an interview."We cannot just talk about solidarity, we cannot just talk about helping. We have to do it concretely," he said in Doha."They went through something that none of us can imagine, and we managed to get them out."The Taliban overthrew Afghanistan's former US-backed government in August and have since been trying to win backing and financial support for their Islamist regime, promising a more flexible rule than last time.But with some women still effectively banned from work, fear of reprisals for practising sport is widespread.And although they have yet to publicise a formal policy on women in sport, the Taliban have made comments that indicate serious participation will be impossible.‘Girls are also human’When they last ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, the Taliban banned women from sporting activity and even going to matches.Sports stadiums were regularly used for public executions.The all-male Taliban government has shut down the ministry of women's affairs and replaced it with one that earned notoriety for enforcing religious doctrine during the hardliners' first stint in power.The Taliban have since denied the removal of the ministry, insisting they were "arranging a framework for it".Joyce Cook, FIFA's chief social responsibility and education officer, said the 158 people from the sports community and their families would head from Doha to Albania until a permanent solution is reached.They are part of a list of 545 people who are seeking to leave, she said."We really need countries to come forward now," Cook told AFP, adding that the "biggest challenge now is to find permanent countries" for their resettlement."FIFA has 211 member associations, that's 211 countries, and we're calling on all of those countries to help us now."In Afghanistan, women have long faced open hostility to their involvement in sport and, in rural areas, it is extremely rare for them to participate.Even in cities, many women's leagues are at a fledgling stage.One 24-year-old woman who has been playing with the national football team since 2011 said everything changed for her when the Taliban seized power in mid-August."There are very narrow-minded people (who think) girls are nothing... I want to show them that girls are also human... this is why I joined football," she said, declining to be identified."It was hard, even for my family... slowly, slowly they started to support me, but sometimes the situation became tough," said the woman, who is also a young medical professional and used to run a clinic in Afghanistan.Dreaming of CanadaWith arms and legs full of bruises from training on concrete for hours on end, she said football was "like a relaxing medicine".Using water bottles to mark their goals, her team now plays in flip-flops and jeans in a compound in Doha, all sharing the same hopes."I and the other girls with me, we have a dream that we will go to Canada," she said.Some members of the Afghan women's youth football team and their families have already sought refuge in Portugal and are back training in the Lisbon suburbs."If Canada, United States, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand... if they could give us a signal and welcome some of these girls, I think it would be a fantastic message of solidarity and unity that only football can bring," Infantino said.Australia and New Zealand are hosting the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2023, while the US, Mexico and Canada will host the 2026 men's World Cup.For Cook, the stories of the Afghan athletes reflect "a humanitarian tragedy"."It's heartbreaking to hear their stories. And it's heartbreaking to try to be in their shoes and try to imagine how they must be feeling," she said."These are people who deserve to be able to start a new life."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fifa-urges-international-community-to-help-in-getting-afghan-athletes-new-home-101635270515228.html

China is among the very few which seem to have started engaging with the outfit. Other members of the international community are taking a wait and watch approach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-provides-1-mn-to-afghanistan-after-wang-yi-mullah-baradar-meet-in-doha-101635259662354.html
26-10-2021||World||Iran says cyberattack closes gas stations across country||A cyberattack crippled gas stations across Iran on Tuesday, leaving angry motorists stranded in long lines.No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which rendered useless the government-issued electronic cards that many Iranians use to buy subsidized fuel at the pump.It bore similarities to another attack months earlier that seemed to directly challenge Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the country's economy buckles under American sanctions. Those economic problems worsen as the U.S. and Iran have yet to jointly re-enter Tehran's tattered nuclear deal with world powers.State television quoted an unnamed official in the country's National Security Council acknowledging the cyberattack, hours after it aired images of long lines of cars waiting to fill up in Tehran. Associated Press journalists also saw lines of cars at Tehran gas stations, with the pumps off and the station closed.“I have been waiting a couple of hours for the gas stations to reopen so that I can fill up," said a motorcyclist who gave his name only as Farzin. "There is no fuel wherever I go.”The semiofficial ISNA news agency, which first called the incident a cyberattack, said it saw those trying to buy fuel with a government-issued card through the machines instead receive a message reading “cyberattack 64411.” Most Iranians rely on those subsidies to fuel their vehicles, particularly amid the country's economic problems.While ISNA didn't acknowledge the number's significance, that number is associated with a hotline run through Khamenei's office that handles questions about Islamic law. ISNA later removed its reports, claiming that it too had been hacked. Such claims of hacking can come quickly when Iranian outlets publish news that angers the theocracy.Farsi-language satellite channels abroad published videos apparently shot by drivers in Isfahan, a major Iranian city, showing electronic billboards there reading: “Khamenei! Where is our gas?” Another said: “Free gas in Jamaran gas station,” a reference to the home of the late Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.State TV said Oil Ministry officials were holding an “emergency meeting” to solve the problem. Some gas stations that accept only cash and are not in the subsidy card network continued pumping fuel.The use of the number “64411” mirrored an attack in July targeting Iran's railroad system that also saw the number displayed. Israeli cybersecurity firm Check Point later attributed the train attack to a group of hackers that called themselves Indra, after the Hindu god of war.Indra previously targeted firms in Syria, where President Bashar Assad has held onto power through Iran's intervention in his country's grinding war.Cheap gasoline is practically considered a birthright in Iran, home to the world’s fourth-largest crude oil reserves despite decades of economic woes.Subsidies allow Iranian motorists to buy regular gasoline at 15,000 rials per liter. That’s 5 cents a liter, or about 20 cents a gallon. After a monthly 60-liter quota, it costs 30,000 rials a liter. That’s 10 cents a liter or 41 cents a gallon. Regular gasoline costs 89 cents a liter or $3.38 a gallon on average in the U.S., according to AAA.In 2019, Iran faced days of mass protests across some 100 cities and towns over gasoline prices rising. Security forces arrested thousands and Amnesty International said it believes 304 people were killed in a government crackdown. Tuesday's cyberattack came in the same month in the Persian calendar as the gasoline protests in 2019.The attack also came on the birthday of the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi who, stricken with cancer, fled the country in 1979 just before the Islamic Revolution.Iran has faced a series of cyberattacks, including one that leaked video of abuses at its notorious Evin prison in August.The country disconnected much of its government infrastructure from the internet after the Stuxnet computer virus — widely believed to be a joint U.S.-Israeli creation — disrupted thousands of Iranian centrifuges in the country’s nuclear sites in the late 2000s.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-cyberattack-closes-gas-stations-across-country-101635259182421.html
26-10-2021||World||Pak PM Imran Khan clears appointment of Lt Gen Nadeem Anjum as ISI chief||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday approved the appointment of lieutenant general Nadeem Ahmed Anjum as the new director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), nearly three weeks after the military announced a major reshuffle in its top brass. Lt Gen Anjum will take over the reins of the spy agency from November 20. Incumbent ISI chief Faiz Hameed will continue in his position till November 19, according to the notification issued by Imran Khan's office.The formal announcement from the Pakistan prime minister’s office was issued on Tuesday evening but earlier in October Pakistan military's media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations issued a notification announcing lieutenant general Anjum’s elevation as the chief of Pakistan's spy agency.Earlier on Tuesday, before the notification was issued by the prime minister's office, lieutenant general Faiz Hameed, Pakistan army chief general Qamar Javed Bajwa and PM Imran Khan met at the ISI Secretariat, people familiar with the developments told Geo News.Anjum belongs to the Punjab regiment of the Pakistan army and has also served as a commander of the Karachi corps. He has led several expeditions in Balochistan against elements which Pakistan perceives as a threat to the nation’s security. Lt Gen Anjum also held command postings in the eastern border of Pakistan i.e. the Line of Control (LoC). His subordinates often refer to him as the ‘man with glacier brain but sharp reflexes’, according to reports by Pakistani news agencies. A graduate of the Royal College of Defense Studies in the UK, Anjum also holds a degree from the Asia-Pacific Centre for Security Studies, Honolulu.The announcement made earlier by the Pakistan military's media wing led to speculations that there could be differences between the Imran Khan-led government and the country's army, which is influential when it comes to the nation’s security and foreign policy-related matters. Acknowledging that there were some "technical issues" between Imran Khan's office and the Pakistani army, the former earlier said that issues would soon be resolved, people familiar with the developments told Pakistani news agency Geo News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-pm-imran-khan-clears-appointment-of-lt-gen-nadeem-anjum-as-isi-chief-101635254506144.html

It's like we are on the game, hearing the music and seeing this doll,” Seoul resident from the Philippines, Sung Hye-jin, said, standing in front of the doll.From toddlers to adults to even dogs, some park visitors were seen wearing green tracksuits with number tag ‘456’, similar to the outfits of show's main character."I really enjoyed the show, so came here wearing this costume for Halloween,” said South Korean resident Ko Dae-hwan, dressed in green.'Squid Game' has been watched by 142 million households since its September 17 debut, helping Netflix add 4.38 million new subscribers.The doll is planned to be displayed at the park until November 21, according to a park official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/red-light-green-light-squid-game-doll-at-seoul-park-draws-fans-101635251143453.html
26-10-2021||World||Xi Jinping, Imran Khan discuss CPEC in phone call||Chinese President Xi Jinping told Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday that the two countries will “unleash” the positive effects of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which is strongly opposed by India since several projects under it are coming up in Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK).Xi Jinping and Imran Khan discussed a range of issues, including CPEC and the ongoing situation in Afghanistan during a phone call on Tuesday, according to a readout shared by official Chinese media.“We will continue to unleash the positive effects of the corridor in promoting growth and improving people’s well-being,” the Chinese president told Imran Khan, according to the official Xinhua news agency. He reiterated CPEC’s strategic role in bilateral ties, adding that “history has fully proved that the two countries are each other’s most reliable iron-clad brother”.The two countries will “jointly build the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor with high quality and strengthen their cooperation in such fields as agriculture, digital economy and people’s livelihood”, Xi Jinping further told the Pakistan’s prime minister, calling on the “two countries to stand together even more firmly and push forward the all-weather strategic cooperative partnership between the two sides, and build a closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era”.The CPEC is a flagship project under China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which New Delhi has opposed as it violates India’s territorial sovereignty. Beijing has paid little attention to New Delhi’s serious reservations about the CPEC and have pumped in billions in money and resources in building infrastructure projects under the economic corridor.In a separate statement issued by the Pakistan’s foreign ministry, Imran Khan “lauded the successful, timely and high-quality implementation of the CPEC projects, and welcomed Chinese investments in the CPEC Special Economic Zones”.He “underscored that early start of work on the ML-1 railway project would complement Pakistan’s geo-economics vision for national and regional development”, according to the Pakistani press readout.The Chinese readout did not share details on what the two leaders discussed on Afghanistan, where Beijing and Islamabad are closely communicating with the Taliban government.In a rare move, however, the leaders of the two countries appealed for international aid for Afghanistan, a statement from the Pakistan foreign ministry said. “Regarding the situation in Afghanistan, both leaders called on the international community to provide immediate humanitarian and economic assistance to the Afghan people to alleviate their suffering, prevent instability and flight of people, as well as continued engagement for the rebuilding of the country,” the statement said.The appeal came as Chinese state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi held two days of talks with Taliban representatives in Doha, Qatar.The Chinese president “noted that the two sides should strengthen counterterrorism and security cooperation”, Xinhua reported.The two sides should maintain close strategic communication, further synergize development strategies and enhance the sharing of experience on governance, Xi Jinping said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-imran-khan-discuss-cpec-in-phone-call-101635250095042.html

This included the proud father telling reporters after viewing his newborn daughter: "She's cute. She looks like me."Mako was followed three years later by her sister Kako, and the two were joined by their brother Hisahito in 2006, the first male born to the imperial family since 1965.Though Mako initially followed royal tradition and attended the elite Gakushuin school through the end of high school, she broke with custom by not continuing at the institution for her university studies, choosing instead to attend Tokyo's International Christian University.She graduated in 2014 with a degree in art and cultural studies, having spent a year abroad at the University of Edinburgh. She later obtained a master's degree in Art Museum and Gallery studies.Mako first met Komuro at a meeting of students planning to go abroad in 2012.Also Read | Japan's Princess Mako, the emperor's niece, finally marries college sweetheart after battling scandals and PTSDKEI KOMUROKomuro was raised by a single mother, with some media reports saying part of his education was funded by his mother's former fiance.At one point, he earned some money by working for tourism promotion near Tokyo.Trouble erupted a few months after he and Mako announced their engagement in 2017, when tabloids reported a financial dispute between Komuro's mother and her former fiance, with the man claiming mother and son had failed to repay a debt of about $35,000.Komuro later said the money had been a gift, not a loan. But in 2021, he submitted a 24-page explanation and later reportedly said he would pay a settlement.In September 2018, he left for studies at New York's Fordham University and didn't return until September this year, after having graduated from law school and started working at a New York law firm. He took the bar exam in July, with results due in December.When he returned to Japan, he was dressed casually and sporting long hair drawn back in a ponytail, setting off a media frenzy because it was deemed "disrespectful".But on Tuesday morning, ponytail shorn and dressed in a crisp dark suit and tie, he left to claim his bride. Most of his face was covered with a mask in line with Japan's coronavirus protocol, but he looked happy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-are-japan-s-princess-mako-and-her-husband-kei-komuro-101635249503347.html
26-10-2021||World||Former South Korean president Roh Tae-woo dies at 88||Former South Korean President Roh Tae-woo, a major player in a 1979 coup who later became president in a landmark democratic election before ending his tumultuous political career in prison, died in hospital on Tuesday in the capital of Seoul. He was 88.Roh, who ruled South Korea as president from 1988-1993, died of complications from various illnesses after his condition worsened while dealing with a degenerative disorder, Kim Yon-su, head of Seoul National University Hospital, told a news conference.Roh was a key participant in the December 1979 military coup that made his army friend and coup leader Chun Doo-hwan president after their mentor, dictator Park Chung-hee, was assassinated following 18 years of rule.Roh led his army division into Seoul and joined other military leaders for operations to seize the capital. In the following year, the military under Chun and other coup leaders launched a bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in the southern city of Gwangju, killing about 200 people, in one of the darkest moments in South Korea's turbulent modern history.Roh was Chun’s hand-picked successor, which would have assured him the presidency in an easy indirect election. But a massive pro-democracy uprising in 1987 forced Roh and Chun to accept a direct presidential election that was regarded as the start of South Korea’s transition to democracy.Despite his military background, Roh built a moderate and genial image during the campaign, calling himself an “average person.” He eventually won the hotly contested election in December 1987, largely thanks to a split in liberal votes between opposition candidates Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung, who both later became presidents.During his five-year term, Roh aggressively pursued ties with communist nations under his “Northward Diplomacy” as communism fell in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union dissolved.South Korea was then deeply anti-communist because of its rivalry with North Korea, but under Roh it opened diplomatic relations with a communist nation for the first time — Hungary in 1989, the year when the Berlin Wall fell and communism crumbled across Eastern Europe.Roh’s government established relations with the Soviet Union in 1990 and with China in 1992. Relations with North Korea improved under Roh, with the two sides holding their first-ever prime ministers’ talks, adopting a landmark joint statement on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and joining the United Nations at the same time.Earlier, Roh oversaw the hosting of the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, the final Olympics of the Cold War era that showed how South Korea had rebuilt itself from the ashes of the 1950-53 Korean War. North Korea boycotted the 1988 games.Ties between the two Koreas have since suffered ups and downs. Despite numerous denuclearization pledges — including one made during Roh’s presidency — North Korea still maintains its nuclear weapons program which it views as a means of survival.On domestic politics, Roh was seen by many as lacking charismatic and aggressive leadership. His nickname, “Mul (Water) Tae-woo,” implied his administration had no color and no taste. He still brought more openness by allowing more political criticism, in contrast with his authoritarian predecessors, Park and Chun. The governments led by Park and Chun often used security laws to suppress political opponents and restrict speech under the pretext of guarding against civil disorder and North Korean threats.After his successor, Kim Young-sam, investigated the coup and military-led crackdown, Roh was arrested, convicted of mutiny, treason and corruption and received a 22-year and six-month prison term. Chun was sentenced to death.The Supreme Court reduced those sentences to life imprisonment for Chun and 17 years for Roh. After spending about two years in prison, both Roh and Chun were released in late 1997 under a special pardon requested by then President-elect Kim Dae-jung, who sought national reconciliation amid an Asian financial crisis.Roh had stayed mostly out of the public eye following his release from prison, refraining from political activities and speeches. In recent years, he suffered prostate cancer, asthma, cerebellar atrophy and other health problems.Last April, his daughter, Roh So-young, wrote on Facebook that her father had been bed-bound over the past 10 years without being able to speak or move his body. She said her father sometimes made eye gestures for communications but looked to “have a tearful face” when he failed to express his feelings and thoughts properly.Roh’s son, Roh Jae-heon, repeatedly offered an apology over the 1980 crackdowns and visited a Gwangju cemetery to pay respects to the victims buried there on behalf of his bed-ridden father.But unlike Roh’s family, Chun, who reportedly suffers Alzheimer’s disease and a blood cancer, has yet to apologize over the crackdowns.Last August, Chun appeared at a Gwangju court to defend himself against charges that he defamed a now-deceased Catholic priest who had testified to seeing Chun’s troops shooting at protesters from helicopters in Gwangju. Chun left the court after 20 minutes, complaining of breathing problems. In his memoir, Chun called the priest “a shameless liar.”Both Roh and Chun were earlier ordered by a court to pay back hundreds of millions of dollars they collected illegally. Roh has paid back his shares but Chun hasn’t done so, according to South Korean media reports.Roh is survived by his wife and their two children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-south-korean-president-roh-tae-woo-dies-at-88-101635247230348.html
26-10-2021||World||'Malicious slander': North Korea dismisses UN rights investigator report||A report this month by a United Nations rights investigator expressing concern about the human rights and humanitarian situation in North Korea is "malicious slander", a North Korean organisation said on Tuesday.In his latest report, Tomas Ojea Quintana, U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in North Korea, said the country's most vulnerable people risk starvation after it slipped deeper into isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic.Ojea Quintana said international sanctions imposed over North Korea's nuclear weapons programme should be eased to provide more aid, but he also criticized abuses such as political prison camps and said self-imposed border lockdowns to prevent a Covid-19 outbreak had worsened conditions."The 'special rapporteur', not being content with distorting our reality, has pointed a finger at our 'people's livelihood' and viciously picked on the most realistic and appropriate anti-epidemic measures taken by our state for our own specific need in order to cope with the global epidemic," an unidentified spokesperson for the Korea Association for Human Rights Studies said in a statement carried by state news agency KCNA.The statement said North Korea does not recognise Ojea Quintana's mandate, and accused him of being part of a US-backed scheme to interfere with the internal affairs of other countries."Our state takes full responsibility for the life security and livelihood of our people, and we have never asked anyone to worry about the living conditions of our people," the statement said.Leader Kim Jong Un said in June the food situation was “tense” because of natural disasters last year, and acknowledged that citizens had faced sacrifices during the pandemic.North Korea has not reported any Covid-19 cases and has imposed strict anti-virus measures, including border closures and domestic travel curbs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/-malicious-slander-north-korea-dismisses-un-rights-investigator-report-101635241418069.html
26-10-2021||World||Hong Kong convicts 2nd person under national security law for pro-independence slogans||Hong Kong has convicted a second person under its sweeping national security law for chanting pro-independence slogans, amid a political crackdown in the city.Ma Chun-man was convicted of inciting secession on Monday after he was found to have chanted slogans such as “Hong Kong independence, the only way out” on 20 occasions between August and November of last year.Critics in Hong Kong say the National Security Law erodes freedoms, such as those of expression and assembly, that were promised to the city for 50 years when the former British colony was handed over to China in 1997.Ma is the second person to be convicted under the new law, which outlaws what authorities describe as secession, subversion of state power, terrorism, and foreign collusion in intervening in Hong Kong's affairs.Ma had been arrested multiple times for chanting such slogans before being remanded in custody.Sentencing for Ma was adjourned to Nov. 11, and he faces up to seven years in jail.Tong Ying-kit, the first person to be convicted under the national security law, was jailed for nine years for inciting secession and terrorism after he drove his motorcycle into a group of police officers last July while bearing a flag with the banned slogan “Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times.”The majority of the city's prominent pro-democracy activists have been arrested for taking part in unauthorized assemblies, and dozens of political organizations and trade unions have ceased operation out of concern for their members' safety under the security law.Over 120 people have been arrested under the security law since it was implemented last June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-convicts-2nd-person-under-national-security-law-for-pro-independence-slogans-101635230443653.html
26-10-2021||World||China re-imposes fresh lockdowns amid rising Covid-19 cases||China is re-imposing fresh lockdowns amid rising Covid-19 infections, the country recorded more than 100 cases across 11 provinces over the last week."Since October 17, there have been multiple scattered local outbreaks in China, and they're expanding rapidly," Mi Feng, a spokesman at the National Health Commission (NHC), said at a news conference Sunday. "There is an increasing risk that the outbreak will spread even further," reported CNN.The rapid spread comes despite about 75 per cent of China's population -- of more than a billion people -- being fully vaccinated, according to Mi.The spread of coronavirus infections worried the Chinese government, which insists on a strict zero-Covid policy to stamp out infections.The outbreak was first detected on October 16 among a tour group of fully vaccinated senior citizens from Shanghai who travelled in several northern regions. Among the 133 infections reported as of Sunday, 106 were linked to 13 tour groups, according to Mi, the NHC health official, reported CNN.Infections have been reported in nearly a third of the country's provinces and regions, with all medium- and high-risk regions concentrated in Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia, Guizhou and Beijing.Authorities have banned travel agencies from organising cross-provincial tours in these regions.On Sunday, the Chinese capital tightened entry restrictions into the city, requiring travellers from places with confirmed cases to present a negative coronavirus test and undergo 14 days of health monitoring, reported CNN.The city has recorded 14 confirmed cases in the latest outbreak, including 12 over the past three days, according to a CNN tally of the Beijing Municipal Health Commission's daily reports.A widespread Covid outbreak in Beijing would be the last thing Chinese leaders want to see as the city gears up for the 2022 Winter Olympics in February.The Chinese authorities in Beijing are making an example of six residents who allegedly broke Covid rules with criminal detentions.Among them, two went out to eat and invited friends home for mahjong despite having developed fevers upon returning from a Covid-infected tourist destination in Inner Mongolia. Another two tried to climb over the fences of their locked-down gated community, reported CNN.The city also suspended a marathon originally scheduled for October 31. It has not announced a new date for the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-re-imposes-fresh-lockdowns-amid-rising-covid-19-cases-101635229323990.html
26-10-2021||World||Asia suffered hottest year on record in 2020: UN||Asia suffered its hottest year on record in 2020, the United Nations said Tuesday ahead of the COP26 summit, with extreme weather taking a heavy toll on the continent's development.In its annual "State of the Climate in Asia" report, the UN's World Meteorological Organization said every part of the region had been affected."Extreme weather and climate change impacts across Asia in 2020 caused the loss of life of thousands of people, displaced millions of others and cost hundreds of billions of dollars, while wreaking a heavy toll on infrastructure and ecosystems," the WMO said."Sustainable development is threatened, with food and water insecurity, health risks and environmental degradation on the rise."The report comes days before COP26, the UN Climate Change Conference being held in Glasgow from Sunday to November 12.The report also laid bare the total annual average losses due to climate-related hazards.China suffered an estimated $238 billion, followed by India at $87 billion, Japan with $83 billion and South Korea on $24 billion.But when the size of the economy is considered, the average annual losses are expected to be as high as 7.9 percent of gross domestic product for Tajikistan, 5.9 percent for Cambodia and 5.8 percent for Laos.Increased heat and humidity are forecast to lead to an effective loss of outdoor working hours across the continent, with a potential cost of many billions of dollars."Weather and climate hazards, especially floods, storms, and droughts, had significant impacts in many countries of the region," said WMO chief Petteri Taalas."Combined, these impacts take a significant toll on long-term sustainable development."Many weather and climate-related displacements in Asia are prolonged, with people unable to return home or integrate locally, the report said.In 2020 floods and storms affected approximately 50 million people in Asia, resulting in more than 5,000 fatalities.This is below the annual average of the last two decades (158 million people affected and about 15,500 fatalities) "and is testimony to the success of early warning systems in many countries in Asia", with around seven in 10 people covered.Asia's warmest year on record saw the mean temperature 1.39 degrees Celsius above the 1981-2010 average.The 38.0 C registered at Verkhoyansk in Russia is provisionally the highest known temperature anywhere north of the Arctic Circle.In 2020, average sea surface temperatures reached record high values in the Indian, Pacific and Arctic Oceans.Sea surface temperatures and ocean warming in and around Asia are increasing more than the global average.They have been warming at more than triple the average in the Arabian sea, and parts of the Arctic Ocean.Arctic sea ice minimum extent (after the summer melt) in 2020 was the second lowest on the satellite record since 1979.There are approximately 100,000 square kilometres of glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau and in the Himalayas -- the largest volumes of ice outside the polar regions and the source of 10 major Asian rivers."Glacier retreat is accelerating and it is projected that glacier mass will decrease by 20 percent to 40 percent by 2050, affecting the lives and livelihoods of about 750 million people in the region," the report said."This has major ramifications for global sea level, regional water cycles and local hazards such as landslides and avalanches."A quarter of Asia's mangroves are in Bangladesh. However, the tropical storm-exposed country's mangroves decreased by 19 percent from 1992 to 2019, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asia-suffered-hottest-year-on-record-in-2020-un-101635227812120.html
26-10-2021||World||Japan's Princess Mako, the emperor's niece, finally marries college sweetheart after battling scandals and PTSD||Japan's Princess Mako, the emperor's niece, has married her commoner college sweetheart on Tuesday and left the royal family after a years-long engagement beset by the scrutiny that has left the princess with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Mako and fiance Kei Komuro, both 30, announced their engagement four years ago, a move initially cheered by the country. But things soon turned sour as tabloids reported on a money scandal involving Komuro's mother, prompting the press to turn on him. The marriage was postponed, and he left Japan for law studies in New York in 2018 only to return in September.Their marriage consisted of an official from the Imperial Household Agency (IHA), which runs the family's lives, submitting paperwork to a local office in the morning, foregoing the numerous rituals and ceremonies usual to royal weddings, including a reception.Mako also refused to receive a one-off payment of about $1.3 million typically made to royal women who marry commoners and become ordinary citizens, in line with Japanese law.Television footage showed Mako, wearing a pastel dress and pearls, saying goodbye to her parents and 26-year-old sister, Kako, at the entrance to their home. Though all wore masks in line with Japan's coronavirus protocol, her mother could be seen blinking rapidly, as if to fight off tears.Though Mako bowed formally to her parents, her sister grabbed her shoulders and the two shared a long embrace.In the afternoon, Mako and her new husband will hold a news conference, which will also depart from customs. While royals typically answer pre-submitted questions at such events, the couple will make a brief statement and hand out written replies to the questions instead."Some of the questions took mistaken information as fact and upset the princess," said officials at the IHA, according to NHK public television.Komuro, dressed in a crisp dark suit and tie, bowed briefly to camera crews gathered outside his home as he left in the morning but said nothing. His casual demeanour on returning to Japan, including long hair tied back in a ponytail, had sent tabloids into a frenzy.Money scandalJust months after the two announced their engagement at a news conference where their smiles won the hearts of the nation, tabloids reported a financial dispute between Komuro's mother and her former fiance, with the man claiming mother and son had not repaid a debt of about $35,000.The scandal spread to mainstream media after the IHA failed to provide a clear explanation. In 2021, Komuro issued a 24-page statement on the matter and also said he would pay a settlement.Public opinion polls show the Japanese are divided about marriage, and there has been at least one protest.Analysts say the problem is that the imperial family is so idealised that not the slightest hint of trouble with things such as money or politics should touch them.The fact that Mako's father and younger brother, Hisahito, are both in the line of succession after Emperor Naruhito, whose daughter is ineligible to inherit, makes the scandal particularly damaging, said Hideya Kawanishi, an associate professor of history at Nagoya University."Though it's true they'll both be private citizens, Mako's younger brother will one day become emperor, so some people thought anybody with the problems he (Komuro) had shouldn't be marrying her," Kawanishi added.The two will live in New York, though Mako will remain on her own in Tokyo for some time after the wedding to prepare for the move, including applying for the first passport of her life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japans-princess-mako-the-emperor-s-niece-finally-marries-college-sweetheart-after-battling-scandals-and-ptsd-101635226467986.html
26-10-2021||World||Covid-19: To travel to United States, get fully vaccinated||Indians planning to undertake air-travel to the United States starting November 8 are required to be fully vaccinated under a new protocol released by the Biden administration on Monday for all incoming non-citizen and non-immigrant international travellers.Children under-18 will be exempted as are participants in clinical trials, people with certain contraindications to the vaccine and those in need to travel in emergency or for humanitarian reason, which will have to be certified by the US government. They will still have to undergo tests for Covid-19, except children below 2.The onus for implementing the new travel rules, which were announced earlier but are now been operationalised, will be on airlines bringing travellers to the United States, much in the same fashion as the mandatory testing requirement they have been enforcing.“We’re taking an important step forward in operationalising this new system as it relates to international air travel by releasing a series of documents that will help airlines and travellers get ready for November 8 and ensure a smooth transition to the new system,” a senior Biden administration official said to reporters previewing the regulation.The United States is a popular destination for international travellers for business, tourism, studies, medical and other reasons. It got nearly 80 million international visitors in 2019, the year before Covid-19 shut down international travel to and from the United States, barring exceptions episodically.According to the latest data available 1.2 million Indians visited the US in 2017, which was 6.5% more than in 2016.Travellers to the US are currently required to provide a current negative test result for Covid-19 before they are allowed to board the flight.Under the new protocol, airlines will required travellers to furnish proof of vaccination issued by an official source - for example, the fact sheet said public health agency, government agency - in the country where the vaccine was given.All travellers - US citizens, non-citizens, immigrants and non-immigrants - will also be required to produce a negative test for Covid-19, done in the past 24 hours. The airlines will only accept WHO-approved vaccines. “Individuals can be considered fully vaccinated ≥2 weeks (more than two weeks) after receipt of the last dose if they have received any single dose of an FDA approved/authorised or WHO EUL (emergency use listing) approved single-dose series (i.e., Janssen), or any combination of two doses of an FDA-approved/authorised or WHO emergency use listed Covid-19 two-dose series (i.e. mixing and matching),” the White House said.WHO recognises 10 vaccines. One of them is the Serum Institute of India’s Covidshield, which is the widely administered Indian version of AstraZeneca’s vaccine that the US has not approved but pre-ordered million of doses for its stockpile.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-to-travel-to-united-states-get-fully-vaccinated-101635221413278.html
26-10-2021||World||Sudan coup generals determined not to lose long-held power, say analysts||By ousting senior civilian figures and disrupting a transition to democracy, Sudan's generals have ensured they maintain control in the East African country, as they have for most of its post-independence history, analysts say.On Monday security forces detained civilian leaders, including Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, who have shared power with the military following the ouster of the autocratic president Field Marshal Omar al-Bashir more than two years ago.General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan declared a state of emergency and dissolved the cabinet, as well as the ruling Sovereign Council of military and civilian figures which he has led since August 2019.The Council was supposed to pave the way for full civilian rule.Since its independence from Britain and Egypt in 1956, Sudan has experienced rare democratic interludes, but overwhelmingly years of rule under military leaders.The latest putsch "looks very much like an attempt by the security forces to maintain control over economic and political interests, and to resist the flip" to a civilian order, said Jonas Horner of the International Crisis Group.The army's move "epitomises their fears" of civilian rule "in a country which was under the control of the military for 52 out of its 65 years of independence," Horner said.To Magdi el-Gizouli of the Rift Valley Institute "the coup was far from surprising".The Sovereign Council ruled the country alongside a transitional government led by Hamdok, an economist, but the role of civilian leaders had been receding.The main civilian bloc, the Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC) which led anti-Bashir protests, splintered into two opposing factions, one of which held demonstrations in support of the military.- An 'engineered' crisis - Critics alleged those protests were being driven by members of the military and security forces, and involved counter-revolutionary sympathisers with the former regime."The crisis at hand is engineered -- and is in the shape of a creeping coup," mainstream FFC leader Yasser Arman said two days before the military made its move.Last month the government said it had thwarted a coup attempt, and Burhan dismissed as "slander" suggestions that the army was involved in that manoeuvre.Ahmed Soliman, an analyst from Britain's Chatham House think-tank, told AFP the military has resisted significant reforms including "professionalisation and civilian oversight" of its institutions, as well as its business interests.The military dominates lucrative companies specialising in everything from agriculture to infrastructure projects.Hamdok said last year that 80 percent of the country's public resources were "outside the finance ministry's control", although he did not specify the proportion controlled by the army.Such "really critical issues in the transition have fuelled very recent turmoil that is taking place in Sudan and perhaps set the stage for this hostile takeover by the military," Soliman said.The military's actions are likely to lead to more instability, he added, so "apart from securing their own interests" it is difficult to know what the officers are trying to achieve, Soliman added.Protests against the coup have already led to three deaths on Monday, and there will be "heavy civilian resistance", Gizouli said."The military will have little option but to crush it by force," he said.Gizouli believes Burhan will remain in power for the foreseeable future but might talk with civilian leaders who remain free, like Foreign Minister Mariam al-Mahdi."He still needs a civilian face for the government," Gizouli said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sudan-coup-generals-determined-not-to-lose-long-held-power-say-analysts-101635218228247.html
26-10-2021||World||US announces new Covid-19 international air travel rules||The Biden administration on Monday (local time) announced new Covid-19 international air travel rules starting from November 8.Starting on November 8, foreign national air travellers to the United States will be required to be fully vaccinated and to provide proof of vaccination status prior to boarding an airplane to fly to the United States, with only limited exceptions, read US Department of State release.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has determined that for the purposes of entry into the United States, vaccines accepted will include those US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved or authorized, as well as vaccines with an emergency use listing (EUL) from the World Health Organization (WHO) that includes Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines.As per the guidelines mixing and matching of approved shots will be permitted.Fully vaccinated air travellers will continue to be required to show documentation of a pre-departure negative viral test from a sample taken within three days of travel to the United States before boarding. That includes all travellers - US citizens, lawful permanent residents (LPRs), and foreign nationals.To further strengthen protections, unvaccinated travellers - whether US citizens, LPRs, or the small number of excepted unvaccinated foreign nationals - will now need to show documentation of a negative viral test from a sample taken within one day of travel to the United States, read the release.The travel advisory by the US Department of State also said that both US citizens and foreign nationals who are fully vaccinated should travel with proof of their vaccination status to provide to their airline prior to departure to the United States.That proof of vaccination should be a paper or digital record issued by an official source and should include the traveller's name and date of birth, as well as the vaccine product and date(s) of administration for all doses the traveller received, added the advisory.While vaccination proof is not required for US citizens and LPRs, fully vaccinated US citizens and LPRs (and their dependents) will continue to be able to show documentation of a negative viral test from a sample taken up to three days before departure to the United States. They must present proof of vaccination to qualify for the three-day test window. US citizens and LPRs who are unable to show that they are fully vaccinated will have to show documentation of a negative viral test taken no more than one day before departure.However, children under 18 are exempted from the vaccination requirement for foreign national travellers, given both the ineligibility of some younger children for vaccination, as well as the global variability in access to vaccination for older children who are eligible to be vaccinated, said the advisory.Regarding testing requirements for children, the advisory added that children between the ages of 2 and 17 are required to take a pre-departure test.If a child is not fully vaccinated and traveling with a fully vaccinated adult, they can show proof of a negative viral test from a sample taken within three days before departure (consistent with the timeline for fully vaccinated adults).If an unvaccinated child is traveling alone or with unvaccinated adults, they will have to show proof of a negative viral test from a sample taken within one day of departure.While children under 2 years of age are excepted from the testing requirement, CDC recommends a pre-departure test for these children whenever possible.The test must be administered no more than three calendar days before the date of the international flight to the United States.This new global travel system replaces the existing country-by-country restrictions, putting in place a consistent approach worldwide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-announces-new-covid-19-international-air-travel-rules-101635216774188.html
26-10-2021||World||Facebook removes Jair Bolsonaro video linking Covid-19 shots to AIDS||Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro found himself in social media time-out Monday after his video warning of a supposed link between Covid-19 vaccines and AIDS triggered action by Facebook and YouTube.Facebook removed the offending video, while YouTube went further, suspending the far-right leader for one week in addition to blocking the clip."We removed a video from Jair Bolsonaro's channel for violating our medical disinformation policies on Covid-19 by claiming that vaccines do not reduce the risk of contracting the disease and that they cause other infectious diseases," YouTube said in a statement sent to AFP.Bolsonaro's latest run-in with social media networks including Facebook, on which he heavily relies to rally his base, came after he cited purported "official reports" from the British government -- since debunked -- in his weekly live address on Facebook last Thursday.He claimed the reports "suggest that people who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 are developing Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome much faster than expected.""I recommend you read the article," he added, without saying where the information came from."I'm not going to read it here, because I don't want to lose my Facebook live video."Facebook, which took down the comments late Sunday or early Monday, has removed Bolsonaro posts in the past.Earlier, it found he spread misinformation or incited people to violate social distancing policies. But this is the first time it has taken down one of his weekly live addresses, a cornerstone of his communications.Bolsonaro has violated YouTube standards once before as well, and the company said the president will not be able to post new videos or do live broadcasts for seven days.The rest of his videos on the channel, where he has 3.5 million subscribers, will remain accessible.The British government denied any such "reports" cited by Bolsonaro, in response to an AFP fact-checking team.The Brazilian Society of Infectious Disease Specialists said in a statement there was no evidence of any relationship between Covid-19 vaccines and AIDS.Bolsonaro's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The president has said he does not plan to be vaccinated against Covid-19, and joked in the past the vaccine could "turn you into an alligator."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-removes-jair-bolsonaro-video-linking-covid-19-shots-to-aids-101635214124888.html

AWS declined to comment on the report.In February, Britain's cyber spies at the GCHQ eavesdropping agency said they had fully embraced artificial intelligence to uncover patterns in vast amounts of global data to counter hostile disinformation and snare child abusers.GCHQ has been using basic forms of AI such as translation technology for years but is now stepping up its use, partly in response to the use of AI by hostile states and partly due to the data explosion that makes it effective.Earlier on Monday, GCHQ Director Jeremy Fleming told a conference the number of ransomware attacks had doubled across the UK in 2021, compared with last year, according to the FT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-signs-deal-with-uk-spy-agencies-to-boost-use-of-ai-for-espionage-report-101635211901156.html
26-10-2021||World||Australia announces climate plan, aims to zero out carbon emissions by 2050||Australia, one of the world’s top per-capita polluters, finally agreed to a plan to zero out its carbon emissions by 2050. Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the target days before he is scheduled to head to Europe for G-20 talks and then the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. It follows a new round of fractious domestic debate on climate policy, an issue that’s riven Australia’s politics for more than a decade and comes after pressure from allies including the U.S. on Australia to show more urgency in action to limit global warming. “We will set a target to achieve net-zero by 2050, and have a clear plan for achieving it,” Morrison said in an emailed statement Tuesday. “We won’t be lectured by others who do not understand Australia. The Australian Way is all about how you do it, and not if you do it. It’s about getting it done.”The government will stick with 2030 goals that have been criticized by activists and business leaders alike as too weak, adding to the sense that timid pledges from developed nations are stifling prospects for major progress at the climate talks. Morrison on Tuesday reiterated that Australia was on track to “meet and beat” its target and that he would provide an update on progress in Glasgow.Australia is one of the top suppliers of fossil fuels, and the sector accounts for almost a quarter of its export earnings. The nation is being looked at to help show leadership that’ll encourage developing countries to step up their efforts. Saudi Arabia, the biggest oil exporter, on Saturday pledged to a goal to hit net zero by 2060.Morrison has frequently ruled out taxes for polluters, and backed the country’s top emitters to devise the best solutions to help Australia hit net zero. His government also hasn’t ruled out subsidizing new coal-fired power stations, with the fuel still responsible for the bulk of the nation’s electricity generation.That’s a blow for COP President Alok Sharma, who has struggled to win momentum for his ambition to “consign coal to history.” Nations like Australia and China, which are lifting coal output to ease an energy crisis, have resisted calls to more quickly phase out their own consumption of fuel. While every Australian state and territory -- and key trading partners China, Japan, and South Korea -- have committed to net-zero emissions, a national target is politically complicated for Morrison, who must hold elections by May and trails the main Labor opposition in opinion polls. Lawmakers within the National Party, the junior member of Australia’s governing coalition, have raised concerns over the threat to rural jobs, particularly in coal-mining communities, from an energy transition and demanded a series of concessions in return for their support. The Australian newspaper reported that the Nationals had received a guarantee that the government would take no action to pursue a methane target. The U.S. and the European Union have been seeking to use COP26 to announce that at least 35 countries joined a global pact to cut methane emissions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-announces-climate-plan-aims-to-zero-out-carbon-emissions-by-2050-101635211311352.html

According to the Dawn newspaper, Khan said that India and Pakistan had only one issue--the Kashmir issue--and urged for resolving it like "civilised neighbours”."We have excellent relations with China, but if somehow we improve our relationship with India - I know after last night's thrashing by the Pakistan team in the cricket match, it's not a very good time to talk about improving relations with India," he said while addressing the Pakistan-Saudi Investment Forum in the Saudi capital of Riyadh.Imran Khan’s comments came a day after Pakistan defeated India by 10 wickets in the ongoing T20 World Cup on Sunday.Also read | Will rather talk to people of Kashmir than Pakistan: Amit Shah"It's all about human rights and the rights of the people of Kashmir for self-determination as guaranteed by the United Nations Security Council 72 years ago.

The majority of the mall has been cleared but police were still looking for any additional victims.Police didn't release any other information, saying the investigation was ongoing.Police are asking people to avoid the area. Police also said they were notifying the families of those involved.The Boise Towne Square shopping mall is located in Idaho’s largest city and is the city’s largest mall.Police were interviewing dozens of people outside the entrance to Macy's, one of five large department stores at the mall that has 153 stores in all.Police are also investigating what appears to be another crime scene at a restaurant near the mall.Cheri Gypin, of Boise, was in the mall with a friend where they walk for an hour three or four times a week. She said she heard several large bangs, but thought something had fallen from the ceiling. Then about 60 people, including families pushing strollers, came running at them, some of them shouting that there was an active shooter.“My friend was trying to process it,” said Gypin, 60. “I just looked at her and said, 'We've got to run.' So we just ran and kept running until we got to the outer perimeter of the parking lot.”They made their way back to their car, where police told the crowd of people who had fled the mall to leave the parking area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-die-4-injured-in-idaho-mall-shooting-police-101635204790357.html

Facebook has said Haugen mischaracterized its work.Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has said Facebook in the coming years will be seen as metaverse company rather than a social media company, as it makes a number of investments to expand the technology.The metaverse, a term first coined in a dystopian novel three decades earlier, has attracted much buzz across Silicon Valley. It refers broadly to a shared virtual environment which can be accessed by people using different devices.Facebook, which has invested heavily in virtual reality (VR)and augmented reality (AR), including buying companies like Oculus, this year created a product team to work on the metaverse. This month, it said it plans to hire 10,000 employees in Europe over the next five years to work on this initiative.Wehner said that starting in the fourth quarter of 2021, it would break out FRL as a separate reporting segment from Facebook's family of apps.Shares of the company were trading up about 2% at $336 in extended trading on Monday. Facebook, whose shares have gained about 20% so far this year, is about $85 billion away from regaining a spot on the $1 trillion club and joining new entrant Tesla Inc.The world's largest social media network is under scrutiny from global lawmakers and regulators, including from the Federal Trade Commission which has filed an antitrust lawsuit alleging anticompetitive practices.The whistleblower documents, which were first reported by the Wall Street Journal, have intensified scrutiny on the company. They include internal research and reports about Instagram's effects on the mental health of teens and about whether its platforms stoke divisions, as well as its handling of activity around the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and inconsistencies in the company's content moderation for users around the globe.Reuters on Monday reported that Facebook employees have warned the company was failing to police rule-breaking content in countries where it was likely to cause the most harm, according to former employees and the cache of disclosures made to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Congress by Haugen.Facebook said it expects fourth-quarter revenue to be in a range of $31.5 billion to $34 billion. Analysts had forecast $34.84 billion in revenue, or a 24.1% jump, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Its third-quarter revenue too faced the brunt of Apple's privacy rules that made it harder for brands to target and measure their ads on Facebook.Daily active users, a metric watched closely by advertisers and investors, grew 6% to 1.93 billion from a year ago, matching expectations.The company's total revenue, which primarily consists of ad sales, rose to $29.01 billion in the third quarter from $21.47 billion a year earlier, missing analysts' estimates of $29.57 billion.Facebook said it repurchased $14.37 billion in stock during the third quarter and announced an additional $50 billion in share buybacks.The company did not announce any new name as part of an expected rebranding effort. In response to the Verge's report last week on its name-change plans, Facebook said it does not comment on "rumor or speculation."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-invests-billions-in-metaverse-efforts-as-ad-business-slows-101635197360742.html

There were only a few, small fireworks seen in the Kabul sky.The streets were mostly empty or silent.The Taliban's foes also saw the victory as significant for the country. Amrullah Saleh, the ex-vice president who became one of the leaders of the anti-Taliban forces after the fall of Kabul, pointed out on Twitter that the cricket team had sung a national anthem and raised a flag which are not recongnised by the Taliban.President Ashraf Ghani, who fled the country in August, said the victory had "installed new hopes in the hearts of all that this nation is alive and no one can hold it hostage!"Despite years of violence and upheaval, Afghanistan has an enthusiastic and widespread following of cricket and residents of Kabul were eagerly anticipating the cricket world cup matches.The governing International Cricket Council (ICC) will meet next month to determine the game's future in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-officials-celebrate-cricket-win-but-kabul-streets-subdued-101635197787142.html

It asked the court for a temporary restraining order to halt the mandate while the suit remains pending.The union added on Twitter that there was "still no written, NYPD-specific policy guidance on how the mandate will be implemented."The mayor set a deadline of 5 p.m. this coming Friday for employees to show proof of inoculation to a supervisor. Over 70% of all 160,000 New York City workers, including a similar percentage in the police department, have already received at least one dose, the mayor said.Patrick Lynch, president of the Police Benevolent Association representing the city's 50,000 active and retired officers, said they should have the opportunity to choose whether to get the vaccine.De Blasio cited overtime and redeployments as contingency plans should a large contingent of those officers and other unvaccinated city workers refuse to comply with the mandate.Municipalities, school districts and other jurisdictions throughout the country are grappling with masking and vaccination requirements. The number of new Covid-19 cases has steadily declined in the United States since a surge caused by the Delta variant of the virus during the summer.De Blasio had said employees will no longer have the option to be regularly tested instead of getting the vaccine, but added the city will still grant medical and religious exemptions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-city-police-union-files-lawsuit-to-block-vaccine-mandate-101635197932645.html
26-10-2021||World||Seven killed, 140 injured in protests following coup in Sudan: Official||Sudan's military seized power from a transitional government on Monday and a health ministry official said seven people were killed by gunfire and 140 injured in clashes between soldiers and street protesters.The leader of the takeover, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, dissolved the military-civilian Sovereign Council that had been established to guide the country to democracy following the overthrow of long-ruling autocrat Omar al-Bashir in a popular uprising two years ago.Burhan announced a state of emergency, saying the armed forces needed to protect safety and security. He promised to hold elections in July 2023 and hand over to an elected civilian government then."What the country is going through now is a real threat and danger to the dreams of the youth and the hopes of the nation," he said.The Sudan information ministry, which is still loyal to ousted Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, said on its Facebook page that the transitional constitution gives only the prime minister the right to declare a state of emergency and that the military's actions are a crime. Hamdok is still the legitimate transitional authority, it said.The UN Security Council was likely to discuss Sudan behind closed doors on Tuesday, diplomats said.White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said: "We reject the actions by the military and call for the immediate release of the prime minister and others who have been placed under house arrest."Youths opposed to the coup barricaded streets and clashed with troops. The main opposition coalition, Forces of Freedom and Change, which pushed for Bashir's removal and negotiated the military-civilian council, said on Twitter it was calling for peaceful actions in the streets to overthrow the military takeover, including demonstrations, the blocking of streets and civil disobedience.Hamdok, an economist and former senior UN official, was detained and taken to an undisclosed location after refusing to issue a statement in support of the takeover, the information ministry said.The ministry urged resistance and said tens of thousands of people opposed to the takeover had taken to the streets and had faced gunfire near the military headquarters in Khartoum. Central bank employees announced a strike to reject the coup, the ministry said.Troops had arrested civilian members of the Sovereign Council and government figures, the ministry said. Also detained was the news director of state TV, his family said.The US State Department said Washington had nothing to share on Hamdok's whereabouts and condition. A department spokesman said it was pausing $700 million in economic support for Sudan.In Khartoum's twin city Omdurman, protesters barricaded streets and chanted in support of civilian rule."Burhan cannot deceive us. This is a military coup," said a young man who gave his name as Saleh.'RAISE OUR VOICES'Sudan has been ruled for most of its post-colonial history by military leaders who seized power in coups. It had become a pariah to the West and was on a US terrorism list under Bashir, who hosted Osama bin Laden in the 1990s and is wanted by the International Criminal Court in the Hague for war crimes.The country had been on edge since last month when a failed coup plot, blamed on Bashir supporters, unleashed recriminations between the military and civilians.In recent weeks a coalition of rebel groups and political parties aligned themselves with the military and called on it to dissolve the civilian government, while Cabinet ministers took part in protests against the prospect of military rule.Sudan is also in an economic crisis. Helped by foreign aid, civilian officials have claimed credit for some tentative signs of stabilisation after a sharp devaluation of the currency and the lifting of fuel subsidies.Washington had tried to avert the collapse of the power-sharing agreement by sending a special envoy, Jeffrey Feltman. The director of Hamdok's office, Adam Hereika, told Reuters the military had mounted the takeover despite "positive movements" towards an agreement after meetings with Feltman in recent days.The military had been meant to pass on leadership of the Sovereign Council to a civilian figure in the coming months. But transitional authorities had struggled to move forward on issues including whether to hand Bashir over to the Hague.Burhan said it was incumbent on the armed forces to act to halt "incitement to chaos and violence".The United Nations, Arab League and African Union all expressed concern. Political leaders should be released and human rights respected, AU Commission Chair Moussa Faki Mahamat said in a statement.Britain called the coup an unacceptable betrayal of the Sudanese people. France called for the immediate release of Hamdok and other civilian leaders. Egypt called on all parties to exercise self-restraint.The Sudanese Professionals Association, an activist coalition in the uprising against Bashir, called for a strike.Two main political parties, the Umma and the Sudanese Congress, condemned what they called a coup and campaign of arrests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seven-killed-140-injured-in-protests-following-coup-in-sudan-official-101635197952071.html
26-10-2021||World||Sudanese protest into night after general ousts government in coup||Sudanese denouncing a military coup protested into the night Monday after troops rounded up civilian leaders, defying the soldiers who had earlier killed three people when they opened fire, according to medics.The military move by Sudan's top general to declare a state of emergency and dissolve government -- one of several such takeovers in Africa this year -- sparked swift international condemnation.The UN demanded the "immediate release" of the prime minister, while the US suspended aid and urged restoration of a civilian government.General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan's announcement in a televised address came after the armed forces detained government leaders that have been heading the transition to full civilian rule following the April 2019 ouster of autocrat Omar al-Bashir, in one of the world's least developed countries."To rectify the revolution's course, we have decided to declare a state of emergency nationwide... dissolve the transitional sovereign council, and dissolve the cabinet," said Burhan.Clashes erupted in the capital Khartoum after his speech, with the information ministry saying that soldiers had "fired live bullets on protesters rejecting the military coup outside the army headquarters."Three protesters were killed and about 80 people wounded when soldiers opened fire, according to the independent Central Committee of Sudan Doctors.Burning barricades"Civilian rule is the people's choice," demonstrators chanted.Protesters waved flags and used rocks and tyres to create burning barricades, calling: "No to military rule".The violence, largely centred outside the army headquarters in Khartoum, came after soldiers detained Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, ministers in his government and civilian members of Sudan's ruling council, the information ministry said.Internet services were cut across the country and roads into Khartoum shut, before soldiers stormed the headquarters of Sudan's state broadcaster in the capital's twin city of Omdurman, the information ministry said.The power grab by the army was condemned by the international community, including United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres who criticised the "unlawful detention" of Hamdok and other leaders."The Secretary-General strongly condemns the ongoing military coup d'etat in Khartoum and all actions that could jeopardize Sudan's political transition and stability," Guterres' spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.The European Union, African Union and Arab League also expressed concern, while the United States, which has been a key supporter of Sudan's transition, said it had suspended $700 million in aid."The civilian-led transitional government should be immediately restored," State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters. He added that Washington had not been able to make contact with the detained prime minister.'Existential moment'Under a 2019 power-sharing deal after the ouster of Bashir, Sudan was ruled by a Sovereign Council of civilian and military representatives tasked with overseeing a transition to a full civilian government.But in recent weeks the cracks in the leadership had grown wide.Hamdok had previously described splits in the transitional government as the "worst and most dangerous crisis" facing the transition.Jonas Horner, from the International Crisis Group think-tank, called it an "existential moment for both sides"."This kind of intervention... really puts autocracy back on the menu," he warned.Bashir, who ruled Sudan with an iron fist for three decades, is in jail in Khartoum following a conviction for corruption.He is wanted by the International Criminal Court to face charges of genocide during civil war in Darfur.But UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet warned Sudan risked returning to oppression."It would be disastrous if Sudan goes backwards after finally bringing an end to decades of repressive dictatorship," Bachelet said.Protest callsIn recent days rival protests were held. Sit-ins outside the presidential palace demanded a return to "military rule", and in response, tens of thousands marched to back the full transfer of power to civilians.The two sides represent opposing factions of the Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC), the civilian umbrella group which spearheaded demonstrations that led to the army's overthrow of Bashir.Tensions between the two sides have long simmered, but divisions ratcheted up after what the government said was a failed coup on September 21 this year.The developments come two days after the mainstream FFC leader Yasser Arman warned of a "creeping coup", at a news conference in Khartoum that was attacked by an unidentified mob.On Monday, the mainstream FFC appealed for nationwide "civil disobedience".Protesters were seen marching through the streets of Khartoum carrying the Sudanese flag."We will not accept military rule, and we are ready to give our lives for the democratic transition in Sudan," said one demonstrator, Haitham Mohamed."We will not leave the streets until the civilian government is back," Sawsan Bashir, another protester, told AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sudanese-protest-into-night-after-general-ousts-government-in-coup-101635196163659.html

26-10-2021||World||‘FB algorithms designed to push divisive content’||Facebook will fuel more episodes of violent unrest around the world because of the way its algorithms are designed to promote divisive content, whistleblower Frances Haugen told the British parliament on Monday.Haugen, a former product manager on Facebook’s civic misinformation team, was appearing before a parliamentary select committee in Britain that is examining plans to regulate social media companies.She said the social network saw safety as a cost centre, lionised a start-up culture where cutting corners was a good thing and said it was “unquestionably” making hate worse.“The events we’re seeing around the world, things like Myanmar and Ethiopia, those are the opening chapters because engagement-based ranking does two things: one, it prioritises and amplifies divisive and polarising extreme content and two it concentrates it,” she said.She said the algorithms pushed users towards the extreme. “So someone centre left, they’ll be pushed to radical left, someone centre right will be pushed to radical right,” she said.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has hit back against Haugen’s accusations, saying earlier this month: “The argument that we deliberately push content that makes people angry for profit is deeply illogical.”Reuters, along with other news organisations, viewed documents released to the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Congress by Haugen.They showed Facebook had known that it hadn’t hired enough workers who possessed both the language skills and knowledge of local events needed to identify objectionable posts from users in a number of developing countries.Frances Haugen told UK lawmakers there is a narrowing opportunity to regulate companies that rely on artificial intelligence. “We have a slight window of time to regain people control over AI, we have to take advantage of this moment,” she said. “Right now Facebook is closing the door on us being able to act.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fb-algorithms-designed-to-push-divisive-content-101635191421044.html
26-10-2021||World||Developed nations fail to meet climate fund target||The chances of the important COP26 climate summit starting in Glasgow later this month succeeding took a hit with rich countries announcing on Monday that they will miss by three years their promise of $100 billion a year as funding to developing and poor countries to help manage the climate crisis.The highly anticipated climate finance delivery plan released on Monday, produced by the minister of environment and climate change for Canada, Jonathan Wilkinson and the state secretary, federal ministry for the environment, Germany, Jochen Flasbarth, said developed countries will likely be able to mobilise $100 billion a year only in 2023, a delay of three years from the 2020 deadline originally promised.COP26 President, Alok Sharma had invited the ministers to draft this climate finance delivery plan in July to gain the trust of developing countries on the funding.The announced plan delivery plan could be detrimental to the success of the summit as it may further erode the trust of developing countries such as India, which have been highlighting the lack of equity and justice in climate negotiations.There was hope that the developed countries would agree to make good the shortfall in funding in initial years in later years, so as to reach an average of $100 billion a year in the five years to 2025, but that was not to be. Sharma said that it was “highly likely” that the funding would achieve that, but this found no mention in the plan that was released.Flasbarth, who said he was “disappointed”, added that “there is a lot of money already on the table” and that it would “increase”.In 2009, at COP15 in Copenhagen, developed countries committed to a goal of raising $100 billion a year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries. They specified that the finance would come from a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral, and multilateral, including alternative ones. The climate finance goal was formalised at COP16 in Cancun.Separately, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change also released an updated analysis of nationally determined contributions submitted by 143 countries as on October 12 on Monday which suggested that overall there is likely to be a 16% increase in global GHG emissions in 2030 compared to 2010.Comparison to the latest findings by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) shows that such an increase, unless changed immediately, is likely to cause a temperature rise of about 2.7°C by the end of the century.But the information submitted also confirms that the updated or new climate action plans can be effective in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions over time.“This latest report from the UNFCCC makes clear, to protect the world from the most devastating impacts of climate change, countries must take more ambitious action on emissions, and they must act now,” said COP26 president Alok Sharma. “That is why we especially need the biggest emitters, the G20 nations, to come forward with stronger commitments.”“Developing countries are being asked to wait till 2023 for climate finance that was promised in 2009. The document provides no plan to increase urgently needed adaptation finance. Much of the shortfall in climate finance comes from the US , the largest economy and largest historical emitter,” said Ulka Kelkar, economist and director, climate programme at World Resources Institute.COP26 ‘might go wrong’, warns UK PM JohnsonBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday said he was “very worried” that the 12-day COP26 climate summit he will host in Glasgow from later this week “might go wrong”.But the UK leader told a special Downing Street press conference with children that he remained hopeful a deal can be done to reduce carbon emissions and limit future temperature rises. “I’m very worried because it might go wrong and we might not get the agreements that we need and it’s touch and go,” Johnson said.“Once again, rich nations have failed to show commitment to provide finance to developing countries for climate action. They need to walk the talk. The delay in delivering the promised USD 100 billion a year of climate finance violates human rights of those who are already facing climate induced loss and damage, due to decades of inaction of rich countries. It is unfair to continue exerting pressure on developing economies to raise ambition on emission reduction, when developed nations are unable to find money that is so critical to support greener and resilient future of current and future generations," said Harjeet Singh, senior adviser, Climate Action Network International.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/developed-nations-fail-to-meet-climate-fund-target-101635191120579.html

Shah visited the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) camp in Lethpora in Pulwama district on Monday, had dinner with the soldiers, and spend the night at the camp before wrapping up his visit to the union territory.It was also his first visit to Jammu and Kashmir since the Central government repealed Article 370 of the Constitution in August 2019 that conferred special status to the erstwhile state. The government has assured that the statehood will be restored once the delimitation process gets completed and elections are held in the union territory.During his visit, the minister asserted that the curfew and internet suspension was necessary following the abrogation of Article 370 to prevent bloodshed in Kashmir. He also rejected former J&K chief minister Farooq Abdullah's advice to Pakistan to resolve the Kashmir issue.“Farooq sahib has given some advice to the Union government – to talk to Pakistan. I want to tell Farooq sahib, who has been a former chief minister of J&K, that we will talk to the people of Kashmir.

26-10-2021||India||Mamata Banerjee promises permanent political solution for Darjeeling, says statehood promise meant to divide people of hills||Siliguri: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday promised a permanent political solution for Darjeeling hills while it remains part of the state, even as she urged leaders in the hills to prepare a roadmap for the same by December. “Some political parties come to Darjeeling ahead of the elections and promise statehood. Their actual motto is to divide the people of the hills. You give me a plan on how to come to a permanent solution. I would help you even while Darjeeling remains a part of West Bengal,” the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief said. Banerjee, who is on a four-day tour of north Bengal since October 24, was speaking at an administrative meeting in Kurseong, which was attended by political leaders of the hills. She asked Anit Thapa, former Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) leader who recently floated a new outfit; Roshan Giri, secretary of the GJM; and Gautam Deb, senior TMC leader and former minister, to hold a meeting and come up with a plan by the first week of December. Officials and political representatives from the Gorkha Territorial Administration (GTA) — an autonomous body that manages Darjeeling and Kalimpong hills in north Bengal — have also been asked to attend the meeting. Banerjee’s remark on finding permanent political solution comes in the wake of Union home minister Amit Shah holding a tri-partite meeting in Delhi to discuss the Gorkha issues on October 12. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Darjeeling MP Raju Bista said: “The Centre is actively considering finding a permanent political solution for Darjeeling hills that witnessed 104-day long general strike and death of 13 people in 2017.” Hill political parties, meanwhile, are clearly divided. GJM headed by Bimal Gurung and Bharatiya Gorkha Prajatantrik Morcha headed by Anit Thapa are aligning with the TMC. The Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF), Communist Party of Revolutionary Marxists (CPRM) and other small parties are pro-BJP and are banking on the Centre to find a permanent political solution. Talking to reporters after the meeting, Giri said, “We are ready to work with Thapa for the development of the hills.” Thapa also said, “We are ready to work together with the GJM only for making plan for permanent political solution.” Though the hill parties have maintained that a permanent political solution means a separate state of Gorkhaland or a Union territory, the Bengal CM on Tuesday indicated that whatever political solution is to be reached, it should be without granting statehood to Darjeeling. The chief minister also said that the state government would hold the GTA elections after fresh electoral rolls are prepared. Parties like the GJM, GNLF and CPRM are opposed to the GTA as they claim it would not fulfil the aspiration of Gorkhas. Banerjee announced that the Darjeeling district magistrate will head the GTA till the elections are held. The GTA elections were due in 2017. But since the 2017 Gorkhaland agitation and until the dates for the 2021 assembly elections were announced, the GTA was being run by the state government-nominated bodies headed by people like Binoy Tamang and Anit Thapa. Tamang, who played a pivotal role to derail the 2017 Gorkhaland agitation, was not invited to Tuesday’s meeting. At present, the GTA is run by a senior IAS officer of the rank of divisional commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-promises-permanent-political-solution-for-darjeeling-says-statehood-promise-meant-to-divide-people-of-hills-101635272784057.html
26-10-2021||India||Dravid closer to India coach job, Laxman may head NCA||Former India captain Rahul Dravid on Tuesday moved closer to taking over as the next head coach of the Indian team when he formally sent in his application for the job, less than a fortnight after discussing the modalities with officials of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), including his long-time dressing room colleague Sourav Ganguly, in Dubai.The deadline inviting applicants ended on Tuesday evening, and it is now all but certain that Dravid will get the job after India’s T20 World Cup campaign ends in the UAE. “Yes, Dravid has sent in his application. We will follow the required procedure. A new member will be added to the Cricket Advisory Committee and they will conduct the interviews,” said a BCCI official who is involved in the process, on condition of anonymity.Though the procedure dictates that BCCI opens up the application process, and then forms a committee to interview the applicants, in Dravid’s case, the interview is expected to be a formality. “To be honest, we haven’t even looked at the other applicants,” said the BCCI official. Dravid will be giving up the post of director of the National Cricket Academy (NCA) soon, and a new appointment will be made. VVS Laxman, another batting stalwart from BCCI president Ganguly’s playing days, is among the front-runners, people aware of the matter said. There is no clarity, however, if Laxman will be willing to give up his lucrative IPL and media commitments for the job. Calls and messages to him went unanswered. Apart from the coach — the current incumbent Ravi Shastri steps down after the T20 World Cup — there will be changes in India’s support staff as well, with batting coach Vikram Rathour the only one expected to be retained, officials indicated. Rathour, who has worked with Dravid at NCA, has submitted his application for the job. Former India batter Pravin Amre, currently batting coach with Delhi Capitals, is also expected to apply. The deadline for applications for the supporting coaches is November 3. For the bowling coach’s job, Paras Mhambrey, who is coaching the India A team and has worked extensively with Dravid at NCA and at the U-19 level, is a front-runner. Former India players Abhay Sharma and Ajay Ratra have applied to be India’s fielding coach. Dravid has been on the coaching circuit for the past seven years working at various levels — from a less-than-successful stint in the IPL with Delhi Daredevils, to a long and fruitful association with India A, India U-19, and as the head of the National Cricket Academy, where he is widely credited for shaping the next generation of international cricketers. When current coach Ravi Shastri first announced in September that he would step down after the ongoing T20 World Cup, BCCI approached Dravid, but failed to convince him at the time to take up a job that would require much of the year be spent on tour.It was finally in this month’s meeting with the BCCI top brass in Dubai — Ganguly and secretary Jay Shah — that Dravid shed his reluctance, and agreed to become the coach for the next two years, the official cited in the first instance said. These two years are packed with ICC tournaments in each format, starting with the 2022 T20 World Cup in Australia, the ICC World Test Championship in 2023 and the ODI World Cup at home in that same year. A big expectation from Dravid would be to end India’s drought of winning ICC trophies. Since Shastri took over in 2014 (Anil Kumble was coach for one year in 2016-17) India have developed into a formidable force in Test cricket with a crack fast bowling attack, but do not have an ICC trophy to show for their success. India’s last major title was the 2013 Champions Trophy. Since then, they have been knocked out from the 2015 ODI World Cup, the 2016 T20 World Cup, 2017 Champions trophy, and the 2019 ODI World Cup. The BCCI appointed former India captain MS Dhoni as “mentor” for the ongoing World Cup after increasing dissatisfaction with the team’s inability to win a trophy. In the past, apart from not wanting to spend that much time away from his family — the Indian head coach job is a full-time job except the two months of IPL— Dravid’s reluctance came from being unsure if he could work successfully with captain Virat Kohli. Kohli has already announced that he will be giving up the T20 captaincy after this World Cup. The BCCI has hinted that he may not remain ODI captain either, though he is likely to continue as Test captain. Kohli briefly shared the Indian dressing room with Dravid as a player — he made his ODI debut in 2008 and Test debut in June 2011. Dravid played his last match for India in January 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dravid-closer-to-india-coach-job-laxman-may-head-nca-101635272595688.html

During his visit, Banerjee is expected to address a public rally following the Model Code of Conduct after the announcement of the schedule for civic polls to be held in the state. “Many of our party workers were attacked by BJP cadres in the past two months. Even our activists were attacked during one of our programme at Amarpur in Gomati district. We condemn it. We are confident that people’s mistrust in the BJP will be reflected in the polls,” Kunal Ghosh told the media in Agartala.

26-10-2021||India||Pramod Sawant hits mute on Satya Pal Malik charge; BJP disses ex-Goa guv Malik||PANAJI: Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant and his office did not respond to former governor Satya Pal Malik’s comments on corruption in his regime but the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) mounted a sharp counterattack at Malik, accusing him of crossing a line of “ethics and propriety”.Sawant, who was speaking to reporters outside the BJP office about the party’s preparations for Goa elections next year, was also asked by reporters about Malik’s allegations but he abruptly walked away without responding. His office didn’t respond to requests for a reaction either. That task was assigned to the party’s spokesperson Damodar “Damu” Naik who reminded that his “own government” was in power in the state, wondered why he didn’t send a report to the Union home ministry when he was still the state’s governor and questioned Malik’s motives.Naik said Malik should step down from his constitutional post if he wants to criticise “his own government”.“It is completely wrong for the governor to speak this way. There is ethics and propriety. He should behave within the limits of ethics and propriety. Did he act on it (corruption charge) when he was the governor? To speak about it now and to speak to the media while still being a governor is completely wrong and unconstitutional. He should have sent a report to the Union home ministry back then and then the senior leaders would have taken it forward,” Naik said. “Why is he talking about it now... after so many months (of being moved on from the post of Goa governor) and that too when only one month is left for elections? Who is behind this?” Naik asked. “Don’t sit in a constitutional post and speak against your own government. Resign from your post and then speak,” he said.Naik said that Sawant was an ‘honest man’.“An honest man is managing the affairs of the state and has taken the responsibility given to him. He even got praise from the Prime Minister (at a recently held interaction),” Naik said. “Was his (Malik’s) mouth taped back then (when Satya Pal Malik was Goa governor)? He should not step across the line,” Naik said. Naik also hit out at opposition parties who have latched onto Malik’s statements saying they had no moral right to lecture the BJP about corruption.“These parties have no authority to talk about corruption when they themselves are steeped in corruption. The Goa Forward Party was removed from the alliance on grounds of corruption. These are publicity stunts. They are attempting to create a negative1 atmosphere ahead of the polls,” he added. In an interview with India Today TV that was broadcast on Monday, Satya Pal Malik who spent a little under a year as Goa governor between October 2019 and August 2020 before being shunted to Meghalaya, said: “I am a Lohia-ite. I get very angry when it comes to corruption. I do not take it kindly. On the day when the lockdown was announced, the government said that even the stores selling basic essentials would not be allowed to open but said they would sell door to door. Which was impossible, but they allowed one company to sell basic essentials door to door which had given money to the Goa government, when people from Congress told me about it, I informed PM Modiji ,” Malik said.“There was corruption in the Goa government in handling everything… because of that I was sent away from there,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pramod-sawant-hits-mute-on-satya-pal-malik-charge-bjp-disses-ex-goa-guv-malik-101635270736066.html
26-10-2021||India||Delhi’s air quality has been surprisingly good in Oct, but smog may be on way||The air quality this October in Delhi is not only better than last year, but also the best in at least the past four years. Covid-19 related restrictions and their impact on mobility would suggest that this improvement in air quality should have happened in 2020, not 2021. After all, transport and industry are important contributors to pollution, and both mobility and economic activity are higher this year.If things are better, it’s because of a drastic change in weather conditions this year that has prevailed over these factors and reduced air pollution – for the time being. This also means that when these conditions change, we might return to business-as-usual, which, in the case of Delhi, means smog.Air quality this October is the best in at least four years...One metric of air pollution available more consistently than others is the concentration of PM2.5 particles, or particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers wide that penetrate deep into the lungs and bloodstream. On 18 of the first 25 days of October, the 24-hour average of PM2.5 concentration in Delhi was less than in all the years after 2018. It suggests that air quality in October has been much better. To be sure, October 2021 has had four days when PM2.5 concentration was in the poor or worse categories.Why is this comparison limited to after 2018? The Central Control Room for Air Quality Management (CCR) shows that PM2.5 data is available from 40 different stations for Delhi. However, only 35 of them have consistent data from 2018 for October. In 2017, this number falls to 15. This comparison is limited to after 2018 so that we have a sufficient number of stations to better represent Delhi’s air, and its quality also remains comparable across years. This means that it is possible that Delhi’s air quality is better this October than in a longer time period than four years.…despite higher mobility and economic activityThe reason good air in October is surprising is because movement of people and economic activity is both higher this year than in 2020. An improvement in air quality 2020 – as it did happen during the 68-day lockdown starting March 25 – could be explained because the sources of pollution were shut. Google mobility data shows this is not the cause for improved air in October 2021. Mobility levels in Delhi, as well as in the neighbouring north-western states of Punjab and Haryana, are far higher this October than last year. An analysis published in HT on October 26 showed economic activity is also higher this October than at the same time last year.Weather, not sources of pollution, is the likely reason for better air this OctoberAs the above data suggests, vehicular and industrial sources of pollution are unlikely to have driven the improvement in air quality. There is a third source of pollution that becomes important at this time of the year – farm fires in Punjab and Haryana. Data shows that farm fires are also somewhat lower this year, especially in the second-half of the month when the number of fires is usually more. On eight days until October 25, farm fires were the lowest since 2017. Five of these eight days have come after October 15.One reason for a lower number of farm fires is that paddy procurement was postponed from October 1 to October 11. This could possibly have delayed clearing of farms for the next crop, which is why the stubble is burnt. Another likely reason for lower number of fires is the rainfall this October. Until 8:30 AM on October 25, rainfall in Punjab and Haryana has been 290% and 192% more than the average rainfall for the same interval between 1960 and 2010, also called the Long Period Average, according to the India Meteorological Department’s gridded rainfall database. Such rainfall, apart from preventing fires, has also likely cleared existing pollutants in the air from other sources. In not only Punjab and Haryana, but also in Delhi, the rainfall this October has been much higher than in all years for which comparable air quality data is available.Good air dependent on weather is not sustainableIf the farm fires have just been delayed, it is likely that farmers will be even more compelled to take the faster route of burning the stubble to clear the fields for their next crop. This can possibly bring an even bigger peak in air pollution later on. This situation can also be complicated by the trend in temperatures so far this October. The maximum temperatures in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi, especially in the past one week, have been lower than in the past four years for which air quality data is available. Maximum temperatures are daytime temperatures.A higher temperature during the day prevents the accumulation of pollutants close to the ground. This has been prevented so far because of rainfall. Without a curb on the sources of air pollution, a quick reversal to bad air quality days will not be surprising. But for now, breathe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/octobers-air-quality-has-been-surprisingly-good-in-delhi-but-smog-may-be-on-its-way-101635265395859.html

The secretary of the Security Council of Kyrgyzstan, Lt Gen Marat Imankulov, visited India for the maiden bilateral strategic dialogue between the National Security Council Secretariats of the two sides. The dialogue is significant in view of India’s efforts to step up cooperation with the Central Asian states on regional security. The two sides discussed the threats and challenges facing both countries and the regional security environment, with special reference to Afghanistan, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. “The two sides welcomed the similarity of views on these matters, and agreed on steps to enhance bilateral security cooperation between relevant bodies, including in the fields of counter-terrorism, combating radicalisation, narcotics control and defence cooperation,” one of the people cited above said. During the strategic dialogue, Imankulov met National Security Adviser Ajit Doval. There was no official word on the strategic dialogue.The strategic dialogue with Kyrgyzstan was held days ahead of India hosting a meeting of national security advisers (NSAs) of countries in the region, including Pakistan and China, to discuss the situation in Afghanistan. This will be the first such meeting to be convened by India since the Taliban marched into Kabul in mid-August. Besides China and Pakistan, regional countries such as Iran, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan have been invited to the meeting. There are no plans to invite the Taliban to the meeting in line with the Indian side’s decision not to rush into recognising the current dispensation in Kabul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-kyrgyzstan-hold-first-strategic-dialogue-focus-on-afghanistan-101635265095802.html

26-10-2021||India||RSS to discuss violence on Hindus in Bangladesh during upcoming meeting||The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) will hold discussions on the recent attacks on minority Hindus in Bangladesh during its three-day All India executive committee meeting starting October 28.RSS officials familiar with the matter told news agency PTI the outfit is likely to pass a resolution on the recent incidents of vandalisation of puja venues in Comilla and other cities of Bangladesh.“We all know that recently there were large-scale attacks on Hindus and the 'puja pandals' in Bangladesh during Durga Puja. Many people were killed and injured. There were protests at many places on this issue. This topic will also be discussed during the Akhil Bharatiya Karyakari Mandal Baithak and there is a possibility of passing a resolution on this issue,” Sunil Ambekar, the RSS’s Akhil Bharatiya Prachar Pramukh or the publicity in-charge, said.The RSS will also discuss its expansion programme to reach regions where it does not have a presence. Ambekar said that the main discussion will be on expanding the activities of the RSS and preparing an action plan. Ambekar said the outfit is working on an action plan which began this year. “The Sangh was established in 1925 and in 2025, the RSS will complete its 100 years. We have made a three-year action plan for our expansion starting from 2021 to 2024 and the work is underway.

The secretary of the security council of the Kyrgyz Republic was in India for the first strategic dialogue between the National Security Council Secretariats of the two countries.The two sides discussed the Afghanistan issue in the wake of the Taliban’s takeover, and the visitor was in consonance with the Indian perspective on stabilisation of the war-torn country through a government in Kabul that has enough representation of women and minorities like Tajik, Uzbek and Hazara communities. The two sides were on the same page on the Afghanistan issue and shared similar views.Also Read | NSA Ajit Doval wants SCO to take action against Pak-based terror groups Jaish and Lashkar-e-TaibanIndia and Kyrgyzstan also agreed upon steps to enhance bilateral security cooperation between the relevant bodies, including in the areas of counter-terrorism, combating radicalisation, narcotics control and defence cooperation, according to people familiar with the matter.Kyrgyzstan is one of the founder members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), of which India is a permanent member along with Pakistan, China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, which makes the dialogue between the two countries significant.The Taliban announced the interim government last month and expanded the cabinet a few weeks later, claiming that it was an inclusive set-up as per the wishes of the international community. A closer look, however, revealed that the government was anything but inclusive, with no women representation in the cabinet and symbolic representation from minority communities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-kyrgyzstan-nsas-are-on-the-same-page-on-afghanistan-101635263008898.html
26-10-2021||India||CBI arrests serving Navy Commander, 4 others for submarine data leak||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has arrested a Commander-rank serving officer and two retired officials of the Indian navy along with two other persons for allegedly leaking confidential information related to an ongoing submarine project in lieu of illegal gratification, people familiar with the development said on Tuesday. The federal anti-corruption probe agency refused to divulge any other details of the case, including the name of the serving officer arrested for the leak. However, officials who didn’t want to be named said the secret action was initiated last month and the matter relates to the upgrade of Russian-origin Kilo class submarines in the Indian fleet. At least 19 locations in Delhi, Mumbai, Noida and Hyderabad have been raided so far in the case and several people as well as recovered digital evidence are being examined. It is alleged that the Commander had discussed crucial details about the ongoing modernisation project of Kilo class submarines with the two retired officers for alleged illegal gratification, said an official. The Anti-Corruption Unit of the agency, which handles sensitive and high profile corruption cases, was tasked to unearth the leakage of information following which the operation was started, they added. Investigation is being carried out to unearth if the information has fallen into the wrong hands. The Indian Navy said on Tuesday that investigation related to alleged information leak of administrative and commercial nature being with some unauthorised personnel has come to light and is being investigated by appropriate government agency. The investigation by the agency with complete support of the Indian Navy is in progress, it added. An internal inquiry by the Navy is also underway and is being carried out by a vice admiral to find out how information leaked despite security protocols and advisories, and how lacunae, if any can be fixed, officials said. India operates eight Kilo class submarines, four HDW German origin submarines and three Scorpene submarines built in India under technology transfer from France (three more Scorpenes will join the fleet in the future). The navy also operates an indigenous nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine, INS Arihant. India is also pursuing a project worth ₹43,000 crore for building six advanced submarines in the country under the government’s “strategic partnership” (SP) model to bolster the Indian Navy’s underwater force levels and counter the rapid expansion of China’s submarine fleet. The new submarines are part of the 30-year submarine-building programme approved by the Cabinet Committee on Security in 1999.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-arrests-serving-navy-commander-2-retd-staff-and-2-others-for-submarine-data-leak-101635263055693.html

The incident has triggered shockwaves in the state and posed questions on the misuse of the internet by youngsters. Malappuram superintendent of police Sujith Das said the young stalker was arrested after the police checked CCTV visuals of some houses in the area and based on the statement of the college student. He said the boy has no criminal record and the woman also said he had never troubled her earlier. However, the teenager’s parents said he was addicted to watching horror films and adult videos. The SP said the woman had a narrow escape after she fiercely resisted his advances. He also received minor injuries and when his parents asked about his injuries he said he had been chased by a stray dog and had fallen into a ditch. However, when the police reached his residence and questioned him, he confessed that he had received injuries while assaulting the 21-year-old woman. In his hurry to escape from the spot, he had left his slippers at the site and later his parents identified them, the SP said. According to the police, he had followed the woman for some distance before attacking her close to a secluded banana plantation. The accused had hit her on the head with a stone, tied her arms and pressed down on her neck to subdue her but she fought back and saved herself. The police added that the boy was also a district level judo champion. After escaping from him, the woman managed to reach a nearby house and alerted them. The woman, in whose house the college student took refuge, told the media that her hands were tied and she had injuries on her face and head and was bleeding profusely. She was discharged from hospital on Tuesday. “She fought back valiantly and escaped. We have already seized his mobile phone and other gadgets,” the SP said adding the minor would be sent to a juvenile home after investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/15yearold-stalker-held-for-rape-bid-in-kerala-101635260055467.html

It will allow both public and private third-party service providers to manage the unmanned aerial vehicles in lower airspace.The policy framework issued by the civil aviation ministry noted that with rapid technological evolution of unmanned aircraft, opening up of new use cases and policy reforms, the number of such aircraft operating in the Indian airspace is poised to increase rapidly.It has also taken into consideration the scenarios which will require flying multiple drones near manned aircraft, especially on lower levels of the airspace where drones are allowed to fly.Current air traffic management (ATM) systems have not been designed to handle the traffic from unmanned aircraft, the National Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management policy framework issued on October 24 stated."Integration of unmanned aircraft in the Indian airspace using conventional means may require unmanned aircraft to be equipped with bulky and expensive hardware, which is neither feasible nor advisable," it noted.This requires the creation of a separate, modern, primarily software-based, automated traffic management system, it said, adding that such systems may subsequently be integrated into traditional ATM systems.The framework allows third-party service providers to give services such as registration, flight planning, dynamic deconfliction and access to supplementary data like weather, terrain and position of manned aircraft.All drones (except Nano drones operating in the green zone) shall be required to mandatorily share their real-time location through the network to the Centre either directly or through third-party service providers, it mentioned.The Centre had on September 15 approved a production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for drones and drone components with an allocation of ₹120 crore spread over three financial years.The civil aviation ministry had on August 25 notified the Drone Rules, 2021 that eased the regulation of drone operations in India by reducing the number of forms that need to be filled to operate them from 25 to five and decreasing the types of fees charged from the operator from 72 to four.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-notifies-framework-for-traffic-management-of-drones-in-lower-airspace-101635256073340.html

And, there has been a minor but gradual spike in case since the celebrations came to an end. On Monday, the state reported 805 new infections, which was, however, 184 less than the virus count registered on the previous day.The current trends, if left unchecked, may lead to a situation where there could be a severe strain on the health infrastructure and workforce, the Union health secretary warned.Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan writes to Narayan Swaroop Nigam, Health Secretary of West Bengal Govt regarding new deaths and cases of #COVID19 in the state, in last 30 days. "One of the primary districts of concern is Kolkata..." reads the letter. pic.twitter.com/ulc6YAmDpgIn his letter, Bhushan said Kolkata reported a high quantum of average daily cases in the week ending October 21 with more than 25 per cent increase in tally when compared to the previous week -- from 217 cases in the week ending October 14 to 272 infections the next week.The district also registered about 27 per cent rise in positivity rate in the past week -- from 5.6 per cent in the week ending October 14 to 7.1 per cent a week later.The weekly testing trends in the district were also showing a downward trend, Bhushan said, while urging more proactive action in this regard.Regarding the overall pandemic situation in Bengal, the Central government representative said the state reported 20,936 cases and 343 related deaths in the last 30 days, accounting for 3.4 per cent of the total infections nationally and 4.7 per cent fatalities, respectively.The Centre said an exponential surge in infections can be in instances where the basic public health strategy of testing, tracking, treating, vaccinating and following Covid-appropriate behaviour are not followed. Bhushan said that with the ongoing festive season, it is crucial to emphasise the importance of implementing Covid-safe behaviour to maintain the collective gains made in the battle against the pandemic.The Centre further urged the state to undertake regular review of cases and deaths and ensure that districts maintain consistency in updating data in the Covid-19 portal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-centre-cites-kolkata-as-primary-district-of-concern-in-bengal-101635255304196.html
26-10-2021||India||Quality Council of India sets up team of experts to execute proposed ONDC project||The Quality Council of India (QCI) has established a team of experts and a number of small and medium enterprises have been on-boarded as volunteers for execution of a proposed project - Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), the commerce and industry ministry said on Tuesday.The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) has initiated this project, which aims to democratise digital or electronic commerce, moving it from a platform-centric model to an open-network.As UPI is to the digital payment domain, ONDC is to e-commerce in India. ONDC will enable buyers and sellers to be digitally visible and transact through an open network, no matter what platform/application they use. It will also empower merchants and consumers by breaking silos to form a single network to drive innovation and scale, transforming all businesses from retail goods, food to mobility."It has been suggested to establish a private sector led non-profit company. The entity is expected to provide a start-up mindset for a population scale implementation, enabled by a management with a futuristic vision, leadership with a deep understanding of commerce, comfort with cutting edge technology, and missionary outlook to drive change," the ministry said in a statement.It added that a non-profit company structure removes any incentive for owners to drive for profit maximisation, keep focus on ethical and responsible behaviour while providing for trust, rigorous norms of governance, accountability and transparency.Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal reviewed the progress on this initiative."QCI has established a team of experts for execution of the project in a mission mode. A number of small and medium enterprises have been on-boarded as volunteers to complement the ONDC team. An ONDC gateway has also been established. About 20 entities covering all network components are at various stages of on-boarding," it said.The DPIIT has approved a budget of about ₹10 crore for initial work on the project.It said that the role of the company would be to develop the network by adopting and building enabling technology and encouraging wide-scale voluntary participation by ecosystem players."It would ensure network discipline by establishing a code of conduct and rules of network based on principles of consumer protection, fair trade and regulatory conformity. The entity will also provide foundational services for managing the network like digital infrastructure for the network, common registry, certification of participants and certifying agencies, grievance redressal, etc," the ministry said.It will also support SMEs in their digital transformation by developing readymade tools to help existing software applications quickly adapt to the network.Goyal directed that wide participation from the ecosystem should be ensured and the institutional structure should be created in such a manner so as to ensure that the entity conducts itself in an ethical, cooperative, democratic and responsible manner.He also directed that special efforts must be made to build trust in the ONDC network and elaborate mechanisms must be put in place for dispute resolution.The government has set up a nine-member advisory council, including Nandan Nilekani from Infosys and National Health Authority CEO R S Sharma, on steps required to design and accelerate adoption of ONDC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quality-council-of-india-sets-up-team-of-experts-to-execute-proposed-ondc-project-101635250845225.html

TMC’s Goa unit has claimed that this is a planned attack by the Bharatiya Janata Party.“Goa TMC condemns this act of vandalism that amounts to insulting a woman who is the only sitting woman Chief Minister in the country. Goans will definitely give a befitting response to such a vengeful government. The latest pictures are evidence of how the BJP has not just vandalised Goa TMC branding but has done so at the cost of Goans,” a statement issued by the Goa TMC said.The TMC further claimed that apart from destroying the hoardings, the effort of local businesses is also ruined, and added that “the BJP is not just spreading hate but is attacking the livelihood of hundreds of fellow Goans by destroying their businesses.”On Tuesday, the TMC also alleged that these acts of vandalism were premeditated, claiming that BJP held a closed-door meeting where it was decided that hoardings will be destroyed “overnight”.National Vice President of TMC, Luizinho Faleiro also expressed his disappointment through a video message. “Today I saw the ruling party members tearing the legal hoardings of the TMC, just because they are threatened by the entry of TMC in Goa,” he said and deemed the incident as “disturbing”.However, BJP national spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy denied TMC’s claims and called them baseless. “Simply because there is a BJP government in Goa, the TMC is blaming us for this act. Making allegations of this sort is incorrect when there is no substantial proof,” he told Hindustan Times.Mamata Banerjee will travel to Goa on October 28 with the aim of spreading TMC’s roots in the coastal state given the upcoming Assembly elections in February 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-posters-in-goa-vandalised-ahead-of-her-visit-tmc-blames-bjp-101635252915077.html

It also said that the commissioner of food safety is empowered under Section 30 of the food safety and standards act, 2006 to impose such a ban on manufacture, storage, distribution or sale of any article of food in the entire state."As per regulation 2.3.4 of the Food Safety and Standards (Prohibition and Restrictions on Sales) Regulations 2011 made by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India, in the exercise of powers conferred by clause (i) of sub-section (2) of section 92 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (Central Act 34 of 2006) read with section 26 thereof, prohibits sale of articles of food in which tobacco and/or nicotine are used as ingredients, as they may be injurious to health," said the notification issued under the signature of Tapan K Rudra, commissioner of food safety, West Bengal.Gutkha and pan masala see wide usage of tobacco and nicotine as ingredients.The state governments usually earn a lot of tax revenue from the sale of these items. However, in the interest of public health, many states across the country have gradually taken steps to ban gutkha and other products with nicotine.The Mamata Banerjee government had decided to ban gutkha, betel spice and several other tobacco products for the first time in 2019.

Party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala made the announcement following a meeting of the party’s top leaders.The Jan Jagran Abhiyan comes ahead of the Parliament’s Winter Session, whose dates are yet to be announced and the assembly elections in five states.The Congress earlier on Tuesday held a meeting of party leaders to decide a strategy for the upcoming legislative elections in the five states. Party president Sonia Gandhi asked party leaders to aim towards strengthening the Congress and asked them to set aside their personal ambitions.She also highlighted that there existed a ‘lack of clarity and cohesion’ on issues related to policy among state leaders. She was also concerned that grassroots-level Congress leaders may be missing out on messages on key issues.Former party president Rahul Gandhi, Congress general secretaries, in-charges and pradesh presidents were part of Tuesday’s meeting which also sought to address the problem of growing factionalism within the party.“The fight to defend our democracy, our constitution and the Congress party's ideology begins with being fully prepared to identify and counter false propaganda. We must fight the diabolical campaign of BJP/RSS ideologically. We must do so with conviction and expose their lies before the people if we are to win this battle,” Sonia Gandhi was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.The meeting also comes before the party is set to launch its new membership drive from next week. Sonia Gandhi said that ahead of the legislative elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand and Manipur emphasis should be laid upon discipline and unity among Congress members.“I would like to re-emphasise the paramount need for discipline and unity. What should matter to each and every one of us is the strengthening of the organisation. This must override personal ambitions. In this lies both collective and individual success,” Gandhi told the attendees of the meet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-to-launch-jan-jagran-abhiyan-from-nov-14-101635250052812.html

26-10-2021||India||Congress promises to improve disaster relief, rescue in poll-bound Uttarakhand||As record rains left at least 72 people dead in a two-day span last week, disaster management appears to have become a major issue ahead of the Uttarakhand elections due early next year. Opposition Congress has said ways to deal with disasters will be part of its manifesto while accusing the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of failing in managing the latest natural disaster in the state.“We will include disaster management issues in our manifesto... we promise to improve the parameter of relief and rescue work in any disaster in the state,” said former chief minister Harish Rawat. He added that the government failed in the aftermath of the record rains this month, saying, “there has been no effort by the government to improve the rescue and relief works.”Rawat said chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami and his ministers have visited only those affected areas accessible by choppers. “We are giving them time till October 27 to improve the rescue and relief work. If it fails to do so, then we will hold statewide protests against the government from October 28.”Also Read: Snowfall sets foot in Himachal, Uttarakhand; North India braces for cold winterBJP leader Madan Kaushik maintained lives of many people were saved due to timely warnings and exact information about the disaster. “The government has also been carrying rescue and relief works on a war footing, but Congress, instead of helping, is busy doing politics even in a disaster.”Kaushik said the Centre provided all possible help in the relief works, adding, “Dhami was in constant touch with the officials of district administrations concerned and himself visited the affected areas.” MM Semwal, a political science professor at Garhwal Central University, said, “Being a disaster-prone state, disaster management has to be given significance in the agenda of political parties.” He said whenever a disaster happens in the state, it affects tourism that contributes to 25-30% of the state’s GDP. “Steps should be taken to minimise the loss of property and lives in any disaster,” he said, calling the Congress’s announcement a welcome step. “The BJP would be under pressure after the Congress’s move to take a similar step considering the upcoming elections.”Political commentator SMA Kazmi echoed Semwal’s opinion. “Political parties have made big statements on disaster management, especially in the hills where it is a major issue. But there is a lack of political will,” Kazmi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-promises-to-improve-disaster-relief-rescue-in-poll-bound-uttarakhand-101635250096501.html

26-10-2021||India||Chhattisgarh’s Hasdeo Arand residents plan protest in Delhi against mining clearance||Residents of Chhattisgarh’s Hasdeo Arand are planning a protest in Delhi against permission granted for stage II mining clearance in the Parsa coal block. They are expected to arrive in the national capital in a few days to also meet environment and forest ministry officials and lodge their protest against the clearance. A press meet is also scheduled in Delhi under the banner of Hasdeo Arand Bachao Sangharsh Samiti.Alok Shukla, convener of NGO Chhattisgarh Bachaao Andolan, said they will move the National Green Tribunal against the clearance and also stage a protest in Delhi.Activists say around 700 people will be displaced and about 840 acres of dense forest will be destroyed due to the mining project. “...both Central and state governments, to serve the corporate interest, are stepping back in terms of safeguarding this (previously) No-Go area...,” said Bipasa Paul, an activist working in the region.Activists and the residents have alleged the clearance was given on the basis of fake consent documents from the local village council, making it illegal. On October 21, the ministry said the clearance was based on the state government’s recommendation. It cited new facts brought to its notice and added it will be at liberty to impose additional conditions.Also Read: Study warns against mining nod to 14 coal blocks in Hasdeo ArandThe clearance came even as around 250 Hasdeo Arand residents undertook a 300-km long foot march from Korba to Raipur demanding cancellation of all mining projects in the region. The marchers met governor Anusiya Uike and chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, who assured them that their rights will be protected and the documents will be probed.Paul called it unfortunate that even after the march, the state government has not ordered an independent probe into the documents. “...no correspondence (has been) done in this matter with (Union environment and forest ministry)... which granted stage-II forest clearance.”Hasdeo Arand is one of the largest contiguous stretches of dense forest in central India spanning 170,000 hectares. It has 23 coal blocks. In 2009, the Union environment ministry categorised the region as a No-Go zone for mining because of its rich forest cover. It was opened again to mining because the policy was not finalised.There is also a significant elephant presence in the area and it is also an important part of a large migratory corridor. Hasdeo Arand forests are the catchment of Hasdeo River --Mahanadi’s largest tributary- which is critical for perennial river flow. It is also the watershed of Hasdeo Bango reservoir and critical for irrigation of 3 lakh hectares double-cropped land in the rice-bowl state of Chhattisgarh.On October 23, Uike wrote to Chhattisgarh’s chief secretary over the issue and directed an inquiry into the documents within 15 days.State minister Ravindra Chaubey cited allegations of irregularities and added there are provisions under which the state government will review the matter.Chhattisgarh forest department has said the Centre asked the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE) to conduct a biodiversity assessment and based on its report stage-II clearance was given.Shukla said it was after stage-I clearance of the project that concerned villagers complained about the fake documents to Baghel but nothing was done. “The state government should have objected to the ICFRE report...but the report was accepted and government, under the pressure of corporates, hurriedly sent it to the environment ministry.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarhs-hasdeo-arand-residents-plan-protest-in-delhi-against-mining-clearance-101635245356498.html

Margaret Harris told journalists that the technical advisory group is currently reviewing data on India's indigenously-made vaccine against coronavirus disease (Covid-19)."If all is in place and all goes well and if the committee is satisfied, we would expect a recommendation within the next 24 hours or so," news agency Reuters quoted Harris as saying at a UN press briefing in Geneva.Millions of Indians have taken a Covaxin shot but many have been unable to travel pending the WHO approval.The vaccine has been developed by Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical company Bharat Biotech. It had submitted the Expression of Interest (EOI) for the emergency use approval as far back as April 19, but WHO has said it needs more data from the company before showing the green light.Without a WHO nod, the two-dose Covaxin is unlikely to be accepted as a valid vaccine globally.Last Friday, a top official of the WHO said the process of thoroughly evaluating a vaccine for use and recommending it sometimes takes a long time but it has to be ensured that the right advice is given to the world."The World Health Organisation is very clear that we want all countries to recognise vaccines that have been given an Emergency Use Listing (EUL) by the WHO advisory process. But it's also very important that WHO, when it makes a recommendation like that, is making that globally,” WHO Health Emergencies Programme Executive Director Dr Mike Ryan had said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Indian Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers on Saturday and discussed various issues including furthering the vaccine research. The meeting was held within days of the country achieving a key milestone of administering one billion doses of the jabs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-may-get-approval-within-24-hours-says-who-official-101635244994003.html

Let the court deal with issues between two states over this and arrive at an amicable solution,” he said while echoing concerns of the people living downstream. The comments came a day after the Supreme Court directed Kerala and Tamil Nadu to discuss the water level in the dam and take a speedy decision to cap it.Joes Joseph, a resident of Kerala’s Idukki, has moved the court saying the level should not go above 139 feet in view of heavy rains in the area like in 2018 when Kerala faced the flood of the century. But Tamil Nadu opposed the plea, saying the court in 2014 fixed the maximum water level at 142 feet.Kerala government has been pressing for a new dam for years citing frequent tremors and changing rain patterns in the Idukki district where the old dam is situated. But Tamil Nadu has opposed it fearing that once the new dam is built, it would not get control over it.The dam was built in 1886 to supply water to southern Tamil Nadu for irrigation. Its main share of water goes to Tamil Nadu.Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday dispelled any immediate threat to the dam. He reiterated the state’s long-pending demand for a new dam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-governor-favours-new-dam-in-mullaperiyar-101635244282017.html

In his bail plea in the Bombay high court, he argued that no contraband material was seized from him and there was no evidence to suggest he consumed drugs. Aryan Khan also argued that the 6gm of “charas” seized from his friend Arbaaz Merchant was meant to be consumed, and considering that it was a small quantity, the offence can only attract a maximum punishment of up to a year’s jail or fine. Hence, he should be released on bail, he pleaded.The bail plea said there was nothing on record to suggest that Aryan Khan was connected to the sale, purchase or trafficking of any narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances.Aryan Khan moved the high court after a special court on October 20 rejected his bail plea, citing prima facie material indicating that “he was in contact with persons dealing with prohibited narcotic substances”.Also Read: Sameer Wankhede in Delhi, likely to meet NCB director generalAryan Khan, Merchant, and model Munmun Dhamech were arrested earlier this month.Special judge VV Patil had rejected Aryan Khan’s argument that nothing was found in his possession and there was no material to connect him to other accused persons from whom drugs were seized.“Perusal of papers shows that though nothing was found in possession of accused No. 1 (Aryan Khan), 6gm of ‘charas’ was found with accused No. 2 (Merchant), which was concealed in his shoes,” said the special court. The special court accepted the NCB’s argument that the accused were part of a drug network and Aryan Khan’s WhatsApp chats showed that he was in touch with a foreign national, and an unknown person dealing in drugs. It added during interrogation, they disclosed the names of the persons who supplied the contraband to them. “Thus, all these facts prima facie show that the accused acted in conspiracy with each other. It transpires that all the accused are connected in the same thread,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/falsely-implicated-in-drug-bust-case-says-srk-s-son-aryan-khan-in-bail-plea-101635243674862.html

Wankhede did not respond to phone calls and messages, but NCB sources said he will meet NCB’s director general in the Capital. Wankhede visit to New Delhi comes in the wake of the purported revelations made by Prabhakar Sail, a panch witness in the cruise drug bust case, that he was made to sign on blank papers at the NCB office after Aryan Khan and the others arrested along with him were taken there. He also alleged in a notarised affidavit that he overheard discussion between KP Gosavi, another witness in the case, and another person, who talked about a ₹18 crore deal, of which ₹8 crore was allegedly to be given to Sameer Wankhede. Sail was Gosavi’s bodyguard.

Such a document has not being filed in any proceeding before any court, despite the fact that the matter is sub judice before the Hon’ble Sessions Court and before this Hon’ble Court,” the affidavit says. “Curiously, the same has been clandestinely distribute and widely publicised in the media. Significantly, such purported affidavit clearly names one Pooja Dadlani, manager connected to this applicant (Aryan Khan).” “It so appears that the said lady appears to have influenced such panch witness when the investigation is ongoing. Such interference at the stage of investigation is mala fide to ensure that the same is derailed and the quest for truth is obstructed,” says the affidavit filed by VV Singh, investigation officer of the drug bust case. “Thus, the respondent respectfully states that as there are clear instances of tampering, influencing witnesses in the midst of an ongoing investigation, the bail application be rejected on such ground alone,” the affidavit says.Also Read: ‘It’s terrible that being Shah Rukh’s son has gone against him’: Rajit Kapur on Aryan KhanPrabhakar Sail, who claimed to have worked as a bodyguard of KP Gosavi, who was seen with drug enforcers in a raid on a cruise ship earlier this month, said in the affidavit that he was forced to sign on blank papers on that night. Gosavi, one of the witnesses in the case, is on the run and police have issued a lookout notice for him. Sail allegedly heard Gosavi and another person discussing monetary settlement for an amount of ₹25 crore, out of which ₹8 crore was supposed to be paid to a senior NCB official. Sail said in the affidavit that he overheard Gosavi telling a person called Sam D’Souza over the phone after Aryan Khan was brought to the NCB office after the October 3 raid about a demand of ₹25 crore and to settle at ₹18 crore as they “have to give ₹8 crore to Sameer Wankhede”, who is the Mumbai zonal director of NCB. He has since been provided protection by Mumbai police.Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan moved the Bombay high court for bail after the special NDPS court on October 20 rejected his bail application.

26-10-2021||India||J&K: UAPA cases filed over alleged videos of people celebrating Pak’s win||The Jammu and Kashmir Police have filed cases under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) over videos that purportedly showed some people in the union territory celebrating Pakistan’s victory over India in a T20 World Cup match in Dubai, UAE on Sunday.“We have registered a case,” said Vijay Kumar, inspector general (Kashmir).People aware of the matter said first information reports (FIRs) under the UAPA and the Indian Penal Code were filed on Monday at police stations in Srinagar’s Soura and Karan Nagar.“An FIR under the UAPA has been registered after there were purported celebrations and slogans following a cricket match. The case is not specific to videos on social media,” said an officer from the Soura police station, who requested no to be named.There is no provision for anticipatory bail under the UAPA, which provides for a minimum of five years of imprisonment.Videos have gone viral on social media purportedly showing celebrations in Kashmir following Pakistan’s one-sided win in the cricket match.Also Read: Mufti links Pak T20 win against India with J&K status, Vij says DNA ‘defective’HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the videos or confirm whether they were related to the India-Pakistan T20 World Cup match played in Dubai on Sunday.Alleged celebrations over the West Indies team’s win against India in the T20 World cup semi-final in 2016 had triggered a clash between non-local and local students at Srinagar’s National Institute of Technology.Former minister Sajad Lone has opposed calls for punitive action against those who reportedly rooted for Pakistan. “I strongly disagree. If you think that they are not patriotic enough because they cheered for another team, you should have the courage and the belief to wean them back if you think they have gone patriotically astray. Punitive actions won’t help. [They] have not helped in the past either,” Lone tweeted.Former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti questioned the anger against Kashmiris for allegedly celebrating Pakistan’s win on Sunday. “Some are even chanting murderous slogans... One hasn’t forgotten how many celebrated by distributing sweets when J&K was dismembered and stripped of special status [in 2019],” she said. “Let’s agree to disagree and take it in the right spirit like [Indian captain] Virat Kohli, who was the first to congratulate the Pakistani cricket team,” Mufti remarked.In Punjab, some students from Kashmir said they were beaten up after the match on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-uapa-cases-filed-over-alleged-videos-of-people-celebrating-pak-s-win-101635238154263.html

Speaking to reporters, Puri said, “I am talking to my counterparts in Saudi Arabia, the Gulf countries, and Russia… we are working at various levels.”Delhi | I am talking to my counterparts in Saudi Arabia, Gulf countries and Russia...we are working at various levels: Union Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on rising fuel prices pic.twitter.com/TGQQQIVGXuThe statement from the Union petroleum minister comes days after he commented that the taxes on petrol and diesel prices funded vaccinations against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and provided meals to the poor in the country. Refuting the “simplistic political narrative” that reducing levies will solve the crisis over high fuel prices, Puri had said, “Every time the price goes up due to something else, it [the said narrative] says you axe your own feet in the process.”As of Tuesday, petrol and diesel prices in India have remained constant for two consecutive days. However, the fuel rates are still at an all-time high with the latest price hike on October 24. Petrol is currently selling at ₹107.59 per litre in the country while diesel is priced at ₹96.32 a litre. In Mumbai, however, diesel has crossed the ₹100-per-litre mark and is currently selling at ₹104.Crude oil prices have also stabilised on Tuesday after remaining at a multi-year high the day prior. Union minister Puri had earlier warned that crude oil prices, if not maintained at sustainable levels, will severely impact the green shoots of global economic recovery.The oil prices were at a multi-year high as producers restricted supplies even amid an increased demand due to rapid economic recoveries from the Covid-19 pandemic. Other immediate factors included low US inventories and a shortage of coal in major economies such as China and India.Benchmark Brent crude, which soared to a three-year high at $86.1 a barrel during the trading session last week, continued to remain firm, hovering above $85.99 on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/talking-to-gulf-nations-saudi-russia-union-minister-on-rising-fuel-prices-101635231384323.html

The Babar Azam-led Pakistan team defeated India by 10 wickets in Dubai on Sunday to get off to a winning start in the tournament.The result of the match, like always, triggered a flurry of reactions on social media - understandably of anger from India and that of celebrations from Pakistan. There were reports that some people criticised those who slammed India. To this, Mehbooba Mufti, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief, said there is no need to show so much anger."Why such anger against Kashmiris for celebrating Pak's win? Some are even chanting murderous slogans- desh ke gadaaron ko goli maaro/calling to shoot traitors. One hasnt forgotten how many celebrated by distributing sweets when J&K was dismembered & stripped of special status," Mufti said in her tweet on Monday.Why such anger against Kashmiris for celebrating Pak’s win?

"Mehbooba Mufti's DNA is defective, she has to prove how much of an Indian she is," Vij was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.A few hours ago, he had expressed similar sentiments on Twitter. Vij said that the DNA of those who are celebrating Pakistan's win in T20 World Cup “cannot be Indian” and asked people to careful of "traitors" hiding in their own country.He had in the past too criticised Mufti for demanding that India should restart the dialogue with Pakistan.

The cause of the fire was being ascertained.Delhi fire services chief Atul Garg said household materials kept in a room caught fire. “All four died of smoke inhalation,” said Garg. Atul Garg added the fire control room received a call at around 4am about the inferno. Four fire tenders were rushed to the spot to douse the flames and rescue the occupants. The fire was brought under control and the house was inspected.“Four bodies, including those of two women, were found on the floor. They all belonged to the same family,” said Atul Garg.Deputy police commissioner (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram said the family resided in the building that had four floors.

26-10-2021||India||In Ayodhya, Arvind Kejriwal prays to Ram Lalla, Lord Hanuman||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal prayed to Ram Lalla at the Ram Janmabhoomi temple site in Ayodhya on Tuesday morning. Acharya Satyendra Das, the head priest of the makeshift Ram temple, performed puja with Vedic rituals.At around 9am, the Delhi chief minister reached Hanuman Garhi, where a section of saints not aligned with the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) led by Nirvani Ani Akhada head Mahant Dharam Das accompanied him. The same saints organised the Saryu aarti for Kejriwal on Monday evening when he arrived in Ayodhya.  Earlier in the day, Delhi chief minister Kejriwal went to the Hanuman Garhi temple to worship Lord Hanuman. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief reached Lucknow on Monday morning and left for Sultanpur, from where he reached Ayodhya on a two-day visit. Sanjay Singh, the AAP's Uttar Pradesh in-charge and Rajya Sabha MP, was accompanying the Delhi chief minister.Reacting to the development, BJP MLA from Ayodhya Sadar assembly constituency Ved Prakash Gupta said, “AAP was earlier opposing the Ram Mandir. The Delhi chief minister had even suggested that a university be made instead of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. Now they are talking about Lord Ram and seeking his blessings.”Continuing his critique, the BJP leader said, “People are not fools. They are well aware of the divisive politics of the AAP”.Notably, Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP has announced that it would contest the state assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh due to be held early next year. The party has said that it would contest all the 403 assembly seats in the 2022 elections.The AAP formally kicked off its poll campaign in September this year, with its senior leaders Manish Sisodia and Sanjay Singh offering prayers at the Ram Janmabhoomi and the Hanuman Garhi temple in Ayodhya. The party also took out a ‘Tiranga Yatra’ in Ayodhya on September 14 from the 18th-century mausoleum of Nawab Shujaudaulah to the Gandhi Park.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-ayodhya-arvind-kejriwal-prays-to-ram-lalla-lord-hanuman-101635227411797.html
26-10-2021||India||Lakhimpur Kheri: 'Hundreds of farmers, why only 23 witnesses?' SC asks UP govt||The Supreme Court asked the Uttar Pradesh government why are very few witnesses in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case when hundreds of farmers were present at the rally? It also directed the UP government to grant protection to the witnesses in the case. The court made the observation while holding a suo motu hearing on the matter.Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for UP government, told Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana-led bench that out of 68 witnesses, statements of 30 witnesses have been recorded under and 23 persons claim to be eyewitnesses of the incident.The court then said that there were hundreds of farmers in the rally and asked why only 23 eyewitnesses are there. It asked the UP government to identify more witnesses.“There was a crowd of 4,000-5,000 persons who are all local people and even post-incident most of have been agitating. This is what has been reported. Then, the identification of these people should not be a problem,” the bench said.The state government, in its reply, said people have seen the car and the people who were inside the car.The court then told UP government that if the eyewitness is more credible than a bystander then it is best to have first-hand information.The bench further ordered protection of witnesses in the Lakhimpur Kheri case and directed the Uttar Pradesh Police to expedite recording of eyewitnesses' statements before a judicial magistrate.“We direct the District judge concerned to entrust the task of recording of evidence under section 164 of the CrPC to the nearest judicial magistrates available,” said the bench which also comprised justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli.The court also sought a separate status report on death of four people, including a local journalist, in the incident and posted the matter for hearing on November 8.As many as eight people, including four farmers and a journalist, were killed on October 3 during a farmers' protest in Lakhimpur Kheri district. An SUV, belonging to Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Mishra's convoy, ran over them. Thirteen people, including Ashish Mishra, the prime suspect in the case and the Union minister’s son, have so far been arrested in connection with the incident.In its last hearing, the court had rapped the Uttar Pradesh Police for “dragging its feet” in the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-kheri-hundreds-of-farmers-why-only-23-witnesses-sc-asks-up-govt-101635227389085.html
26-10-2021||India||Climate change: India lost $87bn due to natural disasters last year, says WMO||India lost $87 billion last year due to natural disasters such as tropical cyclones, floods and droughts, according to the World Meteorological Organization’s (WMO) “State of the Climate in Asia” report released on Tuesday. The development came just days before a UN-led summit on climate change, COP26, starts in Glasgow, Scotland.The disasters that hit India resulted in an average annual loss (AAL) of several hundred billion dollars, as estimated by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), which the WMO referred to in its report.China recorded the highest loss, at $238 billion, followed by $87 billion in India and $83 billion in Japan. The highest AALs were associated with drought, the WMO said. The report also highlighted the impact of climate change days ahead of the COP26 UN summit that begins on October 31, saying that last year was the warmest year on record in Asia with a mean temperature 1.39 degrees Celsius above the 1981-2010 average.Also Read: Disha Ravi features on cover of Guardian’s weekend magazineThere were many heat extremes, including an all-time record of 38 degrees Celsius at Russia’s Verkhoyansk, which is the highest temperature recorded anywhere north of the Arctic Circle, according to the report.The South and East Asian summer monsoons were both unusually active last year, combined with frequent tropical cyclones, caused floods and landslides, leading to loss of life and displacement in many countries.Cyclone Amphan, one of the strongest cyclones recorded in recent times, hit the Sundarbans region in India and Bangladesh in May 2020, displacing 2.4 million people in India and 2.5 million people in Bangladesh, the report said, adding that intense cyclones, monsoon rains and floods hit densely populated areas in South Asia and East Asia, and led to the displacement of millions of people in India, China, Bangladesh, Japan, Pakistan, Nepal and Vietnam last year. Last year, average sea surface temperatures reached record highs in the Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean and the Arctic Ocean. Sea surface temperatures in and around Asia are increasing more than the global average at three times the rate in the case of the Arabian sea, the WMO pointed out in its report.Sea surface temperatures in parts of the Arctic Ocean have also been warming at three times the global average during the 1982-2020 period, the WMO said, identifying Barents Sea in the northern Arctic as a climate change hotspot.Arctic sea ice minimum extent after the summer melt in 2020 was the second lowest on record since 1979. The Eurasian shelf seas and the Northern Sea Route were completely ice-free in summer, yet again pointing to the deepening impact of climate change.Also Read: Developed nations fail to meet climate fund targetProgress on food security and nutrition has also slowed down, the report says. Last year, 48.8 million people in Southeast Asia, 305.7 million in South Asia and 42.3 million in West Asia are estimated to have been undernourished.“The true impact of Covid-19 on food security and nutrition are yet to be established. But compared with 2019, the number of undernourished people in 2020 increased 6% in Southeast Asia and West Asia, and by 20% in South Asia. Climate-related disasters compounded the problem,” the report said.“Weather and climate hazards, especially floods, storms and droughts, had a significant impact in many countries of the region, affecting agriculture and food security, contributing to increased displacement and vulnerability of migrants, refugees and displaced people, worsening health risks, and exacerbating environmental issues and losses of natural ecosystems,” said WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas in reference to the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/climate-change-india-lost-87-billion-to-natural-disasters-last-year-says-wmo-101635226813893.html

So far all his bail pleas have been rejected even though he was not found with any drugs. Along with Khan, at least eight people, including his friend Arbaaz Seth Merchant and model Munmun Dhamecha, were detained by NCB officials.ALSO READ | Don't imprison small-time drug offenders, ministry suggests change in NDPS ActA special NDPS court rejected the bail plea of Aryan Khan on October 20 and extended his judicial custody till October 30. The special court ruled that certain WhatsApp chats showed Aryan Khan's “involvement in illegal drugs activities" and his “nexus with peddlers and suppliers of banned drugs”.The NCB even hinted at the use of darknet in transactions for procuring drugs.The NCB argued before the special NDPS court last week that Aryan Khan was in “conscious possession” of illegal drugs as the agency found at least 6 grams of charas from Arbaaz Merchant, who allegedly admitted to the investigators that they intended to use it for “consumption and enjoyment.”ALSO READ | Is Aryan Khan's bail plea dismissal normal?

26-10-2021||India||Navy ready to push Predator drone acquisition with Modi govt||With the India-US two plus two dialogue scheduled in December, all eyes are on the Indian Navy to move the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) for possible announcement of the $3 billion procurement of armed Predator drones from Washington to strengthen India’s beyond the horizon capabilities.According to officials based in New Delhi and Washington, defence minister Rajnath Singh and external affairs minister S Jaishankar will meet their US counterparts, secretary of state Antony Blinken and defense secretary Lloyd Austin, in December in Washington with both sides on verge of finalisation of dates.While the stabilisation of drought facing Taliban-ruled Afghanistan and the Indo-Pacific in light of Chinese aggressive postures will be top of the agenda, there is a possibility of the two sides announcing the Predator deal provided the due government processes are completed. It is understood that the Indian Navy is ready to move the DAC for Acceptance of Necessity (AON) for acquisition of 30 MQ 9A Predator drones from General Atomics with each of the three services getting 10 Hell-Fire missile firing drones. As the Indian Navy is already operating two leased Predator drones for maritime domain awareness beyond the Straits of Malacca to Gulf of Aden, the acquisition process is being handled by them for both the Indian Air Force and the Indian Army. Despite initial reservations of the Indian Air Force, all services are on board on Predator acquisition.“The process is on. It involves the concurrence of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) after DAC clearance. The announcement can be done provided the process is complete before the two plus two dialogue or else it will be announced later,” said a top South Block official with the Indian Navy confirming that the US had clarified to their satisfaction about the project.Incidentally, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had met the CEO of General Atomics, which is the leading US manufacturer of armed drones, during his visit to Washington on September 23.In the context of the US getting permission to use Pakistani air space for maintaining beyond the horizon capabilities to target terrorists in Afghanistan, India also needs to strengthen its drone capabilities as the indigenous development of armed drones has miles to go. “Pakistan denial on allowing the US the use of its air space for beyond the horizon operations in Afghanistan must be taken with a pinch of salt, just as its denial of the presence of al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden in the past. One of the key reasons why the US did not want India to respond to Islamabad after the Parliament and Kaluchak terror attacks was due to the presence of US special forces in Pakistan after the 9/11 attacks. This was conveyed by then defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld to India in 2002,” said a Pakistan watcher.The Indian requirement for Predator armed drones has grown with China not only acquiring the capability but selling the Wing Loong armed drone to Pakistan, which can launch up to 12 air to surface missiles. Islamabad close ally Turkey has also acquired the armed drone capability with Bayraktar series of drones being used in Libya and Syria theatres and by Azerbaijan against Armenia in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navy-ready-to-push-predator-drone-acquisition-with-modi-govt-101635223209305.html

Speaking at the 67th National Film Awards ceremony, he said “a film should be a vehicle with a higher purpose - a carrier of social, moral and ethical message”.

Sarma has been directed to “explain his position” by 5pm on Tuesday. Both Borah and Saikia alleged that the CM, a top campaigner for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), had made announcements at election meetings promising the construction of medical colleges, roads, bridges, stadiums, development projects and financial grant to self-help groups of tea garden workers. “The commission is of the view that by making the above statements, you have violated the said provision of the model code of conduct,” said the notice issued by EC secretary NT Bhutia.

Apollo Hospitals, in a statement, said, however, it is an “indicative list” and the "final list of co-morbidities eligible for free vaccination would be as per the list published by the government".Zydus Cadila's Covid vaccine ZyCoV-D has already received Emergency Use Authorisation from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) in the country and will be administered to those aged 12 years and above. It is yet to be introduced in the nationwide Covid vaccination programme.As for the emergency use approval for Bharat Biotech's Covaxin in the 2-18 years age group by the DCGI, it is under expert evaluation, official sources had earlier said.On October 12, the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) on Covid-19 of the central drug authority had recommended granting emergency use authorisation to Covaxin for children and adolescents in the 2-18 years age group with certain conditions."It is anticipated that approval will soon be granted for vaccinating children with specified co-morbidities and immediately post-approval, and details of the age-group permitted for vaccination, the free vaccination initiative would be launched by Apollo Hospitals across its units," the statement said."The list is expected to include children with haematological, neurological, cardiac, liver, gastrointestinal, rheumatic, cancer, respiratory, genitourinary and developmental disorders," it said.Dr Prathap C Reddy, Chairman, Apollo Hospitals Group, said, "Adults have been the focus of vaccination till now as by and large, children have been spared from severe Covid infection. However, this is not the case in children with co-morbidities. These children continue to be at high risk of developing a severe infection. In addition, children with comorbidities have also seen a significant psychosocial impact as the lockdown resulted in their missing out on the personalised attention and specialised treatment and care that they require."The government's approval of vaccination for children with co-morbidities, when it comes through, will be a "welcome step in the right direction", he was quoted as saying in the statement."Realising the criticality of this vaccination, we will be extending the Covid vaccines completely free of cost to children with co-morbidities and giving them the necessary 'kavach' (shield) against Covid," Reddy said.Both vaccines would be available at Apollo Hospitals' vaccination centres across the country once all approvals by the government are in place and the vaccines are made available, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/apollo-hospitals-to-provide-free-covid-jabs-to-kids-with-certain-comorbidities-101635217427665.html

The magazine carried Ravi’s first-person account as part of a series titled: “Wrong side of the law. Right side of history: the activists arrested in the name of the planet.”Ravi, 22, is a member of Greta Thunberg’s Fridays for Future movement for awareness over the climate crisis. A Delhi court granted her bail calling the evidence against Ravi for allegedly fomenting trouble “scanty and sketchy evidence” amid outrage over her arrest. Ravi featured on the magazine cover days before the Glasgow Climate Change Conference (COP 26) is scheduled to begin in Glasgow on October 31.In the feature, Ravi recalls how her grandparents, who were farmers, struggled against a water crisis, which eventually motivated her to take interest in the climate crisis and become an activist.“When I was 18, I realised that this is the reality for millions in my country. The fact that it wasn’t front-page news was baffling,” she told the Guardian.Ravi referred to the uproar after her arrest and expressed concern over what she called the suppression of activists and journalists. “People are being punished for what are essentially thought crimes,” she told the Guardian. She added she receives “death threats daily” and that she is used to it.In a tweet, Ravi said: “I’m very honoured to be on the cover of the @guardian Weekend Magazine alongside 20 amazing people including @GeorgeMonbiot @Janefonda @orlamurphy_k @JackHarries @TedDanson and others who I can’t seem to find on Twitter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/climate-change-disha-ravi-featured-on-cover-of-guardian-s-weekend-magazine-101635217692725.html

26-10-2021||India||Indians can finally travel to Singapore again from today. Check details here||Indians can finally travel to Singapore again from Tuesday as the country has announced the resumption of travel for South Asian countries, including India, Nepal and Bangladesh. “All travellers with a 14-day travel history to Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka prior to departure to Singapore will be allowed to enter and transit through Singapore from 11.59 pm on Oct 26," Singapore's Strait Times reported, quoting its health ministry.Travellers from these countries were previously barred from entering Singapore. The new development is likely to have come after reviewing the Covid-19 situation in these countries.However, Singaporean authorities have stated that the travellers will still be subjected to strict quarantine rules. “Travellers from these countries will be subject to Category IV border measures. They will still be required to serve their 10-day stay-home notice (SHN) at dedicated SHN facilities,” the statement from the ministry added.The change in rules come at a time when Singapore has switched to a new model of dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. Unlike Indians, fully-vaccinated travellers from 15 countries -- including Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) -- will not have to undergo the mandatory quarantine when they land in Singapore.Singapore has been witnessing more than 3,000 daily Covid-19 infections recently. It reported 3,174 new Covid-19 cases and 14 deaths on Monday.Singapore is also extending some of its Covid-19 restrictions in preparation for the potential influx of tourists, workers and business travellers. The country’s Covid-19 task force said that the current restrictions will be extended till November 21.From January 1, 2022, only employees who are fully vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19 in the past nine months, can return to the workplace.“Unvaccinated employees will not be allowed to return to the workplace unless they have tested negative for Covid-19 before returning, and they will need to pay for the costs of these tests," said the country's health ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indians-can-finally-travel-to-singapore-again-from-today-check-details-here-101635214461147.html

On that day, between 11am and 2pm, there will be sit-ins and marches," the SKM said in the statement on Friday, reports news agency PTI.The SKM, a joint forum of farmer unions, demanded from the central government the fulfilment of its "legitimate demands" - repeal of the three anti-farmer laws, making minimum support price (MSP) into a legal entitlement for all produce and all farmers, and sacking as well as the arrest of Mishra.Farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have been camping at Delhi borders -- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur -- since November 26, 2020, to oppose the three contentious farm laws.Four of the eight people who died in the violence on October 3 were farmers, allegedly knocked down by a vehicle carrying Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers. The farmers then allegedly lynched some people in the vehicles. The other dead included two BJP workers and their driver.Farmers have claimed that Ajay Mishra's son Ashish was in one of the vehicles, an allegation denied by him and his father who say they can produce evidence to prove he was at another event at that time. Ashish Misra was arrested in the case on October 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-call-for-nationwide-protests-today-to-seek-union-min-ajay-mishra-s-arrest-101635212860397.html

Here's what happened in last proceeding||The Supreme Court will continue hearing the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case on Tuesday, a week after it rapped the Uttar Pradesh police for “dragging its feet” in the investigation. Noting that the special investigation team (SIT) probing the violence needed to get more witnesses to record their statements, the top court adjourned the proceedings last week to October 26. The bench asserted that the SIT must identify the vulnerable witnesses, provide them protection and record their statements under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), as it will have more evidentiary value.Also Read | Lakhimpur Kheri case key accused Ashish Mishra tested for dengue, hospitalisedAs many as eight people, including four farmers and a journalist, were killed on October 3 during a farmers' protest in Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri district. An SUV, belonging to Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Mishra's convoy, ran over them. Thirteen people, including Ashish Mishra, the prime suspect in the case and the Union minister’s son, have so far been arrested in connection with the incident.In its hearing last week, the Supreme Court asked the Uttar Pradesh government why the statements of only four witnesses had been recorded till then. Senior advocate Harish Halve, appearing for the government, sought to dispel the query by saying the police have arrested a number of those accused in the incident and that the statements of other witnesses were being recorded when the courts had shut due to the Dussehra break.The Supreme Court also asked the government why police custody of other accused was not sought, noting, “Until and unless they are interrogated by police, you won't find out.”Also Read | What happened in Lakhimpur Kheri: Sequence of events according to both sidesEarlier, too, the top court expressed its dissatisfaction over the steps taken by the Uttar Pradesh government in the “brutal murder” of the eight men in Lakhimpur Kheri.

On Friday, he was taken into two-day police custody along with three others for further interrogation in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-kheri-supreme-court-to-continue-hearing-today-here-s-what-happened-in-last-proceeding-101635207156249.html

26-10-2021||India||WHO to consider emergency use listing of Covaxin in meet today||The World Health Organization (WHO) will meet on Tuesday to consider much-coveted emergency use approval to Covaxin, India's indigenously-made vaccine against coronavirus disease (Covid-19). According to WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan, the global health body's technical advisory group will meet on October 26 to consider the emergency use listing (EUL) for Covaxin, which is already being used nationwide in the inoculation campaign against the pandemic.Also Read | Centre writes to states over delay in giving second dose of Covid-19 vaccineBharat Biotech, the Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical company which developed Covaxin, has now been waiting for months for the specialised United Nations (UN) agency to provide a formal nod to its Covid-19 vaccine. It had submitted the Expression of Interest (EOI) for the emergency use approval as far back as April 19, but WHO has said it needs more data from the company before showing the green light.Last week, a top official of the global health body said the process of thoroughly evaluating a vaccine for use and recommending it sometimes takes a long time but it has to be ensured that the right advice is given to the world “even if it takes another week or two.”Also Read | As Covaxin awaits nod, WHO official says, ‘it takes longer sometimes’Dr Mike Ryan, the executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, said that the UN agency is “very clear” that it wants all countries to recognise vaccines that have been given a EUL by the WHO advisory process. “But it is also very important that WHO, when it makes a recommendation like that, is making that globally,” Ryan added.WHO has said it “cannot cut corners” to recommend Covaxin’s inclusion in the EUL for vaccination against Covid-19. The agency said it is expecting one additional piece of information from the Covaxin manufacturer which has been submitting data on a rolling basis.The WHO nod for Covaxin’s emergency use authorisation is a much-anticipated one for its widespread acceptability as a safe and effective vaccine. Presently, India is using Covaxin in its nationwide inoculation drive against Covid-19 as one of the six vaccines approved by the Drugs Controller General of India for the same, including the Oxford-AstraZeneca’s Covishield and the Russian-made Sputnik V.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-to-consider-emergency-use-listing-of-covaxin-in-meet-today-101635204897421.html
26-10-2021||India||BJP, Cong keeps up pressure on Odisha’s Naveen Patnaik govt over Kalahandi case||BHUBANESWAR: Odisha’s ruling Biju Janata Dal continues to face the onslaught from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress, who have been demanding dismissal of minister of state for home Dibya Shankar Mishra on grounds that he was close to the school president arrested for the murder of a 26-year-old school teacher Mamita Meher of Kalahandi district.On Monday, BJP mahila morcha activists staged a sit-in at the busy Master Canteen square of Bhubaneswar - their mouth covered with a black band - to demand that Mishra be sacked from the Naveen Patnaik council of ministers over his alleged patronage of Gobind Sahu, president of Sunshine School managing committee in Mahalinga panchayat of Kalahandi district Sahu was arrested last week later on charges of killing Mamita Meher, burning her body and burying the remains in an under-construction stadium in the school campus.While Sahu was sent to judicial custody at the end of his 5-day police remand on Monday, minister Mishra and the Naveen Patnaik government have continued to be on the firing line of the opposition who are attempting to make women’s safety a campaign point ahead of the panchayat polls scheduled in February next year. Senior BJP leader Bijoy Mohapatra has alleged that an effort was made to reach a compromise between the teacher and Sahu at the Raipur residence of Mishra.“This has been going on for the past two months and efforts were made to settle issues between Mamita and the accused, Gobinda Sahu. The call records of the minister, main accused Sahu and Meher can easily be retrieved and verified to ascertain the minister’s involvement in the case. Police have examined some call records of Mishra and informed the chief minister about the findings,” Mohapatra claimed.The BJP, which organised two bandhs in Kalahandi and Balangir districts last week, on Monday insisted that police should also arrest the minister. “If no action is taken, then the party will hold protests in front of all the district police offices across the state on October 26 and 27 for justice to Meher,” said Irasish Acharya, Odisha BJP youth wing president.Congress spokesperson Debasish Patnaik said it was a surprise that chief minister Naveen Patnaik hasn’t spoken yet in context of allegations against his minister.Minister Mishra did not comment on the demands of opposition parties seeking his removal.The BJD, which is on the backfoot over the teacher’s murder and subsequent allegations against minister, has refused to take any action insisting that he is not to be held responsible for any crime by Sahu.“Members of educational institutions generally have photographs with guests visiting schools or colleges. But can the political leaders be held responsible for the activities of the members of managing committees of the schools or colleges,” said BJD spokesperson Lenin Mohanty, hitting out at the BJP and Congress alleging that they were trying to derail police investigation into the murder case.“Many Congress leaders also visited the college managed by Sahu. Former Kalahandi MP and senior Congress leader Bhakta Charan Das visited the college more than once and sanctioned ₹36 lakh from his MPLAD Fund for the college between 2009 and 2014. Congress MLA from Khariar, Adhiraj Panigrahi had also visited the college as a guest.”Political observers and women activists say there may have been a shift in Naveen Patnaik’s stance towards atrocities on women.“Naveen Patnaik was a prime beneficiary of the public anger towards the JB Patnaik regime after several cases of women atrocities including the Chhabirani gangrape case as well as Anjana Mishra gangrape case in 1980s and late 1990s. In the initial years of his chief ministership, Naveen promptly took action against any minister at the slightest hint of impropriety... But in the case of Mishra, there has been a clear shift as the party thinks it can ride over the storm without much political loss,” said political observer Rabi Das.“But this is not the first case. In January this year, law minister Pratap Jena was named along with 13 others over his alleged involvement in the double murder of a 75-year-old BJP leader and his 80-year-old associate in Cuttack district. Yet he was not asked to put in his papers.”Noted women’s activist Tapasi Praharaj said while the Naveen Patnaik government has been assiduously seeking women votes by empowering women self help groups, his government was oblivious to their safety.“As per the NCRB report the rate of crime against women in Odisha was second only to Assam in 2020. Starting from the rape of a 14-year-old Dalit girl in Koraput in October 2017 to the murder of a woman teacher in Rayagada district in October 2013, women in Odisha continue to be at the receiving end. While it is still not clear about the involvement of the minister in the murder case of the woman teacher, he should have stepped down from the ministry in the fairness of things. But as we have seen in the past several cases including the Pratap Jena case, the ruling party is choosing to brazen it out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-cong-keeps-up-pressure-on-odisha-s-naveen-patnaik-govt-over-kalahandi-case-101635192549958.html

I get very angry when it comes to corruption. I do not take it kindly. On the day when the lockdown was announced, the government said that even the stores selling basic essentials would not be allowed to open but that they would supply door to door. Which was impossible, but there was one company that had given money. Then people from the Congress, others approached me and told me about it. So I informed the Prime Minister,” Satya Pal Malik said in an interview to India Today TV.He also said, “There was corruption in the Goa government in handling everything. because of that I was sent away from there”.Chief minister Pramod Sawant hasn’t spoken yet on the former Goa governor’s comments but the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) defended him, saying Malik’s statements were ‘misinformed’.“Governor Satyapal Malik has erred in his statements. We will bring this to the notice of the central leadership,” Goa BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade said.In his interview, Malik also frowned at Pramod Sawant’s handling of the lockdown, and recalled how he spoke against the Sawant government’s “unnecessary” plan to build a new Raj Bhavan in Goa.Goa’s opposition parties rushed to demand that Pramod Sawant step down. Congress leader and leader of Opposition in the assembly Digambar Kamat said Sawant has “no moral right to continue” after the governor’s indictment.
26-10-2021||India||Only marriage between man, woman valid, says Centre in Delhi high court||Decriminalizing homosexuality has nothing to do with same-sex marriages and a valid marriage can take place only between a biological man and a biological woman, the Union government told the Delhi high court on Monday.“The law is settled, either with or without the Navtej Johar case (a reference to the judgment decriminalizing homosexuality). The law is settled, personal laws are settled and marriage, which is contemplated, is between a biological man and biological woman,” solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh.The court was hearing a clutch of pleas seeking legal recognition of same sex marriages under the Special Marriage Act and Foreign Marriage Act, including those by Abhijit Iyer Mitra, Gopi Shankar, Giti Thadani and G Oorvasi.The bench was also hearing a plea by three persons, Joydeep Sengupta, an OCI (overseas citizen of India), Russell Blaine Stephens, a US citizen, and Mario D’Penha, an Indian citizen and queer rights academic and activist pursuing a PhD at Rutgers University, for allowing a foreign-origin spouse of an OCI cardholder apply for registration regardless of gender or sexual orientation.The petitioners, through advocate Karuna Nundy, said all same-sex or queer marriages should be legally recognized in India under the applicable statutes, rules and policies that are in force.The government is yet to respond on this aspect, said Nundy, appearing for Sengupta and Stephens, while pointing out that the couple were married in New York and the laws applicable in their case are the Citizenship Act, 1955, Foreign Marriage Act, 1969, and the Special Marriage Act, 1954.Section 7 A (1) (d) of the Citizenship Act does not distinguish between heterosexual, same-sex or queer spouses, she said. It provides that a person married to an OCI, whose marriage is registered and subsisting for two years, should be declared eligible to apply as a spouse for an OCI card.However, Mehta contended that “spouse” means husband and wife; “marriage” is a term associated with heterosexual couples; and thus there is no need to file a specific reply with respect to the Citizenship Act.“Everything would turn whether your lordship recognizes the submission…on the question of marriage and registration of marriage. Whether it has to be between a biological man and biological woman....Then the entire matter depends on that. There appears to be some miscommunication based on Navtej Johar, which merely decriminalizes 377….But it has nothing to do with marriage,” the central government’s lawyer said.Lawyer Saurabh Kirpal, appearing for one of the petitioners, disagreed with Mehta’s submission of marriages between biological man and woman, and said he would argue against it.The parties said they were ready with their pleadings and the matter could be fixed for final hearing.Following this, the court posted the matter for November 30 for a final hearing, while granting liberty to the parties to file written submissions.The first plea filed by Mitra, Shankar, Thadani and Oorvasi, through counsel Raghav Awasthi, had contended that the Hindu Marriage Act does not distinguish between heterosexual and homosexual marriages if one were to go by how it is worded. The act clearly states marriage can be solemnised between “any two Hindus,” the petition argued.The second petition was filed by two mental health professionals, Kavita Arora, 47, and Ankita Khanna, 36, seeking legal recognition of their marriages under two different civil laws, the Special Marriage Act and the Foreign Marriage Act.The third plea was filed by two men, Vaibhav Jain, an Indian citizen, and Parag Vijay Mehta, an OCI, who were married in the United States, where same-sex marriage is legal, in 2017. They sought the same relief as Arora and Khanna, stating that an Indian consulate refused to register their union this year under the Foreign Marriage Act.Another set of petitioners, Sengupta, Stephens and D’Penha, contended that Sengupta and Stephens been in a loving relationship for nearly 20 years and were married in New York on August 6, 2012, which is recognised in the US, France and Canada.Since Stephens wished to apply for OCI status under Section 7 A (1)(d) of the Citizenship Act in order to be entitled to multiple entry lifelong visa for visiting India, the couple approached D’Penha to file right to information (RTI) applications to ascertain the legal position on Stephen’s eligibility.The three moved the high court after “the ministries kept transferring the RTIs back and forth” and no effective response was received.The Centre has opposed the pleas, saying a marriage in India can be recognised only if it is between a “biological man” and a “biological woman” capable of producing children, strongly opposing the validation of same-sex marital unions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/samesex-marriage-plea-only-marriage-between-man-woman-valid-says-centre-in-delhi-high-court-101635188830742.html
26-10-2021||India||Dabur pulls out ad with lesbian couple after MP minister’s warning||Bhopal: Consumer goods company Dabur India Limited on Monday tendered an apology and withdrew an advertisement featuring a lesbian couple celebrating the Hindu festival of Karwa Chauth after Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra criticised it for showing “objectionable content” and said that legal steps would be taken if the advertisement was not withdrawn. “Today, they are showing two women celebrating Karva Chauth. Tomorrow, they will come up with an advertisement that shows two men getting married. We cannot allow anyone to show such objectionable content,” Mishra told reporters in a press conference in Bhopal on Monday morning.“Fem’s Karwachauth campaign has been withdrawn from all social media handles and we unconditionally apologise for unintentionally hurting people’s sentiments,” Dabur India said in a statement released on its official Twitter handle in the afternoon.The Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company dropped the advertisement for Fem Crème Bleach over various social media platforms on October 23, a day before the festival. The 1.06-minute advertisement showed two women getting ready for the ritual of the festival in which traditionally, a woman is expected to maintain a day-long fast for her husband and break it after viewing the moon at night.“I had asked to send a warning to withdraw the advertisement before registering an FIR for hurting religious sentiments. It’s good that they withdrew the advertisement and also tender apology for that,” Mishra later told HT. The advertisement drew strong reactions over the social media platform as many users applauded it for infusing a traditional festival with a queer storyline. However, the hashtag “BoycottFem” also began to trend as many complained that the advertisement was meant to hurt religious sentiments. This prompted Dabur India to release a statement on Sunday evening clarifying their stance:“Dabur and Fem as a brand strive for diversity, inclusion, and equality and we proudly support these values in our organisation and within our communities. Our campaign too reflects the same. (…) Our intention is not to offend any beliefs, customs and traditions, religious or otherwise. If we have hurt the sentiments of any individual or group, it was unintentional and we apologise. We are also humbled by everyone who have showered their support for the brand and the campaign.”The controversy comes at a time when there are a clutch of petitions seeking recognition of same-sex marriage before the Delhi and Kerala high courts. On Monday, the Centre told the Delhi high court, which is hearing four petitions seeking legalisation that a valid marriage can only take place between a biological man and a biological woman. The court will begin final hearing on the matter on November 30.The advertisement also received flak from various quarters within the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer and Intersex (LGBTQI) community.“Some of our biggest crusaders for queer rights in the country today are transwomen of Dalit and non-Savarna identities. We do disgrace to their labour if we thought this ad could go viral in our name. The ad’s final tagline clearly says that our queerness will be acceptable as long as we are cis-passing, fair-skinned and following certain traditions of living,” Tejaswi, Digital Editor, Gaysi Family, a digital platform that publishes queer content, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dabur-pulls-out-ad-with-lesbian-couple-after-mp-minister-s-warning-101635188829270.html
26-10-2021||India||IMD: Southwest monsoon withdraws from country||The southwest monsoon withdrew from the entire country on Monday, making it the seventh-most delayed retreat since 1975, and with the setting in of north-easterly winds, northeast monsoon commenced over south peninsular India, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).“In view of significant reduction in rainfall activity over most parts of the country, the southwest monsoon has withdrawn from the entire country today (Monday). Simultaneously, with the setting in of north-easterly winds in the lower tropospheric levels, the northeast monsoon rain has commenced over extreme south peninsular India today,” IMD said.“The withdrawal of the southwest monsoon 2021 from the entire country is the seventh-most delayed withdrawal (on or after October 25) during 1975-2021,” it said.The southwest monsoon had completely withdrawn from the country on October 28 last year; October 25 in 2017; October 28 in 2016; October 29 in 2010; October 25 in 2000 and October 27 in 1975. Interestingly, the southwest monsoon retreated on or after October 25 five times between 2010 and 2021 — in 2017, 2010, 2016, 2020 and 2021, the IMD data showed.DS Pai, scientist and head of climate research and services at IMD Pune, said the past 10 years have shown delayed withdrawal of monsoon from the country. “Southwest monsoon should withdraw from the country around October 15 and northeast monsoon should commence over peninsular India by October 20. But there is some delay. This may be linked to a prolonged summer in the northern hemisphere. It is also linked to climate change, which the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) has also recognised in its latest report,” Pai said.Unseasonal rain in October triggered by western disturbances caused flooding and landslides in different parts of northwest India earlier this month. Uttarakhand in particular was badly impacted. “…Delayed monsoon withdrawal from the country (has) provided adequate moisture for intensification of rainfall episodes,” Pai added.In October so far (till October 25), the country has witnessed 42% excess rainfall, with 212% excess rain over northwest India; 22% excess over east and northeast India; 19% excess over central India and 28% excess over south peninsula. Against a normal of 21.4 mm rainfall, northwest India has recorded 66.8 mm rain. Uttarakhand and Delhi, for example, have recorded 525% and 444% excess rain, respectively.Meanwhile, Met department said that a cyclonic circulation is likely to develop over southeast Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood by Tuesday. It is likely to move westwards and under its influence, a low-pressure area is likely to form over central parts of South Bay of Bengal during subsequent 48 hours.Isolated heavy rainfall is likely over Tamil Nadu and Puducherry till October 29, over Kerala till October 27; over south interior Karnataka till October 26; over coastal Andhra Pradesh and Rayalaseema on October 28 and 29, IMD said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imd-southwest-monsoon-withdraws-from-country-101635188293093.html

I seek blessings from Ma Saryu for prosperity of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and rest of the country... The country is facing the corona pandemic. But for the last few days situation in under some control. With blessing of Ma Saryu and Lord Ram, soon we will be free from this pandemic.”He added that he prayed to Lord Ram to make the country “number one”.“We together, 130 crore people of this country can make this possible,” said Kejriwal. “I am much younger to many people present here. But with my experience of running Delhi government in the past five years I can assure that 130 crore people this country together can make this happen if they work like family.”Kejriwal reached Lucknow on Monday morning, and reached Ayodhya on a two-day visit in the evening, accompanied by the AAP’s Uttar Pradesh in charge and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh.According to Vaibhav Maheshwari, AAP’s state spokesperson, the Delhi CM will pay obeisance to Ram Lalla at the Ram Janmabhoomi site, and to Lord Hanuman at Hanuman Garhi temple on Tuesday.The ruling BJP slammed the visit. “AAP was opposing Ram Mandir. They wanted a university instead of Ram Mandir at Ram Janmabhoomi. Now, in Ayodhya they are talking about Lord RamThey have no political base in Uttar Pradesh,” said Ved Prakash Gupta, BJP’s MLA from Ayodhya Sadar assembly constituency.The AAP has already said it will contest the assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh due in February-March next year.

26-10-2021||India||Reconsider PC appeals of 5 women officers: Supreme Court to Army||The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Union government and the Army to reconsider the case of five women short service commission officers (WSSCOs), who were denied permanent commission after being assessed from 1999 to 2005 on annual confidential report (ACR)-based assessment system, and failed to get over 60% marks, the threshold for grant of PC as fixed by the apex court in March.The officers in question approached the top court, complaining against the unit assessment card (UAC) system that prevailed till 2005. This system was discontinued by the Army in September 2005 and replaced by ACR-based assessment policy for grant of PC. However, their plea to be considered for PC was rejected by the Delhi high court on September 17 against which the officers had filed appeals. The petitioner officers were discharged from the Army in July.Senior advocates Huzefa Ahmadi and V Mohana, appearing for the officers, sought to challenge the denial of PC on the faulty UAC system and the failure of Army to consider their exceptional achievements beyond the stipulated ACRs of the fifth and tenth year of service. “If the UAC assessment marks are eschewed, these officers will get far above 60% marks required by them to get PC,” Ahmadi said.Mohana pointed out that the apex court’s March 25 judgment specifically named two of the petitioners — Gopika Bhati and Sonali Singh — for their exemplary achievements and suggested their entire track record be taken into consideration for grant of PC.Bhati was the only officer to receive General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) commendation card for rendering emergency duties in Northern Command Sector and was part of Operation Parakram and Operation Vijay, besides being a national-level squash and tennis player. As regards Sonali Singh, the judgment noted that she was the first woman officer to be convoy commander for Pathankot to Leh in 1999 and was the first woman to be the officer in-charge of Ammunition Dump, Amritsar, during Operation Parakram.Additional solicitor general (ASG) Sanjay Jain and senior advocate R Balasubramanian were present in the court, representing the Centre and Army, respectively. “We have gone as per the court’s decision. The direction was to review the method of evaluation for future batches. If a better system has replaced an old one that does not mean that the old system is condemned,” said Jain, while arguing that any concession will mean dipping the merit below 60% marks.The bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna told the Centre to have a considerate view as the matter involved a small group of officers affected by UAC system. “These are officers who have made achievements. This cannot be ignored. You must add up their achievements while computing 60%. If there are vigilance and discipline grounds on which they have been rejected, we would be the last to interfere,” the bench observed.Both Jain and Balasubramanian sought time to confer with the authorities and proposed to get back by November 12, the next date for hearing the matter.Recently, the court had directed the Army to reconsider the case of 72 WSSCOs, who were denied PC. On a nudge by the Supreme Court, Army reconsidered the list and agreed to grant PC to 39 officers. The court appreciated the Army for its fair stand even as it called for reasons for refusing PC to the remaining officers. This matter too is listed for November 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reconsider-pc-appeals-of-5-women-officers-supreme-court-to-army-101635188109121.html
26-10-2021||India||Army brass holds key meet amid LAC row||The army’s top brass on Monday kicked off a biannual conference to deliberate on key organisational and operational issues, including the prevailing situation along the country’s northern border with China where the two armies are negotiating disengagement of rival troops from friction points on the Line of Actual Control (LAC), officials familiar with the development said. Infrastructure development in the border areas and induction of niche technologies will also be discussed during the four-day conference chaired by army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane. The conference began a fortnight after the 13th round of military talks to cool tensions in Ladakh between India and China reached an impasse on October 10, with PLA not agreeing to suggestions made by the Indian Army. The military dialogue took place more than two months after the last round of talks that led to disengagement of forward deployed troops from Gogra, or Patrol Point-17A, which was one of the flashpoints on LAC in Ladakh. If the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is there to stay in the Ladakh theatre so is the Indian Army, Naravane said on October 9, referring to the military buildup and infrastructure development across LAC. India and China have been locked in a border standoff for over 17 months and despite two rounds of disengagement at friction points this year, the two sides still have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each in the Ladakh theatre. Outstanding problems at Hot Springs and Depsang are yet to be resolved to lay the groundwork for the de-escalation of the Ladakh border row. The conference also comes days after Naravane visited Jammu & Kashmir for a security review after several soldiers were killed in a counterterror operation, and renewed infiltration attempts by Pakistani terrorists are being witnessed along the Line of Control after a temporary lull following the renewal of a ceasefire pact with Pakistan in February 2021. “The apex leadership of Indian Army will brainstorm on current/emerging security and administrative aspects to chart future course in the backdrop of the situation along the borders and challenges imposed by Covid-19 pandemic,” the defence ministry said in a statement on Sunday. The current theaterisation model, a long-awaited military reform with the full backing of the government, seeks to set up four new integrated commands for synergy in operations --- two land-centric theatres, the Air Defence Command and the National Maritime Theatre Command. The creation of theatre commands could take two to three years, with senior officers from the three services being assigned key responsibilities to finalise the joint structures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-brass-holds-key-meet-amid-lacrow-101635187876716.html

Our contact is with you- innocent village people, we have grown from you,” an emotional Kumaraswamy said.Addressing a gathering at a party event at Gubbi near here, he said, “In our family, we have never done politics with money. We have worked with the support of lakhs of workers like you, and with your blessings.” “...some great people are talking about me asking for a suitcase (containing money), if god is there, he will take care of them,” he added.The former Chief Minister was referring to allegations levelled against him during a campaign for Sindagi and Hangal by-polls by his former confidant and now Congress MLA B Z Zameer Ahmed Khan of indulging in “suitcase politics.” Stating that he has gone through lot of pain and has put in all efforts to build the party despite ill-health, Kumaraswamy said, “ I would have died during my Israel visit (2017), but I survived because of the good deeds of my parents...after going through heart surgery for second time, within one month I travelled across the State to build the party.” Questioning as to which leader has travelled with him across the state to build the party other than party supremo H D Deve Gowda despite his old age, he said, “In this part (old Mysuru region) you show affection to me as people belonging to my community are there, but I will have to go to north Karnataka and build the party. I will go there as well. Despite all these efforts, today we are in a position to win 28-40 seats.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/never-indulged-in-any-money-politics-kumaraswamy-101635187875539.html

Speaking to media in Vijayapura district during his election campaign, he called the allegation baseless and said no government work has suffered as ministers have been campaigning for two or three days. “We know what Congress leaders did when the party was in power. All ministers are performing the responsibilities given to them,” he said, adding that nothing is wrong with ministers campaigning in bypolls, since it was their duty towards the party. On Sunday, Karnataka Pradesh Congress president DK Shivakumar had leveled allegations of government work being sidelined due to bypoll work. “People will teach a lesson to the BJP, whose ministers and CM have locked up Vidhana Soudha and are camping in Hangal and Sindagi ahead of the bypolls,” Shivakumar said on Sunday. In Hangal, the chief minister claimed that the BJP candidate Shivaraj Sajjanar will triumph with a massive majority. Bommai also defended the release of the vision document speaking about the government’s achievements during the election campaign. He contended that the ruling party has to speak about its achievements and its commitments. Meanwhile, with the infrastructure in Bengaluru crumbling following heavy rains since October and with the Bommai busy campaigning for the October 30 bypolls, angry residents on Sunday took to social media to apprise the chief minister of the problem they are facing. Several users even challenged the chief minister to accompany them on a city tour to get a sense of the trouble people are going through.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-cm-bommai-hits-back-at-cong-bypoll-jibe-says-ministers-performing-responsibilities-101635187871602.html
26-10-2021||India||Centre puts NEET-PG counselling on hold||Counselling for admission to postgraduate medical and dental courses have been put on hold by the central government since some doctors have challenged the government’s July 29 decision to reserve 27% of the all-India quota seats for other backward classes and economically weaker sections. Counselling for candidates who have cleared the National Eligibility Entrance Test – Post Graduate (NEET-PG) 2021 will not take place till the Supreme Court decides on the matter, additional solicitor general KM Nataraj told a bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna on Monday. The October 22 notice to that effect was not meant for candidates, but for colleges to verify the seats, the government’s lawyer said. The health ministry has issued a clarification to allay the concerns of the candidates, Nataraj said. The petitioners had expressed concern over the notification issued by the Directorate General of Health Services that informed candidates about counselling from Monday. “We were taken aback by this notice and so had to mention it before the court,” said Arvind Datar, lawyer for the petitioners. “All candidates participating in the NEET-PG Counselling, 2021 are hereby informed that the PG Counselling is scheduled to commence from October 25,” the notice had said. “The National Medical Commission (NMC) and National Board of Examinations (NBE) have informed that new letter of permission and accreditations will be issued by November 15.”“We will go by your word,” the court told Nataraj on Monday. “Please make sure, otherwise students will be put to great difficulty.” After the court proceedings, the health directorate issued another notification. “All the candidates/participating colleges are informed that the counselling for NEET-PG 2021 has been put on hold due to the pending court case before the Supreme Court of India,” the fresh notice said. “Once clarifications are sought or received from the Court, the counselling for NEET-PG 2021 shall commence.”The Court is hearing a clutch of petitions challenging the July 29 decision of the government on several grounds, chief among them being breach of the 50% threshold for providing reservations laid down in 1992 by a ruling by an apex court bench of nine judges, lack of justifiable criteria to identify economically weak beneficiaries, and arbitrary announcement on reservation after the registration process for the postgraduate courses had begun.Last week, the court had directed the central government to file an affidavit pointing to the study that went behind fixing an annual income cut-off of ₹8 lakh for identifying EWS. The court had noted that EWS quota was meant for financially poor families, as compared to OBCs, who are socially and educationally backward. The Court had observed that the criteria of ₹8 lakh to identify the socially advanced among OBCs, known as the creamy layer, cannot be the yardstick to identify EWS beneficiaries. It also questioned having a single yardstick for the entire nation, when stark differences exist in purchasing power and per capita GDP from state to state and in rural and urban settings within states.The EWS quota was introduced in 2019 through the 103rd Constitution Amendment Act by which a new clause was introduced in Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution, providing for EWS quota in admissions and employment. The challenge to this law is pending consideration before a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court. The Centre had told the bench hearing the NEET-PG aspirants that the issues about EWS quota fall squarely for consideration before the constitution bench.“This court is not embarking upon any issue of policy but this court must be apprised of the nature of criterion for EWS category,” the two-judge apex court bench has said. The Court also asked the Centre to say how the implementation of both OBC and EWS quotas was justified as reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, which amount to 22.5%, is already earmarked within the all-India quota seats.The July 29 decision applies to 50% postgraduate seats and 15% undergraduate seats under the all-India quota seats. The decision would benefit every year nearly 1,500 OBC students in MBBS and 2,500 OBC students in postgraduate courses and also around 550 EWS students in MBBS and around 1000 EWS students in postgraduate programmes, the central government has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-puts-neet-pg-counselling-on-hold-till-supreme-court-decides-on-obc-ews-quota-101635187870362.html

26-10-2021||India||Karnataka resumes classes for 1 to 5 with strict Covid norms after 18 months||After a long gap of 18 months. schools in Karnataka re-opened for students of classes 1 to 5 from Monday. As per the government orders, schools have to follow strict Covid-19 precautions and a parental consent letter for physical classes is mandatory. According to the department of education, 27.39% attendance was reported in class 1, while class 2 reported attendance of 24.69%. Classes 3, 4 and 5 reported attendance of 23.58%, 24.14% and 23.95% respectively. Karnataka government took the decision to reopen primary schools since the number of Covid-19 cases in the state is showing a consistent decline. Following a meeting with Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on October 18, the government had announced the reopening of schools for students of classes 1 to 5. Strict Covid norms were issued by the Department of Primary and Secondary Education following the meeting. The government has laid down rules such as screening for Covid-19 symptoms on entry points, 50% of the capacity in a classroom, provision of hand sanitisers, the physical distancing of a minimum of one meter as practically feasible, no crowding, particularly at school entry and exit and disinfecting classrooms and restrooms daily using 1% sodium hypochlorite solution, as part of the plans to reopen primary schools. The government has also made it mandatory that only teachers and staff who have been fully vaccinated would be allowed in classes 1 to 5. The government guidelines also mandated that there shall be additional use of face shields by teachers who are over 50 years of age. Primary and secondary education minister BC Nagesh said classes will be held for half a day during the first week and had asked parents to send children to school without any fear. The government had reopened schools for students of classes 6 to 8 from September 6 and for students of classes 9 to 12 from August 23. Despite the schools reopening, several private schools in Bengaluru and in different places across the state, have decided to reopen schools for these students only after Deepavali. R Manjunath Srivatsa, joint secretary and legal cell head, CBSE, ICSE & State Board Private School Management Association (CISPMAM) said that private schools will reopen after November 15 since there will be a break for Deepavali. “Schools are now conducting mid-term examinations. So, most want to delay reopening for primary sections,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-resumes-classes-for-1-to-5-with-strict-covid-norms-after-18-months-101635187812182.html
26-10-2021||India||90% population in six Karnataka districts given one dose: Data||Six districts in Karnataka have administered 90% of its population with the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccination, the Karnataka’s Department of health and family welfare said. According to their data, Bengaluru district (excluding BBMP), Kodagu, Udupi, Ramanagaram, Uttara Kannada and Hassan have achieved the landmark.Special Commissioner (health) Trilok Chandra said that across the state, the first dose coverage stands around 86% and the second dose has been administered to 52% of the population, while 16 districts have achieved a higher first dose coverage than the state average. Despite the good performance by the six districts, the state government’s target for vaccinating the state by the year end still remains a distant goal. The Karnataka government has reiterated its goal to inoculate at least 70% of its over 70 million population with two doses of Covid-19 vaccine and around 90% with the first by the year-end. Experts had opinioned that at least 75% of the state’s population should be given the first dose to blunt the effects of a potential third wave. “There is no doubt that if we don’t vaccinate enough population, the third wave will be as bad, or even worse, than the second,” said CN Manjunath, Karnataka Covid-19 task force member and director of Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research. “Only if are able to build enough herd immunity can we blunt the impact of the third wave. But it is going to be a challenge,” he said. According to Dr Vishal Rao, a member of the expert committee on Karnataka’s Covid task force, the state should vaccinate at least 70% of the population to control the third wave. “Quick vaccination is crucial. So far, we have been vaccinating those above 45 years of age. But in the state, the majority of the population falls in the 18-44 age category. With multiple variants that are being reported, this age group is one of the most vulnerable sections,” said Rao. The second wave has shown an increase in the number of deaths in the 30-45 age group. A comparison of the numbers of the first and second wave shows that in the first wave, around 11 out of 100 deaths were reported in the 30-45 age group, while in the second wave, 16 out of 100 deaths were reported in this category. For the under 30 years age category, in the first wave, 2.2% of deaths belonged to those under 30, while in the second wave, it increased to 2.9%, according to state data. Karnataka government has been receiving praises for the large vaccination campaigns it has conducted. Of the 1 billion doses that India achieved on Thursday, Karnataka has administered 62 million doses. However, data shows that Karnataka has seen sharp fluctuations in its vaccination drives, designed in a way that there are high on selective occasions and then a sudden dip as if doses are hoarded to make these events a success. According to experts, at the current rate, the target required to avoid a third wave may not be achieved. According to data, Karnataka has seen a sharp fluctuation in its vaccine drives since September 17 when it administered a record 3.17 million doses in a single day as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday. Since then, the state has administered around one million doses just three times and sometimes as low as below 30,000. One of the biggest hurdles for the government is the fact that 14 other districts have to catch up in vaccination drives. For example, Kalaburagi district has achieved the least coverage — only 69% of the eligible population has been jabbed with the first dose so far. The state health and family welfare department have begun a house-to-house survey to identify the unvaccinated. A member of the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), who didn’t want to be named, pointed out the disparity in the vaccination in the rural areas of north Karnataka. The districts with the lowest vaccination coverage are in the underdeveloped northern part of the state. “Bengaluru city (BBMP and Bengaluru urban) has the highest number. Naturally, the capital with the highest population will get preference, but the state of North Karnataka is concerning, especially many districts share the border with Maharashtra,” he added. Chandra said that efforts are underway to increase vaccination coverage in rural areas by setting up more centers across the state. He added that to increase the vaccination drive in the city, block and lane-level vaccination has been taken up. “Whoever has not taken the vaccine will be identified and will be vaccinated through special vaccination drives throughout the city on Friday, and it is urged that citizens take complete benefit of this arrangement,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/90-population-in-six-karnataka-districts-given-one-dose-data-101635187809237.html
26-10-2021||India||Kerala: Colleges reopen amid strict Covid protocols||After one-and-a-half-year, the college campus in the state came back to life again as normal classes resumed on Monday. Big banners and cut-outs were visible outside prominent colleges to welcome students after a pandemic-induced long break, but with Covid norms in place. After college, schools will also resume physical classes from November 1. “I could not control my tears as I stepped in. I was enrolled in the college as a first-year BA student but now I am in my final year. Back to campus, we will have to compensate for the lost days, fun and frolic is galore, but of course with Covid-19 norms, ” said Aswati Nair, a student of the Government Women’s College in the capital. Earlier, the government was planning to open colleges on October 18, but it was deferred given heavy rains. State higher education minister R Bindhu said the education sector will become vibrant with the reopening of schools as well. The government had instructed students above 18 to take at least one dose of the vaccine but the majority of them said they are fully vaccinated. Many educational institutions said attendance was more than 80 per cent, higher than routine days. “Before opening, we have asked all schools to convene parent-teachers meetings to ensure smooth running. A helpline will be there for each school. There is no compulsion to attend classes, and parents can take appropriate decisions,” said education minister V Sivankutty, adding that online classes will also continue. The state education department has allotted ₹2.85 crore for schools for buying sanitisers and soaps. The state had been witnessing maximum Covid-19 cases in the country for more than four months. On Monday, it reported 6,664 cases whereas the country’s caseload was 14,306. According to the serosurvey conducted in October, at least 82 per cent of people above 18 years have antibodies against Covid-19 and over 40 per cent of children in the 5-17 age group are also exposed to the virus in Kerala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-colleges-reopen-amid-strict-covid-protocols-101635187271864.html
26-10-2021||India||Madras HC upholds relief for kin of driver killed in 1992 bus fire||Nearly three decades after the death of a bus driver in a fire, the Madurai bench of Madras high court has provided relief to the family of the deceased by confirming the compensation awarded previously. Private bus driver, Nainar, was operating between Aruppukkottai and Rajapalayam in Virudhunagar district (the hub of the firecracker industry) in May 1992 when he and the bus conductor permitted some passengers to carry unlicensed explosives in the vehicle. Soon after, the bus caught fire and more than 30 people died, including the driver. In 2004, his legal heirs claimed a compensation of ₹3 lakh. However, the insurance company challenged the compensation awarded by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, a sub court in Srivilliputtur, in 2010. The high court recalled that during the trial, the tribunal analysed all evidence and held that the accident occurred due to an ‘Act of God’, and directed the insurance company to pay compensation to the claimant. The orders were passed by Justice V Bharathidasan of the high court on October 8 and the copy of the judgment was made available this week. The insurance company, in its present appeal, contested the claim petition stating the accident took place due to the negligent act of both the driver and conductor for permitting the passengers to carry unlicensed explosives, against the policy conditions. Besides, the insurance company also raised a technical issue pointing that the claimants could not seek compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and the claim could only be made under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923. The tribunal had fixed the monthly income of the deceased driver at ₹1,350 per month and after deducting 1/3rd towards his personal expenses, calculated his annual income to ₹10,800. By applying multiplier ‘11’, the tribunal awarded ₹118,800 as loss of income, the high court noted. In addition, the tribunal had awarded ₹10,000 towards loss of love and affection, ₹3,000 towards funeral expenses and ₹1,000 towards transport expenses. The total compensation came down to ₹132,800 along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum. While the counsel for the insurance company, D Sivaraman, contended that the accident had happened only due to the negligent act of the driver, the counsel of the claimants, D Venkatesh, said it wasn’t a driver’s job to check what passengers carry into the bus. After listening to arguments from both sides, the high court said, “Considering the fact and circumstances of the case, and the compensation awarded by the tribunal is just and fair compensation, this court inclined to confirm the award amount of ₹132,800.” Further, the court agreed that the claim can be made only under the Workmen’s Compensation Act. “However, considering the fact that the claim was made in the year 2004, and the tribunal awarded only a meagre compensation of ₹132,800, and also considering the fact that all the other claims were processed and the insurance company already paid the compensation to other claimants, at this distant point of time, the claimants need not be driven to file a fresh claim under the Workmen’s Compensation Act. In such circumstances, this court converts the claim as one made under Workmen’s Compensation Act,” the court said in its orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-hc-upholds-relief-for-kin-of-driver-killed-in-1992-bus-fire-101635187270349.html

26-10-2021||India||Huzurabad assembly bypolls: BJP banks on Rajender’s popularity to make inroads||The Bharatiya Janata Party will hope to cash in on Eatala Rajender’s popularity in Huzurabad, set for by-elections on October 30, but faces stiff competition from the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), which will look to consolidate its hold in the constituency once dominated by Maoists and left-wing groups. Rajender has been drawing impressive crowds for his roadshows and meetings during his campaign, which will come to an end on Wednesday, but it is mostly because of his image, as he had been representing the Huzurabad constituency for the last four terms. There has not been much response from the crowd at the meetings organised by star campaigners, including Union minister for tourism G Kishan Reddy, state BJP president Bandi Sanjay, Nizamabad MP Dharmapuri Arvind, BJP national vice-president D K Aruna and ex-MP Vijayashanti, which could hurt the saffron party’s chances. In the last assembly elections held in December 2018, the BJP secured a meagre 1,683 votes accounting for 0.95 per cent of the polled votes, which is less than the number of votes (2,867) polled under NOTA (None Of The Above).Rajender, who contested on the TRS ticket, got 104,000 votes (59.34 per cent), while his nearest rival P Kaushik Reddy of the Congress secured 61,121 votes (34.60 per cent). Despite knowing that the BJP is a virtual non-entity in Huzurabad, Rajender chose to join the saffron party after being hounded out of the ruling TRS in May this year on the charges of land encroachment.“There was no alternative for him as he needed some protection from the witch-hunt by the Telangana government. He had met leaders of various parties before deciding to join the BJP. Though Congress was a better option, it was suffering from a leadership crisis those days. The BJP leadership assured him all help during that crisis period,” a senior leader close to Rajender told HT on condition of anonymity.The TRS, which is going all out to defeat Rajender in the by-elections, quickly grabbed the opportunity and lured all his associates in the constituency, who were not happy with him joining the BJP. As a result, Rajender is forced to bank on his image in the constituency.Throughout his campaign, Rajender focused only on the good work done by him in the constituency in the last seven years and how he was subject to harassment by the TRS president and chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao.“I thought I would continue in the TRS all through my life, and after my death, I wished that my body would be draped in the pink flag. But KCR would never allow any leaders to grow independently and hound them out if they raised their voice. There is no democracy in Telangana but only a monarchic rule of KCR,” Rajender said at his roadshow in Veenavanka village on Sunday.Interestingly, Rajender is avoiding invoking the names of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah or the Central schemes in his speeches, unlike other campaigners of the BJP. He is also ending his speeches with the “Jai Telangana” slogan, whereas the other BJP leaders are raising the “Bharat Mata Ki Jai” slogan.On the other hand, the TRS is trying to capitalise on the people’s disgruntlement towards the BJP government at the Centre over steeply rising prices of petrol, diesel and LPG gas cylinders. “Why should you vote for the BJP? Is it because the prices of petroleum products have skyrocketed? Is it because the Modi government is privatising ports, airports, railways and steel factories? Remember, soon after the Huzurabad by-elections, the LPG cylinder price would go up to ₹1200,” said TRS star campaigner and state finance minister T Harish Rao at a rally in Jammikunta recently.Another worrying factor for Rajender is the election symbol. All these years, he had been a TRS legislator, and the people in the rural areas identified him with the “car” symbol (of TRS) during the elections. For the first time, he is contesting on the “lotus” symbol of the BJP, which is not a voters’ favourite in the constituency.“We are struggling to convince the people that Rajender’s election symbol is lotus and not car. We are hopeful to bring awareness among the people about the changed election symbol of our leader,” a close associate of Rajender said.BJP state official spokesperson Palwai Rajani said the party has been growing strongly all over the state, and Huzurabad is no exception. “The fact that Rajender has preferred to join the BJP than the Congress itself shows that we are emerging stronger. His victory in Huzurabad would certainly boost the prospects of the BJP across Telangana and prove nemesis for the TRS,” Rajani said.TRS working president K T Rama Rao on Saturday said: “Rajender might be contesting on the BJP ticket in Huzurabad, but within a year, he will join the Congress party. He has an understanding with PCC chief A Revanth Reddy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/huzurabad-assembly-bypolls-bjp-banks-on-rajender-s-popularity-to-make-inroads-101635187210810.html

While the scheme worth more than ₹64,000 crore was initially named as Pradhan Mantri Atmanirbhar Swasth Bharat Yojana (PMASBY), it was later renamed to bring it under the ambit of Ayushman Bharat or National Health Protection Scheme. The Ayushman Bharat scheme aims to cover over 100 million vulnerable families (approximately 500 million beneficiaries) and provide health cover up to ₹5 lakh per family per year. “Through the PM Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission, an entire ecosystem for services, from treatment to critical research, will be created in every corner of the country,” Modi said. The scheme with an outlay of around ₹64,180 crore over six years (till financial year 2025-26) was announced by the Centre during the Budget session in February this year. This scheme will be in addition to the National Health Mission, the statement said. The PM Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission is the second central health scheme to be renamed this year. The National Digital Health Mission, which was launched on September 27, was renamed as Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission. The measures under the new scheme focus on developing capacities of health systems and institutions across the continuum of care at all levels — primary, secondary and tertiary — and on preparing healthcare systems for responding effectively to the current and future pandemics, and disasters, a government statement said. The long-pending demand of experts to strengthen India’s healthcare system is expected to be met through the scheme as it aims to fill critical gaps in the public health infrastructure, especially in critical care facilities and primary care in both urban and rural areas. Under the scheme, government support will be provided to 17,788 rural health and wellness centres in 10 high-focus states. At least 11,024 urban health and wellness centres will be established in all states. Besides these, critical care services will be available in districts having more than 500,000 population, through exclusive critical care hospital blocks, while the remaining districts will be covered through referral services. The scheme will also allow people to have access to a full range of diagnostic services in the public healthcare system through a network of laboratories across the country. Integrated Public Health Labs will be set up in all districts. “Under PMASBY, a National Institution for One Health, 4 New National Institutes for Virology, a Regional Research Platform for WHO South East Asia Region, 9 Biosafety Level III laboratories, 5 New Regional National Centre for Disease Control will be set up. PMASBY targets to build an IT enabled disease surveillance system by developing a network of surveillance laboratories at block, district, regional and national levels, in Metropolitan areas. Integrated Health Information Portal will be expanded to all States/UTs to connect all public health labs,” a note by the press information bureau said.The infrastructure augmentation proposed under the scheme sounds major for a developing country like India, whose public health spend mostly hovers around a meagre 1-1.4% of the gross domestic product (GDP). Experts believe that the first step ideally should be to make use of the existing medical infrastructure optimally, even if it means roping in the private sector at a higher level. “Ayushman Bharat is a good example under which several already existing private hospitals have been roped in to provide treatment to the poor beneficiaries of the scheme. The model seems to be working… It can be emulated as there are several large peripheral hospitals existing in the private sector but with bed occupancy of not more than 20-25%. Such health facilities can be made use of by the government, considering most of these facilities are well-equipped,” former director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, Dr MC Misra, said. “It is time to get into public-private partnerships for changing the overall health care ecosystem. It will also help in increasing patient footfall in such hospitals and help better train their doctors, nurses, paramedics and other technical staff. It’s a win-win both ways,” he added. Another area of focus should be to strengthen the existing health care facilities at the primary level, which will eventually put pressure off many overloaded tertiary care hospitals, experts said. “There is no denying that there is unequal distribution of health care facilities in urban and rural areas but we must understand that health is a state subject and the ultimate responsibility of ensuring effective implementation rests with states. The Centre infusing money is a positive move but it is not only about the money. The implementation is a bigger issue. There needs to be better monitoring at the state level,” former PGI-Chandigarh director Dr KK Talwar said. “There is a reason why states such as Tamil Nadu and Kerala are doing well. Their model needs to be followed in other states as well. Otherwise, the Centre will keep pumping in money but the end result will not be as what’s expected,” Talwar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-atmanirbhar-swasth-bharat-yojana-renamed-brought-under-ambit-of-ayushman-bharat-101635187153399.html
26-10-2021||India||TRS marks 20th foundation day, KCR re-elected as president||Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) on Monday unanimously reelected chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao as the party president for the ninth consecutive term as over 6,000 delegates of the TRS attended the plenary held at Hitex here to celebrate the party’s two decades of formation.KCR said the state has become a role model for others in the implementation of welfare and developmental programmes within seven years of its formation.“We are now No. 1 in the country in terms of economic growth. We have created an irrigation potential that enabled the production of record quantity of paddy so much so that even Food Corporation of India has thrown up its hands for procurement,” he pointed out.The chief minister said the TRS had waged a prolonged battle for 13 years to achieve Telangana statehood, overcoming all the hurdles created by the rulers of the combined Andhra regime. “Drawing inspiration from Mahatma Gandhi during the Independence movement, we achieved the statehood through a non-violent struggle and showed a new direction to the people’s movements across the world,” he said.He said Telangana, which was once infamous for largescale migration of labour in search of livelihood to other states, was now witnessing reverse migration with labourers from other states coming to Telangana for work.“After we announced the Dalit Bandhu scheme, there have been requests from the villages of neighbouring states that they would like to merge with Telangana. I have been getting calls from Andhra Pradesh asking me to launch the TRS there so that our schemes could also be implemented,” he claimed.KCR allayed apprehensions over the implementation of the Dalit Bandhu scheme in Telangana. “The Election Commission of India might have stalled the scheme in Huzurabad constituency temporarily, but we shall implement it by all means before December and in the rest of the state by next year,” he asserted.The TRS plenary passed seven resolutions, including congratulating KCR on his re-election as the party president, achievements of the TRS government on various fronts, including irrigation, agriculture and strengthening rural economy; achieving welfare in Telangana; administrative reforms, development of power, industries, IT and infrastructure; Dalit Bandhu as a role model for nation; development of education and health; and TRS’s demands to the Centre.TRS working president KT Rama Rao, party secretary-general K Keshava Rao, state ministers, MPs, MLAs, MLCs, and other TRS leaders were present for the occasion. Nearly 6,000 party delegates from 10 districts, attended the meeting.Telangana agriculture minister S Niranjan Reddy said the TRS had achieved several historic victories in the last two decades of its formation, and the party would remain a success story in Indian democratic history. “KCR had sacrificed his ministry in the Union cabinet for the sake of Telangana and had even gone into the jaws of death for statehood,” he lauded while speaking on a resolution on the agriculture sector.State roads and buildings minister V Prashant Reddy, in his concluding remarks, said it was the fortune of the people of Telangana to have the leader of a mass movement as the first chief minister of the state. “KCR alone could understand the problems confronting the state and solve them after becoming the chief minister,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trs-marks-20th-foundation-day-kcr-re-elected-as-president-101635187152153.html
26-10-2021||India||Panneerselvam, AIADMK differ on Sasikala’s reinduction||Indicating a new round of fissures within the AIADMK, the party’s coordinator and former deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam on Monday said that expelled leader V K Sasikala’s reinduction will be discussed by their leadership, a statement which was refuted by the party later in the day. “Like I’ve said before in an interview, whether to take her (Sasikala) in, the office bearers of the party leadership will discuss and make a decision,” Panneerselvam told reporters in Madurai district. “Anyone can come into politics, and it is up to the people to accept them.” However, the party’s organisation secretary, D Jayakumar was quick to deny any such intentions. “We have already passed a resolution that Sasikala will not be taken back. We also made it clear that no one should have any links and contact with her, and if they do, we will take disciplinary action,” Jayakumar said. “Everyone has signed this resolution,” he added.Pannerselvam’s move comes at a time when Sasikala has renewed her fight to reclaim the AIADMK, following their loss in the rural local body elections in nine Tamil Nadu districts earlier this month. Sasikala had stepped away from politics briefly.After Sasikala’s release from prison, former chief minister Edappadi Palanswami had completely stonewalled her, but this isn’t the first time that Panneerselvam has softened his stance towards her . Before the assembly elections on April 6, Panneerselvam in an interview had said that the party would examine Sasikala’s reinduction into the party if she accepts the status quo of dual leadership. Panneerselvam and Sasikala also belong to the same Mukkalathor community, whose growth has diminished within the AIADMK given the dominance of Palaniswami’s Goudner community.Last Thursday, Jayakumar filed a police complaint against Sasikala on behalf of the AIADMK for unveiling a plaque at party founder MG Ramachandran’s (MGR) memorial on October 17 that referred to her as the AIADMK general secretary. Sasikala’s surprise move on a day the AIADMK was celebrating its golden jubilee year was seen as her renewed attempt to signal her supporters that she was still in the game to reclaim the party. The party’s official Twitter handle also released a statement signed by deputy coordinator K P Munusamy on the resolution against Sasikala. “There is no room for talk of reinstating Sasikala in the AIADMK under any circumstances,” said Munusamy. Panneerselvam on Monday morning added that the AIADMK is functioning as a cadre-based party as envisioned by founder MGR and is presently led as a dual leadership with him and Palaniswami and joint coordinators. Following J Jayalalithaa’s death in office in December 2016, her close aide Sasikala briefly held the reins of the party. However, she was imprisoned in February 2017 for four years in the disproportionate assets case.By then, Panneerselvam, who had officiated through Jayalalithaa’s illness, launched an offensive against Sasikala, which led to Palaniswami being picked as the chief minister in 2017. While she was in prison, Pannerselvam and Palaniswami merged their factions and ousted Sasikala from the post of interim general secretary and made Jayalalithaa the party’s permanent general secretary. During the party’s regime between 2017 and 2021, Palaniswami was the chief minister while Panneerselvam was the deputy chief minister. After their loss in the assembly election in May, the duo has continued as leader of opposition and deputy leader of opposition in the Tamil Nadu assembly. Political observers see this as Panneerselvam’s way of asserting himself. “Neither Panneerselvam nor Palaniswami will give up their authority in the AIADMK, and Sasikala will not be taken back,” said political analyst Raveendran Duraisamy. “Panneerselvam is making such statements to assert himself within the dual leadership. He wants to show that though the party has taken a stance, he has his views too. And in future, he could always utilise Sasikala for his political growth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panneerselvam-aiadmk-differ-on-sasikala-s-reinduction-101635187150463.html
26-10-2021||India||Centre to ask states and discoms to clear their dues to Coal India: Power minister RK Singh||The central government is going to ask all states and power distribution companies to clear their dues to Coal India, which stands at a staggering ₹16,000 crore, power minister RK Singh said on Monday. “States should understand that electricity is not free,” Singh told reporters on the sidelines of an event in the national capital. “Besides, central power generating companies (gencos) also have outstanding dues to Coal India. This is because states and discoms (distribution companies) do not pay the central gencos on time. The dues of all central gencos have spiralled up to ₹75,000 crore so far.” The large outstanding is making it difficult for the state-owned miner to pay for freight and other related expenses, Singh said. “So, we are going to write to all states now, asking them to clear their dues,” the power minister said. A few states had behaved “irresponsibly” during the recent coal inventory crisis at power utilities, Singh said, accusing them of raising false alarm on outages. “There was this one state which behaved very irresponsibly. It later turned out that they had missed renewing their agreement with GAIL (government-owned natural gas distributor) because of which the company said it would snap gas supply to its power plant,” minister Singh said. “This then triggered one of the discoms in the city to send alerts to its consumers. Then the chief minister and the state’s power minister started creating panic too, when it was the state government that failed to renew the gas supply on time. They should pull up the officials involved in this lapse.” Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and state power minister Satyendar Jain had earlierwarned of power outages. Kejriwal had asked the central government to intervene in the matter. The availability of coal has improved over the past one week, with total inventory at thermal power plants in the country at 8.1 million tonnes of coal on Monday, the power minister said. “The situation will only improve from here on. Thermal power plants will continue to get coal stocks on priority until the situation stabilises further,” Singh said. Forty nine coal-fired plants that are located away from coal mines had less than fours days of coal stock on October 24, down from 62 plants a week ago, Central Electricity Authority data showed. “The weather has helped as the power demand has remained low over the past one week,” a power ministry official said on condition of anonymity. “On Sunday, India had a shortage of 505 MW, with peak demand touching 154,437MW, of which 153,932 MW was met. The shortfall is usual, which often accounts for transmission and distribution losses, apart from local faults and scheduled maintenance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-ask-states-and-discoms-to-clear-their-dues-to-coal-india-power-minister-rk-singh-101635186671824.html

The party which has flown down a delegation of national level leaders including MPs Mahua Moitra, Saugata Roy and other leaders including Babul Supriyo addressed the media at the Azad Maidan in Panaji and released their ‘chargesheet’ accusing the government of wrecking the economy, public infrastructure, state sponsored environmental destruction, failure to restart mining and also pointing out the deteriorating law and order situation as part of an eight-point chargesheet. Led by the party’s newly inducted national vice president Luizinho Faleiro, the party listed out what it said were the failures of the government and claimed that it was only the TMC that had the will and resolve to take on the BJP juggernaut. “The Goa government has failed its people for the last 20 years whichever government has been in power. The government that is currently in power is not a government that is voted in by the people of Goa. It is the government that is sitting in power today because of the last minute late night machinations held in lobbies of five star hotels. It is not one that has been given the mandate by the people,” Moitra who released the ‘chargesheet’ said. “Even the CM of Goa was the Defence Minister of India; he was made to resign, and brought back as the CM of Goa... the people who were put in his place were not mandated by the people of Goa to be their chief minister. Goa and its people are suffering for a long time and that is the reason why we are here,” Moitra added. The chargesheet claimed that 25% people are unemployed and the average Goan cannot afford to buy a home in their own home state, which the party said it would work towards rectifying once in power. The event initially remained in doubt after the state administration told the organizers that permission for their event was not being granted on account of possible law and order and traffic problems that could be the result of a ‘large gathering’.Earlier in the day; Roy, Moitra, Supriyo as well as state leaders called on the family of Siddhi Naik, a young girl who was found dead on Goa’s Calangute Beach in what the police said was a case of drowning. A delegation of TMC leaders is camping in the state ahead of the visit of Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee later this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-releases-chargesheet-against-goa-govt-calls-it-a-double-engine-disaster-101635186668993.html

26-10-2021||India||Past govts went slow on health infra: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday accused the previous governments of dragging their feet on the issue of health care as he launched a ₹64,000-crore national medical infrastructure mission and nine new medical colleges during his visit to Varanasi and Siddharthnagar in Uttar Pradesh.The Prime Minister inaugurated various development projects worth more than ₹5,200 crore for his constituency, Varanasi.“All this work should have been done decades ago,” Modi said at a public rally in his Lok Sabha constituency, where he inaugurated the Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission meant to plug gaps in the health care system.Modi said the mission will also prepare the country to fight future pandemics.Earlier in the day, he inaugurated nine medical colleges virtually from Siddharthnagar. Built at a cost of ₹2,329 crore, these are in Siddharthnagar, Etah, Hardoi, Pratapgarh, Fatehpur, Deoria, Ghazipur, Mirzapur and Jaunpur districts.These nine medical colleges with 2,500 beds will serve people in the Purvanchal region and will create job opportunities for more than 5,000 doctors/paramedics, PM Modi said.“Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission has been launched to give strength to the health infrastructure of the country so that there are high-level preparations to prevent and deal with epidemics. This also aims at bringing self-confidence and self-reliance in our health system,” said Modi, adding that projects worth around ₹75,000 crore were launched in UP on Monday.Announced as the Prime Minister Atmanirbhar Swasth Bharat Yojana in the financial year 21-22 budget speech on February 1, with an outlay of about ₹64,180 crore over six years, the scheme was renamed during the launch. It is the second central health scheme that has been renamed this year after the National Digital Health Mission that was launched on September 27 as Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission. PM Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission will be in addition to the National Health Mission.The PM said good health was considered the basis of every action and investment to make the body healthy was considered good.“No other place could be better than Kashi for launching the mission as it is the abode of Lord Shiva and Shakti,” he said.“After Independence, for a long period, health facilities, infrastructure were not given much attention. The previous governments deprived the country’s healthcare system of facilities for a long time,” alleged Modi.“Corruption in medicines, ambulances, appointments, transfers and postings. In this entire game, some dynasts in UP flourished,” he said. “The cycle of corruption ran 24 hours but the ordinary families in Purvanchal and UP got crushed.” Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav later said that the BJP government was inaugurating new projects as it sensed defeat in the upcoming state elections. Uttar Pradesh will go polls next year.The PM said villages lacked hospitals while hospitals at block level lacked testing facilities and district hospitals didn’t have facilities for treatment of serious diseases. “In big hospitals, there were long queues and patients had to wait for long. There were shortcomings in the healthcare system,” he added.“To remove these shortcomings, the Ayushman Bharat Heath Infrastructure Mission has been launched. Under this mission, health and wellness centres are being opened in villages and cities. These will provide facilities for the early detection of diseases. Free medical consultation, free tests, and medicines will be available at these centres,” said Modi.The objective was to fill gaps in the public health infrastructure, especially in critical care facilities and primary care in both urban and rural areas. The mission will provide support for 17,788 rural health and wellness centres in 10 high focus states. Further, 11,024 urban health and wellness centres will be established in all the states.Through this, critical care services will be available in all the districts of the country with more than 500,000 population through exclusive critical care hospital blocks, while the remaining districts will be covered through referral services. “Today, our government understands the pain of the exploited, deprived and backward lot. Earlier, public money used to go into scams, but today it is being used for big projects,” said the PM, adding, “The speed with which new medical colleges are being opened in UP will have a great impact on the number of medical seats and doctors. Due to more seats, children of poor parents will also be able to dream of becoming doctors and fulfil it.” Modi said the condition of Kashi would have been different had the previous governments paid attention to its development. “The work done in Varanasi in the last seven years was not done in several decades,” he said. “At present, all-around development is taking place in Varanasi. From technology to health, all facilities are being created in BHU (Banaras Hindu University). Young friends from all over the country are coming here for studies,” added the PM. Modi said the country has achieved a major milestone of 1 billion vaccine doses in its fight against the coronavirus epidemic. “With the blessings of Baba Vishwanath, with the unwavering glory of Maa Ganga and with the unshakeable confidence of the people of Kashi, the free vaccination for all campaign is moving forward successfully,” he said. Modi took potshots at the previous government in Uttar Pradesh for “ignoring basic medical needs of the people of the Purvanchal region while filling coffers of their families”, and asserted that the region, which became infamous for deaths due to encephalitis, would now emerge as a medical hub under the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rule. Modi attacked the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government at the Centre and the Samajwadi Party government in UP, alleging that both neglected eastern UP (Purvanchal region). “Mere announcements of the establishment of dispensaries were made. For years, the buildings were not constructed, and if the buildings were constructed, the equipment was not installed. There was a crisis of doctors and paramedical staff,” he said. In an apparent attack on the erstwhile SP government, Modi said: “Their cycle of corruption ran 24 hours. There was corruption in medicine and ambulance procurement as well as in appointments. They had the priority of earning for themselves and filling the coffers of their families while for us the priority is to extend basic facilities to the poor.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/past-govts-went-slow-on-health-infra-modi-101635186310405.html
26-10-2021||India||No action taken on Rohingya, no deportation planned: Karnataka govt tells SC||The Karnataka governmenton Mondaytold the Supreme Court that it has not taken any action against the six dozen Rohingya refugees identified by the police, nor does it have any plan to deport them. “Bengaluru city police have not housed Rohingyas in any camp or detention centre within its jurisdiction. However, 72 Rohingyas identified in Bengaluru city are working in various fields and Bengaluru city police have not taken any coercive action against them as of now and there is no immediate plan of deporting them,” read the statement of objection filed by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led state government. The Basavaraj Bommai-government has also pressed for dismissal of the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocate Ashwini Upadhyay, who is also associated with BJP and has been a former spokesperson for the party in Delhi. Upadhyay, in his 2017 plea, asked for directions to the Centre and states to identify, detain and deport all illegal immigrants, including Rohingya refugees and Bangladeshis.According to the state government, Upadhyay’s petition is liable to be dismissed, for it is “devoid of merit” and is also “untenable in law”. Interestingly, the BJP-led Karnataka government’s response on the issue is in sharp contrast to what the BJP-headed Central government has been submitting in the Supreme Court in a clutch of cases related to deportation of Rohingya refugees. In March this year, in a separate batch of cases, where some of the Rohingya refugees sought protection from deportation and also their release from detention centres, the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) asserted  that India cannot become “the international capital of illegal immigrants” while terming the Rohingya “absolutely illegal immigrants” who posed “serious threats to the national security”. While the Karnataka government has said in its latest statement that it has not put any Rohingya refugee in a camp or a detention centre, the Union government has consistently opposed tooth and nail all pleas for release of Rohingya refugees detained in Assam, Jammu or in any other part of the country. In April this year, the Supreme Court had refused to stop the deportation of at least 150 Rohingya refugees detained in a Jammu prison to Myanmar in the wake of Centre’s submissions that Rohingyas cannot press for a fundamental right not to be deported and rather settle in India since right to residence is reserved only to the citizens of the country. The Centre’s affidavit filed in the apex court in March, seen by HT, had maintained that it has to first secure the interests of its own citizens before those of illegal immigrants who, it said, were casting a burden on the already depleting natural resources of the country in addition to posing a security threat.Following the Union government’s submissions advanced through Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, the Supreme Court on April 8 dismissed a plea to stop their deportation or release them from the detention centre.A similar stand was taken by the Union government in 2018 when the issue of detention and deportation of some Rohingya refugees from Assam had cropped up. The MHA had then submitted in the court that illegal immigrants had to be suspended out of the territory of India in national interest and that due process is being followed in deporting Rohingya refugees. In October 2018, the Supreme Court dismissed the plea to stop their deportation after taking on record the Centre’s stand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-action-taken-on-rohingya-no-deportation-planned-karnataka-govt-tells-sc-101635186249193.html
26-10-2021||India||Chinese PLA activity north of Tawang raises red flags||Tawang (Arunachal Pradesh): The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has intensified patrolling in sensitive areas across the contested border in Arunachal Pradesh after a lingering standoff with India began last year in the Ladakh sector, and has ramped up area domination patrols for surveillance and orientation of newly inducted troops with a noticeable increase in visits by senior PLA officers to forward areas to supervise military activities, data accessed by Hindustan Times shows.The sectors across which the Indian Army has detected PLA’s increased operational tempo include Lungro La, Zimithang and Bum La — areas of high historical significance in the context of Chinese aggression in the eastern sector — and counter measures have been taken to boost India’s readiness to handle any contingency, three senior officers monitoring Chinese activities in the North-East said on condition of anonymity.An activity matrix prepared by the Indian Army to summarise the latest developments in the Lungro La sector showed PLA carried out 90 patrols in the area from January 2020 to October 2021 (hereinafter referred to as 2020-21) compared to about 40 between January 2018 and December 2019 (hereinafter referred to as 2018-19). This more than doubling of PLA patrols has been attributed by the army to the “current operational situation”.HT has reviewed the activity matrix.The duration of long-range patrols by either side along LAC can stretch from one week to four weeks in the Arunachal Pradesh sector, according to officers deployed in the area.Area domination patrols by PLA also spiked between the pre- and post-Ladakh standoff timeline, shooting up from barely 10 during 2018-19 to 35 in 2020-21 (till September), data from the activity matrix shows.A normal patrol is carried out by soldiers in unoccupied, remote areas to ensure there is no encroachment by the adversary and involves marking territory by physical presence, while area domination patrols are aimed at control over the area and suppressing any activity by the enemy, a senior officer said.Along with the increased Chinese patrolling and area domination activities, the Indian Army’s surveillance network has picked up a corresponding jump in visits by senior PLA officers to the Lungro La area north of Tawang — up from 10 visits in the two years before the Ladakh border row erupted to 40 in 2020-21 (till September), according to the activity matrix.In the Indian Army’s assessment, the increase in frequency of visits by top PLA officers is “due to the importance of the sector, current operational situation and familiarisation visits”, says an analysis in the activity matrix.Granular details of PLA activities have become known to the Indian Army because of heightened surveillance along LAC and in Chinese depth areas using satellites, long-range unmanned aerial vehicles, high-tech intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) systems, superior network of radars and hi-tech night vision systems, said one of the officers cited above.Another document seen by HT analysed in detail the latest developments in the Zimithang sector, also north of Tawang.The Indian Army took up forward positions in the Lungro La and Zimithang sectors in 1986-87 to dominate the Sumdorong Chu valley during a tense standoff with PLA there.PLA patrols in the Zimithang sector climbed from eight in 2018 and 2019 to 24 from January 2020 to September 2021; area domination patrols rose from around 25 to 40, and visits by senior PLA officers went up from around 70 to 140, data from the second document shows.For the corresponding period in Bum La from where the Chinese forces made an ingress into Indian territory during the 1962 war, PLA patrols increased from 33 to 40, area domination patrols fell from 13 to 10, while visits by senior PLA officers went up from just one in 2018-19 to 25 in 2020-21 (till October), data from a third document shows.Indian surveillance also picked up increased vehicular movement due to infrastructure development activities and a large number of excavators and bulldozers to keep road axes open across the Lungro La, Zimithang and Bum La sectors, said a second officer.The Chinese actions across the three important sectors are part of a process to step up coercive posture against India, military historian and author Air Vice Marshal Arjun Subramaniam (retd) said.“We are no longer wet behind the ears. We have the necessary wherewithal to adopt a counter-coercive posture against China. Robust joint operations, including extensive air operations by the Indian Air Force, have helped strengthen our posture significantly,” Subramaniam said.He said that China was shifting its focus from Ladakh to other areas along LAC, including Arunachal Pradesh, to keep India unsettled on multiple fronts.Last week, Eastern Army commander Lieutenant General Manoj Pande said that China has ramped up the scale and duration of its military drills across LAC in Arunachal Pradesh, and the reserve formations mobilised by PLA are still deployed there. He said India deployed adequate forces in all sectors and the military is rehearsing and preparing for various contingencies that could arise.“In certain areas where our deployment was thin, steps have been taken to strengthen it,” Pande said, days after the 13th round of military talks between India and China to cool tensions in Ladakh reached an impasse on October 10, with PLA not agreeing to suggestions made by the Indian Army.The military dialogue took place more than two months after the last round of talks that led to disengagement of forward deployed troops from Gogra, or Patrol Point-17A, which was one of the flashpoints on LAC in Ladakh.The Asapila sector in Arunachal Pradesh is among the areas where the Indian Army observed infrastructure development by PLA close to LAC, and it had led to a corresponding increase in troop deployment there, Pande said on October 19.On face-offs between rival troops at Naku La in north Sikkim, he said that patrols came face-to-face in the area because of differing perceptions of LAC, and protocols were in place to resolve the situation even though sometimes confrontations lasted longer.Scores of Indian and Chinese soldiers were involved in a tense face-off in Naku La in May 2020, with rival troops suffering injuries in the confrontation. Another face-off took place in the same sector earlier this year, with the developments making the area a possible flashpoint in the east.The Indian Army has positioned formidable weapon systems in the eastern sector to strengthen its posture against PLA, including M777 ultra-light howitzers that can be swiftly deployed and redeployed in challenging mountainous terrain using the CH-47F Chinook helicopters and the 155 mm FH 77 BO2 guns, better known as the Bofors.“Eastern Command will have to remain prepared for all contingencies including additional deployment to strengthen the defensive posture. As long as disengagement and de-escalation remain stalled in Ladakh, the situation will remain tense,” former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd) said on October 19.Two mountain scribbles along the meandering lake-dotted route from Tawang to Bum La say it best about the army’s readiness and resolve to tackle any threat from the adversary — the Sikh Regiment’s motto “Nischay Kar Apni Jeet Karo” (With determination, I will be triumphant), and the more cavalier “Live Dangerously”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-pla-activity-in-key-sectors-on-eastern-front-101635186129027.html
26-10-2021||India||Mahant Ravindra Puri elected new Akhada Parishad president||The secretary of Shri Panchayati Akhara Niranjani (or simply, the Niranjani Akhara), Mahant Ravindra Puri, was elected the new president of Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP), the apex religious body of 13 recognised monastic Hindu orders of the country, on Monday.His election came in the wake of a split in the body, with only seven of the 13 bodies attending the meeting. Interestingly, last week, seven akharas met and chose their own head of ABAP (the math doesn’t add up because the Nirmal Akhara attended both meetings). The seven Akharas that met on Monday are: Juna, Niranjani, Nirmal, Agni, Avahan, Anand and Naya Udasin. The seven that met last week (on October 21) are: Nirmohi, Nirmal, Digamber, Mahanirvani, Atal, Bada Udasin, and Nirvan. Puri was elected in a meeting of seers convened by Akhara Parishad general secretary Mahant Hari Giri, also the chief patron of Juna Akhara. He will replace Mahant Narendra Giri who died by suicide on September 20. He will remain ABAP president till 2025, the original length of Giri’s tenure. Puri also claimed to have written support of the Nirmohi Akhara, which, like Nirmal Akhara, is part of the other group too. Nirmohi Akhara couldn’t be reached for a comment. On October 21, the seven akharas that met elected another Ravindra Puri, a Mahant of Mahanirvani Akhara (Mahanirvani) , as president of ABAP. A new executive committee was also formed The head of the Nirmohi Akhara, Shri Mahant Rajendra Das, was elected general secretary.Along with them, Damodar Das Maharaj was appointed as vice-president, Jaswinder Singh Shastri as treasurer, Ram Kishore Das Maharaj as secretary, Gaurishankar Das Maharaj as spokesperson and Dharamdas Maharaj and Maheshwar Das as patrons.Monday’s meeting was attended by akharas following the ‘Shaiva’ (sannyasin) tradition, including Juna Akhara (the largest in terms of number of seers as members).“I am happy that the seers have given me the responsibility of leading them and I will not disappoint them. There were representatives from seven akharas who have voted for me and I also have the support letter from one more Akhara. As a result, I have support of eight akharas. There will be efforts from my side to bring the others back in to the fold”, said Niranjani Akhara’s Ravindra Puri after being elected on Monday.Mahanirnavi’s Ravindra Puri could not be reached for comments. However, general secretary of the second faction of the ABAP, Mahant Rajendra Das said, “The election to the Akhara Parishad was held on October 21. The seers of all the akharas have got representation in the meeting and the election conducted in Shree Niranjani Akhara, Prayagraj (on Monday) is illegal and has no recognition”.As per the practice, two members from each of the 13 akharas are members of ABAP and its office bearers are elected from among them.  ABAP general secretary Mahant Hari Giri of Juna Akhara, dubbed the Haridwar election a malicious attempt to divide the ABAP and refused to recognise any of the members elected then. “I had already called for a meeting of ABAP on October 25, and if these akharas had any intention to prove their majority, they should have attended this meeting and got their leader elected. After all, ABAP elects its office bearers in a democratic way. So where is the need to shy away from contesting the elections? “The meeting of ABAP is usually held only when the serving general secretary calls for it. “Monday’s meeting was held with a single point agenda: To elect the new ABAP president. A meeting of the Akhada Parishad will now be called again after three months to select the rest of the executive members,” Mahant Hari Giri said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mahant-ravindra-puri-elected-new-akhada-parishad-president-101635186010134.html
26-10-2021||India||Aryan Khan drugs case: NCB probes extortion charge against Sameer Wankhede||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) started probing on Monday allegations that its Mumbai zonal director, Sameer Wankhede, was part of a ₹25 crore extortion racket after the arrest of actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son, Aryan Khan, in a drug raid.The vigilance inquiry is headed by NCB’s deputy director general (DDG) of northern region, Gyaneshwar Singh, who rushed to Mumbai to investigate the charges levelled by one of the agency’s own witnesses in the drug case, said people aware of developments. The independent witness, Prabhakar Sail, also claimed in an affidavit that the investigators made him sign blank sheets of paper.“We have started a vigilance inquiry on the basis of an affidavit available publicly and a report received from our south-west region DDG (Mutha Ashok Jain),” said Gyaneshwar Singh, who is also the agency’s chief vigilance officer.Asked if Wankhede will continue to head the probe during the course of inquiry, Singh said, “It is too early to say anything. We have just begun. Let us investigate the allegations first.” Wankhede, who landed in Delhi late on Monday, has denied the charges.The developments came on a day a Mumbai court refused NCB’s plea to dismiss Sail’s affidavit, and Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik accused Wankhede of forging his personal documents, a charge denied by the 2008-batch Indian Revenue Service officer.On October 2, Wankhede led an NCB raid on the cruise ship Cordelia, docked at Mumbai’s International Cruise Terminal, to bust a rave party. The next day, the agency arrested Aryan Khan and charged the 23-year-old with alleged consumption and conspiracy under the stringent Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. Aryan is currently in Mumbai’s Arthur Road jail and his bail petition will be heard by the Bombay high court on Tuesday.Wankhede said that 13 grams of cocaine, 5 grams of mephedrone, 21 grams of Charas, 22 pills of MDMA (ecstasy), and ₹1.33 lakh in cash were recovered from the ship. Since then, 20 people, including Delhi-based event management professionals, Nigerian nationals, and Mumbai-based drug peddlers, have been arrested under various sections of the NDPS Act. Investigators later visited Shah Rukh Khan’s house and called in actor Ananya Panday for questioning after her name showed up in Aryan’s WhatsApp conversations.The case took a dramatic turn on Sunday when Sail filed an affidavit saying he overheard his employer, KP Gosavi, talking on the phone to someone identified as Sam D’Souza after Aryan was brought to the NCB office. He claimed Gosavi talked about extorting ₹25 crore to settle the case and release Aryan, which could be negotiated to ₹18 crore, with ₹8 crore going to Wankhede. Gosavi had already made the news by being present during the raid, and seemingly assisting NCB officials, despite not being part of any law enforcement agency.Sail also claimed that he saw Gosavi meeting Shah Rukh Khan’s manager, Pooja Dadlani. and that he was asked to sign 9-10 blank pages in Wankhede’s presence after the raid. Gosavi, who is accused in a 2018 Pune cheating case and was seen clicking selfies with Aryan while the latter was in NCB custody, is on the run after Mumbai police issued a look out notice against him. He told NDTV late on Monday that he intended to surrender in Lucknow and dismissed the allegations against him.Wankhede, who has courted controversy during previous stints in the customs department, denied the charges and wrote to Mumbai Police commissioner to ensure no legal action was carried out against him in the matter.People familiar with the NCB inquiry, who didn’t want to be named, said a three-member vigilance team led by Singh will look into all aspects including role of Wankhede, other officers in the NCB unit and witnesses’ claims, considering “the allegations are of serious nature”. An officer said they are likely to call Sail, Gosavi, Wankhede and other officers in the team for recording their statement.The agency also suffered a setback in the NDPS court after its affidavit asking the court to stop anyone from taking cognizance of Sail’s affidavit was rejected. The court said it cannot pass a blanket order and noted that the case was before the Bombay high court. “Therefore, no such orders can be passed by the court as prayed. Hence, the applications are disposed of,” the court said.Wankhede also filed an affidavit categorically denying the allegations and claiming that the charges were “not only false but misleading, mischievous and maligning.”“I was threatened to be arrested and to be dispelled from my service. There is a lurking threat of arrest as it does not suit some vested interest just for conducting and honest and impartial investigation,” he told the court.The day began with Malik accusing Wankhede of using a fake caste certificate to get government job under reserved quota. Malik – who has previously accused the officer of travelling to Maldives and Dubai to extort money from actors – said Wankhede is Muslim but made a fake scheduled caste certificate. “Forgery by Sameer Dawood Wankhede started from here. The officer, who started his career with forgery, will never work with honesty,” Malik said.Hours later, Wankhede hit back. He said publishing personal documents was defamatory and an invasion on his privacy. “It is intended to malign me, my family, my father and my late mother. The series of allegations of Hon minister over the last few days have put me and my family under tremendous mental and emotional pressure. I am pained by the nature of personal defamatory , slanderous attacks by the Hon minister without any justification,” the officer said in a statement.He said his father Dnyandev Kachruji Wankhede was Hindu, and mother Zaheeda, Muslim. “I belong to a composite multi-religious and secular family and I am proud of my heritage,” the officer said.A copy of the birth certificate issued by Mumbai’s civic body and seen by HT showed the father’s name as Dawood Wankhede and the mother’s name as Zahera Bano.Malik earlier claimed that Wankhede was shifted to the NCB days after the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput in June 2020 to harass Bollywood actors – a charge denied by the officer. Wankhede led the NCB investigation after Rajput’s alleged suicide and questioned several Bollywood actors.The latest controversy also took a political turn with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) demanding intervention by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi backing the setting up of a special investigation team (SIT).State home minister Dilip Walse Patil said he met chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday about the issue.“I had a brief discussion on the entire issue of drug abuse and NCB’s action as I had met him to discuss some other issue. I have also read Sail’s affidavit. We have accepted his demand and provided police protection. If Sail files a complaint, police will take necessary action. He has visited Sahar police station today, ” Walse Patil told reporters. Sail had asked for police protection earlier, claiming a threat to his life.The BJP alleged that political figures were behind Sail’s revelations. “It needs to come to the light that who is behind Sail’s statement and in which hotel the statement of Sail recorded? Shielding the drug mafia is the real intention behind it? Is Sail being threatened to become part of the extortion gang of the ruling party? The entire episode needs to be investigated by CBI to check all these links,” said BJP leader Ram Kadam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aryan-khan-drugs-case-ncb-probes-extortion-charge-against-sameer-wankhede-101635185948888.html
26-10-2021||India||Comparing the 2021 festival season with the one in 2020||The festival of Diwali is just a couple of weeks away. Cultural and religious considerations aside, the biggest festival of the Hindu calendar is also a critical period for the economy as consumption demand peaks. Given the background of the pandemic’s impact, festive demand will be even more important for the economy. How does this year’s festive season look when compared to last year’s? Here are five charts that answer this question.The pandemic has ebbed ...,This holds no matter which indicator one looks at. India’s first wave of Covid-19 peaked in September 2020, if one takes seven-day average of daily new cases as the metric. The second wave of the pandemic peaked on May 9, and was far more severe. Since then, the situation has improved radically. Current levels of daily new cases and positivity rates (cases found per hundred tests conducted) are a third those between Dusshera and Diwali last year. The situation looks even better if Kerala is excluded from the comparison, as it accounts for more than 50% of daily new cases at the moment, but accounted for less than 20% of cases between Dussehra and Diwali last year.... mobility levels, especially for retail and recreation, are much higher...,What is especially encouraging about the pandemic’s situation is that cases have not gone up despite a significant rise in mobility levels. Data from Google Mobility Indices shows that mobility levels are significantly higher than what they were during the festive season last year. This holds for retail and recreation, transit stations as well as workplace mobility. That India has managed to partially vaccinate at least 75% of its adult population and has fully vaccinated around 33% has definitely played a role in this virtuous combination of high mobility levels and low daily new cases.... and concerns about inequality aside, the economy is looking good...,Whether one takes ultra-high frequency indicators such as the Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI) or RBI projections for GDP in the quarter ending December 2021, the economy’s prospects are definitely looking better compared to last year. NIBRI was at 105.3 in the week ending October 24 compared to 83.3 a year ago (week ending October 25, 2020).As per the latest projections of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), GDP growth in the quarter ending December 2021 is expected to be 6.8%. These numbers however do not mean that a broad-based jump in consumption demand is guaranteed. RBI’s Current Situation Index (CSI) has not had much of a recovery compared to last year. It was at 57.7 in the September 2021 round and 49.9 a year ago. Some of the divergence between indicators such as CSI and NIBRI is also on account of the fact that the latter mostly track the formal and well-off sectors of the economy.... but commodity prices are a much bigger problem at the moment ...,Headline numbers on retail inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) might not show this. Annual growth in CPI was 7.3% in September 2020. This number was just 4.4% in September 2021. A lot of the relief in headline CPI numbers is because of a moderation in food prices. The situation changes when one looks at other measures of prices. For example, India’s crude oil basket was priced at $ 40.7 per barrel in October 2020. It reached $83.2 on October 22, latest data from the ministry of petroleum showed. The Bloomberg Commodity Price Index was at 72.01 on October 25, 2020. It has risen to 105.03 on October 25. If commodity prices continue to increase or even stay at their current levels, they will add to headwinds facing the Indian economy....,even as a short-term supply crunch adds to worries about long-term demand.The current commodity price spike is unlike what the world has seen in the past. This because it has been accompanied by a clogging of global value chains thanks to a shortage of critical inputs such as microchips, even shipping containers. This means that many businesses, such as those making cars and high-end personal gadgets, might not be able to meet demand for the festive season. A lot of the demand might dissipate if there are no supplies in the crucial window. This, when read with the fact there are long-term concerns about India’s growth potential – the IMF has slashed India’s potential growth from 6.25% to 6% -- is not exactly good news. While this is definitely a concern for the economy going forward, and needs concerted policy intervention, it does not take away from the fact that this year’s festive season is definitely better for the economy compared to last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/comparing-the-2021-festival-season-with-the-one-in-2020-101635179349558.html
26-10-2021||India||Elephant electrocuted in Kaziranga; another jumbo in Guwahati||Two elephants, a wild and a domesticated one, were killed due to electrocution in two separate incidents in Assam on Monday. A domesticated elephant belonging to the Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve (KNPTR), two wild boars and a swamp deer died in the park while a wild pachyderm died in Guwahati. According to KNPTR authorities, the male elephant named Oiravat, aged 18 years, died after the metal chain tied around his front legs got stuck in an electric pole, which fell on the animal. Carcasses of a swamp deer and two wild boars, all killed by electrocution, were found near the elephant. The incident took place in Hati Camp area under Burapahar range of the park, informed KNPTR director P Sivakumar. In another incident, the carcass of a wild elephant, which reportedly died due to electrocution, was found at Ahom Gaon locality in Guwahati on Monday. Forest officials said the carcass was sent for post-mortem to verify the exact cause of death. Last week, wildlife activist Rohit Choudhury had written to Assam chief secretary Jishnu Barua seeking creation of a task force to restore animal corridors connecting Rani and Garbhanga reserve forests with Deepor Beel (all located on the outskirts of Guwahati) to allow easy movement of wild animals, especially elephants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/an-elephant-2-boars-1-deer-electrocuted-in-kaziranga-another-jumbo-in-guwahati-101635171967519.html
26-10-2021||India||Will rather talk to people of Kashmir than Pakistan: Amit Shah||The government of India would rather talk to the youth of Jammu and Kashmir than Pakistan, home minister Amit Shah declared on Monday, adding that a new era of development has begun in the Union Territory under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“Farooq sahib has given some advice to the Union government – to talk to Pakistan. I want to tell Farooq sahib, who has been a former chief minister of J&K, that we will talk to the people of Kashmir. I will talk to the youth of Kashmir Valley,” Shah said, referring to Farooq Abdullah, leader of the National Conference party.“Why should we not talk to you?” Shah asked a gathering of delegates and representatives of Panchayati Raj institutions at the Sher-e-Kashmir International Convention Centre in Srinagar on the last day of his three-day visit to the troubled region, his first since the central government in August 2019 repealed Article 370 of the Constitution that conferred special status to Jammu and Kashmir.“With a firm belief, I want to convey to you that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a new era of development has begun in J&K and complete results of this development will be visible by 2024,” the home minister said, adding that he has spoken directly with the people of Kashmir, without bulletproof vests and additional security, to emphasise the progress and development in the newly formed Union Territory.Shah also said he was being asked why curfew was imposed and internet snapped on August 5, 2019, when Article 370 was done away with and the state was bifurcated into the Union territories of J&K and Ladakh.“By saying this, they want to misguide the youth of Kashmir Valley,” Shah said. “If internet was not stopped and curfew not imposed in J&K, then there would have been bloodshed and the youth of Kashmir would have been killed. We did not want people to be killed.”Shah said three families that ruled J&K for 70 years would never understand the pain of an elderly father who is forced to lift the coffin of his young son, referring to prominent political families without naming them.“Nearly 40,000 people were killed during their rule, but till date they have not condemned terrorism that is taking place in the Valley,” the home minister said. “We will not allow anybody to disturb peace here.”On the issue of land being taken away, the home minister said that after the abrogation of Article 370, many people said land belonging to the local people would be taken away. “Panchayat (village council) members are here, sarpanches (village chiefs) are here. Go and ask people in your villages how much land has been taken away from them in the last two years,” Shah said.Shah praised J&K’s Lt Governor Manoj Sinha, saying that he has provided jobs to more than 20,000 people. “Today also, six thousand people are being given jobs. Now, the corruption that the three families indulged in is a thing of the past,” the home minister said.He appealed to the youth to not be swayed by rumours. “I want to convey to the youth of Kashmir that those who handed stones and weapons to you, please tell them that there is electricity and hospitals in Kashmir,” Shah said. “Are there medical colleges and is potable water available over there? There is nothing,” he said, referring to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.The three political families did not let ordinary people become panchayat members and sarpanches in the past 70 years, the home minister said. “Today 30,000 people got elected as the representatives of the people of Kashmir. I want to tell the youth of Kashmir that you can become a member of Parliament, or minister in the Indian government and can also dream of becoming the chief minister of J&K, and now nobody can stop you. The people of Kashmir have the same rights which I enjoy in our country.”Shah promised that not a single person in J&K will remain homeless by the end of next year. “In J&K, 20,000 have already got homes. By the end of 2022, nobody will be without a home in J&K,” he said. “We want them (the youth) to hold pens. They shouldn’t hold weapons but tools to assemble machines.”In a veiled attack on the Congress, the National Conference and the Peoples’ Democratic Party, Shah said while only three medical colleges were set up by the “three families which have ruled Jammu and Kashmir”, Prime Minister Modi has ensured seven new medical colleges will soon be established.“Earlier, 500 youths could become doctors. Now 2,000 youths can become doctors from these new medical colleges. Nobody will need to go to Pakistan to study medicine,” he said.The home minister inaugurated a 500-bed hospital at Bemina in Srinagar that was completed at a cost of ₹115 crore, laid the foundation stone for the Handwara Medical College, a ₹46-crore bridge over the Ferozepur Nallah in Baramulla district and road projects worth ₹4,000 crore, among others.Earlier in the day, Shah visited Kher Bhawani temple in Ganderbal and met delegates of a few Sufi organisations.Reacting to Shah’s attack on the Abdullah family, National Conference spokesperson Imran Dar said, “Farooq Abdullah and later Omar Abdullah became chief ministers only because people voted them to power. They were not coronated to power. Besides, National Conference has been in power for only 23 years, out of which half was in alliance. Bharatiya Janata Party has every agency at their disposal. If there is anything (wrong done by the National Conference), why don’t they bring to fore? This is all rhetoric with no factual support.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-talk-to-people-of-j-k-instead-of-pakistan-says-amit-shah-on-3-day-visit-to-valley-101635162066269.html

The top NCB officer, however, denied the allegations.However, Wankhede wrote to Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale on Sunday, seeking protection from any legal action being planned against him by unknown persons to “falsely frame him.”Saying that he fears for his life, Sail wrote in his affidavit, “KP Gosavi is missing now and I now fear that NCB officials and other persons involved may kill me or abduct me.”In his affidavit, Sail also claimed to have overheard Gosavi and one Sam D'Souza trying to settle the cruise ship drugs seizure case allegedly for ₹18 crore. ALSO READ | 'Put a bomb of ₹25 crore': What KP Gosavi's ex-aide 'exposed' on Aryan Khan case Sail also claimed that when he was called to the NCB office as an witness in the case, an officer took his signatures on “10 blank papers” on the instruction of Wankhede. Soon after Sail's signed revealations surfaced, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut shared a video of Aryan Khan talking to Gosavi in NCB custody, and urged the police to take suo moto cognisance of the allegations of demand for money.Witnes in #AryanKhan case made to sign on blank paper by NCB is shocking.

First, the Indian military has picked up ample signs that the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has intensified patrolling and area domination activities across the contested border in Arunachal Pradesh. Second, last week, China adopted a new law that strengthens the PLA’s ability to work with civilians to defend the country’s borders. This law allows the State to combat all acts that undermine land boundaries, build border infrastructure, and nurture frontier towns. Coming close on the heels of the Chinese side’s refusal to act on India’s forward-looking proposals to end the military face-off at remaining friction points in the Ladakh sector during the last meeting of the senior military commanders, these developments make it clear that India is in for the long haul and cannot afford to let its guard down even an inch.
