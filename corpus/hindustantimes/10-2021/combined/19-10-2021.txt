19-10-2021||Delhi||2 held in Delhi for robbing vendors, morning walkers||The special staff of northwest district police arrested two men, who allegedly committed snatchings and robbed elderly morning walkers and street vendors in the morning. Deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Usha Rangnani said the arrested men, identified as Pankaj alias Rajesh (24), and Tannu alias Prince (23), robbed a 71-year-old vegetable vendor, Ramvilas Prasad, of ₹4,600 at Haiderpur in Shalimar Bagh area on October 14. “Prasad was going towards Azadpur. Around 4am, the suspects, who were on a motorcycle, threatened him with a weapon and robbed him of the money. A case was registered and the special staff was tasked to identify and nab the robbers,” said Rangnani adding that the team arrested the suspects on Monday and recovered ₹2,200 of the stolen money and a bike used in the crime.During interrogation, Rangnani said, it came to the fore that Pankaj was previously involved in seven cases of snatching, burglary and theft while Tannu had one case against him in the past. “They mainly committed crimes early morning, when there would be less gathering at public places. They came out around 4am and robbed street vendors, daily wagers and elderly morning walkers, who had small amounts. The suspects believed that since they robbed small amount, the victims won’t report the crimes,” she said adding that the suspects used the stolen money to buy alcohol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/2-held-in-delhi-for-robbing-vendors-morning-walkers-101634668133410.html
19-10-2021||Delhi||Not in my backyard: Growing resistance to new mobile towers from Delhi RWAs||When the result of the referendum came in at Navjeevan Vihar, it showed 120 against, and 3 for. And so, like almost every other neighbourhood in the Capital, this leafy and quiet south Delhi enclave decided against allowing the installation of a mobile tower. It’s an almost self-destructive fight that’s playing out across the city: everyone is hungry for bandwidth and connectivity, in fact, under the current circumstances where people are still working and studying from home, even more than they were before the pandemic struck; yet, no one wants the mobile or so-called cell towers around. The reason: fear that radio frequency or RF waves cause cancer. Science says that the levels of RF waves most people are exposed to on account of proximity to a mobile tower are unlikely to be harmful. There is also, as yet, no research that shows a link between RF waves and cancer. But science is usually powerless against sentiment and emotion. Ask Ruby Makhija. The secretary of the Navjeevan Vihar Resident Welfare Association (RWA) says most people are aware of research that says mobile towers are safe, but that there is still a lot of concern over “radiation” from such installations. There’s also fear of the value of a house next to a mobile tower going down -- perhaps a bigger fear than radiation in Delhi. She puts the onus on the companies and government agencies to educate people better. Meanwhile, her RWA is one of 56 from south Delhi that last month petitioned the south corporation (MCD, south) on problems regarding the installation of new mobile towers while demanding a more consultative process to fix their locations. It isn’t just the fixed towers that are points of contention; even the so-called cellular tower on wheels (COWs) are. And so, Delhi’s mandate under the National Broadband Mission to at least double the number of its mobile towers from 20,012 to 46,000 between 2020 and December 2022 hangs fire. Across the northern part of the city, with complaints pouring in from residents and municipal councillors about the new cellular towers on wheels, the north corporation (MCD, north) decided on September 20 to put on hold the installation of any new cellular tower on wheels in its jurisdiction pending a review. Yogesh Verma, chairman of Keshavpuram , where several such complaints were flagged , says the moratorium on such installations continues. “We are trying to find locations away from residential areas where empty plots or abandoned parks can be used . We are trying to involve residents and councillors in the process.”  Verma, who is also former deputy Mayor of north MCD admits that connectivity is also important but, in the same breath, adds that the towers have a real perception problem. The result: “Everyone wants good mobile connection, no one wants a tower.” In some instances cases, residents have gathered to prevent tower installations and police have had to intervene; in other cases, residents have approached the courts. For instance, the residents of Gayatri Apartments in Sector 9 Dwarka have objected to a mobile tower being installed in a green area behind the society citing health implications. Rajeev Suri, a Defence Colony resident who filed a petition against a tower being installed in the central park of the colony said the South Delhi Municipal Corporation was trying to build one on top of storm water drain which is illegal. “Our green areas should be sacrosanct and they are under attack. If we need new towers, government buildings should be preferred. The community has the first call on the use of space where they live and their consent should be taken. The concept of public commons does not seem to exist in our city.” A few months ago, the standing committee of the south corporation directed officials to revise the existing policy on towers, effectively barring their installation on school and hospital buildings. The immediate trigger was a new tower in a Janakpuri hospital . The behaviour of the corporations and councillors is understandable. Hell hath no fury like a RWA scorned, and no one wants that when municipal elections are scheduled for early next year. Indeed, during the south corporation’s deliberations, a councillor said each tower could cost him 2000 votes. The corporation has sought to assuage everyone’s fears, but to no avail. In August, it held a special house of councillors meeting on mobile tower related issues. SDMC mayor Mukesh Suryan says that a myth has developed about mobile towers in peoples’ minds. “This house was held with experts, doctors and officials from telecom department to educate the councillors so that they can pass on the message.” But it’s so far been a losing battle. Data presented to the house by the Department of Telecommunications or DoT shows that Delhi has 20,102 towers (December 2020) with an average of 13.55 towers per square km. Under the National Broadband Mission, the aim is to increase this to at least 46,000 by December 2022 with a goal to achieve 50mbps availability of broadband speed. The Cellular Operators Association of India reports that Delhi needs nearly 37,000 additional mobile towers by 2024 to resolve connectivity issues. Delhi currently has around 32,304 telecom towers, and needs approximately 69,223 by 2024, according to the association’s estimates.Lieutenant General SP Kochhar, COAI director general, said , “The issue of inadequate indoor telecom coverage is a long-standing one for mobile users across the world. The problem has escalated in recent times, with higher data uptake during the pandemic.” DoT is organising several awareness seminars to assuage the fears of RWAs. One such event was held last week and saw Vijay Prakash, director, DoT (Delhi sector) explaining that the World Health Organization, on the basis of its reference of at least 25,000 scientific articles published over the past 30 years, concluded that there is no evidence of health consequences due to low level of electro magnetic force (or EMF) radiations. RFs are a kind of EMF. “India’s EMF norms are 10 times more stringent then international norms and over 43,000 base transceiver stations have been randomly checked in Delhi out of which not a single case of EMF norms violation was found,” he added. The department also operates the website www.tarangsanchar.gov.in where people can see locations of mobile towers in their areas and their current EMF levels. Additionally, complaints can also be lodged on this portal for getting a particular site inspected with a fee of ₹4000. “DoT field units perform tests in the presence of the applicant and report is shared with them,” Prakash explained. Dr Vivek Tandon, additional professor of neurosurgery at AIIMS, said that there was no causal relationship between EMF radiations and brain tumour or hearing problems or disturbed sleep cycle. “People get alarmed that EMF is placed in Group 2B carcinogen (something that can cause cancer) but it only indicates that more evidence is needed in this regard. People do not know that even Aloe Vera and pickled vegetables are in Group 2B carcinogens,” he told representatives of the participating RWAs. The RWAs were convinced that mobile towers were not generating harmful radiation, but they were not convinced about installing them in their neighbourhoods. A senior Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) official said that mobile towers are safe and called improved mobile connectivity a “necessity”. “This is a misconception about towers emitting harmful radiation. EMF radiation norms, which are stricter than international standards, are currently in place and people should not be afraid of new tower installations. While people require better mobile connectivity, new towers are needed for improving it,” said the official.Atul Goel, president of URJA (United Residents Joint Action) , a collective body of RWAs, echoed the sentiment of Defence colony resident Suri and suggested that the towers be “installed in government buildings, offices, even atop community garbage collection centres (or dhalaos)” . Mahesh Uppal, a senior telecom expert, said that mobile towers are absolutely crucial for mobile connectivity. “If we need better mobile connectivity, we need mobile towers. It is a fact that when the mobile tower is far away, the mobile handset emits more power and the risk is greater. It is better not to have a tower installation too far away from you,” he said. He added that the fear behind mobile towers was irrational as the tower radiation norms are much stricter in India than many western countries such as the US. “It is in people’s interest to focus on enforcement of these norms rather than opposing the new tower installations” No one likes missed calls. But the problem is that they seem to like mobile towers even less.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/not-in-my-backyard-growing-resistance-to-new-mobile-towers-from-delhi-rwas-101634668073525.html
19-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: SC appointed panel finds alarming violations in Ghazipur poultry market||A Supreme Court appointed panel has listed major violations of safety rules at the Ghazipur poultry market (popularly known as the Ghazipur Murgha Mandi) that pose serious public health concerns, senior municipal officials said. The slaughter house monitoring committee, constituted in accordance with 2012 Supreme Court order, submitted its report to the principal secretary of the urban development department on September 30. HT has seen a copy of the report.The report said that despite the bird flu scare earlier this year, conditions in the biggest wholesale poultry market of the city remain alarming. The report flags that no records of the source of consignments are being maintained and no veterinarian was found in the market during an inspection by committee members on September 23, 2021 that is a mandatory condition for running a slaughter house. The Ghazipur poultry market is managed by Delhi Agricultural Marketing Board.The committee also reported that blood and offals were being directly discharged into the drain without any treatment. The panel was headed by the director of veterinary services, South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) Ravindra Sharma, and had members from the veterinary services, animal husbandry department and Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). The report also noted that shops meant for sale of live birds were being used for slaughter of birds in large numbers even though trade of livestock and slaughter of birds are two distinct activities requiring different licences to operate.“It can be estimated that more than four lakh poultry birds were being brought into the market. The health status of these birds, majority of which were found injured and some were so sick that they were drifting in and out of consciousness,strongly indicated that there was a lack of sufficient veterinary attention being provided. No consignment that was being brought into the market had a ‘fitness certificate to transport’ which is provided by a veterinarian,” the report states. It is important to note that similar violations were also flagged by the same panel in November 2020 but little seems to have changed on the ground.The report also noted the possible environmental impact due to non-scientific disposal of by-products. “It is estimated that more than three thousand birds were being slaughtered in each outlet in the mandi. Fresh blood was either being collected in barrels or poured in drains. Slaughtering and dismembering of carcasses was being carried out next to drains, and offals and blood were being discharged into drainage system without any treatment or processing (thereby) posing serious risk to public health,” the report said.Noting that there is complete neglect of hygiene and general sanitation in the market, a monitoring committee member said that they have found several instances of violation of slaughterhouse rules (2001) and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. The committee has recommended action by specific agencies dealing with the full range of violations at the market. It said that health and hygiene violators be dealt by FSSAI, Delhi Police should prosecute traders who are found transporting birds in violation of rules, and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee should impose environmental compensation cess on those found polluting water. Mohammad Imran alias Kallu, a member of the Ghazipur poultry market association, said the traders were shifted from places such as Jama Masjid and Qasabpura to Ghazipur in 1990s but adequate facilities were not provided to them. “This concerns small animals, so a separate slaughterhouse may not be needed. However, there is no no modern slaugtherhouse for poultry in the city. We also want facilities such as proper drainage, wash rooms, etc. The traders pay a fee to operate from the market but facilities are not provided to us,” he added.Officials of the Delhi Agricultural Marketing Board did not respond to repeated calls made to elicit response on the panel’s findings and recommendations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-sc-appointed-panel-finds-alarming-violations-in-ghazipur-poultry-market-101634667954723.html
19-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Two arrested for committing four robberies in one night in Dwarka||Police on Tuesday said they have arrested two men, who were involved in a series of four robberies within a span two hours in Dwarka last week, after an encounter in Dwarka Sector 10 on Wednesday night. The two arrested suspects sustained gunshot wounds in the shoot-out, and their interrogation led to the arrest of their associate, a former Delhi Civil Defence employee, the police said.The arrested men were identified only by single names as Sachin,21, and Bablu,20, both residents of Mangolpuri in outer Delhi. Their accomplice Vishal, a resident of Sultanpuri in Delhi, was arrested later. Police said the duo was travelling in a car when the police team intercepted their vehicle in Dwarka Sector 10 and asked them to surrender. The duo opened fire at the police in a bid to escape. One of the two shots fired by them hit a policeman, but he was saved by his bulletproof jacket, police said. Two shots that the police fired in retaliation hit Sachin and Bablu in their knees, police said.On the intervening night of October 11 and 12, four incidents of armed robbery were reported from Dwraka, police said. In the first incident, the complainant alleged that a Santro car stopped in front of his scooter around 12.30am near Mahadev Apartments, Sector 23. Three persons got out of the car and robbed him of valuables, a senior police officer said.In the second incident, the mobile phone of the second complainant was snatched near Hotel Welcome by three to four men and after committing the robbery, they fled in a Santro car, the officer said. The third incident happened around 1.15am — the mobile phone of a third person was snatched from Sector 9, Dwarka. In the fourth incident, a man named Shagun reported that around 2.35am a car stopped in front of his scooter near Vegas Mall, and the occupants robbed him of his mobile phone, police said.“The arrested men and their one known associate planned to commit a series of robberies in quick succession, after taking inspiration from a crime show on TV,” said a senior police officer, adding that the suspects were identified after the investigating team scanned more than 200 CCTV camera footage and questioned nearly 100 persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-two-arrested-for-committing-four-robberies-in-one-night-in-dwarka-101634667953427.html

All construction agencies must only take up construction work following all anti-dust norms or be prepared for strict action. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) imposed penalties to the tune of ₹90 lakh after finding violations at 286 sites across the [Capital] and warned [owners] of serious repercussions if norms are not complied with,” said Rai in a press statement.The statement added, “DPCC teams have visited 1,105 construction sites so far; norms are being followed at most sites; citizens are actively bolstering our efforts. [We have given] clear instructions to DPCC teams to take strict action against violators and submit reports daily to keep us aware of the situation on the ground. The Delhi government is running an anti-dust campaign from October 7 to control air pollution in Delhi. Citizens have shown constant support for the campaign.”“The Kejriwal government is leaving no stone unturned to reduce pollution in Delhi... the government is running a large-scale anti-dust campaign. Environment minister Gopal Rai said that all construction agencies must only take up construction work following all anti-dust norms or be prepared for strict action,” the statement added.Rai had held a meeting with representatives of government construction agencies on September 14 and representatives of private construction agencies on September 17 to discuss controlling dust pollution. During that time, a 14-point agenda regarding preparations at every construction site was discussed. Public notices were issued on September 21-22, saying that it is necessary to implement the 14 rules on construction sites. After this, a reminder was sent to everyone on October 2, the government said in the press statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-fines-owners-of-286-construction-sites-for-violating-dust-control-norms-101634667683237.html
19-10-2021||Delhi||Default bail an indefeasible right, under trials must be informed of this right: Delhi HC||Holding that default bail — if no charge sheet is filed in the maximum period prescribed or the permitted extended period of investigation — is an “indefeasible part of the right to personal liberty”, the Delhi high court on Monday issued a slew of directions legal entities and agencies concerned to ensure that the custody of an under trial is not extended mechanically and that there is “application of mind before deciding such pleas”.Justice Manoj Ohri, while granting bail to an accused in a dowry death case, said sending an under trial to jail or extending such remand is a judicial function that requires due application of mind.“The right to seek default bail under Section 167(2) CrPC is a fundamental right and not merely a statutory right, which flows from Article 21 of the Constitution of India. It has been held to be an indefeasible part of the right to personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, and such a right cannot be suspended even during a pandemic situation. The right of the accused to be set at liberty takes precedence over the right of the state to carry on the investigation and submit a charge sheet.”“The order remanding an accused to custody is not an empty formality and at that stage, the magistrate is required to apply his mind for the necessity of remand. The 60th or 90th day of custody assumes great significance as in the event of non-filing of charge sheet, a right under Section 167(2) CrPC, which is held to be an indefeasible and fundamental right, accrues in favour of the accused. To ensure that this right does not get defeated in any manner an obligation is cast upon the magistrate to inform an under trial prisoner about accrual of such right,” justice Ohri said in his 24-page judgment.The judgment came on a plea by a man challenging an order of the trial court dismissing his revision plea seeking default bail.The accused and his family members were booked under Sections 304B (dowry death) 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code on January 16, 2020.The accused was arrested on January 18, 2020, and was sent to judicial custody after being produced before the magistrate the next day. His judicial custody was extended time and again, including on April 15, 2020, when his custody was extended till April 29, 2020.However, the time period of 90 days to file a charge sheet expired on April 18, 2020. The accused contended that he should have been granted default bail as the investigating agency had failed to file the charge sheet.Noting the lapse, the court issued directions to ensure that the rights of under trial prisoners to seek default bail are not defeated despite the legislative mandate and the principles of law enumerated by the courts time and again, and that the custody of an under trial is not extended mechanically as has been done in the present case.It directed that the under trial prisoner be produced before the court concerned on the next day — i.e, on the 61st, 91st or 181st day as the case may be — so that he can be duly informed of his fundamental right to seek default bail if no charge sheet is filed in the maximum period prescribed or the permitted extended period of investigation.The court also modified the present format of the custody warrant and included a a column indicating the day on which the right of “default bail” will accrue to the under trial.It also directed the district legal services authority to ensure that the remand advocates/legal aid counsel posted in criminal courts are instructed to keep an under trial informed of his right to seek default bail and the date of accrual of such right.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/default-bail-an-indefeasible-right-under-trials-must-be-informed-of-this-right-delhi-hc-101634667594775.html

Police suspected that the acid could have been used to destroy the two bodies or make them unrecognisable. The man was aged around 20 and the girl was 16, who went missing on October 13, they said.“Bodies have been sent for autopsy and an FIR was lodged with the police. We are exploring the hate killing angle,” said Avinash Pandey, superintendent of police (SP) Unnao. “Initial investigation suggests that girl’s father had beaten up the man outside his house the day he disappeared with the girl. The role of the local policemen is also being investigated,” Pandey said. Their bodies were identified through the mobile phones, clothes and slippers found nearby, police said. Meanwhile, the girl’s family has alleged kidnapping by the man while the latter’s filed a simple missing complaint. However, the man’s father alleged that the police tortured him when he went to file the missing complaint to the police.

19-10-2021||Lucknow||Kushinagar airport inauguration today: 8 UP airports servicing 74 destinations||After its expected inauguration by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, Kushinagar International Airport will add to the number of airports in the state.In the days to come, the airport is expected to operate more international flights than Lucknow because of its bigger runway and other facilities, Airports Authority of India (AAI) officials said.Lucknow Airport has operated without any competition in the past. Till 2017, there were only four operational airports (Lucknow, Varanasi, Gorakhpur and Agra) in the state. Only Lucknow and Varanasi airport had the distinction of being international airports. In all, 25 destinations (15 from Lucknow, 8 from Varanasi, 1 from Gorakhpur, 1 from Agra) were connected through air services.At present, eight airports have become operational with a total of 74 destinations (21 from Lucknow, 20 from Varanasi, 8 from Gorakhpur, 5 from Agra, 11 from Prayagraj, 4 from Kanpur, 2 from Hindon, 3 from Bareilly).Lucknow Airport has seen some good airlines withdraw their services because of its small runway in the past. Singapore Scoot, Tiger Air closed operations from Lucknow despite good air traffic because of runway problems. Similarly, Thai Smile which started operations in 2016 for Bangkok stopped its services.Now that the runway of Kushinagar airport is bigger and better than Lucknow airport, more international flights are expected to prefer Kushinagar. Airlines from South East Asian (Buddhist) countries have already made queries for slots at Kushinagar airport, authorities said.The runway of Kushinagar airport is 3,200 metres long and 45 metres wide which is fit for landing of big aircraft, while the runway of Lucknow airport is just 2,800 metres long and 30 metres wide, making it difficult for big aircraft to land here.Besides, the Kushinagar airport has an advanced turning pad, additional runway strip, taxiway, isolation subway, advanced runway lighting for smooth landing and take-off of aircraft.An AAI official said on condition of anonymity, “To have more international flights, Lucknow airport will need to expand its runway or it will continue to have its mediocre status despite being the state capital.”Minister of state for civil aviation Nand Gopal Gupta ‘Nandi’, said, “Healthy competition is always good for business. We need more international airports in a state like Uttar Pradesh. Today Lucknow, Varanasi and Kushinagar have international level airports in the state. Another international airport at Jewar is being developed by the state government, besides developing Maryada Purushottam Shri Ram Airport in Ayodhya. Soon there will be five international airports in the state and we expect good air traffic from all these airports.”Commenting on the Kushinagar airport, Nandi said, “Work on its terminal began in 2016 at a cost of ₹199.41 crore. We expect good air traffic from Kushinagar in the days to come.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/kushinagar-airport-inauguration-today-8-up-airports-servicing-74-destinations-101634667534982.html
19-10-2021||Delhi||250 Delhi students felicitated for mentoring girl students in govt schools||Around 250 students from the Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW) were felicitated by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday for successfully mentoring over 1,000 girl students of classes 11 and 12 in Delhi government schools for six months, and encouraging them to pursue higher education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields.A survey done by government officials showed the number of girl students who knew the timelines for competitive examinations went up from 38% to 91% in the past six months. The government survey also showed that the students’ awareness regarding financial support increased from 7% to 54% while that of mock tests increased from 22% to 96% in the past six months. Also, the students’ determination for pursuing higher education increased from 28% to 94% in the past six months.“Only 21% students had any idea about the nature of papers they had to answer to clear the entrance exams [before the mentoring programme began] but this number went up to 99% over the past six months. Students also reported that their communication, self-motivation, confidence and time management skills significantly improved [in the past six months],” the government said in a statement on Tuesday.The initiative Education Mentoring Programme was launched by the Delhi government in March this year to encourage more girl students to pursue education in STEM fields. “Over 1.5 lakh (150,000) Delhi government school students write the board exams each year. Of these, only 5,000-6,000 are girls from the science stream. Even they often do not have access to information and guidance about careers at large, and the field of engineering in particular,” the government said in a statement on Tuesday, explaining the reason for launching the programme.Under the Education Mentoring Programme, girl students who recently cleared the Joint Entrance Exam had the opportunity to share their “experience, learnings and advice” with aspirants. The young mentors also discussed the available choices of courses in STEM, entrance examinations and question patterns, resources available for preparation, and financial aid schemes of the government.“Our education system has perfected its ability to cater to the top 5% of our students.

Minutes before the self-immolation, the victim and the key witness in a facebook live feed had accused certain police officers of UP police of supporting the BSP MP, who is currently in jail, and harassing them.On September 30, the Varanasi police had arrested the CO after registering a fresh FIR against him on various charges, including abetment of suicide, at Lanka police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/rape-victim-s-self-immolation-dy-sp-terminated-from-service-101634667233506.html
19-10-2021||Delhi||Rise in dengue cases: AAP accuses BJP of negligence, BJP refutes charge||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of negligence, citing the increase in dengue cases in Delhi.The BJP dismissed the allegations as “baseless”.While the AAP is in charge of the Delhi government, the BJP rules the three municipal corporations in Delhi (MCD). Municipal elections will be held in Delhi next year.“The BJP is committing criminal negligence, and the MCDs under them are responsible for the rise in dengue cases in Delhi. BJP leaders have put the budget of dealing with dengue and malaria in their own pockets instead of spending it on machines and medication,” alleged AAP spokesperson Atishi in a press conference.She also said, “The BJP-ruled MCDs have not bought anti-dengue medication for fogging even till this month. We fail to understand why they are taking the situation so lightly. They have not taken even a single step in time to prevent dengue in Delhi. More than 70% of posts are vacant in the anti-malaria department. At least one fogging machine is required in every MCD ward, but MCD does not even have enough fogging machines. How can one even trust them at this point?”Dismissing the allegations as “baseless”, Delhi’s BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “MCDs have invested in awareness campaigns, fogging and checking the spread of dengue and malaria by regularly inspecting homes, especially coolers (in homes), while chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is wasting crores of rupees on hoardings and campaigns. They should stop wasting money on advertising and instead help MCDs financially to better control the spread of dengue and malaria.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rise-in-dengue-cases-aap-accuses-bjp-of-negligence-bjp-refutes-charge-101634667113430.html
19-10-2021||Delhi||Bank staffers among 12 held for trying to steal from NRI account||The Delhi Police’s cyber cell (CyPAD) on Tuesday said they have arrested 12 persons, including three employees of HDFC Bank, for attempting to fraudulently withdraw nearly ₹6 crore from a non-resident Indian (NRI)’s dormant account with the bank’s Delhi branch.In all, the arrested persons made “66 failed attempts” in the past six months to withdraw the money, both by trying to hack into the account using internet banking and by using a fraudulently obtained chequebook, the police said.“The fraudsters also procured an Indian mobile number, whose 10 digits were identical to the NRI’s cellphone number in the United States, which was registered with the bank account and was also listed in the know your customer (KYC) details. They attempted to use the Indian mobile number to gain access to the account via internet banking,” said deputy commissioner of police (CyPAD) KPS Malhotra.
19-10-2021||Delhi||Delta variant ups herd immunity threshold, 80%+ need antibodies: Study||The Delta variant has meant that close to 80-90% of the population needs to be vaccinated or have had a previous infection (and thus antibodies) in order for a protective wall of population immunity to be strong enough to slow down the virus, researchers from two premier Delhi institute have said, citing serosurveillance data from before the April-May wave of infections in Delhi and the outbreak that happened despite it.Herd immunity is reached by highly effective vaccines that can stop transmission, but it has been complicated in the case of the coronavirus Sars-Cov-2 due to mutations and waning immunity. The mutations in the Delta variant made it significantly more transmissible -- by some estimates, more than twice when compared to the virus that was first found in Wuhan.With that virus, which was estimated to have a basic reproduction number (the number of people the virus can spread to on average, also known as R-nought or R0) was between 2 and 3, and the herd immunity threshold was considered by 60-70%. Now, according to a pre-print study by researchers from Maulana Azad Medical College, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, and the Delhi government health department, this threshold may be 80-90%.The research refers to Delhi’s January round of sero-surveillance to show that despite 56.13% people testing positive for antibodies, there was a massive wave of Covid-19 with over 28,000 cases reported in a single day at its peak in late April. “The antibody seroprevalence in January showed a more than two-times increase, coinciding with a rapid decline in the test positivity rate and the daily new incident cases suggestive of high population-level immunity. The high seroprevalence through natural infection was insufficient to achieve herd immunity and avert the second wave of the pandemic in Delhi,” the study says. There is another instance when herd immunity can collapse -- that is when the mutation makes the virus more resistant to immunity from an infection with an older variant. A surge in cases despite high sero-positivity was previously reported from Manaus in Brazil, where the Gamma variant (P.1) that can significantly evade immune was identified. “Rapid Covid-19 vaccination with the highest possible coverage remains the most feasible means of combating and ending the Covid-19 pandemic,” even though a previous infection provides higher and longer term immunity,” according to the paper. The researchers also suggest that serial sero-surveys be continued to monitor the waning population levels of antibodies. Genetic sequencing is also needed to keep an eye out for variants that may be more effective in evading immunity, according to the study. Dr Nandini Sharma, first author of the study and professor of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College, said, “In the study we assumed the R0 of the virus to be 2 and showed that to prevent a huge surge in infections, hospitalisations, and deaths we need 80 to 90% of the population to be sero-positive either through infection of vaccination. The data is from January when we did not anticipate a second wave due to delta whose R0 is much more.” She said, “Now, we are unlikely to have an outbreak of delta. But the cases might go up if a new variant emerges that is more infectious and can evade the immunity.” There is a need to continue following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and preventing large gatherings for the time being, she said. Dr Ekta Gupta, professor of virology at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences said, “The number of cases have gone down in Delhi because of the high levels of exposure in April and May along with a good pace of vaccination. This, despite people not following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour – this is clear from the fact that we are seeing other respiratory diseases like flu in Delhi again, which had reduced because of masking.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delta-variant-ups-herd-immunity-threshold-80-need-antibodies-study-101634666874547.html
19-10-2021||Delhi||Closure of educational institutes hits PG owners in DU’s north campus area hard||The closure of educational institutes and the shift towards online classes due to Covid-19-related restrictions since March last year have hit the rented housing business in Delhi University’s (DU) north campus area. Many owners said they have had to shut their businesses down.With a new academic session set to begin in online mode and the impending danger of the third wave of Covid-19, paying guesthouse (PG) owners said if students do not return soon, the economic impact might be irreversible.Like previous years, of the around 280,000 applicants to DU this year, only 40% of the aspirants (115,000) are from Delhi-NCR areas. Since there are less than 4,000 beds available for undergraduate students in different college and university hostels, most outstation students end up staying in PGs or sharing rented accommodation with other students.Thanks to online classes, scores of PG owners who rented buildings to run hostels for outstation students have shut down their businesses in the past year.Vikas Bansal, who runs the famous Circuit House PG in the Kamla Nagar area, owns four buildings and had rented five others to house around 500 students every year before the pandemic. Due to the pandemic-generated financial crunch, he said he can now offer students only 200 beds in the four buildings he owns.“Most of the hostel buildings and PGs currently operational in the north campus area are owned by people running the businesses. Those who rented property for the purpose had to give up their lease because it was impossible to pay rent, electricity, water, and other charges,” said Bansal, who is also the vice-president of the Delhi Student Housing Association-- a collective of students, property and PG owners formed during the pandemic to address housing issues.“We are completely dependent on the university guidelines. So far, there is no clarity regarding the reopening of classes and the mode of teaching (online/offline) in the coming days. We are hoping for in-person classes to resume at least in a phased manner from January. If that doesn’t happen, the businesses of hostel-owners like me, who own property, will also collapse,” he said, adding that the economic impact would be “irreversible.”Bansal also said that several start-ups and housing facilities that were offering living space to students in the area have shut shop in the past 18 months due to the uncertainty of the situation and the high maintenance costs, including housekeeping, electricity, rent, water, and others.Several hostel owners said that another reason for the closure of the hostel and PG business in areas such as Kamla Nagar, Hudson Lane, GTB Nagar, Vijay Nagar, and Kingsway Camp was the way the buildings were constructed. They said the properties were designed to house students, not families, and hence could not be rented out to anyone else.Rajpal Singh, who had rented 12 buildings, is currently in the process of shutting down his hostel business. “In the past four-five years, many buildings were constructed specifically to be used as hostels. For instance, there would only be one kitchen in a multi-storeyed building. The buildings cannot be converted into regular flats and rented out to families because they lack drawing rooms, lobbies, and separate kitchens,” he said.Singh explained that since PGs were a commercial establishment, PG owners would have to pay electricity and other kinds of rent accordingly. “I was spending over ₹25,000 per month on these expenses, including paying salary to housekeeping and security staff. It was no longer sustainable to run the business so I decided to shut it down. I had paid around ₹2-3 crore as security deposit for these buildings, but the money was adjusted in lieu of the last few months’ rent and I did not get any of it back,” he said, adding that the second wave of the pandemic was particularly devastating for hostel owners.“In January this year, some students had started returning to campus. But the second wave of the pandemic crushed all hopes of normalcy. Parents too are scared about sending their wards back to campus and with the risk of a third wave, there is a lot of uncertainty,” he said.Ajay Singh, the owner of Aparna Hostel which has housed about 500 students every year for nearly two decades, said he had to sell two of his cars to keep up with the monthly cost of maintaining the hostel ( ₹2 lakh per month).He said that until last March, there were at least 1,000 hostels and PGs in the one-km radius of DU’s north campus. “Around 50% of hostel owners had to leave their furniture behind when they gave up their lease. There is no assistance scheme for PG owners,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/closure-of-educational-institutes-hits-pg-owners-in-du-s-north-campus-area-hard-101634666753529.html
19-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s south civic body launches ‘gift a tree’ scheme to boost its greening drive||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Tuesday kicked off a new greening initiative called ”gift a tree”, a programme through which residents may gift tree saplings, instead of extravagant gifts, to their near and dear one on their special occasions and festivals. Launching this online drive by planting a sapling of maulshree at Harsukh Park, justice (retired) Adarsh Kumar Goel, chairman of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), said to protect the environment, such initiatives should be taken up on a priority basis. “It is the need of the hour that we should show our commitment to save greenery by planting and adopting trees, thereby contributing to afforestation efforts, promotion of biodiversity, setting right damaged ecosystems, mitigating climate change and improving the environment. This (gift a tree) is a good initiative by the SDMC, under which one can book and plant a tree at a selected SDMC park by logging on to the online module. While an e- certificate will be generated for gifting the tree, the south corporation will give an undertaking to take care of tree for its whole life,” he said. Civic officials said anyone who wishes to gift a tree needs to log on to the SDMC portal and book a space in one of the 20 SDMC parks selected for the purpose, choose the sapling and make the payment. SDMC director (horticulture) Alok Kumar said, “To avail of the ‘gift a tree’ scheme, a person need only spend about ₹2,000-2,500. This concept encourages people to do away with extravagant gifts in favour of gifting a tree by planting the sapling in the name of their loved ones.”The civic body will plant the sapling at the park and also set up a tree guard around it with details of the person in whose name the tree was planted. An e-certificate to commemorate the gift will also be given to the beneficiary. The civic body will from then on care for the tree for its lifetime at no added cost and the person adopting it will be able to visit the tree any time they choose, the officials said.The person gifting the tree as well as the person in whose name it being planted may also take part in the plantation ceremony, if they so wish, officials said. SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti, who handed over the e-certificate to the NGT chairman, said trees are key component of this earth as they protect the environment. “A single tree absorbs nearly one tonne of carbon dioxide in its lifetime, which helps in controlling global warming. Besides, plantation is the easiest way to protect the environment. Through this initiative, people can ensure plantation in selected parks of the SDMC, where the civic agency will look after the gifted tree for its whole life,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-south-civic-body-launches-gift-a-tree-scheme-to-boost-its-greening-drive-101634666633455.html

The step follows an in-depth study undertaken by the institute,” said MNNIT director prof Rajeev Tripathi while confirming the move.He said the institute had also merged the 110 seats of BTech IT with BTech (computer science) course. As a result, the total seats of BTech (computer science) have risen from earlier 180 to 290. The institute was the first in the country to start an undergraduate programme in computer science and engineering in 1976-77. It started BTech in IT course from 2003-04 session.“A scrutiny of past records showed that BTech in IT programme was low on the preference of top aspirants as compared to the BTech in computer science and engineering course and, as a result, the BTech (IT) was attracting aspirants much lower in the merit. We also observed that even companies hiring our students preferred BTech in computer science and engineering pass-outs to BTech in IT pass-outs, believing that the course in computer science and engineering is more holistic and covering a wider spectrum of skills and knowledge as compared to IT,” prof Tripathi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mnnit-to-shut-btech-course-in-info-technology-101634666454459.html

According to BMC’s finance department, FDs worth ₹5,664 crore matured this year, even as BMC invested ₹9,079 crore in new deposits. According to the statement to be presented in the standing committee on Wednesday, BMC has ₹82,410 crore in 343 separate FDs at private as well as nationalised banks. The civic body earns around ₹1,800 crore as interest per year on FDs. In the ongoing fiscal’s budget, BMC had taken an internal loan from FDs, attached to long-term infrastructure projects such as infrastructure development fund. For the construction of infrastructure projects such as the coastal road, BMC has linked FDs worth ₹50,952. The amount is expected to be spent in the next few years. Further, FDs of around ₹26,000 crore are part of the employees’ provident fund and pension accounts.In the statement to be presented on Wednesday, the BMC has stated, “The FDs were at ₹79,002 crore in August.

19-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s north corporation kicks off new module for online transfer of teachers, principals||The North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Monday kicked off the new module for online transfer of teachers and principals to bring more transparency in the education system, the officials said. Launching this module at the civic centre, north corporation mayor Raja Iqbal Singh said the civic body has started the process of online transfer of teachers and principals to bring about more transparency in the education system. “With every information available in the public domain through this module, our teachers need not to run here and there for their transfer. Besides, this new system will also reduce human interaction – which often leads to malpractices,” he said. Echoing similar views, Alok Sharma, chairman of the education committee, north corporation, said the transfer process of teachers has been made fully computerised by this online transfer module. “The applicant needs to apply through their biometric identity for transfer. Under this module, the teachers and principals will be able to select a maximum of five schools of their priorities, and the computer will automatically allocate the school on the basis of first come, first-served, as per the vacant posts available,” he said. Sharma further said the north corporation has re-engaged nearly 700 contract teachers at its primary schools earlier this month. “The proposal to re-engage 667 primary teachers was first approved by the education committee and then it was vetted by the commissioner. The contract of these teachers was terminated in 2020. The move will benefit all primary teachers who were hit hard by loss of jobs during the coronavirus pandemic,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-north-corporation-kicks-off-new-module-for-online-transfer-of-teachers-principals-101634666275638.html
19-10-2021||Noida||CBSE schools in Gautam Budh Nagar gear up to hold Term-1 board exams this year||School authorities in Gautam Budh Nagar are gearing up to prepare students for the new pattern of the examinations after the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Monday released its date sheet for the first-term board examinations for classes 10 and 12, officials said on Tuesday. The CBSE will be holding offline examinations for the first time, ever since the coronavirus pandemic outbreak.According to the circular issued by the CBSE, the 90-minute Term-1 examination will have objective type questions, and Term-2 examination -- scheduled to take place between March and April -- is likely to have subjective or objective type questions. This will be decided according to the pandemic situation in the country at that time, said the officials.The first term for Class 10 board examination will be conducted from November 30 to December 11, 2021, on the major subjects. The examination on the major subjects for Class 12 will be held from December 1 to December 22.“There are a total of 148 CBSE-affiliated intermediate schools in Gautam Budh Nagar, with nearly 40,000 students in classes 10 and 12, according to the official data,” said Dharamveer Singh, district inspector of schools, Gautam Budh Nagar.Renu Singh, principal of Amity International School in Noida, who is also the Noida coordinator of CBSE, said, “Unlike board examinations in the earlier format, when question papers were collected from CBSE’s designated centres, password-protected encrypted question papers will be sent to schools online this year. Schools will get half an hour (30 minutes) after entering the passwords, and they will have to print the question papers within this time period. For this, schools have to be well-equipped, and there will be a greater number of examination centres this year.”As the CBSE has already shared the sample papers for Term-1 board examinations, schools have been conducting mock tests to prepare students for the new pattern. “This time, we have objective type questions which require thorough understanding on topics. It is a huge shift for the students from the earlier pattern of board examinations. We have been conducting mock tests and practical examinations offline, so that the students understand the new pattern well,” said Kamini Bhasin, principal of Delhi Public School (DPS) in Noida.Seema Kaur, principal of Pacific World School (PWS) in Greater Noida West said that the students are preparing themselves for the examinations through resources such as sample papers, worksheets and periodic assessments. “After attending online classes and giving online examinations for over a year now, the students need to be ready to face offline examinations for Term-1 board examinations. To ensure this, we have been holding offline practice tests at the school, in accordance with guidelines issued by the CBSE,” she said.Aditi Basu Roy, principal of Grads International School (GIS) in Greater Noida and president of All India Principals’ Association (Gautam Budh Nagar chapter), said that holding Class 10 examinations before Class 12 examinations will ensure that all the issues with the new pattern are resolved by the schools and the CBSE itself. “According to the examination schedules, Class 10 examinations will be conducted before Class 12 examinations. This is a strategic decision by the CBSE which will help the schools as well as the Board to resolve issues which may come during the Class 10 examinations, so that Class 12 examinations could be conducted smoothly. The CBSE will put observers at each centre, and encrypted question papers will be sent to the schools for the examinations,” she said.Meanwhile, Manoj Kataria, president of Parents’ Welfare Society in Gautam Budh Nagar, said that parents are also confident enough to send their children to schools for offline examinations. “With almost negligible numbers of Covid-19 cases daily, at present, parents are confident about sending their children for offline board examinations. Moreover, students will be able to maintain social distancing as there will be a greater number of examination centres, and the strength of students will be manageable. In addition, with over one and a half years into the Covid-19 pandemic, students of classes 10 and 12 are old enough to understand and obey Covid-appropriate behaviour,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/cbse-schools-in-gautam-budh-nagar-gear-up-to-hold-term-1-board-exams-this-year-101634666274487.html

The court also imposed a ₹50,000 fine on the convict -- identified as Vijay (goes by first name) alias Bijju -- who is a resident of Deri Scanner village in Badalpur.Dinesh Kumar, station house officer (SHO), Badalpur police station, said Vijay, who lived in the neighbourhood of the victim, frequently visited her house. On the day of the crime, Vijay visited the victim’s house in the afternoon and found that she was playing outside the house. He took her out on the pretext of buying her some goodies.“The man took her to an isolated place, raped her, killed her, and then threw her body in a small pit,” SHO Kumar said.Family members of the child launched a search, but failed to trace her. Later, some children informed them that they had seen Vijay going to a nearby field with the girl in the afternoon.The victim’s family informed the police, and a case was registered against Vijay under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 376 (rape), Section 302 (murder) at the Badalpur police station in 2017, and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act sections 5 and 6.SHO Kumar said that Vijay was arrested the next day after he committed the crime and was sent to judicial custody. “Police had filed a chargesheet in this case within a month,” he added.Vrinda Shukla, deputy commissioner of police (women safety), Gautam Budh Nagar, said on Tuesday that the additional district judge (special POCSO 1), Niranjan Kumar, sentenced Vijay to life imprisonment after hearing the case.“The court has also fined Vijay ₹50,000, failing which he will have to serve 30 months more imprisonment... So satisfied that the culprit of such a heinous crime against a young victim has been suitably punished,” Shukla said, adding that the Noida police has been pursuing all women-related cases in the court seriously, leading to convictions.Total 70 persons have been convicted in women-related cases since November 2020, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-man-jailed-for-life-for-raping-killing-one-year-old-girl-101634666273320.html
19-10-2021||Noida||Air quality ‘satisfactory’ in Noida, mercury rises by 7°C||The air quality in Noida and adjoining areas continued to remain under ‘satisfactory’ levels even as the temperatures soared by seven degrees Celsius (°C) on Tuesday.According to weather analysts, rainfall in most of the northern parts of the country have suppressed the transport of pollutants and reduced the biomass burning, leading to a better air quality.The air quality in the city, which oscillated between ‘very poor’ and ‘poor’ category till Sunday, improved a little following the rainfall on Sunday, thereby keeping the air quality in the ‘good’ category on Monday and the ‘satisfactory’ category on Tuesday.“Though rainfall activities have stopped in Delhi-NCR, most of the parts of northern India saw patchy rainfall on Tuesday. This suppressed the biomass burning and reduced transport of pollutants. The region is receiving northwesterly winds, which for the time being will be cooler because of the snowfall in the hilly region. The air quality will, however, start dropping over the next two days as the region will become dry and the daytime temperatures will increase, leading to the resumption of transport of pollutants and biomass burning,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) reading, on a scale of 0 to 500, for Noida on Tuesday was 79 against 45 a day earlier. Similarly, Ghaziabad’s AQI was 77 against 45 on Monday, and Greater Noida’s AQI was 78 against 38 a day earlier.An air quality index (AQI) between 101 and 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is ‘very poor’, and above 400 is ‘severe’.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the maximum and minimum temperatures in Noida on Tuesday were recorded at 30.1°C and 20.5°C against 23.1°C and 20°C, respectively, a day earlier. At Delhi’s Safdarjung weather station, considered average for the national capital region (NCR), the maximum and minimum temperatures were recorded at 31.2°C and 19.9°C -- one degree below and two degrees above the season’s average, respectively.“The maximum and minimum temperatures will hover around 31°C and 19°C, respectively, on Wednesday. The sky will mainly remain cloudy,” said an official of the IMD on Tuesday.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the low biomass burning has led to an improvement in the air quality in the city. “Local land surfaces are wet, so the dust re-suspension is the bare minimum, which has led to a low presence of particulate matter (PM10) in the air. Presence of western disturbance has led to scattered rainfall over North India and low biomass burning. This condition improved the AQI, with low PM2.5,” according to a statement issued by the SAFAR on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/air-quality-satisfactory-in-noida-mercury-rises-by-7c-101634666213457.html
19-10-2021||Mumbai||Mobile phone found in Taloja jail at Navi Mumbai||A mobile handset was found in one of the cells of Taloja jail in Navi Mumbai. The jail houses some high-profile inmates and the prison authority has reported the matter to Kharghar police. Senior inspector Sandipan Shinde of Kharghar police, said, “An unclaimed phone was found inside the prison. The matter has been reported to our police station and we are investigating the matter”. Shinde added that as there was no SIM card in the phone, they are trying to trace the owner/user of the device through its international mobile equipment identity (IEMI) – a unique serial number – to find out how it had reached the jail.The police are not clear if any inmate had used the mobile phone. Police sources said that once the phone’s owner is identified, they would be able to answer all the questions.Taloja jail houses more than 2,000 prisoners, including some high-profile under-trial prisoners such as dismissed Mumbai Police officers Sachin Vaze, Riyazuddin Kazi, Sunil Mane and Vinayak Shinde, retired encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma and some white-collar crime accused such as Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor and convicts such as gangster Abu Salem, who is serving life imprisonment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mobile-phone-found-in-taloja-jail-at-navi-mumbai-101634666095254.html
19-10-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad, Noida asked to implement Grap||The sub-committee constituted by the Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and adjoining areas on Monday directed several agencies, including those in Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar, to implement several pollution-control measures with immediate effect in areas with “very poor” and “poor” to “moderate” air quality.An air quality index (AQI) reading between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.Officials of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) said that the committee also directed the implementation of certain measures which require the participation of citizens in order to keep a check on air pollution.“The committee suggested several measures, which include keeping pollution under control certificates (PUC) up-to-date; keeping engines of cars and two-wheelers properly tuned; adherence to lane driving; optimal usage of private vehicles and no disposal of garbage/waste in the open. Such directions have been issued for the first time and respective agencies have been asked to implement these measures,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB.“It is now up to the respective agencies to begin enforcement of the measures to abate pollution in the coming days. Both Ghaziabad and Noida have their winter action plans ready. With the directions, measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) come into immediate effect,” Sharma added.The Grap lists different measures to be implemented when air quality deteriorates.The committee has directed the chief secretary of Uttar Pradesh, UPPCB, transport commissioner of UP, Ghaziabad municipal corporation, Noida Authority, Ghaziabad Development Authority, and Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority, among others to “stringently” enforce/stop garbage burning; stop activity in brick kilns; not tolerate visible emissions and strictly enforce PUC norms.“We will start with a drive to check for violations of PUC norms and levy penalties. We will strictly enforce the directions,” said Vishwajeet Pratap Singh, additional regional transport officer, Ghaziabad.Ghaziabad is one of the 16 non-attainment cities in UP and its pollution levels are some of the highest across the country.According to UPPCB records, Ghaziabad, in 2017, reeled under “severe” air pollution for 47 days. The city saw 50 days of “severe” pollution in 2018. Records indicate that there were no “good” air days in 2017 at all, while there were only four such days in 2018.Ghaziabad saw 31 “severe” air days in 2019, and 24 “severe” air days in 2020. In 2019, there were “good” air days and in 2020, there were 13 such days.In the first nine months of 2021, Ghaziabad witnessed 10 days of “severe” pollution in January and February, but only nine days of “good” air.“Most of the ‘severe’ air quality days happen in October, November, December, and January, and even if their number reduced a bit in 2020, it is due to judicial orders and intervention by courts. However, the prolonged monsoon this year may help reduce the number of ‘severe’ pollution days. It is now up to the agencies to sustain the momentum,” said Akash Vashishtha, a Ghaziabad-based environmentalist and lawyer.“Ghaziabad lacks public transport, which is a major reason why the residents are forced to use their own vehicles, and this leads to major contribution to air pollution. Illegal factories operating in different areas also are a major source of pollution. The burning of waste is also a common sight in small localities. Above all, strict enforcement is must,” said Sushil Raghav, a Ghaziabad-based environmentalist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-noida-asked-to-implement-grap-101634666093931.html
19-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai fisherman releases endangered turtle found near coastal road site back to sea||A hawksbill sea turtle – a protected species under the Indian Wildlife Act (1972) – was rescued and released back to the sea by a fisherman from Worli Koliwada on Tuesday around 8pm, just off the Mumbai coastal road construction site. The incident sparked critical reactions from conservationists, who said that the controversial infrastructure project has so far ignored the presence of such biodiversity in the region.The fisherman, Nitesh Patil, who is the director of the Worli Koliwada Nakhwa Vyavsay Sahakari Society, found the turtle close to Bandra-Worli Sea Link, where work on the Coastal Road-Sea Link interchange is due to commence this month. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) recently began preparing the construction of this segment of the controversial infra project, prompting nearly 200 boats from across the Worli fishing zone to gherao a temporary jetty at the coastal road construction site on October 14.“This further confirms the presence of marine life along the coastal road project. This is not the first time that we have seen the presence of protected marine life in the area. Dolphins are also frequently seen by the fisherfolk who take their boats out there,” Patil told HT.Shaunak Modi, a city-based marine biologist and director of the Coastal Conservation Foundation, pointed out that the exact location of the turtle was less than 200 metres away from the site of the coastal road reclamation. “The presence of turtles, dolphins, corals and other rich biodiversity that are found in the inter-tidal zone has been completely overlooked by the coastal road’s environment impact assessment report. A more rigorous, honest assessment is required,” he said.An official with the state forest department’s mangrove cell, which is tasked with conservation of marine life and implementation of mitigation measures to protect biodiversity in relation to the project, said, “We have already received about ₹150 crore from BMC to be used for biodiversity conservation. The money is kept in a fixed deposit as per the organisation’s mandate, and specific measures to conserve biodiversity will be implemented to protect such species.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-fisherman-releases-endangered-turtle-found-near-coastal-road-site-back-to-sea-101634665973340.html
19-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab ex-CM Amarinder Singh to soon announce his own political party||Former Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday said that he will launch his own political outfit soon, news agency PTI reported. Amarinder Singh quit the Congress last month after Punjab saw a change in chief minister with Charanjit Singh Channi taking over the role.Amarinder Singh said that he will not rest until Punjab’s future is secured. “Will not rest till I can secure the future of my people and my state. Punjab needs political stability and protection from internal and external threats,” the former chief minister was quoted as saying by his media advisor Raveen Thukral.The former chief minister who said that he would not join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) earlier, however, kept the door open for a coalition. Singh however outlined that the farmer’s interest will then have to take the centrestage. “Hopeful of a seat arrangement with BJP in 2022 Punjab polls if farmers protest is resolved in farmers’ interest. Also looking at alliance with like-minded parties- Akali groups, particularly Dhindsa & Brahmpura,” Singh was quoted as saying by his media advisor.The final months of Singh’s tenure as a chief minister was fraught with infightings as Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu and a group of rebel ministers accused him of not fulfilling promises made in 2017. Sidhu and Singh opposed each other and Singh’s resignation from the post of chief minister came two months after Sidhu’s elevation as state unit chief.“I feel humiliated. This is the third time they (Congress high command) have called the MLAs. Apparently, they do not have confidence in me and didn’t think I could handle my job. But I felt humiliated at the manner in which they handled the whole affair,” Singh said last month, while tendering his resignation. He also called Sidhu ‘unstable’ and deemed him ‘unfit’ for Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-ex-cm-amarinder-singh-to-soon-announce-his-own-political-party-101634665802735.html
19-10-2021||Mumbai||Union environment ministry notifies final ESZ around Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary||The Union environment ministry has notified the final demarcation of the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) around Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary (TCFS). The notification was gazetted on October 14 and accessed by Hindustan Times on Tuesday. With the ESZ now in effect, certain activities such as setting up of new, polluting industries will be prohibited in a 48 square kilometre (sq km) zone around TCFS, while others such as construction, eco-tourism and infrastructure expansion will be regulated by a ministry-appointed ESZ management committee.An ESZ is a buffer zone created around protected areas – namely wildlife sanctuaries and national parks – to reduce developmental pressures on the environment. After several months of being in the offing, the Centre had recommended final notification for the delineated ESZs on August 17 during a Union environment ministry’s ESZ expert committee meeting, the minutes of which were published on September 8.The draft notification for the declaration of ESZ around TCFS was first notified on November 6, 2019, but was subsequently re-notified on April 30 after the Maharashtra government revised its proposal to increase the area earmarked for protection by the forest department. It was initially proposed to include 34.06 sq km of adjacent land within the ESZ, but the state government in March wrote to the Centre, proposing the inclusion of an additional 14 sq km of land therein.The proposal also increased the maximum width of the originally proposed buffer area to a maximum of 3.98km, as compared to 3.5km earlier. At its southernmost point near Vashi bridge, the width of ESZ is 0km, while at its northernmost point at Thane-Kalwa bridge, the width is 2km.The ESZ monitoring committee that will implement the notification includes the additional principal chief conservator of forests (APCCF), mangrove cell; deputy conservator of forests (DCF), mangrove cell; district collectors of Thane and Mumbai; joint commissioner of Mumbai civic body, two independent experts in ecology and biodiversity nominated by the state and a regional officer of the Maharashtra State Pollution Control Board (MPCB) from either Mumbai or Thane. The APCCF (mangrove cell) will serve as the chairman.“All development work that is permissible as per the notification will be monitored and sanctioned by the ESZ committee with conditions that the local environment and biodiversity cannot be harmed. This notification has been pending for a long time and the committee will conduct regular meetings to enforce its provisions to the fullest extent,” said Virendra Tiwari, APCCF, mangrove cell.Spread across 1,690.5 hectares (ha) across Mulund, Vikhroli, Bhandup, Kanjurmarg and parts of Mandale village near Mankhurd, TCFS is home to 12 true mangrove species, 39 mangrove associates, 167 species of birds including flamingos, 45 fish species, 59 species of butterflies, 67 insect species, among other mammals such as jackals. In May 2018, the state had declared it a flamingo sanctuary.The ESZ notification does not mitigate developmental pressures entirely. HT had reported on August 28 that the Union environment ministry’s expert appraisal committee (EAC) for CRZ clearances has given a go-ahead for setting up 47 transmission towers in Mumbai, a portion of which will pass through TCFS for less than half a kilometre. EAC has recommended that bird diverters should be installed among the transmission lines “so as to avoid accidental collision of birds ie flamingos”. Similarly, the Mumbai-Ahmedabad high-speed bullet train has also been permitted to cut through the sanctuary, diverting just over 3ha of forest land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/union-environment-ministry-notifies-final-esz-around-thane-creek-flamingo-sanctuary-101634665853371.html
19-10-2021||Lucknow||Kheri DM sounds red alert amid flood threat||District magistrate Dr Arvind Kumar Chaurasiya sounded a red alert about impending flood in Kheri following excessive discharge of water into Sharda river from Banbasa barrage located in Champawat district of Uttarakhand on Tuesday.“Around 5,33,000 cusec water had been discharged into the Sharda river from Banbasa barrage till Tuesday afternoon. It is likely to enter Kheri within next few hours,” he said. “It was in 2013 when over five lakh cusec water was released into the Sharda river which resulted in flood in 181 villages then,” Kheri DM added.He asked the residents of flood-prone areas of Nighasan, Pallia, Dhaurahra and Lakhimpur tehsils to move to safer places in view of the flood threat.Moreover, incessant rain for the past two days in the district and neighbouring Nepal led to the swelling of Kheri rivers of Sharda, Mohana, Ghaghra and Kaudiyala. Now, excessive discharge of water into the Sharda river would worsen the situation.Kheri DM Dr Arvind Chaurasia, who alongwith SP Vijay Dhull, reached Sharda barrage in Sharda Nagar on Tuesday to review the flood situation instructed sub-divisional magistrates of Pallia, Nighasan, Dhaurahra and Lakhimpur to ensure that the people living in low-lying areas were moved to safe places.Meanwhile, heavy rain since Sunday coupled with strong winds has left Kheri farmers deeply worried about their paddy crops in the harvesting season. Rain and heavy winds have flattened the paddy crops while the harvested paddy crop lying in fields submerged in water causing severe loss to the farmers.

These officers failed to act against stubble burning even as they have been given nodal officers under them to help curb the menace. Those issues the notices include tehsildars, block development and panchayat officers (BDPOs), sub-divisional officers (SDOs), sub-divisional engineers (SDEs), block agriculture officers and junior engineers (JEs). These officers failed to submit daily action taken reports on farm fire incidents to the Moga administration. Now, they have directed to file reply to the notices within three days or face departmental action. The Moga administration has appointed nodal officers for every village and over 20 cluster officers to check stubble burning incidents. They are obligated to share daily action taken reports through a mobile application called ‘ATR’ (action taken report), developed by Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) and the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre (PRSC), after physical verification of stubble burning incidents. Their failure in sending reports caused inconvenience to the Moga administration in monitoring and data compilation of stubble burning incidents; the administration also faced difficulty in sharing information of stubble burning incidents with the state government, the notice to them reads. Sources added that nodal officers were not going to villages for physical verification of stubble burning, due to farmers’ agitation. Other claim that technical glitches in the mobile application led to the non-submission of daily reports. “We have served notices to the 14 officers not sharing reports, and they have separate verbal reasons. We have sought explanations and replies from them. Their replies will reveal the actual reason for failing to upload the action taken reports,” the ADC (G) added. The 14 officers issued the show-cause notices are Iqbal Singh, SDO; Gurdeep Singh, JE, water supply and sanitation department; Navroop Singh, SDE of construction sub-division Moga; Manvir Kaur, naib tehsildar of Ajitwal; Sukhvir Kaur, BDPO Moga-1; Jarnail Singh, supervisor of Guardians of Governance (GoG), Manjot Singh Sodhi; BDPO Kot Ise Khan, Kirpal Singh; BDPO Nihal Singh Wala, Joginder Singh; SDO of Mandi Board, Baghapurana, Deepak Kumar; naib tehsildar of Nihal Singh Wala; Gurbhej Singh, assistant project officer (APO) of BDPO Kot Ise Khan, Partap Singh; tehsil in-charge of GoG, Sudhir Kumar; SDE Moga-1 and Gurpreet Singh, block agriculture officer of Nihal Singh Wala sub-division.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/14-moga-cluster-officers-for-stubble-burning-issued-show-cause-notice-101634665675055.html

19-10-2021||Other||Fatehpur assembly constituency: Congress citadel ready for a triangular contest||One of the most fertile areas, Fatehpur assembly segment in Kangra is a known farming hub with most of the families in the constituency dependent on agriculture. This Congress citadel for over a decade is set for a tough triangular battle on October 30 by-election.The by-election was necessitated after the death of Congress legislator Sujan Singh Pathania. The former minister died of prolonged illness in February this year.Pathania, a former forest officer, was elected from Fatehpur (earlier known as Jawali) in 1977 on Janata Party ticket. Next election he contested as a Congress nominee but was defeated by BJP’s Rajan Sushant who was re-elected in 1985 election as well.Pathania won two consecutive elections in 1990 and 1993 before again losing to Rajan Sushant in 1998. He was re-elected in 2003 but again lost to Sushant in 2007.In 2009, the seat was vacated after Sushant was elected to the Lok Sabha and Pathnaia won the by-poll and was re-elected in 2012 and 2017.This time, the contest is between Sujan Singh Pathania’s son Bhawani Singh Pathania, BJP’s Baldev Thakur and Rajan Sushant who is contesting as an independent.Precursor to 2022 assembly pollsThe byelection to Fatehpur assembly segment holds importance as it would be a precursor to the voting trend in 2022 assembly election. Population-wise largest district Kangra holds key to the formation of government.The district sends 15 legislators to the 68-member state assembly and data of previous elections shows that the party which wins maximum seats in Kangra forms the government.In the 2017 assembly polls, the BJP had won 11 seats and Congress only three while independent candidate won one seat.BJP faces bumpy rideThe BJP which is looking to wrest the seat from Congress is facing a bumpy ride due to infighting. The squabbling in the Fatehpur unit of BJP began even before the party had announced tickets. Former Rajya Sabha MP Kripal Parmar was a frontrunner for BJP ticket but lost the race to Baldev Thakur.Before the ticket announcement, posters calling Parmar an outsider were put up in the constituency.Fearing a rebellion, the party chose Baldev Thakur over him. Peeved over the denial of ticket, Parmar is staying away from campaign even as the chief minister Jai Ram Thakur convinced him not to contest as an independent. Recently, his close confidents have been expelled from the party for anti-party activities.Recently, posters calling Thakur an outsider also cropped as his home originally falls in adjoining Jawali constituency.Former BJP MP Rajan Sushant, who is contesting as an independent, will also harm the party’s prospect as he still enjoys a considerable vote bank.BJP had lost last three elections from Fatehpur due to infighting between the factions.However, the BJP leadership denies any infighting. Industry minister and the in-charge for Fatehpur bypolls Bikram Singh said: “All the talks about infighting are nothing but rumours being spread by the opponents to weaken the BJP. We will win the election with a thumping majority and will end the decade-long drought.”He said BJP is seeking votes on the achievements and works done by Centre and will emerge victorious.The BJP is also facing the farmers’ ire in Fatehpur which reflects the mood of the public. The BJP candidate and workers faced protests by the farmers over non-fulfilment of their demands and were even denied entry in several villages.Rajender Mehra, a local said the BJP has failed to fulfil its promise of opening a grain market in the local area. “Our crops are rotting in the field as the Punjab has banned the crops from outside the state in its markets,” he said.Inflation, unemployment Congress’ poll plankMeanwhile, the opposition Congress has made rising prices and unemployment the main poll plank in the bypoll. Sujanpur legislator and Congress in-charge for Fatehpur Rajinder Singh Rana said the BJP was running the government like a market where profit matters the most.“People are reeling due to high prices of essential commodities and have decided to teach the saffron party a lesson,” he said.He also alleged that BJP has foreseen its defeat and now was threatening the employees to win the elections.Caste matrixFatehpur assembly segment is dominated by Rajput community followed by OBC. The Brahmins also have a sizeable population in the constituency and have traditionally sided with BJP.Former MP Rajan Sushant, who is contesting as an independent, is a Brahmin and will hurt BJP the most.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fatehpur-assembly-constituency-congress-citadel-ready-for-a-triangular-contest-101634664473277.html

The four-lane road will boost connectivity between Bulandshahr and Jewar, officials said, adding the GT Road passes through Dadri in Greater Noida. The state government has directed the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) to work on multi-modal connectivity plan to connect the Jewar airport with rest of Delhi-NCR cities, including Bulandshahr, Meerut, Ghaziabad, Delhi, and Faridabad, said the officials.“To connect NH 91, also known as GT Road, with the Noida International Airport, the UP government has planned a 25-km road. The government has asked the National Highways authority of India (NHAI) to work on this new link that will boost connectivity between Khurja/Bulandshahr and Jewar. Now, the NHAI will prepare a detailed project report and work on it,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer, Yeida.Meanwhile, the Integrated Industrial Township Greater Noida Limited (IITGNL) has decided to build a four-lane 2.5km road and an underpass on NH-91 near Shiv Nadar University to connect proposed logistics hub at Greater Noida’s Bodaki with the highway. Also, one interchange is planned at Dankaur village on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE) and another is planned at Sirsa village on the expressway that passes over NH-91 and the Yamuna Expressway, officials said.“The interchange at Sirsa will connect a 130-metre-wide Greater Noida road with the EPE and interchange at Danakaur will connect the EPE with the Yamuna Expressway that reaches till Jewar airport site. It means Greater Noida’s logistics hub, transport hub and integrated Industrial Township will enjoy smooth connectivity with airport once these projects are built,” said Narendra Bhooshan, CEO of IITGNL and Greater Noida authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gt-road-to-be-connected-with-noida-airport-101634664354242.html

The lawmaker cited that it is necessary to ensure free and fair elections in the upcoming bypolls to Dinhata (Coochbehar), Santipur (Nadia), Gosaba (South 24 Parganas) and Khardah (North 24 Parganas) constituencies.In his letter, Singh claimed that post-poll violence has not yet ceased in the state. “As you are aware the spate of post-poll violence, which started from the day of counting after the General Election, still continues. The High court also took cognizance of the situation and ordered a CBI probe in the case,” Singh wrote.Singh alleged that cadres of Trinamool Congress (TMC), the ruling party in the state, attacked BJP candidates Joy Saha from Khardah and Ashok Mandal from Dinhata while they were conducting door-to-door campaigns in their respective constituencies. He in his letter said that he cannot rely on the state police.According to a report by news agency PTI, Ashok Mondal, the BJP candidate for Dinhata assembly constituency, and Natabari's party MLA Mihir Goswami were allegedly heckled by TMC supporters in the presence of Jalpaiguri's BJP MP Jayanta Roy during campaigning at Nayarhat. The local TMC leaders, however, denied the involvement of its workers in these cases. Nisith Pramanik’s retaining his Lok Sabha seat necessitated the by-election to Dinhata assembly constituency.“In this context, we repeat our request made earlier for immediate allotment of Central Security cover for our candidates as we have no reliance on the West Bengal Police,” Singh wrote. He requested the CEO to deploy 30 companies of CAPF per constituency to ensure that the bypolls on October 30 are held peacefully.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bjp-mp-seeks-additional-central-forces-for-oct-30-bengal-bypolls-101634663513549.html
19-10-2021||Other||Jubbal-Kotkhai: Apple is the flavour of the poll season||With the campaign to the bypoll reaching its last leg, emotions and issues related to horticulture are running high in the apple heartland in Jubbal-Kotkhai constituency that has remained the turf of two former chief ministers.Apple cultivation is the main source of livelihood for the majority of the electorate in this constituency. In spite of a good crop, apple season this time has been agonising for the farmers. The weather vagaries hit the crop earlier, unseasonal snow in spring caused widespread damage to orchards in the middle and higher belts, and repeated spells of hail battered the fruit. The farmers did not get compensation for the losses.Later, prices in the market crashed, mainly due to the nexus between the merchants and wholesale dealers. The ₹6,000 crore apple economy which mostly runs on the free market model, was dealt another setback when Adani group, a big corporate buyer in Himachal Pradesh’s apple market, announced its opening price for premium quality fruit at just ₹72 per kg against ₹88 per kg it offered last year.There were widespread protests in the apple-growing regions of the state. Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a conglomerate of 21 fruit and vegetable growers’ associations, was at the forefront of the campaign. The agitation echoed loud in Jubbal and Kotkhai too.The farmer was angry over the steady silence maintained by the government. Horticulture minister Mahender Singh‘s and urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj’s statements further infuriated the growers. Both blamed the economy for the losses. Farm unions demanded the government to implement Market Intervention Scheme on the analogy of Kashmir, besides the implementation of the APMC Act. The fruit cultivators also wanted the government to abolish various charges the commission agents were pocketing.Apples are one of the core issues for fruit growers in the by-polls. “Na hum Congress waaley na hum BJP Waley hum hein Seb waley (neither we are Congress nor BJP, we are apple growers),” says Chetan Bragta, an independent candidate who rebelled against BJP after he was denied ticket and party preferred Neelam Saraik over him.Chetan is riding high on sympathy wave after his father Narinder Bragta’s death in June. Bragta, a former horticulture minister, was a popular leader and widely known for his contribution towards apple-growing areas. He was instrumental in introducing anti-hail guns, strengthening the local mandis.“There is no fault of mine, the party did not let me mourn my father’s death. I was asked to be in the field for campaigning, I don’t understand why did they do this to me,” says Chetan whose election symbol is apple.He has come out with a vision document promising more CA stores, fruit processing industries, high-density plantation, setting up horticulture university and promoting orchard tourism in his assembly segment.“Roads and horticulture have always been my priority, the BJP government ignored the apple-growing regions in the last three years. the government should talk about what they did for apples, the main Theog-Hatkoti road, which is the lifeline of apple growing regions, is still incomplete, while the conditions of link roads have gone from bad to worse,” says Rohit Thakur, former MLA, ex-chief parliamentary secretary and grandson of former chief minister Ram Lal Thakur.Thakur lost the last election to BJP’s Narinder Bragta by a margin of 1,062 votes. Rohit’s grandfather Ram Lal Thakur had remained legislator from Jubbal and Kotkhai, seven times and he defeated Virbhadra Singh in 1998. Rohit who himself has been legislator thrice is trying to defend his legacy.Former CM Virbhadra Singh had also remained a three-time MLA from here.On the other hand, BJP’s Neelam Saraik too is raising issues related to apples. “Actually, some people have not been able to tolerate that commoner has been allocated the ticket,” she says. To allure voters, BJP had announced separate sub-divisional magistrate office in Jubbal and Kotkhai and a tehsil and fire station in Kalbogh region.Samyukt Kisan Morcha is opposing the BJP. “Our organisation is non-political but it’s obvious that the farmers will oppose the BJP over farm laws and the impact of these laws is visible everywhere,” says Sanjay Chauhan, former mayor who hails from Kotkhai, co-convenor of SKM.“The cost of production has skyrocketed, while the prices have remained stagnated since 2010. So government must provide MSP as is being given in Kashmir. The government must strictly ensure timely payments. Government must seriously think of implementing universal carton and speed up building cold chain facilities,” says Mahijit Rathore, president of Nawar Valley Apple Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jubbalkotkhai-apple-is-the-flavour-of-the-poll-season-101634663813310.html

Traffic police officials said that the Tigri underpass area at Vijay Nagar will be out of bounds for commuters due to the work. The officials said that all the vehicles from Noida and Greater Noida which come to Ghaziabad using the Tigri roundabout will have to use other route like the one at Shahberi to come to Ghaziabad. “Those vehicles that want to proceed to Delhi, via Ghaziabad, from Noida and Greater Noida will have to use the underpass at the Vijay Nagar bypass and thereafter use the Delhi-Meerut Expressway to travel to Delhi. The expressway lanes will not be closed/diverted during the diversion period. No vehicle will be allowed to use the service road to move to Noida,” said Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic). “Likewise, the traffic coming from Mohan Nagar and Siddharth Vihar will also use the Vijay Nagar bypass to travel to Delhi. The diversion is due to repair works of the Ganga water pipelines and may last till November 10. We have also informed the Noida traffic police about the diversions,” Kushwaha added. The diversions have been announced under the phase 2 (UP Gate to Dasna) of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, the officials said. NHAI officials said that they will try to finish the work before Diwali, that means before November 4. “We are expecting that the work will finish in the next 10 days. Since the new high-capacity water pipelines were laid due to expansion work of the expressway, we need to connect the new pipelines. So, the diversions have been announced for the work to go on smoothly,” said Mudit Garg, project director, NHAI. “The works will also be taken up at Bamheta and Dasna locations, but it will be done later on,” he added. The pipelines bring Ganga water from the Upper Ganga Canal near Dasna and the water is taken to the Pratap Vihar treatment plants from where it is supplied to Ghaziabad and Noida with the help of pipelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-20-day-diversions-announced-on-nh-9-for-pipeline-repair-works-101634663216340.html

19-10-2021||Chandigarh||‘Doing politics over religious issues will make India like Afghanistan, Pak’: Punjab minister||Punjab MLA and state agriculture minister ‘Kaka’ Randeep Singh Nabha on Tuesday said Indian politicians should keep from doing politics over "religious matters" lest the environment in the country becomes like the "one in Afghanistan and Pakistan."“The bravehearts who helped the country achieve independence and gave democracy to the country are constantly being sidelined. The country is being weakened,” he told news agency ANI.He further stated that religious politics creates a “feeling of mistrust and insecurity” among the people. “If this situation continues, then the day is not far when the situation in India will become like Taliban ruled Afghanistan, and Pakistan,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The Congress leader’s remarks come in the aftermath of the gruesome killing of a 35-year-old man from Punjab’s Tarn Taran district at the farmers’ protest site at Delhi’s Singhu border. Identified as Lakhbir Singh, the Dalit man’s body was found hanging from a police barricade with his left arm chopped off. A post-mortem report on Saturday explained that Lakhbir died owing to excessive bleeding and as many as 22 injury marks were found on his body.Watch here| Singhu hand chopping & murder: Watch how Rakesh Tikait described the incidentLakhbir was allegedly murdered for desecrating a Sikh holy book. Three individuals belonging to the Nihang namely Narayan Singh, Bhagwant Singh and Govind Preet Singh, who have claimed responsibility for the killing, were sent to a six-day police custody by a local court in Sonipat on Sunday.Notably, Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma has blamed the farmer union leaders and the opposition parties for the killing of Lakhbir. In a statement, he said that Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait was fanning anti-national sentiments and was giving “provocative speeches” in a desperate bid to advance his political career.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/indian-politicians-must-refrain-from-doing-religious-politics-punjab-minister-101634661207324.html
19-10-2021||Other||Punjab speaker accepts Khaira’s resignation as MLA||Chandigarh Punjab Vidhan Sabha speaker Rana KP Singh on Tuesday accepted the resignation of rebel Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA from Bholath and former leader of opposition Sukhpal Singh Khaira from the state assembly. A notification to this effect was issued by the state assembly, which stated that consequent upon the resignation of Khaira, the Bholath seat has fallen vacant. There will be, however, no by-election as the general assembly polls in the state are less than four months away. Khaira said he had resigned on June 3 before joining the Congress. “The speaker asked me to submit the resignation in the prescribed format, which I did today in person. My resignation has been accepted,” the two-time Bholath legislator said. Khaira had joined the AAP in December 2015 after resigning from the Congress and won the Bholath assembly seat in 2017; he, later, became the leader of opposition in the Punjab assembly. However, he fell out with AAP top brass and led a rebellion following his unceremonious removal as the leader of opposition. He quit the AAP to float his own separate outfit, Punjab Ekta Party (PEP), ahead of the 2019 parliamentary elections. Khaira had first tendered his resignation from the state assembly in April 2019 to contest from the Bathinda Lok Sabha seat which he lost. “I had taken my resignation back at that time because I did not want to oblige the ‘fake revolutionaries’ (AAP) and the people of my constituency to go through the nightmare of byelection. I am with the Congress and will contest from Bholath (in the upcoming polls),” he said. As per the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha, a member can withdraw the resignation any time before it is accepted. Khaira rejoined the Congress with two other MLAs Jagdev Singh Kamalu and Pirmal Singh Khalsa who had revolted against the AAP leadership to protest against the former’s removal from the position of leader of opposition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-speaker-accepts-khaira-s-resignation-as-mla-101634661773410.html

19-10-2021||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai becomes first city in MMR with 100% first vaccination dose against Covid||Navi Mumbai has become the first city in the MMR region to have all its citizens over 18 years of age vaccinated with the first dose of Covid vaccine. The city is racing towards full vaccination with Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) reporting that more than half the population has also taken the second dose.In all, 11,07,233 residents have taken the first dose of Covid vaccine, giving the city 100.02% vaccination rate amongst those over 18 years of age, according to NMMC. Of these 5,76,567 have also taken the second dose, i.e. 52.08% of the eligible population.Said municipal commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, “It is certainly very comforting, especially in view of the third wave threat. We had gone all out with our efforts and active participation of the residents to complete the vaccination to avoid the third wave or at least to reduce the impact.“September and October have been landmark months with more than 3.5 lakh doses being given in just a month and a half. We ensured that more vaccination centres were opened so that they were close to the residences. In case of shortages, we ensured a balance of first and second dose. Those above 45 years of age were given preference initially.“We identified the super-spreader categories and vaccinated them and also facilitated the vaccination of seriously ill patients in their homes. There was constant review of the situation amongst all officials and departments.”On the plans ahead, Bangar said, “Fortunately, the third wave has been extended. We are confident that we will complete the second dose as well soon. The availability of doses is not an issue any more. The only restraint is that there is a gap of 84 days. We will complete it as soon as the residents are eligible.”Appealing to the residents, he said, “We should not get complacent as there are news reports that a third wave will not come. I still believe that it will come, it is just a matter of time. Of course, the severity can be less due to vaccination.“We should try to totally avoid it. Why take a chance? Take all precautions and efforts to postpone it as far as possible. Our vaccination drive for not just the second dose but also the first will continue in view of the presence of a floating population in Navi Mumbai.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-becomes-first-city-in-mmr-with-100-first-vaccination-dose-against-covid-101634661123659.html
19-10-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees 4th straight day of fewer than 2,000 Covid-19 cases||In view of the decline in Covid-19 cases, the Maharashtra government has extended the timings of restaurants and eateries till 12am, while shops have been allowed to function till 11pm from Tuesday onwards. In addition, all preparations are being made for colleges, which are slated to open from Wednesday. Till now, all hotels and shops had to pull their shutters down by 10pm.Following the order of the Maharashtra government, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) also gave a green light for this move. Meanwhile, restaurants and eateries can continue with delivery of food round-the-clock.Maharashtra, for the fourth consecutive day, recorded fewer than 2,000 Covid-19 cases (1,638) on Tuesday.The state government, in its notification, defended the extension, citing the upcoming Diwali season. “In the wake of the upcoming festival season, it is now felt that restrictions imposed on times of functioning for various establishments such as shops, restaurants, hotels, among others, will lead to more crowds in the shorter duration they are currently allowed to function,” cited the notification. It, however, said that all other Covid-19 restrictions will continue to remain.Hotels and restaurant associations welcomed the move, but are not entirely happy with easing of restrictions. “The additional two hours will provide much-needed succour to the beleaguered hospitality industry. Our sector was the worst affected by Covid-19 restrictions. However, we wish extensions were granted till the pre-Covid deadline of 1.30am,” said Pradeep Shetty, senior vice- president, Hotel & Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI). Similar is the stance of Shivanand Shetty, president, Indian Hotels and Restaurants Association, (AHAR), one of the leading association of hoteliers. “We have almost come to normalcy and hence the original timings should be restored quickly,” said Shetty.The Chamber of Association of Maharashtra Industries and Trade (CAMIT), which represents the manufacturers and shopkeepers, have welcomed the extension. “It’s good that the state government is gradually opening up as there is still a threat of a third wave,” said Mohan Gurnani, chairman, CAMIT.On Monday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had held a series of meetings, including with the members of the Covid-19 task force, to decide further easing of restrictions, in line with the decline in the number of Covid-19 cases.The state government has also decided to ease the restrictions further as amusement parks, auditoriums and theatres will be opened from October 22.Mumbai’s tally of new cases was 314, along with four deaths, thus bringing its toll to 16,188.

19-10-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena headed UD dept restarts double increment for BMC staff with Masters in Marathi||In an apparent move to play the Marathi card ahead of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation elections, the Shiv Sena-headed urban development department cleared a proposal to restart the policy to give two additional increments to BMC employees who have completed their post-graduation in Marathi subject. UDD minister Eknath Shinde cleared the proposal of the BMC on Monday. The decision by the department will benefit 1,489 BMC employees and would put a burden of ₹52.63 lakh on the civic body. The double increments were given out since 2011 to promote the use of and encourage studying Marathi language. They had stopped since 2015 after the sixth pay commission came into force, increasing the financial burden on the civic body. Sena legislator Sunil Prabhu, who was following up on the proposal, said he had written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and sought intervention from environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray on the issue. “The proposal was cleared on March 9, 2011, but its implementation was stopped in 2015. At that time, the standing committee had stated that it should be extended till the academic year 2018. This proposal was pending with the government since 2018. Now with this decision, over 1,400 employees will benefit from this decision,” Prabhu said. This is the second such decision to push Marathi language after CM Uddhav Thackeray fast-tracked construction of Marathi Bhasha Bhavan at Marine Drive in Mumbai instead of Navi Mumbai. The Marathi language department is also headed by the Shiv Sena.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-headed-ud-dept-restarts-double-increment-for-bmc-staff-with-masters-in-marathi-101634660872871.html
19-10-2021||Mumbai||Arbitrator cannot pass ex-parte orders without issuing notices to parties: Bombay high court||Observing that an arbitrator cannot pass ex-parte orders without issuing notices to parties to the dispute before it, the Bombay high court (HC) has struck down an arbitral order against Godrej Properties. Justice GS Kulkarni said sections 18, 19 and 24 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, mandate that in the conduct of arbitral proceedings parties are not only treated with equality but each party “shall be” given full opportunity to present its case. “This would be more imperative when the parties are already before the arbitral tribunal,” said justice Kulkarni while striking down the October 8 order passed by the sole arbitrator on an interim application filed by Goldbricks Infrastructure Private Ltd., the other party to the commercial arbitration which had staked certain claims against Godrej Properties. Goldbricks Infrastructure had last year moved HC. The court had referred the commercial dispute for arbitration to a retired Chief Justice of India. Both the sides had filed applications for certain interim measures, and acting on such a plea filed by Goldbricks Infrastructure, the arbitrator had on October 8 restrained Godrej Properties from dealing with or creating any third party rights in unsold flats and other units of Residential Zone –II. Godrej Properties had moved HC, challenging the ex-parte order, claiming that the order was passed by the arbitrator without even issuing a notice to them, which the arbitrator could not have done. Justice Kulkarni accepted the argument advanced on behalf of Godrej Properties. The single-judge bench said Section 24 (2) mandates that the parties “shall be” given sufficient advance notice of any hearing and this would include hearings for ad-interim, interim or final orders. “In my opinion, the provisions certainly make it incumbent upon the arbitral tribunal to give sufficient notice of any hearing to the parties before it,” said the court. “If this is what is plainly reflected from the said provisions of the Act, it would be unknown to law and quite peculiar for an arbitral tribunal to pass an ex-parte ad-interim order, on the mere filing of a section 17 application, without hearing even the party making the application, much less the contesting respondent,” justice Kulkarni added, referring to the fact that the sole arbitrator had not even heard Goldbricks Infrastructure before passing of the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/arbitrator-cannot-pass-ex-parte-orders-without-issuing-notices-to-parties-bombay-high-court-101634660812800.html
19-10-2021||Mumbai||2 weeks after reopening schools no spike in Covid cases among kids in Mumbai: BMC||Over two weeks after the reopening of schools in the city, no spike has been reported in the number of Covid-19 cases among children. However, the city has recorded a marginal drop in the number of cases. According to the data, between September 14 and 30, 1,024 cases were reported in the 0-19 age group that went down to 732 cases between October 1 and 17.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has, starting October 4, allowed the reopening of schools for Class 8 to 12. Further, starting from today, colleges also have been allowed to remain open. However, colleges have been asked to have lectures in staggered time format, and students and staff members have been asked to remain vaccinated.However, in the case of those below the age of 18 years, a vaccine is yet to roll out. As of October 17, 50,246 cases of Covid-19 have been reported in the 0 to 19 age group, of which 14,090 cases are in the 0 to 9 age group, followed by 36,156 in the 10 to 19 age group.In terms of fatality, the 0 to 9 age group has reported 19 deaths till now followed by 41 in the 10 to 19 years of age group.Further, a fall has been reported in other age groups also. According to the data, in the age group of 20 to 29, 1,005 cases were reported between October 1 to 17. In the same age group, between September 14 and 30, 1,375 cases were reported.In the age group of 30 to 39, during the same period cases went down from 1,925 to 1,210. In the age group of 40 to 49, cases went down from 1,627 to 1,136. Similarly, in age groups above 50 years of age also went down from 3,926 cases to 3,021 cases.According to BMC officials, there is no spike reported yet, but it will be too early to conclude that there will not be any spike in the case of children or adults. Earlier, in the last week of June, the BMC’s sero survey on children had revealed that more than 50% of the paediatric populace in Mumbai had antibodies against Covid-19. The survey among the 1-18 years age group was to gauge the prevalence of the virus among the young population. The overall sero positivity rate is 51.18%.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC said, “Over two weeks have passed but no spike is reported when it comes to Covid-19 cases in children. It could be due to high level of antibodies present, but at the same time we are ready to vaccinate around three million children. Our current strength of vaccinated centres will be sufficient to roll out vaccination for children once the vaccines are made available by the government.”Apart from the reopening of schools and colleges, the BMC has also given several other relaxation in the month of October including reopening of religious places, theatres, auditoriums followed by increasing operational hours for shops and restaurants. Owing to these relaxations, the BMC has maintained that the period till November 20, 2021, will remain crucial.Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the Covid-19 task force, Maharashtra said, “In general, across all age groups including those of children, the cases are on the decline. This is partially maybe because we do not have any new variant of concern. Also, a significant number of children already have Covid-19 antibodies. Hence, we should wait for proper vaccines for children to be rolled out.”Dr Joshi added, “For adults, the vaccination is already going on at a good pace. Despite these factors, we will need to be careful and cautious. In this, unvaccinated and partially vaccinated citizens have to be more careful.”On Monday, Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar had said that the BMC is ready to vaccinate over three million population of children. However, it is awaiting vaccine and its guidelines to be rolled out by the Central government.Meanwhile, on Tuesday 314 cases were reported followed by four deaths taking the case tally to 752,344 and toll to 16,188. The city’s recovery rate is 96% with 728,138 recoveries followed by fatality rate being 2.15%. There are 5,521 active cases in the city. On Tuesday, 57,660 citizens were vaccinated. In the city, 13,572,771 doses have been administered so far and 4,923,773 citizens are fully vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/2-weeks-after-reopening-schools-no-spike-in-covid-cases-among-kids-in-mumbai-bmc-101634660753229.html

Around 300 houses were still to be removed and over 50% of these were demolished on Tuesday, officials said.Yashpal Yadav, the commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF), said, “We started removing the illegal squatters on Monday and we are aiming to complete the work by Thursday. Around 300 houses are being demolished, of which almost 50% of the work has been done. During this drive, we are removing makeshift houses of people who stayed back after the initial demolition drive and also demolishing half broken houses from the last time.”Earlier, Yadav had said that residents living in Khori are those who were allowed to stay back upon requesting officials that they be allowed to collect and sell the construction and demolition waste.“Now, if anyone wants to take the construction and demolition waste, then they will have to take special permission from us before going,” Yadav said.About 6,600 dwelling units in Khori village were razed by the MCF over the last few months as the illegal colony was encroaching 150 acres of Aravalli forest land. On June 7, the Supreme Court fixed a six-week deadline to remove the 6,600 structures in the Khori Gaon colony.The court directed MCF to act without exception against all unauthorised structures on forest land. However, demolition of illegal farmhouses and banquet halls on Aravalli land hit a hurdle, as owners had approached the Supreme Court seeking relief, claiming that their structures had come up after the state government had amended the norms in 2019, which was immediately put on hold by the top court in March 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/aravalli-demolition-mcf-starts-wrapping-up-demolition-of-khori-gaon-101634660692758.html

We have a 30-bed dengue ward along with a functional neonatal intensive care unit (ICU) and our paediatrics ICU will also be functional by end of this month.” He said that residents should look out for symptoms of bleeding and rashes, besides fever and cold, and seek professional help at the earliest. According to the daily dengue and malaria bulletin issued by the district administration on Tuesday, a total of 12,738 notices have been issued in the district so far for larvae breeding. On Tuesday, larvae breeding was found in 186 houses across the district. Doctors from the Civil Hospital in Sector 10 said that in the past week, at least 50 patients suffering from fever were admitted to the hospital. “In the past week, at least 50 patients with fever and thrombocytopenia (a condition where one has low blood platelet count) have been admitted to the hospital, along with regular cases of fever in the OPD. Cases of dengue are usually reported until Diwali, but with rain continuing, more cases are likely to be reported this season. After Sunday’s rain, not much waterlogging was reported from roads but as water gets accumulated in households, there is still a chance for mosquito breeding,” a senior doctor with the internal medicine department of Civil Hospital said. Experts said that patients should seek medical help immediately as platelet count can drop rapidly. Dr Rajesh Kumar, a senior consultant with the internal medicine department of Paras Hospital, said, “Dengue cases multiplies during rainy season because the weather conditions and temperature become conducive for the growth of the mosquitoes. It has been seen that patients who get infected in the month of October or November get severe infection and the chances of ICU admissions also increase. The cross reaction that happens between the types of dengue make the condition of the patient serious, resulting in more severe drop in platelets and fluid presence in stomach and chest. If the patient doesn’t get timely medical intervention, it can cause death as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dengue-hospitals-gear-up-to-handle-rise-in-cases-after-heavy-rain-101634660635260.html

After two applications were rejected, the authority has written to the power utility company, Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN), seeking a power connection at the earliest.Officials of the DHBVN said that the first two applications were declined due to lack of documentation and complete information, and that the third application is currently under process and its review will be expedited.At present, the NHAI is using diesel generator sets to power the lights in the underpass.The Sirhaul underpass near Ambience Mall helps city residents to avoid going to Rajokri in Delhi to take a U-turn to reach Ambience Mall and DLF Phase-3, which would also reduce congestion at the border. The underpass was scheduled to open on October 15 but it was delayed because of pending work.In a letter to the DHBVN on October 14, Nirman Jambulkar, project director, NHAI, said, “It is submitted that during the recent site inspection, it was observed that the underpass at above location has been substantially completed and is almost ready for being made operational. However, in the absence electric connection, to be released by DHBVN, the said underpass can’t be put to public use. Considering the importance of the project being monitored at the highest level by central and state government, it is requested that the electricity connection may be released by DHBVN immediately.”A DHBVN spokesperson, however, said that the application submitted by the NHAI contractor in January was incomplete and the same was intimated through a letter. In the case of the second application, the DHBVN had sought a consent letter from the contractor for setting up a transformer at the site and payment thereof. However, the consent letter was not submitted, as a result of which the application was declined.“The third application was submitted on October 8 and it is being processed on priority and if the documentation is complete, the connection will be released at the earliest. Since this is a government connection and pertains to infrastructure, the department will ensure it is cleared on priority,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/nhai-seeks-power-connection-for-ambience-mall-underpass-on-priority-101634660634001.html

Sampling for the survey will be done on October 25-26 and results will be declared by November 1.”Officials said that preparation for the survey will be completed by October 22 by the district health department after which fieldwork for collecting samples will start. The testing of samples will be done between October 27 and 29.In the third serological survey, the Faridabad district reported the lowest seropositivity at 64.2%. In urban areas of the district, the seropositivity was found to be 64.1% while in rural areas, it was 64.2%. In the Faridabad district, 1,320 samples were collected for the survey conducted in September this year.Dr Vinay Gupta, the chief medical officer of Faridabad district, said, “In the CLIA test (the type of serological test done by the health department this time) conducted for the sero survey, if results are above 0.3, then it is considered positive but if the result is below 0.2, then it is negative. In the samples collected from our district, results of 14% samples were between 0.2-0.3, which is why the survey will be conducted again.”Gupta said that the survey is being conducted again as the current seropositivity of 64.2% is based only on results 86% of the samples. “As results for 14% of the population were inconclusive, we cannot say for sure that the current seroprevalence is correct. It can be possible that whole of the 14% of the population have antibodies developed or partially. As it is a big number of the sample size, the survey has to be conducted again,” he said. A serological survey finds the level of antibodies that may have been developed either after an infection or being vaccinated. The results will help the department plan strategies and assess their preparedness for the third wave of Covid-19. In the third sero survey, children were included for the first time to assess the level of immunity in this vulnerable and unexposed cohort.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/third-sero-survey-faridabad-to-be-tested-again-due-to-14-inconclusive-results-101634660632785.html
19-10-2021||Mumbai||Think of children as a reservoir of Covid-19 virus: Expert||Children can be potential reservoirs of the Sars-CoV-2 and vaccinating them becomes a public health imperative, according to Indian virologist Dr T Jacob John. The senior medical expert emphasised prioritising the Covid-19 vaccine for children between 12 to 18 years in order to minimise the virus transmission and risk of emergence of new variants by mutations. “We have underestimated the epidemic among children as they are not falling sick so much, but we must think of children as a reservoir of the virus,” said John. He was speaking at an online session organised by the Indian Academy of Paediatrics on Tuesday evening. He cited a study by researchers at the Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) that confirmed that children are capable of carrying and replicating the Sar-CoV-2. The study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases included 110 Covid-19 patients aged two weeks to 21 years. While the researchers did not find a correlation between viral load and severity of the disease in kids, they said that it was a misconception that children, who are mostly asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, are less infectious. John suggested that the government should prioritise children in the age group of 12 to 18 as a pilot and then open the vaccination for much younger children. India’s epidemic stage is over “India has reached the end of the epidemic phase of Covid-19, and is in an endemic phase which will be a long haul,” said John. “Paediatric vaccination will play a crucial role in keeping the Covid-19 numbers in the endemic stage,” he said. Navi Mumbai-based Paediatrician Dr Vijay Yewale, who is a former president of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics, said that the Covid-19 trend among children has been that of mild disease. “We see Covid-related complications very rarely among children,” he said, adding that it is likely that the government will open paediatric vaccination only for children with comorbidities at first. John cited his observations of the past 16 weeks during which the number of cases in India has been steady without any upswings. In addition, the latest serological survey by the Indian Council of Medical Research has shown 70% sensitivity. “At least 95% of the population has antibodies, considering all the factors,” he said, adding that barring some states like Kerala, Mizoram, Meghalaya and Sikkim, India is in an endemic phase. John predicts that a third wave is unlikely in the current circumstances, but if it hits, the timing will be sometime mid- 2022 or the last quarter of 2022. “India’s endemic phase is likely to be influenced by re-infections. But we can forget about the third wave for the time being. If at all the third wave hits, it will be because of a new variant which does not acknowledge our existing immunity,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/think-of-children-as-a-reservoir-of-covid-19-virus-expert-101634660514029.html

The drug was worth ₹30 lakh in Delhi, the arrested smugglers, identified as Jogan Ram of Latehar and Noorani Bibi of Palamu, told police.Rohtas SP Ashish Bharti said that police and intelligence officers have been interrogating the arrested smugglers to know the kingpins and white-collared persons behind the illegal narcotics trade. On September 22, the officials at Aurangabad had seized 97 kgs of Doda powder worth ₹77 lakh from a tribal man and an 18-year-old girl of Palamu. They confessed to coming to Aurangabad to board a Delhi bound train to hand over the consignment in Delhi.On June 9, Gaya police had seized 112 kgs of Doda powder worth ₹90 lakh from an auto-rickshaw near Dobhi on GT Road (NH 2). The consignment was to be loaded on a Delhi-bound bus.Opium and Doda powder were also seized from smugglers in Gumla and some other districts of Jharkhand in recent months. The contraband drug, often called ‘the poor man’s heroin’, is a narcotic derived from the opium poppy and is in high demand for making Ayurvedic and Unani medicines as well as used by addicts in the national capital, Noida and Gurugram. Some so-called Hakims also used the powder for making medicines, an official said.Opium is cultivated under Maoist’s protection in their dominated areas in remote hilly Gaya and Aurangabad districts of south Bihar and bordering Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. Drug smuggling is a good source of their earning.Police and security agencies working in the region to finish the economic resources of Maoists often destroy the poppy cultivation in these districts. But it is very difficult to locate the cultivation in dense hilly forests in the unapproachable terrain.Licensed growers have to destroy Doda after extracting the Opium. But due to the lack of monitoring of the destruction process by the government, smugglers are earning crores by buying Doda from the farmers at cheap rates, said an official..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gt-road-grand-chord-rail-line-safe-haven-for-smuggling-drugs-to-delhi-101634660332716.html

According to the FIR (first information report) lodged by the police on October 12 on a complaint by senior JMM legislator Ramdas Soren, Ravi Kejriwal offered him money and other benefits if he was willing to help bring down the government. Kejriwal, a former treasurer of JMM, was suspended from the party in August last year. Ranchi’s senior superintendent of police Surendra Kumar Jha said, “An FIR has been registered with the Dhurwa police station. The matter is being investigated. Further action would be taken accordingly.” Ramdas Soren told Hindustan Times on Tuesday that he had filed his complaint through his personal assistant on October 9 and the FIR was registered on October 12. Sources said the case has been registered under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Prevention of Corruption Act. Hatia additional superintendent of police Vineet Kumar has been made investigating officer in the case. Ramdas said he was Kejriwal came to his his official residence a few weeks back and offered him money and a ministerial berth if he breaks away and helps BJP form a new government. He said he filed the complaint after informing his party’s senior leadership.“Being from the same party, we have known each other for long. Kejriwal came to my official residence in Dhurwa along with another person, Ashok Agrawal, whom I don’t know. He said he was in touch with other legislators as well. I told him in clear terms he was knocking on wrong doors,” the MLA from Ghatshila said. Kejriwal could not be contacted. On July 25 this year, Ranchi police had arrested three persons, Abhishek Dubey, Amit Singh and Niwaran Prasad Mahto, for allegedly conspiring to overthrow the coalition government of the JMM, Congress and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) in Jharkhand. They were arrested on a complaint by Congress MLA from Bermo, Anup Singh alias Kumar Jaimangal.

The police, however, are yet to file charge sheet in the case. Ranchi SSP said investigation in the case was still on. JMM, BJP trade fireReacting to the fresh case, JMM said they are not surprised by the “dirty tricks” of the BJP, which, in turn, described the new case as a diversionary tactic by the Soren government. “Who all are involved would be known only after police investigation. However, BJP started its dirty tricks the day the Soren government came to power. State BJP leaders often make statements that this government would fall soon. How? They should explain that,” said JMM spokesperson Manoj Pandey. Jharkhand BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said, “This government has a knack for coming up with such conspiracy theories every few months. Similar allegations were made few months back. What happened in that case, nobody knows. This government has failed to deliver on electoral promises. Whenever they are cornered over any issue or there are rumblings within the alliance, they come up with such diversionary tactics. And this time, the allegation is against their own leader,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/exjmm-treasurer-booked-for-bid-to-lure-party-mla-pull-down-soren-govt-101634659852987.html

The state’s farmers have been protesting against Singla for allegedly being opposed to their interests. The training was meant to apprise farmers of new techniques and processes in farming and new avenues they could take up. The farmers raised slogans and held a protest on Dhuri road. The protesters alleged that the department did not inform them about the lecture of Singla in advance. “Farmers reached in their 100s to attend the camp. However, when we saw the minister, we boycotted the camp and opposed the presence of Singla. Farmers are not getting payment of sugarcane dues and the debt on Punjab is increasing day by day. But the minister wanted political mileage,” said Sarabjit Singh, former sarpanch of Alal village.Sangrur chief agriculture officer Jaswinderpal Singh Grewal said that over 1,000 farmers participated in the camp, but just about 100 ‘politically-backed’ among them opposed the minister.Singla said that farmers would not face shortage of DAP fertiliser in the state.

These colleges were found flouting norms by either not appointing a principal or not getting this position approved; there were also issues and irregularities in the appointment of faculty members. The norms for these have to be in line with the ones that the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) and the university issue. The first counselling for admission to BEd courses in colleges across the state is going to begin from October 21.Varsity’s dean (colleges) Gurpreet Singh Lehal said under the NCTE guidelines, for an intake of 100 students in the BEd course, there is a requirement of 16 full-time faculty members, including a regular principal. “The selection of at least 10 faculty members, including the principal, should be approved by the university. For the past many years, these colleges have not recruited any University-approved faculty member and principal despite many reminders and warnings that the university issued to them,” Lehal said, adding that after the last warning in August, these colleges had assured the varsity of appointing an approved principal and the minimum required faculty by October 15.“For BEd second year and for MEd courses in these colleges, students continue to suffer as well. We have now strictly instructed these institutions to appoint the minimum required faculty and principal, after following all norms and approval, within two months,” the dean added.The colleges debarred from admission include Bhagwati College of Education (Mansa); GN College of Education, Guru Nanak College of Education for Girls (Samao); Guru Tegh Bahadur College of Education (Dalelwala); Malwa College of Education (Kotkapura); Malwa College of Education, (Sardulewala); Sai College of Education (Lehragaga); Shiva College of Education; Swami Dayanand College of Education (Bhucho Mandi); Universal College of Education and Vidya Sagar College of Education (Fatehpur).SPECIAL USE OF TECHNOLOGY TO CHECK GHOST FACULTYLehal added Punjabi University has started using a special software to bring transparency and efficiency in the working of the college development council. “All affiliated colleges have been instructed to display detailed faculty information with photographs, with other information such as infrastructure, time table and facilities for students and faculty on their official website,” he said, adding that a comprehensive database of faculty members of all affiliated colleges of the university will be developed.“The database will also be useful in mitigating the menace of ‘ghost faculty’, which refers to teachers who simply do not exist or exist in two or more colleges simultaneously,” he said.

The service charge on all RWS schemes will be reduced by 70% from Rs.166 to Rs.50 per household per month in the villages worth 440 crores.Channi also said that that his government would provide free power to all rural water supply (RWS), and reduce the service charges on all RWS schemes by 70% from existing ₹166 to ₹50 per household every month in the villages.On Monday, Channi burnt copies of power bills in Punjab's Chamkaur Sahib in a symbolic gesture to announce the waiver.We Promised and We DeliveredThe waiver of unpaid electricity payments has commenced, as promised to the people of Punjab. The resolution to waive the arrears of all Punjab users with a 2 KW load has been put into effect today by burning copies of these bills. pic.twitter.com/TDLKZyMZLD“We Promised and We Delivered. The waiver of unpaid electricity payments has commenced, as promised to the people of Punjab. The resolution to waive the arrears of all Punjab users with a 2 KW load has been put into effect today by burning copies of these bills,” Channi wrote on Twitter.The Punjab government last month announced to waive off the outstanding bills of domestic electricity consumers with up to 2kW load usage. The government said move will cost the state exchequer around ₹1,200 crore.The decision by the Congress-led government in Punjab is seen a move to woo the electorate of the state ahead of assembly elections in 2022.The Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal, whose party has decided to contest the assembly elections in Punjab, announced round-the-clock electricity supply in the state if voted to power in the 2022 polls. Kejriwal also announced to provide 300 units of free electricity to every household and promised to write off pending bills of domestic consumers.Calling the power crisis in Punjab “man-made”, Kejriwal said the problem can be resolved by upgrading the transmission system. “We faced a similar problem in Delhi during our initial years in government. We changed the transmission system, and the situation has improved to the point that people don’t buy inverters now,” Kejriwal was quoted as saying in a report published in Hindustan Times.In a separate decision, the Channi cabinet tweaked the existing policy of outsourcing Group D employees, and said that they would be recruited on a regular basis. “If the officers are permanent recruits, then the recruitment for class D would also be on the same pattern. An initiative towards creating just & fair Governance,” he posted on Twitter.The Punjab chied minister further said the state government is already in the process of finalising a policy to safeguard the interest of such employees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/after-electricity-channi-govt-in-punjab-waives-off-pending-water-bills-101634653782727.html

19-10-2021||Lucknow||Cong to give 40% tickets to women in UP polls, says Priyanka||LUCKNOW Looking to consolidate its support base in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress on Tuesday announced that it would give 40% tickets to women in the UP assembly elections slated for early next year.The party, which could win only seven seats in the 403-member UP house in 2017 polls, had decided to put its bet on women in the UP elections.“The Congress will give 40% tickets to women in the forthcoming UP elections,” said Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi while speaking to media persons at the UP Congress Committee (UPCC) headquarters with ‘Ladki hoon, lad sakti hoon’ (I am a girl, I can fight) slogans painted in the backdrop. The AICC national general secretary and in charge of party affairs in Uttar Pradesh said the decision was aimed at making women, who constitute roughly half the vote bank, a “full-fledged partner in power.”The announcement by the Congress leader was greeted with the bursting of firecrackers and slogan-shouting by women workers who were watching the press conference on a large screen installed in the party office. Priyanka called upon women to join politics to change the “politics in Uttar Pradesh” and said applications for tickets would be accepted till November 15. “This decision is for every woman who wants to bring about a change, fight for justice and work for unity and development. Only women can bring about a change because they have compassion, they are firm and they have the power. We promise to ensure full participation of women in the state’s politics,” she said. Whether the Congress would extend the same (40% tickets to women) to the national level or other states, Priyanka said she was the general secretary in-charge of UP and it was for other state units to take a call on the issue. The Congress leader said if she had her way, the reservation for women candidates in distribution of party tickets may have been 50%. The AICC general secretary tasked with regaining the party’s lost ground in the political heartland, however, was non-committal about contesting the upcoming state polls herself. “It has not been decided as yet,” she quipped in response to a question on the possibility of her contesting the polls.About leaders seeking tickets for their wives or other family members, she said: “What is the harm if people want tickets for their wives or other women of their family? When they fight elections, they get empowered.” Priyanka Gandhi also used the occasion to target the BJP government on Lakhimpur Kheri incident where eight people, including four farmers, died recently. “This government shows how it can protect those who crush people. This is wrong,” she said. Referring to all women she met over the past two years, including police women who detained her in Sitapur, Priyanka said: “It was pitch dark in Sitapur. I was surrounding by the police including women cops. I also argued with them. They asked me to sit in a jeep and took me to Sitapur police lines. One of them was Madhu and the other was Pooja. They were on duty till 4am. This decision (40% tickets for women) is for them as well.” Asked whether the party would be able to get women candidates, she said: “Yes, we will get candidates and they will contest the election. If they don’t get sufficient strength this time, they will get it next time. We will help them fight the election.” “This is a good move. Every political party should follow it. The decision, if followed by other parties too, will bring about a social change and discipline to politics,” said Professor SK Dwivedi, former head of department, political science, Lucknow University. “The Congress has never worked for women and is now talking about 40% reservation for them only in view of UP assembly elections,” said Chandra Mohan, spokesman, UP BJP. BJP MP and former UPCC president Rita Bahuguna Joshi said the Congress did not have any consideration for women and she felt humiliated when she was in the Congress. BSP chief Mayawati described the announcement as “pure election drama.” “The Congress remembers women, Dalits and backwards only when it is out of power. When in power, it could have brought a law for 33% reservation for women in Parliament and state assemblies,” she tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/cong-to-give-40-tickets-to-women-in-up-polls-says-priyanka-101634654512253.html

19-10-2021||Chandigarh||How Forky made her way into my house, and heart||God knows from where she arrived and settled herself in the roadside garden of our corner house in the lane. The cries emanating from her hunger pangs caught my daughter’s attention, and she went outside to look for the source. She discovered it to be an abandoned, lean and fragile puppy. Taking fancy to the little creature, she brought milk in an earthen bowl for her. As they say, whatever your birthplace, you gravitate to the place where you finally settle. The puppy came in as a young, perhaps six months old; and took refuge in our garden. She adjusted herself in this place as if it was destined for her. Just into her 11th grade, and confined indoors because of the Covid pandemic, my daughter spent her free time with her. My better-half and she named her Forky. Though Forky was protected by the garden grills, they often came out to shoo away the stray dogs who dared to bark at her. I’m sure animals understand the language of love, that’s why she stayed on with us. Forky’s presence affected the life of our 10-year-old Labrador, who couldn’t make out why he had suddenly lost the undivided attention of the family. He would often bark when we served her food as if it was out of his share. Thankfully, he didn’t do her any harm, and they signed a tacit peace accord between themselves within a few days. But it was me who always found her reprehensible. Perhaps Forky was too thin and freaky, or she was a street dog; whatever the reason, she didn’t fit my description of a pet. For one full year, I couldn’t tolerate her presence. Initially, I tried to shoo her away whenever my daughter wasn’t around. But invariably, I had to back down as her stern voice came out of nowhere, reminding me to stay put. I often told her, Forky was her sister from a previous birth. However, she didn’t seem to mind my poking as long as her favourite wasn’t touched or shooed. As she grew up, Forky became our best defence against any intruder. She was a better bet than any doorbell or CCTV camera. Her incessant shrill barking was a foolproof alarm for someone’s presence at the gate. In charge of opening and closing the locks of the house, every morning I would see her sticking her nose in between the logs of our gate. Customarily, I would shoo her, but then one day, I just opened the gate and allowed her to come onto our veranda. I realised; it wasn’t just an entry to my house; it was as much an entry into my heart. I don’t know when and how this change of heart happened. Probably it was her persistence, despite my snubs, that did the trick. For the first time, I could feel the power of endurance in relationships. I wondered how as humans we distance ourselves from others over paltry matters, pledging never to cross paths with them. I guess we need to learn from the animals how to make a place in someone’s heart. If we just learnt this basic lesson of persistence, the rift in our relationships, the rising divorce rate in our families would drop. She taught me, if we were a little more tolerant and hung on despite the adversities, it’s just a matter of time before we end up in everlasting togetherness. vikasdeepak23@gmail.com The writer is an Ambala-based prosthodontist||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/how-forky-made-her-way-into-my-house-and-heart-101634648211794.html

Police, however, brought the situation under control.Mondal and Goswami had faced a similar situation in Bamanhat area on Monday.BJP alleged that the incidents were engineered to prevent the party candidate from campaigning.The by-election to Dinhata assembly constituency was necessitated by the resignation of Nisith Pramanik, winning candidate and Minister of State for Home Affairs, who retained his Lok Sabha seat.The TMC renominated Udayan Guha, who had lost to Pramanik.Besides Dinhata, by-elections will also be held in Santipur (Nadia), Gosaba (South 24 Parganas) and Khardah (North 24 Parganas).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-bypolls-bjp-candidate-mla-heckled-in-coochbehar-party-accuses-tmc-101634647171021.html
19-10-2021||Patna||Ground realities cannot be learnt from one’s drawing room: RJD’s swipe at Congress in Bihar||With the campaigning for by-polls to two seats in Bihar gaining intensity, a war of words has broken out between the Congress and RJD with RJD’s Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Jha on Tuesday launching a scathing attack against Congress in-charge of the state Bhakta Charan Das alleging the latter has ‘no knowledge of state’s politics’ and ‘cannot know ground realities by sitting in a drawing room’. Jha’s comments come a day after Das had made a strong accusation against the RJD of digressing from the long fight of upholding secularism and fighting communalism and reaching an understanding with those ‘forces’ against whom both the Congress and Left have been fighting for long. “I feel, the RJD has had an understanding with those forces against whom we have been fighting though the party is not coming out in the open. This is a game-plan. In the days to come, they will go with those forces. After all, it is clear the RJD does not need the support of 19 Congress MLAs. It means, they have got support of other forces,” Das had told the media. Asked whether he implied that RJD was in an understanding with the BJP and could join hands with the saffron party, Das asserted it was clear the RJD did not need Congress support having decided to contest both Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan seats. “If the RJD wanted to form government, they would have needed 19 MLAs. It means, RJD is getting support from the party against whom we all had come together to form the Grand Alliance,” the Congress in-charge said. Das, a former MP, also had slammed the RJD for breaching the coalition dharma saying that the Grand Alliance would have been intact had RJD respected the Congress demand for being allotted the Kusheshwar Asthan seat , which has traditionally been the party’s stronghold. Admittedly, the RJD on Tuesday countered Das point to point with the party’s national spokesperson in a media interaction calling Das’s statement of “RJD having an internal understanding with the BJP” as laughable and unfortunate. “The Congress-in charge of Bihar does not have any knowledge of social economic and political history of the state or RJD’s sacrifices. Becoming the party’s in-charge does not mean destroying the party,” Jha said. On Congress’s accusation that RJD had strayed from its ideology of secularism, Jha said the Das should know that it was RJD chief Lalu Prasad who had the guts to stop BJP patriarch L K Advani’s Rath Yatra in 1990 in Samastipur. “There were many Congresses chief ministers but nobody showed the guts or courage to stop the Rath. It was Lalu Prasad who had the courage to stop Advani in Bihar. Before making any comment, first turn the mirror towards yourself,” Jha said, emphasizing that RJD’s secular credentials cannot be doubted as it had relentlessly fought against communal forces and made sacrifices to oppose the BJP. The RJD MP also refuted Das’s allegation that the principal opposition party had breached the coalition dharma. “RJD has fulfilled coalition dharma with Congress at all times staying behind at good and bad times especially during its bad times. RJD is doing its coalition dharma by making all efforts to defeat the JD(U)-BJP coalition in the by-polls and we shall accomplish that. But I will urge you (Das) to gain some knowledge of politics of the state. By sitting in the drawing room, you cannot understand ground realities of the state,” Jha said, taking a pot-shot at the Congress leader. The hostility between Congress and RJD, both having contested along with the Left as part of the Grand Alliance in 2020 assembly polls, was triggered with the RJD deciding to contest both the Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan seats in the by-polls to be held on October 30. Congress too has fielded its candidates from both the seats though the grand old party has called RJD’s unilateral decision as a violation of coalition dharma. The Congress party’s state leaders have become vocal against the RJD recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/ground-realities-cannot-be-learnt-from-one-s-drawing-room-rjd-s-swipe-at-congress-in-bihar-101634644671506.html

Mandakini Khadse is also here. We are following court orders and will cooperate in the investigation,” advocate Mohan Tekavade told reporters, according to news agency ANI.Last week, the Bombay high court granted pre-arrest bail to Mandakini and ordered her to appear before the ED every Tuesday and Friday till further orders. The court also asked the central probe agency to file a reply on Mandakini’s anticipatory bail application, before posting the matter for further hearing to December 7.Pune-based activist Hemant Gavande filed a petition in 2017, alleging that Eknath Khadse bought a three-acre plot in Maharashtra Industrial Development Area in 2016 by misusing his position as the revenue minister in the then Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government in the state.It is alleged Khadse manipulated the actual market price of the land, incurring the state exchequer a loss of ₹61.25 crore.In August, the ED attached assets worth ₹5.73 crore belonging to Eknath Khadse, Mandakini, his son-in-law Girish Chaudhari, among others in the land deal case. The agency filed a chargesheet on September 4 this year in which it named three people along with sub-registrar Ravindra Muley and Benchmark Buildcon Private Limited.The ED alleged that Chaudhari and Khadse bought the land for ₹3.75 crore when its actual price was ₹22.83 crore. Subsequently, Muley was taken into custody by the court.The attached assets include one bungalow, three residential flats, seven land parcels worth ₹4.86 crore, and bank deposit to the tune of ₹86.28 lakh, according to ANI.However, earlier this month, Muley was granted bail by additional sessions judge, HS Sathbhai. A special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court said that prima facie it doesn’t appear that the sale deal lodged in 2016 was undervalued to pay the stamp duty, Hindustan Times reported.While Mandakini has been instructed to appear before the ED on Tuesday and Friday every week, the Bombay HC has exempted Eknath Khadse from any appearance in view of his poor health. In October, senior advocate Aabad Ponda and Swapnil Ambure sought for the exemption by informing the court that the NCP leader underwent surgery for grade-3 haemorrhoids in a Mumbai hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/lawyer-of-ncp-leader-s-wife-says-will-cooperate-with-ed-in-pune-land-deal-case-101634642892656.html
19-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi air to stay in satisfactory category on Tuesday||Delhi sky was likely to be partly cloudy throughout Tuesday, as per the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) forecast, which also predicted the maximum temperature in the national capital to remain around 29 degrees Celsius on Tuesday. Rains had lashed parts of Delhi-NCR over the Sunday and Monday, causing water logging in the city.The Met department has predicted the minimum temperature in the city to be 19 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, more than two notches down from Monday’s 21.1°C, but two notches above normal for this time of the year. The maximum temperature was 23.9°C on Monday, nine degrees below normal.Delhi’s air quality remained in the satisfactory category on Tuesday morning. Data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showed the hourly air quality index (AQI) at 7 am to be at 59, which is at the lower-end of the “satisfactory” category.On Monday, the average 24-hour AQI was 46, a drop of over 250 in just a day. The index on Sunday had shot up to 298 and was categorised as “poor”, leading to breathing discomfort on prolonged exposure.Residents of Delhi breathed good air after 413 days on Monday as heavy downpours through the day settled down pollutants. It was the first time since 2015 that the air in the national capital has been so clean in October.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.Also Read: How to build urban climate resilienceOn Tuesday morning, the Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), however, said that Delhi’s air quality index was in “good” category.“Delhi’s AQI is in the good category with PM2.5 as the main pollutant. Local land surfaces are wet and so dust re-suspension is minimum which lead to low PM10. Presence of western disturbance has led to scattered rainfall over north India, leading to low biomass burning. This condition improved AQI with low PM2.5. Fire counts reduced to 170 and its share is only 1% to PM2.5. Moist surfaces inhibit re-suspension of dust which will keep AQI in good [category] for next 24 hours and after that the AQI will degrade to satisfactory for Delhi.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-air-to-stay-in-satisfactory-category-on-tuesday-101634642738692.html

Rawal asked him to get inside the car and that he would show soft copies of the documents which he claimed were in his mobile phone.“However, Rawal locked the car once the constable sat inside and took off.

19-10-2021||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: We are all pedestrians, let us respect our right to walk||PUNE Walking is the most basic means of transport and a fundamental element of the human condition. Countless generations of our ancestors have walked the earth. A walk – the Dandi March – is part of India’s freedom struggle. Walking enables study, livelihoods, everyday needs, relationships, recreation, and exploration. According to the 2011 census, one-third of all work trips are by foot. Women depend on walking more than men. Studies show that 60 per cent of children walk to school. As a transport mode, walking provides individual health benefits and is good for the city’s environment and economy. Walking is a part of trips by other modes too – we walk to and from a bus-stop, six-seater, or rickshaw.Pedestrian lives lost due to lack of attentionEven though walking is such an important part of our individual and collective lives, across the country pedestrians face difficulties. Road design, management, and maintenance seem much more oriented to the needs of automobiles than of people.In most cities, there is not even the semblance of a decent footpath. Not only is road space taken up by moving vehicles, but parked vehicles also occupy and deny even the margins of the road to pedestrians. The lack of safe facilities to walk and cross results in a shocking human cost. In 2019 alone, 25,858 pedestrians were killed in road crashes in India. Road crash reports show an 85% increase in deaths of pedestrians in five years. In Pune, about one-third of all road crash deaths are pedestrians.Policy support for the pedestrian modeStreets and walking neighbourhoods must be strengthened and made safe and inclusive in such a way that it accommodates all types of road users - from children to senior citizens to differently-abled people.Our government and even the United Nations recognise the importance of walking. India’s National Urban Transport Policy, promulgated in 2006, emphasizes the mobility of people and not vehicles. The vision is to provide sustainable and affordable mobility which is accessible to all citizens. India has also committed to reducing road accident deaths. India’s Smart City Mission recognises that walking contributes to cleaner air and less congestion and makes education, health care and other social services more accessible to the most vulnerable populations.Two sustainable development goals are concerned with safe, accessible, convenient walking facilities for all (SDG 3.2 and 11.2). The UN’s New Urban Agenda of 2016 urges countries to ensure safe, inclusive, accessible, green, and quality public spaces, including streets, sidewalks and cycling lanes, squares, waterfront areas, gardens, and parks. Such spaces foster a peaceful and healthy society, promoting the values of living together and social interaction.How can we accelerate the move from high policies to local action? Call for a Pedestrians’ DayCitizens’ groups in Pune and many other cities are coming together to call for a Pedestrians’ Day, in a campaign by the Sustainable Mobility Network India (see https://www.sumnet.in/npd/). A petition has been initiated with Jhatkaa.org. The hope is that citizens and citizens groups, educational institutions will reach out to their elected representatives to celebrate the Day and promote awareness of the needs of pedestrians. Campaign coordinator Suraj Jaipurkar says, “The aim is to draw attention to the status of walkability and road safety and call for integrating these as core elements of sustainable mobility and transport infrastructure.” Observing such days has helped raise awareness and increase commitment to these important causes. They provide an occasion to discuss, reflect, generate ideas and spur action. December 11 is Pune’s Pedestrians’ DayIn Pune, it is wonderful to note that the mayor has declared December 11 as Pedestrians’ Day for the city. We can all support the national call and observe Pedestrians’ Day in Pune. Students and citizens’ groups can conduct meaningful activities – check your neighbourhoods for walkability and condition of footpaths, the safety of pedestrian crossings, functioning of signals with pedestrian phase, enforcement of ‘stop line’ at signals enabling safe crossings. More ideas are at https://savepunetraffic.org/pedestrians-day/On Pedestrians’ Day, activities may include neighbourhood walks and rallies, no-vehicle day, civic group meetings to present walkability study results to local decision-makers as specific suggestions for action. Let us celebrate and enable walking. Let us become a more equal and respectful society. Finally, we are all pedestrians. Let us respect our own right to walk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/civic-sanskriti-we-are-all-pedestrians-let-us-respect-our-right-to-walk-101634641840098.html

Rural development and panchayats department director Manpreet Singh has issued an order restraining panchayats from auctioning and cutting trees on village land till further orders. Also read: Stubble burning: Centre must push states to adopt the Pusa bio-decomposer modelIn the order last week, the director referred to a high court stay on cutting trees on the plea of advocate HC Arora, seeking intervention against auction notices that the three panchayats had issued for the sale of khair trees. “It was directed that no trees shall be cut in the area concerned without the leave of the court,” the order read. On the complaint of a Faridkot resident Gurpreet Singh Chandbaja, the NGT directed the Punjab principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) to probe the matter and take remedial measures, including action against violators. More than 2,000 full-grown trees on 135 acres at a defunct cooperative sugar mill have been axed to clear land for developing a housing project of the Punjab Urban Planning and Development Authority (PUDA) in the past four months. The director said that following directions of the high court and the NGT, the government is reviewing its existing policy for selling trees, and therefore, restrained the panchayats from auctioning and cutting trees till further orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-govt-reviewing-policy-to-sell-trees-on-panchayat-land-101634641838709.html

Citing the recent spate of attacks in Jammu & Kashmir, the Arvind Kejriwal-led party insisted that considering the prevalent situation the Prime Minister “must agree with the stand of not conducting the match”.“We see people being attacked in Kashmir. I'm sure that even PM agrees with the stand of not conducting the match (IND v PAK) as when (the BJP was) in opposition he used to question that when state sponsored terrorism is taking place in India why should we play cricket with them?” AAP MLA Atishi said at a press conference on Tuesday.Also Read: Extension of BSF’s jurisdiction in Punjab: AAP seeks rollback of decisionAtishi also said that unless such attacks against Indians cease, cricket matches should not be played with Pakistan. “So, I am sure that not only AAP but even BJP and its leadership along with the PM will agree that unless such attacks in India and targeted attacks on Indians stop, it will not be right to play matches like this,” she added.India and Pakistan are scheduled to play a much-anticipated high-octane T20 World Cup match in Dubai on October 24. Union minister Giriraj Singh was the first politician from the BJP to insist on “reconsidering” the upcoming match. "I think if relations (between India and Pakistan) are not good then this should be reconsidered," Singh told reporters on Monday.Both the AAP and Singh were referring to the civilian killings carried out in Kashmir by militants in the first two weeks of October.

19-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab emerging as preferred destination for ethanol plants||Punjab is proving to be a favoured destination in the country for setting up ethanol distillation plants. As many as 25 business houses have approached the state’s excise and taxation department with expression of interest to set up the plants, and as per reports more are keen. Ethanol, the purest form of ethyl alcohol with a concentration of 99.65%, is a key ingredient in alcoholic beverages like beer, wine and brandy, and is used in large quantities in ethanol blended petrol (EBP), which helps reduce pollution, vehicular fuel cost and increases mileage. Currently, the country has 200 ethanol plants, with an annual production capacity of 684 crore litres. Among these, four, attached with distilleries, are in Punjab.With establishment of more plants in the state, country’s capacity is expected to touch 775 crore litres, which can help save ₹30,000 crore of foreign exchange. “Each plant of 100 kilolitre per day (one lakh litres per day) capacity will require an investment of ₹100 crore. Currently, 8.5% ethanol is blended with petrol in the country and this is expected to touch 20% by 2025, as mandated in the National Bio-Fuel Policy of 2018. The sector will certainly become a booming business in the future,” said excise department joint commissioner Naresh Dubey. A litre of ethanol is sold to petrol companies at ₹50 per litre. Why Punjab? Abundant supply of water and food grains is the primary cause for industry’s interest in setting up ethanol plants in Punjab. Wheat, paddy, maize and sugarcane, which are easily available in the state, constitute as major raw materials for the industry. Besides food grains, ethanol is also produced using non-edible agricultural waste, left over after harvesting. This can include corn cobs, rice straw and wheat straw, which are converted into cellulose and later fermented to form ethanol. This in turn can be blended with conventional fuel. “Ethanol is best sourced from sugarcane and its waste, which is also grown in the state,” said an officer of the rank of joint commissioner. Besides, each plant requires 20 to 35 acres, which is available in the state.“To encourage the industry, we have drastically cut down the licence fee to ₹5 lakh per plant, whereas for a distillery ₹1 to 3 crore is charged. After a formal expression is received, the department will issue a letter of intent and set a deadline of three years to start production to full capacity,” said Dubey. The plants are also seen as a major revenue source in form of GST and employment generation, as each plant will employ at least 200 people. An industrialist, keen to set up an ethanol plant in the state, said, “We are planning to set up a plant with a daily capacity of 150 kilolitres. Ethanol is equally beneficial for the country and the investors. It will also conserve water, as it is produced from maize and sugarcane as well. More area under maize and sugarcane cultivation means lesser water-guzzling paddy, hence sub-soil water will be conserved.” Other than Punjab, neighbouring Haryana is also flocked by similar investors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-emerging-as-preferred-destination-for-ethanol-plants-101634617236791.html

Despite rain, farmers remained present at several locations in Karnal, Kurukshetra, Rohtak and Panipat districts.Agitators reached the Karnal railway station and laid siege of tracks around 10am on Monday. However, farmers served food and water to the people stuck due to the stir. In Kurukshetra, farmers protesting under the banner of BKU (Charuni) did not allow the movement of trains till 4pm. Similar protests were witnessed in Panipat. Farmers sat on tracks at Uchana in Jind, Dadri, Bahadurgarh, Hisar, Rohtak, Sonepat and many other parts of the state. Rapid Action Force was deployed at the Sonepat railway station.Azad Palwan, BKU’s Jind district president, said, “We blocked railway lines on a call given by the SKM demanding the arrest of Union minister Ajay Mishra. Justice can’t prevail in the Lakhimpur Kheri case until he resigns from the Modi cabinet. The BJP government is shielding him and his son,” he added.The protesting farmers also stopped a goods train in Bhiwani, but the protest ended peacefully in the region.With the Railways not issuing any advisory to suspend or divert trains, hundreds of passengers were stranded and complained that the government should have issued an advisory. “I had to go to Delhi, but there are no trains since morning. Now, I have been left with no other option but to wait here until the movement of trains is restored,” said a woman passenger waiting at the Karnal railway station.Reacting to the problems faced by passengers, BKU (Charuni) Karnal district president Jagdip Singh Aulakh said, “The call was given a week ago and the commuters should have avoided travelling.”Cops were deployed at the railway stations, but the protests remained peaceful.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rail-roko-farmers-block-key-tracks-in-northern-haryana-101634593234702.html
19-10-2021||Chandigarh||No doubt Ram Rahim was actual beneficiary of Ranjit Singh’s death: CBI court||There is no doubt to the fact that Gurmeet Ram Rahim, who was feeling aggrieved by the circulation of the anonymous letter on sexual exploitation of sadhvis of Dera Sacha Sauda, was the actual beneficiary of shutting the mouth of Ranjit Singh for ever, the CBI special court has said. It said that other convicts who have been found to be directly involved in the murder had no personal enmity with the family of Ranjit Singh, another factor that points to the involvement of Dera head. Khatta Singh, a controversial but key witness in the case, has given eyewitness account of the conspiracy hatched for murder and reason that it was due to letter on exploitation of sadhvis. His testimony became clinching evidence in this case even as Khatta Singh, who once served as driver of Dera head, at one point of time had turned hostile. The court said that his testimony deserves acceptance if it is evaluated in its entirety coupled with the facts and circumstances of the case and the pressure on him due to influence the Dera chief enjoyed. The 365-page conviction judgment and 46-page sentencing order elaborates on account of 60 prosecution witnesses and twist why it deserved to be accepted. The court also took note of testimony of Saroj, sister of Ranjit Singh, who had stated that Ranjit had confided in her how he is facing threat from Dera as they suspected that he was behind circulation of the letter in question. She had also stated that Jasbir Singh and Sabdil Singh had been visiting Ranjit’s house prior to the occurrence. Ranjit’s father Joginder Singh had also deposed that Sabdil and Jasbir told Ranjit that accused Gurmeet Ram Rahim was unhappy and that he wanted him to apologise for his act otherwise he will be killed. “..it emerges out that it was the origin and circulation of the anonymous letter in question, which the Dera people were inquiring,” the court said adding that since it was circulated by the Taraksheel Society, and a member of society was a co-villager of Ranjit Singh, Dera suspected Ranjit Singh’s hand behind it. Further, there was reference to exploitation of a Kurukshetra girl, suspected to be Ranjit’s sister. “It is crystal clear that the Dera people were having full suspicion about the involvement of Ranjit Singh in the origin and circulation of the anonymous letter in question and they had openly threatened to eliminate Ranjit Singh,” the court said. It also stood proved that Ranjit was summoned to the Dera and was asked to apologise, which he refused and resulted in conspiracy to kill him, an account corroborated by Khatta Singh. The fact of Ranjit getting an insurance policy in June 2002, a month before the murder, was another evidence that he feared for his life at the hands of the Dera head.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-doubt-ram-rahim-was-actual-beneficiary-of-ranjit-singh-s-death-cbi-court-101634593054071.html

Kanda is facing a triangular contest from INLD’s Abhay Singh Chautala, who is eyeing the fourth consecutive victory from his traditional family’s bastion and Pawan Beniwal of the Congress, who had switched sides ahead of the byelection. The bypoll was necessitated after Abhay resigned in the favour of farmers protesting against three farm laws on January 27.Addressing the gathering while farmers showed them black flags on the outskirts of the village, BJP’s state president OP Dhankar said Abhay had promised that he will not fight the election until three farm laws are repealed while tendering his resignation.“ Now he is in fray again. Have the farm laws been repealed? He is betraying the voters and doing politics thinking they are fools. The people of Ellenabad want to go with the BJP-JJP government.

19-10-2021||Chandigarh||Day after Sidhu’s missive to Sonia, Channi promises to implement party agenda, resolve all issues||Blurb: Chandigarh Amid a fresh push by Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu for implementation of pending agenda ahead of the assembly elections, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Monday said that all matters will be resolved and the agenda of the party implemented. The chief minister’s statement came a day after Sidhu again flagged 13 issues, including justice in sacrilege cases, exemplary punishment for big fish behind drug trafficking, cancellation of faulty power purchase pacts, cut in power rates and fixing responsibility for scholarship scam, in a letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi. “Be it 13 points, 18 points, 21 points or even 24 points, whatever the agenda is, we are implementing it. Not a single point will be left out,” Channi told reporters at a press conference after a state cabinet meeting in which water bill arrears of consumers in urban and rural areas were waived. The chief minister said it was his (Sidhu’s) right to raise issues as the state chief. “The party is supreme and the government will implement its ideology. Ghar ghar wich challi gal, sarkar kareigi masle hal (There is talking in every household that government will take care of all issues),” he said in response to Sidhu’s letter. The chief minister also played down their differences, stating that in case it occurs that they (he and Sidhu) had issues, he would make the PPCC chief sit beside him at his next press conference. Channi and Sidhu, who have not been on the same on senior appointments, some cabinet inductions and portfolio allocation, had a late-night meeting on Sunday to improve coordination between the party and the state government with the state polls less than four months away. Cabinet minister Pargat Singh, considered close to Sidhu, and central leaders Harish Chaudhary and Krishna Allavaru were also present in the meeting held barely hours after the PPCC chief posted his letter to the Congress president on Twitter. The Punjab Congress president, who has been steadfast on his demand for implementation of pending promises, took up the matter at the meeting, citing their significance for the party in the state. “We are having regular internal meetings with different leaders of the party every day. There will be another round of meetings again today,” Chaudhary said, refusing to go into details. While Sidhu did not respond to calls, his wife and former chief parliamentary secretary Navjot Kaur said they (PPCC chief and CM) held a long meeting to discuss to find a way for cancellation of PPAs. “We do not want a situation where we decide to cancel PPAs and run into the legal tangles. That’s why they sat till 3am,” she told journalists in Amritsar. Sidhu, Chaudhary and some other party leaders had another round of talks on Monday evening to discuss the appointments in the state and district units and hiring of a private firm for poll campaign management and publicity on social media. Half-a-dozen private companies are said to be vying for the party’s poll campaign management work in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/day-after-sidhu-s-missive-to-sonia-channi-promises-to-implement-party-agenda-resolve-all-issues-101634589214353.html

They started leaving after the fresh attack on a group of non-locals at Wanpoh in Kulgam district on Sunday night. The attack left two dead and another injured.Many spent the night in security force camps and police stations, and some are determined to stay put in the Valley despite the fear. Many have returned to their rented accommodations.Zahir-ul-Islam, who hails from Malda district in West Bengal, said they received a call from the police last night and were asked to reach the police station in Ganderbal. “We were 20 people staying in four rooms at Ganderbal. After noting down our details, we all were taken to the nearby camp at Dignibal where more than 500 non-local workers had assembled,” he said.“Only a few hundred people were given food, rest all of us remained hungry. In the afternoon we were allowed to go. The police officers asked us whether we wanted to go home and many of us declined to go back,” he added.He said their group was involved in construction work and wanted to complete all the remaining projects.“We will stay for the next two months. Despite killings, we won’t leave Kashmir,” he said.His words were echoed by his roommate Faruqul, who is also from West Bengal. “We are not afraid. We will only go once our works get complete here.”At Sopore, non-local workers were called to the police station late last night and then kept in a school building on the national highway and in a hostel of a degree college.“When we reached the police station, we were taken to a school building close to the Army and police camp and kept there for the night. Some of our colleagues left for homes early by taking cabs. We are still in the school building, and we haven’t decided whether to go or stay,” said Dalip Paswan, a labourer from Bihar.At the railway station in Srinagar, many non-locals said they felt unsafe after the killings.“I never wanted to go before January, but back-to-back attacks on non-locals have left all of us scared,” said Darmendra from Bihar.Another labourer Dhananjay from Bihar said after the killings, they don’t want to stay. “With each passing day, the situation is turning bad and people from Bihar are being targeted,” he said.Since October 1, 11 civilians have been killed in targeted attacks in different parts of Kashmir and among those killed five were non-locals.Officials at the railway station in Nowgam said workers had been coming since morning and many waited for five to six hours till the arrival of trains that took them to the Banihal station.However, officials are tight-lipped over the workers leaving the Valley. Soon after the attack at Wanpoh in Kulgam, the police had moved many non-locals to secure places in south Kashmir, Ganderbal and Baramulla districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/migrants-crowd-railway-station-to-catch-a-train-out-of-kashmir-101634588975291.html

No one tested positive in Panchkula on three days, while the daily count remained zero in Mohali and Chandigarh tally on one day each. At 26, cases in Mohali were 188% higher than nine cases last week. However, Chandigarh’s count dipped from 32 to 14. In Panchkula, it changed from six to 10.In some relief, no fatality owing to the virus was reported in the tricity this week, after three deaths in the week ending on October 10.At the peak of the second wave in May, the tricity had recorded 46,245 cases and 790 deaths in just one month. With restrictions on public movement being put in place, the curve started flattening thereon and only 50 cases were recorded in the last week of July. The weekly cases have been fluctuating ever since, but have never crossed the 100 mark. Mohali civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur said, “Covid cases in Mohali district have started increasing again, so testing has been intensified. But it is also crucial to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, especially during the festival season when public movement increases.”Dr Suman Singh, director, health services, Chandigarh, said, “As restrictions have been lifted and festivities are underway, more gatherings are taking place. To avoid serious infection, people must complete their vaccination cycle as early as possible. Even if people are vaccinated, they must maintain social distance and wear face masks in public. Only these precautions can avert the third wave.”She added, “Since 60% of the population is already immunised in Chandigarh, leading to herd immunity, the transmission rate is under control. The health department is sticking to the testing-and-vaccination practice to control the spread. Any rise in the positivity rate is revealed through testing people.”Nine test positive in tricityThe tricity logged nine fresh Covid-19 cases on Monday, down from 13 on Sunday.Chandigarh confirmed four cases, while three people tested positive in Mohali and two in Panchkula. No death was reported in any area for the 13th straight day.However, the active cases rose from 66 to 68 since Sunday. A total of 34 patients are still recuperating in Mohali, 24 in Chandigarh and 10 in Panchkula. The latest cases in Chandigarh came from Sectors 19 and 28, and Khuda Lahora. The three cases in Mohali were from Dhakoli and Mohali city. Chandigarh’s caseload has reached 65,306, including 64,462 recoveries and 820 deaths.

19-10-2021||Chandigarh||Stung hard by dengue, Mohali’s govt hospitals run out of testing kits||Struggling with an unprecedented rise in dengue patients, government hospitals in Mohali have run out of the testing kits to detect the vector-borne disease.The tests are conducted for free at the government hospitals in Mohali’s Phase 6, Dera Bassi and Kharar. But with no more kits available, patients have been forced to turn to private hospitals, where they are being charged anywhere from ₹800 to ₹1,000 per test.In just two months, Mohali has witnessed 1,622 dengue infections, a 244% spike from the 471 cases detected in 2020. The district has also lost 12 residents to the virus, transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.Notably, as per norms, the health department only considers test reports by a government lab, and then carries out insecticide spray in the positive patient’s house. All private hospitals and labs need to report any suspected or confirmed dengue cases to the health department for remedial measures.Civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur said, “The shortage of kits is not only in Mohali but in entire Punjab. We have sent the demand to the state government and hopefully, it will be sorted out soon.”“We are facing an alarming situation. Anti-dengue drives have been started and the number of anti-larvae teams has been increased. But we need the full cooperation of residents, who need to take vector-control measures at their houses,” she said.“Over 1,600 people have been infected and 12 have died in Mohali. Ten of these deaths were reported in just 16 days of October and two in September,” said the civil surgeon. She said maximum dengue cases were surfacing in urban areas, including Phases 3B1, 4 and 5, Zirakpur, Dera Bassi and Kurali.District epidemiologist Dr Vikrant Nagra said the civil hospital in Phase 6 was equipped with a 50-bed dengue ward, while those in Kharar and Dera Bassi had six beds each, and most of these were available for serious patients.Pvt hospitals warned against overchargingCivil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur warned private hospitals and laboratories against overcharging patients for tests and treatment, and said patients can contact the helpline 104 for complaints and queries.Due to the spurt in dengue cases this year, the Punjab health department had recently fixed charges for the NSI Antigen and Dengue Antibody tests as ₹600 each, and ₹50 for Platelet Count Test at all private hospitals.‘Dengue cycle changed due to late rains’On the current rise in dengue cases, Dr Suman Singh, director, health services, Chandigarh, said, “Earlier, dengue cases would start surfacing in July and last till September, as dengue mosquitoes breed in stagnant water, when the temperature is high. However, due to monsoon’s arrival and withdrawal getting delayed over the recent years, the breeding cycle has completely changed, leading to more cases now. But these should start ebbing away with the dip in temperature.”She cautioned residents against allowing stagnating water in their households. “The health department is inspecting houses and challaning the violators, besides conducting fogging,” Dr Singh added. 110 more contract infection in tricityOn Monday, as many as 110 more people got infected with dengue in the tricity, but the figure was lower than 193 on Sunday.Of the total cases, 68 were reported from Mohali, 25 from Chandigarh and 17 from Panchkula.Apart from 1,622 cases in Mohali this year, Chandigarh has detected 419 dengue infections, while 355 people have contracted the disease in Panchkula.While Mohali has confirmed 12 deaths since September, Chandigarh and Panchkula have not reported any fatality owing to dengue so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/stung-hard-by-dengue-mohali-s-govt-hospitals-run-out-of-testing-kits-101634588614344.html
19-10-2021||Chandigarh||3rd sero survey: 76% population in Haryana has Covid antibodies||Haryana’s 76.3% population has developed coronavirus antibodies, state the findings of the third round of serological survey conducted by the state health department in September. The survey aimed to assess the presence of coronavirus antibodies developed in the population either by natural infection or as the result of Covid vaccination. The third round’s seroprevalence is significantly higher as compared to the previous rounds of serological survey conducted in 2020. About 14.8% population in the second round conducted last October and 8% in the first round in August 2020 was found to have developed Covid antibodies. While the population sampled in the first and second rounds of survey was 18 years and above, the third round also included children aged between six and 17 years and adults aged 18 years and above. ‘Kurukshetra tops in seroprevalence’Haryana health minister Anil Vij, who released the report of third round of serological survey on Monday, said the sero positivity was 78.1% in urban areas and 75.1% in rural areas. “Kurukshetra district was found to have the highest sero positivity at 85% and Faridabad at 64.2% has the lowest seropositivity,” the health minister said. Vij said that since Faridabad had the highest inconclusive samples at 13.2%, the district would be resampled. He added that 75% men and 77% women were found to have developed antibodies. ‘Close to achieving herd immunity’Additional chief secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora said that their aggressive vaccination programme also supplemented to higher seroprevalence in the community. About 2.48 crore individuals, including 1.75 crore with first dose, have been vaccinated in the state. “Although, the results of this round of sero survey are somewhat near to the level of achieving herd immunity, a large proportion of population is still vulnerable. Therefore, enforcing Covid-appropriate behaviour is still our utmost priority,” Arora said. Sample size increasedThe ACS said for the third round, the sample size was increased to 36,520 as compared to 18,700 samples (seroprevalence: 8%) in the first round and 15,840 samples (seroprevalence:14.8%) in the second round in 2020. He said that 21,912 individuals in 18 years and above category, 10,956 in 10 to 17-year age group and 3,652 individuals in the 6-9 age group were sampled during the third round. Arora said that since the health minister wanted the third round of sero survey to be more inclusive, it was decided to expand the sample size to include the most-vulnerable population of children above six years. “This was done considering the possibility of third wave affecting the kids,” he said. It was decided that the efficacy of vaccination should also be determined by detection of anti-spike coronavirus antibodies. 69.8% kids aged between 6 and 9 years have antibodiesAs per the third round, the sero-positivity rate in kids aged between six and nine years was 69.8%. It was 73.2% in adolescents (10-17 years) and ranged between 76.7% and 79.5% in individuals aged 18 years and above. Health officials said that stratified simple random sampling technique was used in this study to maintain uniformity and comparability with the national-level sero survey. The health department selected 60% samples from rural areas and 40% samples from urban areas. Nodal officer for Covid Dr Dhruva Chaudhary of Rohtak PGIMS said that serological surveys gave an accurate estimate of the population exposed to Covid infection, including asymptomatic individuals. “The sero-survey findings enable better understanding of population protection against epidemic peaks which is not possible in hospital-based surveillance,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/3rd-sero-survey-76-population-in-haryana-has-covid-antibodies-101634588193634.html

19-10-2021||Chandigarh||Appointment of Punjab DGP: UPSC seeks govt view on cut-off date for remaining service period of probable officers||The appointment of a regular DGP may take some more time as the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) has sought clarification with regard to the service period of nine senior-most officers whose names were forwarded by the state government. According to the information, the UPSC sought state government’s view on the ‘cut-off’ date to be considered for evaluating the remaining service period of officers shortlisted for the top police post. The state had sent the names on September 30 and now the UPSC wants to know if it (September 30) should be considered to evaluate the mandatory service period left or the date when previous DGP Dinkar Gupta was removed as Punjab Police head. The government discussed the matter on Monday and the reply will be filed on Tuesday, an official said. The Punjab government had sent the names of nine IPS officers to the UPSC, which, in turn, will choose three names after evaluating various factors as per the laid-down norms. The state government will have to pick one of the three officials for the top police job. The norms make it mandatory that the officers being considered for the post should have at least six months’ service left. One of the strongest contenders for the post, 1986-batch IPS officer S Chattopadhyaya, would have been out of the race for the top police job had the government not sent the panel to the UPSC on September 30 as he is scheduled to retire on March 31 next year. After Charanjit Singh Channi replaced Capt Amarinder Singh as chief minister, then state police chief Dinkar Gupta proceeded on a month’s leave and the government removed him from the top post on September 10, posting him as chairman of Punjab Police Housing Corporation. The government has given the additional charge of the state police chief to 1988-batch IPS officer Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota till a regular DGP is appointed. Sahota’s appointment had become a bone of contention between chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and Punjab Congress chief Navjot Sidhu, who questioned the probe conducted by him in the Bargari sacrilege case during the previous SAD-BJP regime. Sidhu camp is desperate to see Chattopadhyaya as the next DGP. The officer was given the additional charge of vigilance chief on October 14, the day Sidhu had met central leaders of the party in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/appointment-of-punjab-dgp-upsc-seeks-govt-view-on-cut-off-date-for-remaining-service-period-of-probable-officers-101634587717702.html

19-10-2021||Chandigarh||Festive rush: No sign of temporary parking sites in Ludhiana markets||In view of the traffic snarls seen in markets every year during festive season, police along with GLADA, municipal corporation and other departments, had promised to set up temporary parking sites in at least 10 locations, however, there is still no sign of these anywhere in the city.The proposed sites for the temporary parking sites were the vacant land of the Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (GLADA) opposite the mini secretariat, Dr BL Kapur Memorial hospital near Daresi, vacant GLADA land near Old Session Chowk, the site behind the civil hospital, vacant LIT land near Feroze Gandhi market, vacant land behind the bus stand, a vacant LIT complex on Rani Jhansi Road, the LIT parking near Orient Cinema, vacant land near Mohini Resort on Chandigarh Road, and parking of Flamez mall at Malhar road among others.But with authorities failing to deliver on the promise, some contractors are using the situation to mint money. Abhinav Sharma, a resident of Model Town Extension, said, “A contractor outside a shopping complex in the city has been charging ₹100 from people for parking their car for an hour. The residents are forced to pay as there is no other option available.”Shopkeepers claim the trouble is more this year due to the ongoing construction work on Ferozepur road. Madhur Mahindra, public relation officer of Connaught Place market association, Ghumar Mandi, said the market witnesses heavy rush of vehicles on weekends. “As festival season is on, the number of vehicles and visitors has increased. Police are towing away vehicles for wrong parking, but no efforts are being made to streamline the flow of the traffic in the market,” he said, adding, “Earlier visitors used to park their vehicles alongside Ferozepur road. Due to ongoing construction work, there is no space left for parking.”City residents are facing similar problems on Sat Paul Mittal road (Malhar road) and Pakhowal road. Due to delay in completion of work, the stretch faces traffic jams all the time.Rahul Verma, Punjab Road Safety Council member, said that due to non-cooperation of some of departments, the establishment of temporary parking lots has remained a non-starter. There are many places which could be utilised as parking.He added that as Dhan Teras, Karva Chauth and Diwali are around the corner the traffic problem could increase in such areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/festive-rush-no-sign-of-temporary-parking-sites-in-ludhiana-markets-101634587055261.html

It was to depart from the Ludhiana railway station at 9:30 am.

These trains were rescheduled and plied post 4 pm after the farmers’ protest ended, however, passengers were left fuming.Updesh Kumar, a resident of Delhi travelling in Paschim Express, said he came to Ludhiana for some work on Sunday and was to return in a day. “I would have reached Delhi around 4 pm. I empathise with the farmers but they should also understand that if they are agitated with the government, they should not make the public suffer for it,” said Kumar.Sanjay, another passenger, blamed railway officials for not serving food in the train. “Since we are stuck in the trains, railway officials should serve us food,” he said.Sachin from Rajasthan who was travelling with his kids also expressed his displeasure. “I went to Amritsar to visit the Golden temple and could have reached home today but I am stuck here now. My kids are also getting restless,” said Sachin.

We could have commuted by road and got our skin saved from such harassment,” said Gupta.Meanwhile, Tarun Kumar, station director, Ludhiana, claimed that the availability of water for the stranded passengers was ensured. He added that trains were not cancelled in advance so as to let the maximum trains to pass.Railways issued a refund of ₹18,000 to the passengers whose trains were cancelled, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-rail-roko-delays-26-trains-passing-through-ludhiana-101634586874987.html

19-10-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Waiting for work||They are sitting on their haunches, waiting for work. House painters Madan Lal, Gopal, Jagdish and Malik are stationed with their paint brushes in Old Delhi’s Tiraha Behram Khan. This is one of the historic quarter’s traffic junctions where freelance labourers gather to be picked up for assignments. Their clients—mainly builders and contractors— hire them for small projects, which might last from a few hours to the entire day. The labourers later return to this same spot, and wait for more work.It is 3 in the afternoon. These four painters say they haven’t been approached since the morning. They live nearby in a rented room and have been here since 8am—they left only once for a quick lunch at “Sanjay ka Hotel.” It is possible that the day may end on a zero earning, one of them says matter-of-factly. “We are used to not getting any work for long stretches of time, especially since the karuna (coronavirus),” says the extrovert Malik. He is in his mid-20s. The eldest among the four is Madan Lal, 55. He is affectionately known as “chacha.” Although strenuous physical work becomes increasingly trying at his age, “chacha” cannot afford to retire. “Who will take care of me,” he argues, shrugging his shoulders. “My wife is dead, my son is dead.”All the labourers are from Aligarh district in UP. “Hardly any work there,” says Malik. They have been in Old Delhi for years. May be they can find more work by shifting base to some other place in the Capital. Malik shakes his head. “Our roots are now in Purani Dilli. We know the people well. The landlord understands when we can’t pay the rent on time. People help us when we need to borrow money, they know we won’t be running away.” Mr Lal, the “chacha,” too speaks up forcefully—“We cannot start again in a new place, especially in these times when one relies so much on the help of others.”With almost no income in the past few days, “we are surviving by borrowing from each other,” says Gopal.The painters will leave the area only after 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-waiting-for-work-101634586506374.html

Sukh Ram’s son and former minister, who has been a BJP legislator from Mandi, Anil Sharma did not attend the election rally of chief minister Jai Ram Thakur held on Sunday despite his meeting with the state BJP in-charge Avinash Rai Khanna on Saturday. Meanwhile, talking to the media, Anil Sharma said he might take a decision regarding the next course of action in a day or two. “It could be anything. My son Ashray Sharma, who is presently a general secretary in the state Congress, is also on the list of Congress’ election observers,” he said. Sharma is overtly and covertly hitting out at his own government over development works that have slowed down in Mandi. He is also upset over being ignored while planning and executing developmental works in his constituency. “If my position is strengthened, I would work to pace up the development,” he said.Sharma said Mandi had got chief minister for the first time, but that has not helped the area in any manner. He said Sukh Ram’s vote bank was still intact and it would only benefit the party with which he and his family would be in. Sharma along with his family members had switched over to the BJP. He won the 2017 assembly election and was elevated as power minister. But his terms strained after his son Ashray Sharma contested the Lok Sabha elections on the Congress ticket in 2019 against BJP’s Ram Swaroop Sharma. Anil was compelled to give up his ministerial berth. Since then the party had been sidelining him. “It was my son who contested elections not me. I did not campaign for my son. Time and again I was humiliated in the presence of the chief minister,” he said.The CM and the state BJP in-charge had held a closed-door meeting with Sharma convincing him to campaign for the party. Sharma had been kept away from the campaign in the municipal corporation elections too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mandi-bypoll-campaign-sukh-ram-s-family-conspicuous-by-its-absence-101634586454608.html

Welcoming the resolution, Channi alleged that the three agriculture black laws are the culmination of the conspiracy to subjugate India’s farmers for the advantage of a handful of “crony capitalist friends” of the Modi government. He also said that for over 10-and-a-half months, lakhs of farmers have been protesting peacefully on Delhi’s borders, blocked by spikes and boulders on the National Highway from advancing further.

Addressing mediapersons here amid a spike in selective killings and terror attacks, Sharma said, “Except for a brief period of abrogation of Article 370 and 35-A, we are witnessing a continuous process of defeating the purpose of removal of Article 370. Jammu province has further been pushed to permanent inferior status and it continues to be a colony of Kashmir.” “Given such a situation, separate Jammu state is the only panacea available to meet the national requirement, empower people of the province to manage their own affairs, defeat enemies working day and night to change Jammu’s demography and create Kashmir-like situation in this strategic region,” Sharma said. He claimed that the people of Jammu province would rise in revolt sooner than later if the powers-that-be in New Delhi continue to treat Jammu as a Kashmir’s colony. Justifying the demand for separate Jammu state, Sharma said, “The manner in which terrorists targeted and brutally murdered innocent peaceful Hindus and Sikhs in Kashmir, including poor Hindu labourers from Bihar and other places and the manner in which the people of Jammu province were ill-treated and excluded from all walks of life, including the vital service sector, even after the abrogation of Article 370 and 35A, has once again established that Jammu province and Kashmir valley just can’t be maintained as a single political unit”. He also tore into the votaries of early elections based on the “fudged & fraud 2011 census” based delimitation and grant of full state status to the UT of J&K.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/separate-state-only-lasting-solution-ikkjutt-jammu-101634586452657.html

On Sunday, militants shot dead two labourers from Bihar, Raja Reshidev and Joginder Reshidev, in their room at Wanpoh, Kulgam. Chun Chun Reshi Das, also from Bihar, sustained multiple injuries and was being treated at the Government Medical College in Anantnag. Meanwhile, the Anantnag district administration has granted ex gratia relief of ₹1 lakh each to the next of kin of both Raja and Joginder. Both the victims have been working here as construction labourers each earning ₹500-700 a day. “We were sitting in our room when we heard that some people in a room were shot at. We brought them to the hospital,” said M Zulfikar, a construction worker from Bihar staying at Wanpoh. Another worker said one of the persons was shot six times. “I don’t know how many attackers were there? I was in my room,” he said. Agency reports quoting the mother of Joginder said he had come to Kashmir some 3-4 months ago. “He is survived by three children. The government should help us,” she said. On Saturday, carpenter Saghir Ahmad, 53 of Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh, was killed at Litter village in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district. He was living in rented accommodation there and had been coming to Kashmir for the past one year. His family said Saghir was doing the dishes in his rented room when he was fired upon. “He has four daughters and a son who has been working in Rajasthan. Saghir had gone for work far away from his family because of poverty. If there would have been work, why would he go hundreds of kilometres away from home,” his younger brother M Naeem told the media on Sunday. “His son was also forced to go to Rajasthan for work. They have nobody to take care of them except us. The government should provide help of ₹1 crore to my nieces,” he said. On the same day, Saghir was killed, 30-year-old Arvind Kumar Sah, a resident of Bihar, was shot dead at Eidgah in Srinagar by militants while he was busy selling “golgappas” outside the park.

The Jammu and Kashmir Police have said the terrorists were believed to be hiding in the jungles since August this year. “Para action is on, but there is nothing conclusive so far. Drones and a helicopter are being used in Nar Khas but there is no breakthrough. The search operations are on in both the places—Nar Khas and Chamrer,” said an Army officer. A senior police officer said the terrorists believed to have sneaked in August from Balakote before reaching Nar Khas forests and Chamrer. “We also suspect that there could be two groups and one of them had reached Chamrer in Surankote on way to Shopian via Pir Ki Gali before they gunned down five soldiers on Monday last,” he added. “Now, such operations take time because the terrain is difficult. There is thick wild growth in the dense forest of Nar Khas where natural caves are there and visibility is also an issue,” he said. An Army source said on Monday when five soldiers were killed in Chamrer area of Surankote, the terrorists were hiding at vantage positions and had opened fire from two different directions. On Monday last the Army suffered five casualties that included a JCO followed by four more casualties. While bodies of the two soldiers were found on Thursday that of JCO and the fourth soldier was found on Saturday. Within four days from Monday to Thursday, the Army has lost nine soldiers—the worst in recent years. Sources within the establishment also flagged the issue of sharing parallel intelligence. They also divulged that the practice of deploying two intelligence men in each border village has also faded away in recent times. “Nothing substantive was shared by intelligence agencies before five of our men were downed on Monday in Chamrer. Now, if these terrorists are there since August, it clearly shows the failure of intelligence agencies and at the same time local support to them cannot be denied,” they said. It may be stated here that Nar Khas forest is barely 10 km from the LoC while Chamrer is located in Dera Ki Gali area of Surankote and sans LoC. Nar Khas forest is spread in six to eight square km of the area and has thick forests having rivulets, rivers and caves with poor visibility while Chamrer is a hilly terrain that leads to Pir Ki Gali and then to Shopian in south Kashmir. “Security forces, for now, have no exact idea about to which terror groups the hiding terrorists belong but some social sites claimed that People’s Anti-Fascist Front (PFF)—an offshoot of LeT was involved but we can’t vouch for the veracity of such claims,” said a police officer. Another senior police officer said, “Terrorists were contacted thrice and the contacts were initiated by the security forces but then in a jungle things don’t click the way you want. They seem to have been trained well in guerrilla warfare and seem to have acclimatised to the forests”. Army chief reaches Jammu Meanwhile, Army Chief General MM Naravane reached Jammu on a two-day visit to the region wherein GOC, White Knight Corps, will give an update on the security situation and operational preparedness. “The COAS will visit forward areas and interact with troops and commanders on the ground. He will visit Poonch to take stock of the situation and get a feedback from the commanders on the ground,” said an Army officer. Major attacks 1. On May 2, 2020, at least five security personnel, including a Colonel, a Major and a sub-inspector were killed during an 18-hour anti-militancy operation in north Kashmir’s Handwara area. 2. On February 14, 2019, at least 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel as well as suicide bomber Adil Ahmad Dar, a local Kashmiri youth, were killed in Pulwama. 3. On February 10, 2018, at pre-dawn, Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists attacked Sunjuwan brigade and killed six soldiers and a civilian besides injuring 20 others that included 14 soldiers. 4. On November 30, 2016, at least seven soldiers, including two Majors, were killed when militants dressed as policemen stormed a military camp in Nagrota, which also has Army’s 16 Corps headquarters. 5. On May 14, 2002, the Kaluchak military station was attacked by three armed terrorists from Pakistan. The trio first attacked a Himachal Road Transport Corporation bus on the Jammu-Pathankot highway and killed seven passengers before storming the station where they killed 23 persons, including 10 children, and five soldiers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/poonch-encounter-difficult-terrains-give-tough-time-to-army-to-flush-out-terrorists-101634586394300.html

At some places, mehandi artists have even set up tents ahead of Karva Chauth. The result: traffic snarls and parking woes for the visitors. Gurnoor Singh, a resident of New Model Town, said, “Lack of parking space is already a major concern in city markets and the situation has only worsened due to the encroachments ahead of festive season. Sometimes, we end up losing at least 15 to 20 minutes while trying to find a parking spot or navigating the jams.”In Jawahar Nagar market, shopkeepers have set up separate tents outside their shops. Dilpreet Singh, a resident of Dugri area, said, “I had gone to Model Town, Gol market, with my mother a few days ago. It was a complete mess. The MC should either act against such encroachments or come up with alternate parking arrangements.”An MC official, requesting anonymity, said, “Earlier, the MC used to charge shopkeepers and allow them to take up a portion outside their shops during festival season. As it caused traffic jams, the MC stopped the practice around three years ago. But now, they have just succumbed to the pressure from shopkeepers and politicians ahead of assembly elections.” Meanwhile, MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said strict directions have been issued to the staff for removing encroachments by shopkeepers. “I will direct the in-charge of tehbazaari wing to check the situation and ensure smooth flow of traffic in the markets. Strict action will also be taken against officials who fail to act against the violators,” said Sabharwal.10 months on, MC fails to establish notified vending zones in the cityThough 10 months have passed since the Ludhiana civic body notified 64 vending zones, there are no sign of these anywhere in the city. The vending zones are being set up so that vendors can be removed from roadsides and allotted a designated space to carry out the business without affecting the traffic. The vending zones are to be established in Field Ganj, Civil Lines, Ghumar Mandi, Model Town, Gill Road, Hambran Road, Daresi among other areas. MC secretary Neeraj Jain said the process to establish vending zones is on and the MC has to take certain permissions from other departments such as LIT, GLADA etc, as a few sites fall under their jurisdiction. A few permissions are also to be taken from the finance and contracts committee (F and CC) of MC and an agenda regarding this will be taken in the next meeting, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/festive-rush-ludhiana-markets-chock-a-block-with-encroachments-once-again-101634586274279.html

In his complaint to the chief electoral officer, INLD’s election agent Rakesh Babar said that leaders of the BJP and the JJP have been continuously violating the model code of conduct for the Ellenabad bypoll.“It has been seen in many videos and clips on social media that JJP’s key person Meenu Beniwal and others are violating the model code of conduct by distributing money after the announcement of the bypoll. It has also come to the fore that many security personnel, including black commandos and paramilitary forces personnel, have been provided to Meenu Beniwal who is neither a candidate nor such a person who is legally authorised by any law or by court’s order to have this security cover due to his life threats. This amounts to a total misuse of power and wastage of the taxpayer’s money. We demand that Meenu Beniwal and his other associates be kindly directed to leave Ellenabad area till declaration of results,” he added.INLD’s Abhay Singh Chautala, who had resigned in support of farmers protesting against three farm laws on January 27, is seeking the fourth consecutive term from Ellenabad and pitted against BJP’s Gobind Kanda and Pawan Beniwal of the Congress.Beniwal is considered a close aide of Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala and it has been learnt that he had marshalled resources when the JJP was formed after a vertical split in the INLD and the Chautala family. As per sources, he was also seeking a ticket, but could not get it.

INLD state chief Nafe Singh Rathee said the BJP-JJP leaders have been making all attempts to influence the voters by distributing money and violating model code of conduct. “The election commission should take strict action against such people. It is clear that Abhay Singh Chautala is winning the by-election with a thumping majority and coalition party leaders are making all efforts through illegal means to save their candidate’s security,” he added. Sirsa deputy commissioner Anish Yadav said they have received a complaint from INLD against Meenu Beniwal for violating model code of conduct for Ellenabad bypoll.“We are looking into the complaint,” he added. Meanwhile, Meenu Beniwal said he is a resident of Ellenabad constituency and had gone to campaign for BJP-JJP candidate Gobind Kanda. “I have not violated any model code of conduct. As a citizen of this constituency, I have a right to canvas for the coalition candidate,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ellenabad-bypoll-inld-files-complaint-against-dushyant-s-aide-101634586033195.html

19-10-2021||Chandigarh||Pre-poll bonanza: Punjab govt waives water bill arrears||In a pre-poll populist move, the Punjab government on Monday decided to waive water bill arrears in rural and urban areas and free power to rural water supply schemes with effect from October 1. The decision that will put a financial burden of about ₹1,800 crore on the state, was taken during a cabinet meeting, chaired by chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi. The cabinet also gave a nod to reduce service charges on all rural water supply schemes by 70%, from ₹166 to ₹50 per household per month in the villages. Similarly, the cabinet decided to reduce water usage charges to ₹50 per month for domestic connections of all categories having plot size above 125 square yards in municipal councils and nagar panchayats and municipal corporations. Plots up to 125 square yards in urban areas have already been exempted from paying water and sewerage user charges. These concessions would benefit nearly 25 lakh families living in urban areas. It was decided in the meeting to provide funds through budgetary support to settle outstanding arrears of ₹1,168 crore of power bills of rural water supply schemes, according to an official statement. Addressing a press conference after the cabinet meeting, the CM said the state would facilitate the Centre for acquiring land for the Patti-Makhu rail link and it will be ensured that adequate compensation is given to the farmers and landowners. Deputy chief ministers Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and OP Soni and cabinet ministers Manpreet Singh Badal, Aruna Chaudhary, Vijay Inder Singla and Pargat Singh were also present in the press conference. Nod to recruit group-D employees on regular basis In another decision, the cabinet gave clearance to recruit Group-D employees on a regular basis. He slammed the previous governments for hiring people for these posts on an outsource basis. On a query about the status of contractual employees, Channi said the state government is already in the process to finalize a policy in this regard to safeguard the interest of such employees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/prepoll-bonanza-punjab-govt-waives-water-bill-arrears-101634585673203.html

You must have also got the information that some people, especially the members of Satkar committee, objected to the victim’s cremation as per Sikh rituals, citing the sacrilege of the Guru Granth Sahib,” the letter says.It adds, “In a viral video, culprits and other people can be seen saying that Lakhbir had disrespected the Sikh holy book but in reality, no video has surfaced on social media or from news organisations which can prove that Lakhbir committed sacrilege.” Sampla adds that statements given by farmer organisations or the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) indicate that the victim was found with Sarbloh Granth rather than Sri Guru Granth Sahib. “We firmly believe that SC Lakhbir should not be stated as guilty until the police investigation proves the same,” the letter says, adding that in recent times, a large number of SC Sikhs had been targeted and converted by missionaries and institutions and the process was on. He added that incidents like Lakhbir’s murder and objections to his cremation would only speed up the conversion drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lakhbirs-killing-at-singhu-border-sampla-writes-to-akal-takht-seeks-bhog-as-per-sikh-code-101634585615038.html

He has filed two separate suits of civil and criminal defamation.Apart from Vaid, the petitions have been filed against Nishant Bagh sarpanch Panch Reeta, secretary Kiran Pal and junior engineer Kulwant Singh. The court has issued notice to the defendants in the civil suit for November 12.Khurmi alleged that the road leading to his house was dug up in 2018 for reconstruction. But, the sarpanch deliberately delayed the reconstruction for around three years. In February 2021, the work started and a stretch of around 800 feet has been constructed, but a 100-feet stretch has been left out outside his house.“The road is not being constructed by the sarpanch due to political vendetta and I have been complaining to MLA Vaid and other officials, but to no avail. I was forced to move the court due to the harassment and financial loss as this has impacted my clientele,” said Khurmi.Meanwhile, Vaid said he is unaware of any petition filed against him. “I will look into the matter and if any anomalies are found in work, the officials will be directed to complete the work without discrimination,” said Vaid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-petition-filed-against-gill-mla-for-delay-in-road-project-101634585614022.html

There is a mad rush to book tickets which has translated into a single direct flight seat costing an average of over ₹1 lakh for economy travel. In pre-covid times, the rate was between ₹60,000 and ₹70,000 (depending on when one booked relative to date of travel). This means an increase of 40-50%. The maximum demand is from the Doaba region in Punjab, where parents and relatives of students in the US had been anxious for the route to open up for long. For all this while, only Green Card holders, students, US citizens and their spouses were allowed to travel there. Air India and United Airlines are booking direct flights to the US from India; American Airlines is awaiting the Centre’s approval. “Since the announcement, there has been a huge demand for bookings in November and December, but seats are limited. There are indirect flights via Europe and other countries, but due to Covid restrictions and differing rules across countries, travellers are preferring direct flights only as they do not want to waste time en route. Tickets for economy fare travel are priced ₹1 lakh and above,” said Ramanjit Singh Bedi of Prompt Travels, Chandigarh.Travel agents add that there are no appointments for Visitors’ Visa for those applying afresh at the US Embassy for the next five months. “The next slot for interview for a Visitors Visa at the US Embassy in New Delhi is available only after March 20, 2022. Applicants are also exploring dates for a Visitors’ Visa after March, such is the demand,” said Aman Phallar, of Amreen Holidays in Ludhiana.A number of travellers had booked tickets in advance, expecting that the US will open up travel from November 1. “These travellers are now having to pay hefty re-scheduling costs for their tickets,” said another travel agent.Brij Mohan Singh, a farmer from Dakha said, “My daughter got married and went to reside with her husband in the US. As we have a tourist visa, we had no other option but to wait for travel restrictions to ease. My wife and I booked our flight to the US in November the day the announcement was made.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ticket-to-us-at-rs-1-lakh-up-40-over-pre-covid-times-101634585612999.html

19-10-2021||Lucknow||Sports hub Meerut needs world-class athletics track||In a virtual interaction with Prime Minister Narendra Modi before the Tokyo Olympics in July, national champion and record holder race-walker Priyanka Goswami drew attention to the need for an international standard athletics track in her hometown Meerut, which is a sports hub.“We need to have international standard athletics track as well as dedicated coaches for young athletes,” Goswami said when the PM asked her about issues.In fact, Goswami, who finished a creditable 17th at the Summer Olympics after enjoying an early lead, was only repeating the long-pending demand of athletes of Meerut, which is also known as one of the biggest sports hubs of India. Goswami, as well as many other top athletes who have consistently been doing well at the international level, including Asian Games gold medallist discus thrower Seema Punia, Asian Games bronze medallist javelin thrower Annu Rani, long distance runner Parul Chaudhary, Rupal Chaudhary, Vidhi Singh, Chavi Sherawat, Vishal Saxena, Kuldeep belong to Meerut but practise outside the city due to the unavailability of facilities for them. “That’s a reality for the athletes of Meerut and other neighbouring districts in western Uttar Pradesh,” Anu Kumar, secretary of Meerut Athletics Association, said.“There are over 1000 plus athletes in the area, but they don’t have facilities for training. The only government-run Kailash Prakash Stadium doesn’t have even hurdles to conduct an athletics meet.”“That’s the reason why all our top athletes do train either at different SAI centres, New Delhi or go outside the country to train for the international events,” said Kumar, adding, “Even the government-run athletics hostel in Meerut was shifted elsewhere in 2005.”Instead of an athletics track, the state government has been laying a hockey astro turf at the Kailash Prakash Stadium.“It’s good to have a hockey astro turf in the city, but our primary need is an athletics track,” said Kumar who believes that strongly-built youths from the Jat community in the area are best suited for athletics and wrestling.“Kids in this community always have a strong build, height and above all the culture of a rich diet, including ghee, milk and curd that make them stronger for events like running, throwing and wrestling,” he said.“If we have an international standard athletics stadium here in Meerut, we would see this city producing many medallists at the international level.”He also said that this rural belt of western Uttar Pradesh has been a nursery of strongly-built individuals for Delhi Police and the defence forces.“You can see thousands of athletes running on the roads of Meerut and its adjoining districts early in the morning as they rely on athletics to get jobs in the Delhi Police and the armed forces,” he said.Enthusiasm for athletics in Meerut is such that even in the recent district championships, over 1000 athletes appeared in different disciplines in both the male and female categories. “We have 30-odd clubs and a few clubs of athletics in the city being run by former international athletes. They have been producing good results at the national level, that too without having even basic infrastructure.’We couldn’t get hurdles during the district meet as the person responsible for this at the Meerut stadium had gone on a personal tour and refused the facilities to us,” he said, adding, “Somehow we borrowed the equipment to conduct the meet.”“Other cities like Sonipat, Delhi and Panchkula have an adequate number of international standard athletics tracks. Covering a long distance on a routine basis for training isn’t possible for all the athletes of Meerut,” h e said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/sports-hub-meerut-needs-world-class-athletics-track-101634583512971.html

Following this, the jurisdiction of BSF was extended from 15km to 50km in the state, which is around 50% of its area.AAP Lok Sabha in-charge Amandeep Mohi and in-charge of Ludhiana east constituency, Daljit Bhola Grewal, stated that the jurisdiction has been reduced by 30 kms in Gujrat, which is surprising.“It seems like there is no issue in Gujrat but in Punjab only, due to the political interests of the Union government.

19-10-2021||Delhi||Job portal, sport centre in govt’s draft policy for differently abled||Early detection centres in all districts, a national level employment portal, and dedicated sports centres are among the provisions of a new national policy for the differently abled, a draft of which has been prepared by the department of empowerment of persons with disabilities (DEPwD) under the ministry of social justice. The draft will be finalised soon and placed in the public domain for comments, said a senior DEPwD official.“The existing policy was notified in 2006. A task force was set up in 2019 to prepare the draft policy after the new Right of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 came into force. A meeting of the expert committee is scheduled on October 25 to finalise the policy and then it will be put in the public domain,” added this person, asking not to be identified.The draft policy, derives from the Right of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act 2016) and aims to provide a framework for the implementation of the new law. The 2016 law which replaced the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995, added 14 disabilities to the seven mentioned in the latter.“The draft national policy, once notified, will cover the gaps in providing government facilities to people with disabilities,” said the official.While there are employment exchanges in various parts of the country for PwD, the new policy proposes the creation of a dedicated national level employment portal with information about government jobs for the differently abled. “Various departments issue advertisements regarding employment for PwD, but this portal will provide information regarding all the central government vacancies for people with disabilities at one place. It will also have information about various skill training centres in India,” added the official.Disability rights activists say that there are several barriers for the differently abled when it comes to employment.Subhash Chandra Vashishth, disability rights advocate and Director of Centre for Accessibility in Built Environment Foundation, said, “It is a good move to develop a dedicated national level employment portal for PwDs. But there should be provision for equal opportunity policy for the private sector, as the RPwD Act 2016 mandates. Most private establishments have not yet registered their EOPs with the Chief Commissioner/ State Commissioner as required by the Act.” His reference is to the Equal Opportunity Policy that both state-owned and private businesses were to declare and also register with the State Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities, as mandated by the 2016 law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/job-portal-sport-centre-in-govt-s-draft-policy-for-differently-abled-101634582456931.html
19-10-2021||Delhi||And the air in Delhi was ‘good’ — after 413 days||Residents of Delhi breathed good air after 413 days on Monday as heavy downpours through the day settled down pollutants. It was the first time since 2015 that the air in national capital has been so clean in October. The overall Air Quality Index in Delhi fell to 46, categorised as ‘good’ by the Central Pollution Control Board, a drop of over 250 in just a day. The index on Sunday had shot up to 298 on Sunday, which is categorised as ‘poor’ that leads to breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. The relief might be short-lived as winds from the northwest blow in smoke from the farm stubble fires in Haryana and Punjab in the coming days, experts said.Monday was Delhi’s first spell of good air not just in 2021, but since August 31 last year, data from the federal pollution watchdog showed. Delhi has not breathed good air in October since at least 2015, when the agency started keeping AQI records. The drastic fall in pollution levels was more due to the duration of the rains, scientists of the Indian weather office said, as well as showers in neighbouring states, potentially negating the effect of smoke from the burning of farm residue. “Delhi has received some intense rain spells this year, but this time, there was a drastic fall in pollution levels because the rain was widespread throughout Delhi and neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and others, and it also lasted for a longer duration,” said VK Soni, head of the environment and research department at the India Meteorological Department.“We have seen that intense rain spells during monsoon this year were usually shorter spells, which lasted between two and three hours, because of which pollution levels did not drop as drastically as they did on Monday,” Soni said.Delhi this year saw one of the most erratic monsoons ever, Met department data show. It started off with an unusually delayed arrival. Instead of it normal arrival date of June 27, monsoon this year entered the capital on July 13, 16 days behind schedule. This was the most delayed arrival in 19 years. In 2002, monsoon hit Delhi on July 19.The city progressively broke a slew of monsoon-related weather records. The rains in Delhi broke records in July, August and September. Most of the city’s rainy days saw showers concentrated into a few hours, battering the city’s infrastructure and throwing normal life off kilter. The capital’s air quality has steadily dropped all month, a decline that accelerated on Friday, when AQI reached the far end of the ‘moderate’ zone at 198. On Saturday, as winds calmed, air pollution got worse and reached 284, before climbing to 298 the next day.Delhi in 2020 recorded five good air days, the most since AQI recordings began. This, however, was likely due to curbs on social and economic activities due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The restrictions have largely been lifted now.In 2015 and 2016, Delhi did not record a single good air day. In 2017, two such days were recorded — July 30 and July 31. After another year of no good air day in 2018, Delhi in 2019 recorded two good air days on August 18 and 19, official data reveal. This respite from severe air pollution will be short-lived and air quality will start getting worse under the impact of northwesterly winds from October 21, Soni said. The winds will blow from the northeast on Tuesday and Wednesday but will change to northwesterly from Thursday, when air quality will again deteriorate, Soni said. Easterly winds on Monday ensured the share of stubble fires in Delhi’s air was only 1%, according to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) of the ministry of earth science. The rains also kept local pollutants in check, it said. “Local land surfaces are wet and so dust re-suspension is minimum; this is also keeping the PM 10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres) levels low. The presence of western disturbance has led to scattered rainfall over north India, leading to low biomass burning. This condition improved the AQI with low PM 2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) levels. Fire counts reduced to 170 and its share was only 1%,” Safar’s air quality analysis read. “Moist surfaces inhibit re-suspension of dust, which will keep the AQI in ‘good’ range for the next 24 hours and after that it will degrade to the ‘satisfactory’ category,” the analysis predicted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/and-the-air-in-delhi-was-good-after-413-days-101634582553588.html

He directed MC and railway officials to expedite the construction.Initiated in December last year, the authorities had initially set August 31 as the deadline for the ₹120-crore project. Now, they have stated that it will be completed by December 31.Earlier, cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu had assured that the RUB from Pakhowal Road towards Sarabha Nagar will be completed by August 31. The deadline was then pushed to Diwali and it has now been delayed again.An official, requesting anonymity, stated that the deadline may be further extended to February as it is difficult to complete the work by December.MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal stated that the railway department had delayed their part of the work in the past and the project is now moving fast. “The officials have been directed to further expedite the construction work and it is expected to be completed by December 31. I am monitoring the daily progress and fields inspections are also conducted frequently,” said Sabharwal.Under the project, the ROB is being constructed to facilitate movement of traffic from the Pakhowal Road canal bridge towards the Hero Bakery Chowk. While one RUB is being constructed from the Pakhowal Road canal bridge up to the Leisure Valley in Sarabha Nagar, the other RUB is being constructed from Hero Bakery Chowk up to the Pakhowal Road canal bridge.Commuters left a harried lotWith the stretch from Hero Bakery Chowk to Pakhowal Road canal bridge closed for traffic, commuters have been facing a harrowing time. Those going towards Pakhowal Road from Hero Bakery Chowk have to take a detour through Model Town Extension to reach their destination.Traffic jams at Shastri Nagar railway crossing and near Krishna Mandir in Model Town Extension have added to their woes and the pathetic condition of Ishmeet Singh Road near Pakhowal Road canal bridge has further worsened the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pakhowal-road-rob-rubs-project-ludhiana-mc-chief-directs-officials-to-expedite-work-101634582433755.html

Following this, a team of MC officials from the building branch, bridges and roads (B and R) department and operations and maintenance (O and M) cell visited the spot to initiate the process to prepare estimates for upgradation of the sewer and road infrastructure outside the house.Members of the memorial trust, including the kin of the martyr Sukhdev, have been demanding renovation of the house and the area outside for a long time. In 2018, former chief minister Captain Amarider Singh announced ₹1 crore for the work, but nothing has been done at the ground level as of now. Recently, the trust had commenced repair of the porch area outside the house.It has been learnt that the members have now approached the CM’s office and senior officials in the local bodies department, following which the local authorities have initiated the process. President of the trust, Ashok Thapar, said the house also needs renovation as the walls have weakened with passage of time and the surrounding area is in shambles. But, the house falls under the jurisdiction of the archaeological department. “We have demanded that the MC at least beautify the area outside the house and we appreciate that the work has started now. We have also been pressing for a direct approach to the house from the Chaura Bazar area. But, the authorities are delaying the process, even after the funds have been allocated for acquiring a piece of land for it. Waterlogging and lack of cleanliness are among other problems being faced at ground level,” said Thapar.Meanwhile MC additional commissioner Aaditya Dachalwal stated ₹50 lakh have been received from the state government for beautification of the area around the house. As per the demands of the trust, which includes upgrading the sewer lines and construction of road, estimates are being prepared and a team of MC officials also visited the area for the same on Monday.

However, chief judicial magistrate, Prayagraj, Harendra Nath, on the request of the CBI, extended judicial custody of the three accused till October 30 which is the next date of hearing in the case.On Monday, all the accused appeared before the court from jail through videoconferencing and refused to give their consent for the polygraph test alleging that the CBI had filed the application only to harass them.The CBI, in its application, had requested the CJM court to pass an order for carrying out a polygraph test on Anand Giri, Aadhya Prasad Tiwari and his son Sandeep Tiwari, who are in jail for allegedly abetting the suicide of Mahant Narendra Giri. Giri’s body was found hanging from a ceiling fan in his room in Baghambari Gaddi Math in Prayagraj on September 20. A purported suicide by the chief priest of Bade Hanuman Temple named his disciple Anand Giri, Bade Hanuman Temple priest Aadhya Prasad Tiwari and his son Sandeep of harassing him. All three were arrested in connection with the case.Later, an FIR was lodged against Anand Giri and two others under Section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) with Georgetown police station here. The state government first set up a special investigative team to probe the case. On September 22, the government recommended a CBI probe into the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/narendra-giri-death-cbi-plea-for-polygraph-test-of-three-accused-rejected-101634581952799.html

They pointed out that the irrigation department and Central Water and Power Resource Station (CWPRS) had not given their approval to the project.Civic activists Sarang Yadwadkar, Vijay Kumbhar and Vivek Velankar held a press conference and raised various questions about the project. “We have been asking various questions to the PMC for the last few months but neither the PMC nor the consultant have addressed them. We are surprised how the elected members have given the project their nod without studying it!” Yadwadkar said.“The irrigation department had clearly said that the PMC does not have the right to change the flood lines. However, the PMC is changing the flood lines and thereby creating land in the river. They are even planning to sell the government-owned 180 acre land around the river,” Yadwadkar said.Velankar said, “Whenever we raise questions, PMC officials say they don’t have any idea and ask us to check with the consultant instead. The PMC is answerable to the citizens not the consultant. It is the PMC’s responsibility to check the detailed project report (DPR) and address the citizens.”Kumbhar said, “If this project is executed, the city will face the problem of flooding. But political parties are not concerned about floods. They just want their share of the project/cost. Citizens should think about electing such leaders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/civic-activists-question-pmc-nod-to-riverfront-development-project-101634581892743.html

Despite having announced retirement from active politics, he remains popular in the area.Chaudhary has represented the seat as an Independent as well as on tickets of the Congress, Samata Party and its later avatar the JD(U), besides the Rashtriya Janata Dal founded and headed by Kumar’s arch rival Lalu Prasad.During the state elections last year, Chaudhary is said to have lobbied hard with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to ensure that one of his sons was fielded from Tarapur. However, as per National Democratic Alliance formula, the seat went to JD(U), which fielded sitting MLA Mewa Lal Chaudhary, who had, notably, wrested the seat from Shakuni Chaudhary himself in 2015.Mewa Lal retained the seat but died of Covid-19 earlier this year. The party has now fielded Rajiv Kumar Singh, who belongs to the same Koeri caste as the Chaudharys (Shakuni and Mewa Lal). The assembly segment has a predominance of Yadavs and Koeris and all MLAs here so far have been from either community.The ruling JD(U) had won the seat last year by defeating the RJD candidate by a margin of around 7,000 seats. This time, the party is pitted against RJD’s Arun Kumar and Rajesh Mishra of the Congress.With inputs from agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-bypolls-jd-u-eyes-tarapur-veteran-shakuni-choudhary-to-clinch-seat-101634572175384.html

Odisha vigilance officials on Monday said they seized around 1440 grams of gold and a designer necklace worth ₹24.25 lakh from his house.“During the course of searches, 1440 gm of gold and a Sabyasachi Mukherjee brand designer necklace worth ₹24.25 lakh were found in the house of Pradeep Kumar Panigrahy. Steps are being taken for their attachment. The bank accounts of Panigrahy and his family members would be blocked,” said a senior official of the vigilance department.On Sunday, Odisha vigilance officials carried out searches at several premises of Panigrahy over allegations of him possessing assets worth ₹5.05 crore which was disproportionate to his known sources of income.Vigilance officials said following allegations of possession of disproportionate assets by Panigrahy, a secret verification was conducted which revealed that the former BJD minister amassed disproportionate assets between May 2009 and November 2020. The vigilance department registered a case against Panigrahy on October 4 in this regard.The 56-year-old MLA, once considered to be the blue-eyed-boy of chief minister Naveen Patnaik, was arrested in December last year by the Odisha Crime Investigation Department (CID) over allegations of having collected money from youths in Ganjam district on behalf of his prospective son-in-law Akash Pathak, son of former IFS officer Abhay Pathak, with the false promise of providing jobs in Tata Motors.He was then slapped with six more cases in different police stations and continued to be in jail till the Orissa High Court in June granted him bail. However, Akash Pathak continues to be in jail as he is yet to get bail in a case of cheating lodged by the CID. Pathak’s father and former Indian Forest Service officer Abhay Pathak was released from jail in Bhubaneswar in July this year.Till last December, Panigrahy was considered the first among equals in the regional party and one of the very few with direct access to chief minister Naveen Patnaik. In 2004, Patnaik asked him to oversee his assembly constituency Hinjili in Ganjam district for nearly a decade. He was then given a BJD ticket in 2009 from the seaside Gopalpur constituency from where he won on a trot three times.In 2014, Patnaik made him minister of three departments, including rural development, higher education and science and technology. He was dropped from the cabinet in 2017 but was still seen as powerful. He was appointed BJD’s Ganjam district president in 2015 despite the district having three senior cabinet ministers. In 2019, he was made responsible for 15 assembly constituencies of the undivided Ganjam district in recognition of his organisational skills.His troubles began soon after the 2019 polls when he was blamed for the party’s defeat in three of the 15 constituencies. He retained his own seat Gopalpur by a slim margin of 2,600 votes, the lowest margin in Ganjam district. There were allegations that he had sabotaged the BJD’s prospects in these constituencies. His access to the chief minister ended soon after.Last year, he ran out of favour when he wrote several letters to the chief minister demanding the Odisha government to bring back migrant workers from Gujarat during the Covid-19 lockdown. He then complained that the state government was ignoring local MLAs in the fight against Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gold-designer-necklace-worth-rs-24-lakh-seized-from-ex-bjd-mla-s-house-101634571033346.html

She has bagged the All India Rank 98, and has, at the same time, become the topper among girls appearing for the nationwide engineering entrance. The only girl in the top 100 this year, the 17-year-old happy topper looks back at her preparations and calls her worry “unwarranted”.“Stressful moments are all throughout. The last 15 days, after JEE (Advanced) got over, I had been a bundle of nerves because I was worried about the rank that I was going to get with these marks. Fortunately, I got a good enough rank to get into my dream college - IIT Delhi,” says Chopra, whose mother is a Maths teacher and father is a software engineer. A student of Delhi Public School, Vasant Kunj, she says she took online classes from Allen Career Institute. Earlier this year, she had scored a full score of 300 in the IIT-JEE Main exam.Congratulatory messages are pouring in from all corners, says Chopra. “Friends are congratulating me. Treat mangte hai! We’re all planning to go somewhere outside, once Covid subsides,” she says.The pandemic has been tough and schools have been operating online. However, this didn’t have a toll on her academics. “My teachers made sure there wasn’t a lot of difference between the online and offline mode of classes. I never felt the impact of the pandemic where my studies were concerned. Of course, my social life was affected. School was way more fun offline. My friends and I used to chat all the time, we used to play in the ground. Covid has restricted a lot of things.A science student, she scored 97.2% in her class XII exams. And Chopra says she couldn’t have done it without the support of her parents! Talking about the diet she maintained during this time, she shares, “I didn’t a have a say in that aspect. I didn’t have much of an opinion on that at all. Whenever I wanted to eat something outside the routine, I’d just ask them. If they felt it wasn’t too close to an exam, they’d get it for me.”However, Chopra admits that the pressure and cut throat competition is too much for people her age. “When I look at JEE , it’s just six hours of your day that will be determining the next four years of your life. Naturally, that’s the kind of pressure that can be challenging for someone our age to handle. But when you think about it, a lot of other people are going through that too, right? I’m not the only one. There are 10 lakh such people who went through engineering entrances. When you have that thought in your brain, that you’re not alone but it’s a collective thing, it kind of reduces of gravity of that (pressure). You’re able to focus more on the actual prep rather than the pressure,” she says.Author tweets @siddhijainnFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/fortunate-to-get-a-good-enough-rank-for-my-dream-college-says-jee-advanced-girls-topper-kavya-chopra-101634554650211.html

Moscow and Beijing have cultivated close military ties in recent years at a time when their relations with the West have soured.North Korea’s latest missile launch, meanwhile, saw the US military’s Indo-Pacific Command condemning it as destabilising. South Korean and US officials were investigating if the missile was a previously unseen version displayed last week at an exhibition in Pyongyang, a South Korean source told Reuters.They were studying if the missile was fired from North Korea’s experimental Gorae-class submarine, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tensions-flare-over-missile-test-navy-drills-near-japan-101634667989804.html

But don’t call her an oldie.The 95-year-old queen has politely declined the honor of being named “Oldie of the Year” by a British magazine, saying she does not meet “the relevant criteria.”The Oldie magazine on Tuesday published the queen’s response to its suggestion that she follow in the footsteps of former recipients, including former Prime Minister John Major, actor Olivia de Havilland and artist David Hockney.“Her Majesty believes you are as old as you feel, as such The Queen does not believe she meets the relevant criteria to be able to accept, and hopes you will find a more worthy recipient,” said a letter from her assistant private secretary, Tom Laing-Baker. He ended the letter “with Her Majesty’s warmest best wishes.”The queen, who was widowed this year, still keeps a busy schedule of royal duties. On Tuesday she held audiences with diplomats and hosted a reception at Windsor Castle for global business leaders.The Oldie of the Year prize honors people of advanced age who have made a special contribution to public life. The queen’s husband Prince Philip, who died in April, received the accolade in 2011, when he was 90.After the queen declined, this year’s Oldie of the Year award went to movie royalty instead: French-American actress and dancer Leslie Caron, 90.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hope-you-find-worthy-recipient-queen-elizabeth-ii-rejects-oldie-award-101634664805432.html
19-10-2021||World||Zalmay Khalilzad, US special envoy to Afghanistan, steps down||Zalmay Khalilzad, the US special envoy for Afghanistan Reconciliation who negotiated the February 2020 accord that led to the withdrawal of US-led international forces, has resigned.He will be succeeded by his deputy Thomas West, who was part of the national security team of US President Joe Biden when he was vice-president.US secretary of state Antony Blinken announced Khalilzad’s departure in a statement on Monday, saying, “As he steps down from his role, I extend my gratitude for his decades of service to the American people.”In his resignation letter to Blinken, Zalmay wrote, as reported by The Washington Post, “I decided that now is the right time… at a juncture when we are entering a new phase in our Afghanistan policy.”Zalmay Khalilzad was a familiar figure in New Delhi where he dropped by often to keep the Indian government in the loop on the Afghan peace process. But the US evidently did not tell the Indians all that was happening as external affairs minister S Jaishankar recently said that “we were not taken into confidence on various aspects” of the 2020 agreement.Khalilzad, an Afghan-American, was named special representative in 2018 by then secretary of state Mike Pompeo to lead negotiations for a settlement in Afghanistan that could pave the way for the withdrawal of US forces and end one of America’s endless wars.Zalmay Khalilzad failed to bring the Taliban and the elected government of then Afghanistan president Ashraf Ghani to the table, but did succeed in getting a deal signed by the US with the Taliban in February 2020, which provided the basis for the withdrawal of US-led troops by Biden, completed in August.The controversial accord was widely slammed for giving away too much to the Taliban in return for very little. And Khalilzad, who negotiated the deal with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a Taliban co-founder and now a deputy prime minister, carried the burden of the criticism.“Khalilzad negotiated a bad deal with the Taliban, which triggered a debacle that he failed to anticipate or handle,” said Husain Haqqani, former Pakistani ambassador to the US and South Asia expert at Hudson Institute, a leading US think tank. “He equated US withdrawal with peace, and bypassed and marginalised America’s Afghan allies. Khalilzad handed the keys to Kabul to the Taliban in return for promises everyone knew the Taliban would not keep. One can only hope Tom West does a better job of understanding who the Taliban are and what might be the limits of negotiating with them.”Biden has said that it was not an agreement that he would have signed, and he and his officials often said it tied their hands on Afghanistan. But instead of renegotiating it, he went ahead to honour America’s commitment to withdraw its forces, though the Taliban did not abide by most their commitments.“The Talibs committed to not allow terrorist groups, including Al-Qaida, [to] plan or carry out attacks against the security of the US and our allies,” Khalilzad wrote in his letter. “They further agreed not to allow terrorists to recruit, train or fundraise in the territories they controlled. They also agreed to negotiate directly with the existing Afghan government for a power-sharing agreement and a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire.”The Taliban remain thick with Al-Qaeda, which remains present in Afghanistan, according to assessment by several intelligence agencies and analysts. Zalmay Khalilzad was expected to leave office in May after Biden announced a timeline of the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, shifting the Trump administration’s deadline from May 1 to September 11, and subsequently to August 31. He was asked to stay on, but his exit had been on the cards for a while. Speculation was rife when he missed the first post-withdrawal meeting between the US and the Taliban in Doha on October 9, in which West led the US team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/zalmay-khalilzad-us-special-envoy-to-afghanistan-steps-down-101634665193327.html
19-10-2021||World||Taliban ‘interior minister’ Sirajuddin Haqqani lauds suicide bombers, hands out aid to kin||The Taliban’s “interior minister”, Sirajuddin Haqqani, a UN-designated terrorist for whom the US has offered a $10-million bounty, has praised suicide bombers and pledged support for the families of fighters killed in suicide attacks. Haqqani, a top leader of the Haqqani Network that has strong links with the Pakistani military, distributed 10,000 Afghanis (about $110) and clothes to the families of suicide attackers and promised them a plot of land during a meeting held at Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul on Monday. Photos posted on Twitter by pro-Taliban accounts showed the event was attended by hundreds of men. Haqqani was featured in several of the photos, though his face was blurred or he was photographed from the rear. The Haqqani Network was blamed by Indian and US officials for the July 2008 suicide attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul that killed 58 people and injured nearly 150. Among the dead were the Indian defence attaché, Brig Ravi Datt Mehta, diplomat V Venkateswara Rao and two Indo-Tibetan Border Police personnel.Saeed Khosty, the interior ministry spokesman, said on Twitter that Haqqani had “met the family members of martyred Fidayeen” at the hotel. “In his speech, the Interior Minister praised the jihad & sacrifices of Mujahideen & martyrs. He called them heroes of Islam & the country. [Haqqani] told everyone about the memories of the martyred (Fidayeen) their piety & deeds. He called them heroes of the believing nation,” Khosty tweeted. “Now you & I must refrain from betraying the aspirations of our martyrs,” Haqqani was quoted as saying by Khosty. Khosty also confirmed Haqqani had distributed 10,000 Afghanis and clothes to the families of the suicide bombers and “promised a plot for each (martyr’s) family”. Several photos showed Haqqani embracing relatives of the suicide bombers and praying at the meeting. The interior ministry also said in a statement that Haqqani paid tribute to the suicide bombers by describing them as “martyrdom seekers” and “holy warriors”. Ironically, the hotel in which the meeting was held had been targeted in January 2018 by Taliban fighters who killed 40 people, including 14 foreigners. The Taliban has carried out scores of suicide attacks across Afghanistan in recent years that killed thousands of Afghans and foreign troops. In a separate development, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Pakistan’s Bol TV news channel that the group’s army has several units of suicide bombers. “The time for carrying out more suicide attacks is over, but we still have groups of suicide bombers who will not hesitate to sacrifice their lives for the defence of the country,” he said, speaking in Pashto. “Some groups have special names while others are known as fidayeen units and these will all be part of our strong forces,” he added. Mujahid said only males are allowed to carry out suicide attacks, though women had participated in the jihad in the past. “Even in those times, women were not allowed to carry out suicide attacks. Males in suicide attack groups are given training so that they can defend the country when the time comes,” he said. Sirajuddin Haqqani is on the FBI’s most wanted list for terrorism and carries a bounty of $10 million on his head under the US Rewards For Justice programme. A listing on the “most wanted” section of the FBI website states: “Sirajuddin Haqqani is wanted for questioning in connection with the January 2008 attack on a hotel in Kabul, Afghanistan, that killed six people, including an American citizen. He is believed to have coordinated and participated in cross-border attacks against United States and coalition forces in Afghanistan.” Haqqani was also allegedly involved in planning an assassination attempt on former Afghan president Hamid Karzai in 2008.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-interior-minister-sirajuddin-haqqani-lauds-suicide-bombers-hands-out-aid-to-kin-101634664173066.html
19-10-2021||World||Haiti gang seeks $17M for kidnapped US missionaries: Report||A gang that kidnapped 17 members of a US-based missionary group has demanded a $17 million ransom for them, according to Haiti's justice minister, as quoted by the Wall Street Journal.Justice minister Liszt Quitel said the gang was demanding $1 million per person. Quitel did not immediately return messages for comment, but he also confirmed the figure to the New York Times. The Journal said he identified the ages of the abducted children as 8 months and 3, 6, 14 and 15 years.A wave of kidnappings prompted a protest strike that shuttered businesses, schools and public transportation in a new blow to Haiti's anemic economy, and unions and other groups vowed to continue the shutdown Tuesday.FBI agents and other US officials are helping Haitian authorities hunt for the 12 adults and five children linked to the Christian Aid Ministries in Ohio who were kidnapped Saturday during a trip to visit an orphanage.It is the largest reported kidnapping of its kind in recent years, with Haitian gangs growing more brazen and abductions spiking as the country tries to recover from the July 7 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse and a magnitude 7.2 earthquake that struck southern Haiti on Aug. 14 and killed more than 2,200 people.“We are calling on authorities to take action,” said Jean-Louis Abaki, a moto taxi driver who joined the strike Monday to decry killings and kidnappings in the hemisphere's poorest nation.With the usually chaotic streets of Haiti’s capital quiet and largely empty Monday, Abaki said that if Prime Minister Ariel Henry and National Police Chief Léon Charles want to stay in power, “they have to give the population a chance at security.”Haitian police told The Associated Press that the abduction of the 16 Americans and one Canadian was carried out by the 400 Mawozo gang, a group with a long record of killings, kidnappings and extortion. In April, a man who claimed to be the gang's leader told a radio station that it was responsible for abducting five priests, two nuns and three relatives of one of the priests that month. They were later released.At least 328 kidnappings were reported to Haiti’s National Police in the first eight months of 2021, compared with a total of 234 for all of 2020, said a report last month by the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti.Gangs have been accused of kidnapping schoolchildren, doctors, police officers, bus passengers and others as they grow more powerful and demand ransoms ranging from a couple hundred dollars to millions of dollars.Ned Price, the US State Department's spokesman, said US officials have been in constant contact with Haiti's National Police, the missionary group and the victims' relatives.“This is something that we have treated with the utmost priority since Saturday,” he said, adding that officials are doing “all we can to seek a quick resolution to this.”UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the rise in gang violence has affected relief efforts in Haiti. He said the UN resident and humanitarian coordinator reported that “violence, looting, road blockades and the persistent presence of armed gangs all pose obstacles to humanitarian access. The situation is further complicated by very serious fuel shortages and the reduced supply of goods."Dujarric said that Haiti's government should redouble efforts to reform and strengthen the police department to address public safety and that all crimes must be investigated.Christian Aid Ministries said the kidnapped group included six women, six men and five children, including a 2-year-old. A sign on the door at the organization’s headquarters in Berlin, Ohio, said it was closed due to the kidnapping situation.Among those kidnapped were four children and one of their parents from a Michigan family, their pastor told The Detroit News. The youngest from the family is under 10, said minister Ron Marks, who declined to identify them. They arrived in Haiti earlier this month, he said.A pair of traveling Christians stopped by the organization’s headquarters Monday with two young children to drop off packages for impoverished nations. Tirtzah Rarick, originally of California, said she and a friend prayed on Sunday with those who had relatives among the abductees.“Even though it’s painful and it provokes us to tears that our friends and relatives, our dear brothers and sisters, are suffering right now in a very real physical, mental and emotional way, it is comforting to us that we can bring these heavy burdens to the God that we worship,” she said.News of the kidnappings spread swiftly in and around Holmes County, Ohio, hub of one of the nation’s largest populations of Amish and conservative Mennonites, said Marcus Yoder, executive director of the Amish & Mennonite Heritage Center in nearby Millersburg, Ohio.Christian Aid Ministries is supported by conservative Mennonite, Amish and related groups in the Anabaptist tradition.The organization was founded in the early 1980s and began working in Haiti later that decade, said Steven Nolt, professor of history and Anabaptist studies at Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania. The group has year-round mission staff in Haiti and several countries, he said, and it ships religious, school and medical supplies throughout the world.Conservative Anabaptists, while disagreeing over technology and other issues, share traditions such as modest, plain clothing, separation from mainstream society, closely disciplined congregations and a belief in nonresistance to violence.The Amish and Mennonite communities in Holmes County have a close connection with missionary organisations serving Haiti.Every September at the Ohio Haiti Benefit Auction, handmade furniture, quilts, firewood and tools are sold, and barbecue chicken and Haitian beans and rice are dished up. The event typically brings in about $600,000 that is split between 18 missionary groups, said Aaron Miller, one of the organizers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/haiti-gang-seeks-17m-for-kidnapped-us-missionaries-report-101634653238138.html

The announcement was made by British health minister Sajid Javid who said that the national Covid-19 vaccine booking service would be opened up in order to ramp up the number of younger people receiving shots."I think it is important for anyone who is invited as eligible for the vaccine, including young people, that they do come forward and take up that offer," Javid told parliament, according to Reuters.Britain, as it relaxed restrictions and reopened activities this summer, has been reporting a daily jump in new Covid-19 cases recently—much higher than in other western European countries.Furthermore, coronavirus cases have fuelled among those aged 17 and younger nationally, causing concern among scientists that vaccines are being rolled out in schools too slowly.The Boris Johnson-led government has said that it is keeping a "very close eye" on rising levels of Covid-19 infections and has a plan in place to deal with the viral disease and deaths are broadly flat.The UK recorded 49,156 new Covid-19 infections on Monday, the highest spike since mid-July. The country has reported an average of 43,000 cases a day over the past week, 15 per cent higher compared to the week before. New infections have risen by more than 60 per cent in the last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-covid-19-spike-uk-set-to-open-up-vaccine-bookings-for-children-aged-1215-101634644718422.html

And yet Africa’s 54 countries are responsible for less than 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions.The new report seizes on the shrinking glaciers of Mount Kilimanjaro, Mount Kenya and the Rwenzori Mountains in Uganda as symbols of the rapid and widespread changes to come. “Their current retreat rates are higher than the global average. If this continues, it will lead to total deglaciation by the 2040s,” it says.Massive displacement, hunger and increasing climate shocks such droughts and flooding are in the future, and yet the lack of climate data in parts of Africa “is having a major impact” on disaster warnings for millions of people, WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said at Tuesday’s launch.Estimates of the economic effects of climate change vary across the African continent, but “in sub-Saharan Africa, climate change could further lower gross domestic product by up to 3% by 2050,” Josefa Leonel Correia Sacko with the African Union Commission writes in the report. “Not only are physical conditions getting worse, but also the number of people being affected is increasing.”By 2030, up to 118 million extremely poor people, or those living on less than $1.90 a day, “will be exposed to drought, floods and extreme heat in Africa if adequate response measures are not put in place,” Sacko adds.Already, the UN has warned that the Indian Ocean island nation of Madagascar is one where “famine-like conditions have been driven by climate change.” And it says parts of South Sudan are seeing the worst flooding in almost 60 years.Despite the threats ahead to the African continent, the voices of Africans have been less represented than richer regions at global climate meetings and among the authors of the crucial Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scientific assessments. African participation in IPCC reports has been “extremely low,” according to Future Climate for Africa, a multi-country research program.The costs ahead are huge. “Overall, Africa will need investments of over $3 trillion in mitigation and adaptation by 2030 to implement its (national climate plans), requiring significant, accessible and predictable inflows of conditional finance,” the WMO's Taalas said.“The cost of adapting to climate change in Africa will rise to $50 billion per year by 2050, even assuming the international efforts to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/africas-glaciers-to-disappear-soon-118mn-may-face-droughts-floods-report-101634637395665.html
19-10-2021||World||Indo-Canadian Amarjeet Sohi, ex-cabinet minister, elected mayor of Edmonton||Former Indo-Canadian cabinet minister Amarjeet Sohi has been elected mayor of the city of Edmonton in Canada’s Alberta. The 57-year-old had opted out of contesting in recently held general elections to focus on winning the mayoral polls. A former city bus driver, Sohi served in the City Council before he ran for the Liberal Party from the riding of Edmonton Mill Woods in the 2015 national elections. After narrowly defeating then minister of state Tim Uppal of the Conservative Party, Sohi was appointed cabinet minister by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Over the next four years, he handled the portfolios of natural resources, and then infrastructure and communities.Sohi, who was born in what is now the Malerkotla district of Punjab, had lost to Uppal in 2019 and thereafter set his sights on the mayoral elections.He defeated his closest rival Mike Nickel on Monday night in mayoral polls that are traditionally not held along party lines.Outgoing mayor Don Iveson congratulated Sohi on his victory, saying, “I’ve had the pleasure of working with mayor-elect Sohi during his time as city councilor, and have always appreciated and been inspired by how hard he has worked for our community. I have no doubt Edmonton will thrive under his leadership.”Another mayor of Indian origin is completing his term leading the city of Calgary, also in Alberta. Naheed Nenshi, the first Muslim to be elected mayor of a major Canadian city when he achieved that feat in 2010, has chosen not to run again. The new mayor in the city also has roots in India as Jyoti Gondek was elected on Monday night. She was born in the UK to Punjabi parents, originally from India, and the family emigrated to Canada when she was aged four.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indocanadian-amarjeet-sohi-ex-cabinet-minister-elected-mayor-of-edmonton-101634630257857.html

19-10-2021||World||New Zealand's Covid-19 cases touch all-time high, govt pushes for vaccination||New Zealand counted its most new coronavirus cases of the pandemic Tuesday as an outbreak in its largest city grew and officials urged vaccinations as a way out of Auckland's two-month lockdown.Health officials found 94 new local infections, eclipsing the 89 that were reported twice during the early days of the pandemic 18 months ago. Most of the new cases were in Auckland, but seven were found in the nearby Waikato district.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said lockdown rule-breakers were contributing to the spread of infections and noted that many of the new cases had been detected among younger people.“I know the highs and lows of cases is incredibly hard on people, particularly those in Tamaki Makaurau," Ardern said, using the Indigenous Maori name for Auckland. “I just wanted to reinforce again that we're not powerless. We do have the ability to keep cases as low as we can.”New Zealand had successfully eliminated earlier outbreaks by imposing a strict lockdown and by aggressively contact-tracing and isolating those who were infectious. But the approach failed against the more transmissible delta variant. The government has since eased some of Auckland's lockdown rules, allowing more people to return to work.Ardern has also embarked on an all-out effort to get people vaccinated. That's included a televised “Vaxathon” festival on Saturday which saw a record 130,000 people getting shots, more than 2% of the New Zealand's population of 5 million.Ardern has promised to outline a path out of lockdown for Auckland based on vaccination numbers.The government has previously talked about the importance of getting 90% of people aged 12 and over fully vaccinated, including a high proportion of Maori, who have been particularly hard hit by the outbreak.But that goal remains some distance away, with 85% of eligible people having had at least one dose and 67% fully vaccinated. The numbers are lower among Maori.Professor Michael Baker, an epidemiologist at the University of Otago, said he was concerned that contact tracers in Auckland would soon become overwhelmed. He said lawmakers needed to consider temporarily reimposing stricter lockdown rules as a circuit breaker.“There are burning embers all over city,” Baker said. “They have lifted the wet blanket of the strong lockdown, and people are getting lockdown fatigue."Baker said he thought it was possible for the government to continue eliminating the outbreak outside of Auckland, provided it kept in place strict border controls around the city.He said the most important goal in any reopening would be to ensure the health system was not overrun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-covid-19-cases-touch-all-time-high-govt-pushes-for-vaccination-101634627215625.html
19-10-2021||World||China’s ‘hypersonic missile’ raises concerns over weakness in US defences||China’s reported launch of a hypersonic missile into orbit has raised concerns that US rivals are quickly neutralising the Pentagon’s missile defenses even as it invests tens of billions of dollars in upgrades. In a test two months ago, the Chinese military sent a nuclear-capable missile into low-orbit space and around the globe before cruising down to its target, the Financial Times reported Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter. Although the weapon missed its mark by about two dozen miles, the paper said, the technology, once perfected, could be used to send nuclear warheads over the South Pole and around American anti-missile systems in the northern hemisphere. China disputed the paper’s account, with Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian describing it as a “routine test of a space vehicle to verify technology for spacecraft reusability” and comparing it with systems being developed by private companies. “China will work with other countries in the world for the peaceful use of space for the benefit of mankind,” Zhao told a regular news briefing Monday. If the missile test is confirmed, it would suggest that Chinese President Xi Jinping may be exploring orbital strikes as a way to counter American advancements in shooting down ballistic missiles before they can threaten the US homeland. The Russians considered such “fractional orbital bombardment systems” during the Soviet era before abandoning them. But in 2018, Russia rolled out a series of new weapons that President Vladimir Putin said would render US missile defenses “ineffective.”The moves illustrate how the Pentagon’s push to develop and deploy more advanced anti-missile systems, ostensibly to protect against weapons from North Korea and Iran, may be accelerating a new nuclear arms race. Kim Jong Un over the past few years has unveiled a wide range of missiles -- testing what his regime described as a hypersonic glide vehicle last month -- designed to thwart American and allied defenses.Under Kim, North Korea has developed a series of solid-fuel ballistic missiles designed to fly too low to be intercepted by a U.S.-operated antimissile system known as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD. The missiles may also be too fast to be stopped by Patriot surface-to-air missiles that defend against low-altitude rockets, weapons experts said.Kim Jong Un’s ‘Son of Scud’ Poses New Threat to US TroopsLi Nan, a visiting senior research fellow at the East Asian Institute specializing in Chinese security and military policies at the National University of Singapore, described China sending a missile into orbit as “a game-changer.” “If China was able to deploy one, that would basically neutralize U.S. missile defense,” Li said. “It makes it very hard for the U.S. to deal with this new type of missile and will make it very costly to combat and build up new capabilities to counteract this technology.” After years of development, a U.S. Navy destroyer last year successfully intercepted a mock intercontinental ballistic missile designed to simulate one developed by North Korea. The test, which the head of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency described as an “incredible accomplishment and critical milestone,” would potentially allow ships in the U.S.’s Seventh Fleet to shoot down missiles in addition to 44 interceptors based in silos in California and Alaska. The MDA plans to spend $45 billion between fiscal year 2020 and FY24, the Government Accountability Office said in April, after spending about $163 billion over the previous two decades. The Biden administration has pressed ahead with plans to develop a new anti-missile warhead and expand defense systems in Alaska and Europe, despite cost overruns and delays.The U.S. and China have increasingly squared off in places like the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait as part of what the Biden administration has characterized as “strategic competition” between the world’s two largest economies. The threat of a U.S. strike that wipes out Chinese missiles before they can hit an American target, has long been seen as a deterrent against more assertive military action by Beijing. The U.S., like Russia, holds more than 4,000 warheads, according to a June report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The PLA Rocket Force, by comparison, added about 30 warheads to its stockpile of about 320 bombs over the past year.Developing hypersonic glide vehicles are one way for countries such as China and North Korea to make the most of their smaller number of warheads, said Melissa Hanham, a non-proliferation expert and an affiliate with the Stanford Center for International Security and Cooperation. She said there wasn’t yet any public evidence that either country was considering an orbital bombardment strategy. ‘Extremely Risky’“However, weaponizing space in this way is extremely risky and destabilizing should any country pursue it,” Hanham said. “It raises the stakes of an unintended escalation which could lead to nuclear war.”  Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby declined to comment on the Financial Times report Monday, saying only that Beijing’s efforts to advance its military showed why the U.S. regarded China as its “No. 1 pacing challenge.” “We have made clear our concerns about the military capabilities China continues to pursue, capabilities that only increase tensions in the region and beyond,” Kirby said. The August test was one of several recent moves by Beijing that appeared intended to overcome U.S. advantages in both warhead stockpiles and missile shields and establish a more favorable balance of power. China is building at least 250 missile silos in at least three sites, according to independent analysis of satellite imagery, causing non-proliferation experts to speculate that the People’s Liberation Army might leave many empty to confuse and distract U.S. military planners. Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Communist Party’s Global Times newspaper, tweeted the Financial Times story Sunday, saying that Beijing would improve its nuclear deterrence to “ensure that the U.S. abandons the idea of nuclear blackmail against China.”Ankit Panda, the Stanton senior fellow in the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said China’s description of the test as a “space vehicle” likely can’t be taken at face value, since putting a hypersonic glide vehicle into orbit wouldn’t be routine. Although U.S. ship-based systems might be able to intercept such an attack by an intercontinental ballistic missile, Panda said, ground-based systems in the north wouldn’t. “Existing U.S. counter-ICBM defenses all rely on intercepting the incoming warhead outside the atmosphere, which is partly why China has looked to gliders in the first place,” Panda said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-hypersonic-missile-raises-concerns-over-weakness-in-us-defences-101634625550098.html
19-10-2021||World||Trudeau visits indigenous community, says sorry for holidaying on Sept 30||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologised in person before an indigenous gathering in the province of British Columbia for having gone on vacation when the country marked its first National Day for Truth and Reconciliation on September 30.Trudeau visited the Tk’emlups te Secwepemc Nation community and held a press conference with its chief Rosanne Casimir. This First Nations band is close to Kamloops in British Columbia where 215 unmarked graves of indigenous children were discovered last summer, followed by several other similar findings.Referring to his decision to go on holiday on September 30, Justin Trudeau said, “It was a mistake and I understand that it made a very difficult day even harder.” The day was made a national holiday by the Trudeau government itself earlier this year. He faced flak from the indigenous community for choosing to go vacationing on the date that commemorated the tragedy faced by children of the erstwhile residential school system.As that day was observed at the end of last month, Justin Trudeau’s official schedule stated he was having private meetings in Ottawa. However, he had actually flown to the resort of Tofino, also in British Columbia, for a family holiday and filmed on a beach by the outlet Global News. His office later updated his itinerary with the holiday.His move drew criticism in Canada from various indigenous groups such as the Native Women’s Association of Canada (NWAC). It issued a statement on Friday expressing “shock and dismay” over Trudeau holidaying in Tofino. NWAC CEO Lynne Groulx said the “decision to duck out entirely” on this particular day was “astounding for its sheer level of callousness”.On Monday, Casimir appeared to accept the apology even as she scolded Justin Trudeau over rejecting invitations from the indigenous community and choosing to holiday - even as he looked on. She said, “The shock, anger and sorrow and disbelief was palpable in our community.” However, she said, his appearance on Monday was “about making some positive steps forward and rectifying a mistake”.Emotions over the controversial treatment of Canada’s indigenous people have been high this year due to a series of discoveries of hundreds of unmarked graves of children at or close to the location of residential schools that were operated by the Catholic Church from the mid-19th century into the 1970s.Last summer in Canada, 182 such graves were found near the town of Cranbrook in British Columbia, 751 in Saskatchewan and 215 in Kamloops, also in British Columbia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justin-trudeau-visits-indigenous-community-says-sorry-for-holidaying-on-sept-30-101634626117346.html

The request came from Pfizer-BioNTech on Monday, whose new vaccine candidate is meant for children in the age group of aged 5-11 years.As of now, Covid-19 vaccines approved for emergency use in Canada are for those aged 12 years and above.Pfizer’s jabs account for the majority of Covid-19 vaccines administered in Canada, at over 46 million doses. However, the doses for children below 12 cannot be drawn from existing stocks, and will have to be a different formulation and delivered in smaller doses.Health Canada said, “As with all Covid-19 vaccines, the department will prioritise the review of this submission [from Pfizer], while maintaining its high scientific standards for safety, efficacy and quality.”It said it will authorise use of the Pfizer vaccine’s pediatric version “if the independent and thorough scientific review of all the data included in the submission showed that the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the potential risks in this age group”.So far, around 82% of the eligible population in Canada has been vaccinated against Covid-19.Health Canada said this was the first submission it has received that aims to vaccinate the 5-11 age group against Covid-19, and studies of the pediatric jab “are ongoing” in children below five years of age.Pfizer apart, other pharma companies are also learnt to be testing their Covid-19 vaccines for children of various age groups. Health Canada is expecting to receive more data for review in the coming months.According to a survey from the agency Angus Reid Institute, 51% of those people sampled in Canada say they will get their children, aged between 5 and 11 years, vaccinated against Covid-19 as soon as a jab is available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccine-canada-reviewing-pfizer-jab-for-children-aged-5-11-years-101634622877277.html

The figures come a day after figures showed the world's second-biggest economy grew slower than forecast in the same period owing to the regulatory tightening as well as an energy crunch.Real estate output shrank 1.6 per cent on-year, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a report breaking down changes in gross domestic product. The reading marks the first contraction since the first three months of 2020 – when China's Covid-19 outbreak was at its height – and reverse from its 7.1 per cent growth in April-June.At the same time, output from construction slipped 1.8 per cent, the report said, also representing its first decline since the first quarter of last year. Before the pandemic, China's construction sector had never shrunk since at least 1992 when data started being collected, according to data cited by Bloomberg News.Property and construction are pillars of the Chinese economy, underpinning other important sectors such as commodities and furnishings.But they have taken a hit as Beijing wages a regulatory clampdown on the real estate sector, including by tightening rules on lending.The move comes against the backdrop of a $300 billion debt crisis at China Evergrande – one of the nation's biggest property developers – that has hammered investor sentiment and fuelled fears of a spillover into the wider economy.China's central bank has said the risk of contagion is "controllable" and Evergrande will be able to resume unfinished projects.Tuesday's report also showed growth in China's manufacturing output slowed to 4.6 per cent in the third quarter, down from 9.2 per cent in the previous three months, as production curbs at factories battling ongoing energy shortages began to bite.At a news briefing Monday, NBS spokesman Fu Linghui said “current international environment uncertainties are mounting and the domestic economic recovery is still unstable and uneven.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-real-estate-construction-sectors-shrink-for-first-time-since-covid-19-began-101634622362138.html
19-10-2021||World||China: CPC leader sanctioned for violations in Xinjiang takes charge of Tibet||A rising Chinese politician sanctioned by western countries for alleged human rights violations in Xinjiang has been appointed as the Communist Party of China (CPC) chief of Tibet, Chinese official media reported on Tuesday.Wang Junzheng, 58, was the deputy secretary of the CPC committee of Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR) and political commissar of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps.Wang’s appointment for the Tibet role will come under the focus of global rights groups and will be closely tracked by New Delhi in the backdrop of the ongoing border tension along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.The status of current Communist Party secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), 65-year-old Wu Yingjie, who had assumed office in 2016, was not immediately clear though it is likely that he has retired.Earlier this year, the US treasury department had sanctioned Wang, and Chen Mingguo, director of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau, for alleged human rights abuses against the Muslim Uighur community.The two were targeted for their role in Xinjiang under the US Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, it said, adding that the move complemented actions taken by the EU, Britain and Canada.“The United States is committed to using the full breadth of its financial powers to promote accountability for the serious human rights abuses occurring in Xinjiang,” the US treasury department had said.Reacting to the sanctions, Wang had told Chinese official media that the move was based on “lies and false information; are a gross slander and an affront to the reputation and dignity of the Chinese people; a flagrant interference in China’s internal affairs; and a grave violation of China’s sovereignty and security interests”. Wang’s appointment for the Tibet role was announced by Zeng Yichun, vice-minister of the organisation department of the CPC’s Central Committee on Tuesday at a meeting of the leading party cadres of TAR in Lhasa.Zeng said the decision was made after thorough consideration and careful study in light of the “overall situation and actual situation of the leadership of the region”.For the Tibet Autonomous Region’s new party chief, Wang, the promotion is a critical one.In 2019, Wang, former party chief of Changchun city, had taken over as the head of the political and legal affairs commission - the top political body responsible for law and order in the region - in XUAR; and in 2020, he was again promoted as deputy CPC secretary of the autonomous region.Earlier this month, Yan Jinhai was appointed deputy chairperson and acting chairperson of TAR while former chairman, Qizhala, resigned, and is expected to take up a new role in Beijing.The reshuffle is likely part of the build-up to the five-yearly CPC Congress to be held next autumn when China’s President Xi Jinping is expected to start his third five-year term as party general secretary, the first Chinese leader to do so in decades.In July, Xi became the first top Chinese leader to visit Tibet since 1990. During his visit, Xi stressed both social stability and the importance of border security for the mountainous region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-cpc-leader-sanctioned-for-violations-in-xinjiang-takes-charge-of-tibet-101634621076943.html

Muslims across the world celebrate the day, which is also a designated holiday in many parts of the world.Mawlid al-Nabi in Arabic translates to the “birthday of the prophet” and is observed on the 12th day of the month of Rabi-ul-Awwal, the third month of the Islamic lunar calendar, which commences with the sighting of the moon.History and significance of MawlidMuslims around the world believe that the day holds a special significance in their calendar. The history of Mawlid goes back to the early days of Islam when a few followers of the Prophet Muhammad, known as Tabi’un, started holding sessions of poetry and songs to honour their leader.The focus of Eid Milad-un-Nabi is to celebrate the life of the Prophet - his teachings, sufferings, and his character - as he even forgave his enemies. His teachings still continue to influence believers and instill them with the will to follow the path of righteousness.Muslims celebrate the occasion by wearing new clothes, offering prayers, and exchanging gifts. The day is celebrated by preparing special meals at mosques and at home with friends and family.In the Middle East, streets are often decorated with lights, and food and sweets are distributed to the public.This year, as per the Gregorian calendar, the celebration began from the evening of October 18 and will last till the evening of October 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-mawlid-how-is-it-celebrated-around-the-world-101634617469802.html

diamond merchant and two of his associates, seeking dismissal of fraud allegations against them by the trustee of three companies they previously owned indirectly.The allegations were made in a New York court by Richard Levin, the court appointed trustee of three US corporations--Firestar Diamond, Fantasy Inc and A Jaffe--indirectly owned by 50-year-old Modi previously.Levin had also sought a minimum compensation of USD 15 million for “harm” suffered by the debtors of Nirav Modi and his associates Mihir Bhansali and Ajay Gandhi.Southern District of New York Bankruptcy Court Judge Sean H Lane issued the order last Friday, in a major blow to the Indian fugitive and his accomplices.Nirav Modi, who is currently lodged in a jail in the UK, is challenging India's attempts to extradite him to face charges of fraud and money laundering in the Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case.“SDNY Bankruptcy Court Judge Lane in a clear decision denied defendants Modi, Bansali and Gandhi’s motions to dismiss US Trustee Richard Levin’s amended complaint in the adversary proceeding arising out of Modi’s initial chapter 11 bankruptcy petition, alleging fraud, breach of fiduciary duties, RICO and related state law claims,” Indian American attorney Ravi Batra told PTI.Explaining the 60-page order, Batra said Modi ploughed his profits back into his own company as additional sales to falsely raise the stock price/company valuation by setting up a scheme to defraud Punjab National Bank (PNB) and other banks of over USD 1 billion by a “shell game,” where the ball gets bigger with each sleight of hand, and then issue Letters of Undertaking (sort of a guarantee) to PNB and get loans based upon the inflated ball’s value.“But to get the ill-gotten funds by bank fraud out of his companies, he engaged in a separate fraud to hide those withdrawals for personal benefit as if they were ordinary business transactions,” Batra said based on the court papers.According to the court order, Levin’s petition sought to recover damages for harm inflicted by Modi and his two accomplices on the debtors and their estates as a result of his six-year extensive international fraud, money laundering and embezzlement scheme.The scheme resulted in accrual of claims against the debtors of over USD 1 billion in favour of Punjab National Bank, the diversion of millions of dollars of the debtors’ assets for the benefit of the family of Modi and Bhansali, and the collapse of the debtors and the resulting loss of value of their businesses.“The court’s refusal to dismiss RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) count is legally satisfying, but there is a hole in this celebration by law abiding banks and people: once the appeals are taken, and Modi remains charged with the US Trustee’s amended complaint, in whole or in part, and the case goes to a jury and wins a judgment, it’s only the assets Modi and his cohorts then have can they be compelled to disgorge,” Batra said.“Here, as in every type of “pump and dump” cases, it’s not what was fraudulently taken from Banks' remains, but the size of the original ball’s value in the shell game, less high living expenses, waste, defence fees, etc. Today is a great day for the rule of law, thanks to Judge Lane, as now Modi’s US companies, run by the US Trustee, are going after Modi and his co-defendants so Punjab National Bank can get 10-25 cents on the dollar,” Batra told PTI in response to a question.According to the court ruling, from early 2011 to early 2018, Modi and his associates orchestrated and carried out a scheme to “obtain loans, credits, or other funds under false pretences and without collateral” from numerous banks, including the PNB.The bank fraud involved the use of letters of undertaking (LoUs), a financial instrument unique to India, designed to facilitate efficient import transactions.Modi and the co-conspirators sought to artificially inflate the import volumes of Modi’s India-based companies with sham transactions so as to obtain more LoU funding, it alleged.To carry out this scheme, Modi and his co-conspirators used a web of shell companies known as “shadow entities” based in Hong Kong and Dubai that posed as legitimate businesses to create fake import transactions and launder the proceeds, it said.The PNB and the other defrauded banks are reported to have lost in excess of USD 1 billion as a result of the fraud, the judge wrote in his order.In his petition, Levin listed examples of how Modi, Bhansali and Gandhi directly benefited from fraudulently issued LoUs and were involved in circular transactions until early 2013, when the debtors no longer directly participated in import and export transactions underlying LoU issuances and instead received proceeds indirectly through the “shadow entities”.Meanwhile, the UK’s Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said in August that it is reviewing the London High Court ruling to grant Modi permission to appeal against his extradition order with the Indian government for the next stage in the legal process.The CPS, which represents the Indian authorities in court, highlighted that the appeal can be heard at a full hearing on two grounds related to the mental health of the diamantaire, who is lodged at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London as he fights his extradition to face charges of fraud and money laundering in the estimated USD 2-billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case.Modi is the subject of two sets of criminal proceedings, with the CBI case relating to a large-scale fraud upon the PNB through the fraudulent obtaining of letters of undertaking (LoUs) or loan agreements, and the ED case relating to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.He also faces two additional charges of "causing the disappearance of evidence" and intimidating witnesses or “criminal intimidation to cause death”, which were added to the CBI case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/big-blow-for-nirav-modi-us-court-junks-plea-seeking-dismissal-of-fraud-charges-101634618878395.html

The officer will also look at other things, including State Department's special immigrant visa program and the processing of Afghans cleared for admission into the US as refugees, the Fox News report further said.The development was first reported by Politico, which quoted State Department and congressional officials. It also reported that Secretary of State Antony Blinken received an action memorandum on October 15, detailing the investigations into emergency evacuation of the US Embassy in Kabul "to include evacuation of US citizens and Afghan nationals" and other things.Diana Shaw, the State Department's acting inspector general, notified Congress of her office's actions on Monday, Fox News reported. She also said in separate letter also informed the Congress that her office is launching "several oversight projects" related to the end of US mission in Afghanistan, according to Fox News.Other inspector generals from other department, like defence, are also likely to launch similar investigations.The Taliban swept across Afghanistan in August, seizing control of almost all key towns and cities in the backdrop of withdrawal of the US forces that began on May 1. On August 15, the capital city of Kabul fell to the insurgents.The final days of the withdrawal of American troops turned chaotic, with thousands who had worked with the US and its allies, remaining in the war-torn country. President Joe Biden defended his handling of the withdrawal, calling the US airlift to extract more than 120,000 Americans, Afghans and other allies from Afghanistan to end a 20-year war an "extraordinary success".Biden has faced tough questions about the way the US went about leaving Afghanistan. He is under heavy criticism, particularly from Republicans, for his handling of the evacuation.Congressional committees, whose interest in the war waned over the years, held public hearings on what went wrong in the final months of the US withdrawal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-s-chaotic-afghan-withdrawal-to-be-probed-by-ig-report-101634612803237.html
19-10-2021||World||Amid surge in Covid-19 cases, Russians left unvaccinated. Here's why||Russia, one of the countries hit hardest by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, has a low vaccination figure, which is reportedly fueled by widespread mistrust of the treatment and lacklustre government measures. According to official figures, only 32 per cent of Russians are fully vaccinated, while the country continues hitting record statistics in terms of Covid-19 figures. As many as 34,325 new cases were recorded nationwide in Russia on Monday, a record in the daily tally for the fifth day running. The death toll, too, increased by 998, a number just short of the over 1,000 deaths recorded on Saturday.Also Read | Did Russia steal AstraZeneca Covid jab formula? This report suggests soReporting on the Covid-19 situation in Russia, the New York Times, citing pollsters and sociologists, pointed out that the country's low vaccination rate is a reflection of the “prevalent mistrust in Russian authorities” that has metastasised since the pandemic began last year. At 32 per cent, Russia's vaccination rate shows that only one-third of the entire country's population (42 million inhabitants, according to an estimate put forth by Russia's prime minister Mikhail Mushustin last week) has been vaccinated so far, despite free Covid-19 shots being made available on part of the government.Denis Volkov, the director of an independent polling operation, told NYT that an estimated 40 per cent of Russians have no trust in their government, and these people are an active constituent of the group most reluctant to take the Covid-19 vaccine. This same operation had estimated in one of its August polls that about 52 per cent of Russians are uninterested in getting the vaccines administered.According to the experts, skepticism regarding the Sputnik V vaccine may also be responsible for the low vaccination rate in Russia, considering the fact that Western vaccines, like those made by Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech, are not available in the country. There was also an unusual speed and secretive process behind the development of Sputnik V in Russia, reported the Science magazine; its approval was met with criticism in mass media and discussions in the scientific community as to whether distributing the vaccine was justified “in the absence of robust scientific research confirming safety and efficacy.”Also Read | Indian hospitals cancel Russia's Sputnik V vaccine orders. Here's whyThe Vladimir Putin government in Moscow has ruled out the idea of a nationwide lockdown and is instead relying on measures like reintroducing the QR code system in some regions for access to public spaces. Russia's second-largest city - Saint Petersburg - has announced that from November 1, people will need to present a QR code to get into sports and cultural events, where more than 40 people are gathering. Only people who have been fully vaccinated or who have had a negative Covid-19 test in the past 72 hours will receive the QR code.Experts, meanwhile, say that the true Covid-19 death toll in Russia may be significantly higher than the official figure. The Rosstat statistics institute, which uses a broader definition of what constitutes a coronavirus death, has put the toll at more than 400,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-surge-in-covid-19-cases-russians-left-unvaccinated-here-s-why-101634609988091.html
19-10-2021||World||'In 2008, warned Bill Gates against sending flirtatious email to employee': Microsoft||Microsoft executives in 2008 warned Bill Gates to stop sending flirtatious emails to a female employee but dropped the matter after he told them he would stop, the company revealed Monday.The Wall Street Journal was first to report that Brad Smith, then Microsoft's general counsel and now its president and vice chair, and another executive met with Gates after the company discovered inappropriate emails to a midlevel employee.The newspaper reported that Gates didn’t deny the exchanges, and members of the Microsoft board who were briefed on them declined to take further action because there wasn't any physical interaction between Gates and the employee.Microsoft declined comment Monday except to confirm the Journal's reporting. Smith didn't return a request for comment made through the company.Gates’ private office said in a written statement that “these claims are false, recycled rumors from sources who have no direct knowledge, and in some cases have significant conflicts of interest.” It declined further comment.The reported 2008 warning came more than a decade before similar alleged behavior led the tech giant to hire a law firm in 2019 to investigate a letter from an engineer who said she had a sexual relationship with Gates over several years.That investigation preceded Gates' departure from Microsoft's board last year, but didn't come to light publicly until after Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates announced in May they had decided to end their marriage of 27 years. The divorce was finalized in August. The former couple still jointly runs the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.Gates was Microsoft’s CEO until 2000 and since then has gradually scaled back his involvement in the company he started with Paul Allen in 1975. He transitioned out of a day-to-day role in Microsoft in 2008 and served as chairman of the board until 2014.Microsoft spokesperson Frank Shaw told the Journal that the 2008 warning from company executives happened shortly before Gates retired as a full-time employee. Shaw told the newspaper that Gates had suggested meeting the employee outside of work in emails that were flirtatious and inappropriate but “not overtly sexual.”The latest disclosure about Gates adds to concerns raised by a Microsoft investor asking fellow shareholders to support a proposal that would force the company to investigate its workplace harassment policies and release a report about them.“Reports of Bill Gates’ inappropriate relationships and sexual advances towards Microsoft employees have only exacerbated concerns, putting in question the culture set by top leadership, and the board’s role holding those culpable accountable,” says the proposal from Arjuna Capital on the agenda of Microsoft's annual shareholder meeting next month.Microsoft urged investors to reject the proposal in a note filed with regulators last week, arguing it is unnecessary because the company has already adopted plans to publicly report how it is implementing its policies on sexual harassment and gender discrimination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-2008-warned-gates-against-sending-flirtatious-email-to-employee-microsoft-101634608979645.html

This comes after Zalmay Khalilzad resigned from the post following chaotic withdrawal of the American forces from Afghanistan."West, who served on then-Vice President Biden's national security team and on the National Security Council staff, will lead diplomatic efforts, advise the Secretary and Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, and coordinate closely with the US Embassy Kabul presence in Doha on America's interests in Afghanistan," Blinken said in a statement.Blinken also thanked Khalilzad for his "decades of service"."As Special Representative for Afghan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad steps down from his role, I extend my gratitude for his decades of service to the American people," Blinken said in the statement.Khalilzad was the person who led talks with the Taliban in Qatar that resulted in the Doha agreement between the Islamic group and former US President Donald Trump to fully withdraw US troops by May 2021.But he has been criticised for not pressing the Taliban hard enough during peace talks.Current and former US officials told news agency Reuters that in the three years Khalilzad has been in the role, he became the face of one of the largest US diplomatic failures in recent memory.US officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the veteran American diplomat relinquished leverage to the militant group, continuously undermined the Afghan government, and had little interest in hearing different viewpoints within the American government.Some officials, lawmakers and foreign policy experts said that he is one of the few US diplomats to have relations with the Taliban and was simply following orders from both Trump and Joe Biden: Get all American troops out of Afghanistan.In 2019, then president Ashraf Ghani's national security adviser accused Khalilzad of "selling out" the Afghan government in talks while lending the Taliban a façade of credibility. Khalilzad was given a free hand by the Trump administration, but the peace deal he brokered went nowhere. In negotiations, officials said Khalilzad gave away too much early by making clear that Washington was looking to withdraw all of its troops.Khalilzad has so far declined to comment on the record.Born in Afghanistan, Khalilzad was a veteran of past Republican administrations who helped President George W Bush plan the overthrow of the Taliban in 2002.The United States, meanwhile, said on Monday that it will not join talks on Afghanistan announced for this Tuesday by Russia that will include two other key players, China and Pakistan. The state department blamed logistical issues but said it considered the Russian-led forum “constructive.”“We look forward to engaging in that forum going forward, but we're not in a position to take part this week,” state department spokesman Ned Price told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-representative-zalmay-khalilzad-quits-pays-for-pro-taliban-tilt-101634609176654.html

19-10-2021||World||Capitol Hill riots: Trump sues to stop release of Jan 6 White House records||Former President Donald Trump on Monday sought to block the release of documents related to the January 6 Capitol insurrection to a congressional committee investigating the attack, challenging President Joe Biden's initial decision to waive executive privilege. In a federal lawsuit, Trump said the committee's request was “almost limitless in scope,” and sought records with no reasonable connection to that day. He called it a “vexatious, illegal fishing expedition” that was “untethered from any legitimate legislative purpose,” according to the papers filed in federal court in the District of Columbia.Trump’s lawsuit was expected, as he had said he would challenge the investigation and at least one ally, Steve Bannon, has defied a subpoena. But the legal challenge went beyond the initial 125 pages of records that Biden recently cleared for release to the committee. The suit, which names the committee as well as the National Archives, seeks to invalidate the entirety of the congressional request, calling it overly broad, unduly burdensome, and a challenge to separation of powers. It requests a court injunction to bar the archivist from producing the documents.The Biden administration, in clearing the documents for release, said the violent siege of the Capitol was such an extraordinary circumstance that it merited waiving the privilege that usually protects White House communications.In a letter obtained by The Associated Press, the White House worked to undercut Bannon's argument before a scheduled committee vote on whether to recommend criminal contempt charges against him. Bannon is a one-time White House adviser who left the administration years before the insurrection.Deputy Counsel Jonathan Su wrote that the president's decision on the documents applied to Bannon, too, and “at this point we are not aware of any basis for your client’s refusal to appear for a deposition.”“President Biden’s determination that an assertion of privilege is not justified with respect to these subjects applies to your client’s deposition testimony and to any documents your client may possess concerning either subject,” Su wrote to Bannon's lawyer.Bannon’s attorney said he had not yet seen the letter and could not comment on it. While Bannon has said he needs a court order before complying with his subpoena, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and former White House and Pentagon aide Kashyap Patel are negotiating with the committee. It is unclear whether a fourth former White House aide, Dan Scavino, will comply.The committee has also subpoenaed more than a dozen people who helped plan Trump rallies ahead of the siege, and some of them have already said they would turn over documents and give testimony.Lawmakers want the documents as part of their investigation into how a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building on Jan. 6 in a violent effort to halt the certification of Biden’s election win. The committee demanded a broad range of executive branch papers related to intelligence gathered before the attack, security preparations during and before the siege, the pro-Trump rallies held that day, and Trump’s false claims that he won the election, among other matters.Trump's lawsuit says the “boundless requests included over fifty individual requests for documents and information, and mentioned more than thirty individuals, including those working inside and outside government.”The files must be withheld, the lawsuit says, because they could include “conversations with (or about) foreign leaders, attorney work product, the most sensitive of national security secrets, along with any and all privileged communications among a pool of potentially hundreds of people.”The suit also challenges the legality of the Presidential Records Act, arguing that allowing an incumbent president to waive the executive privilege of a predecessor just months after they left office is inherently unconstitutional. Biden has said he would go through each request separately to determine whether that privilege should be waived.While not spelled out in the Constitution, executive privilege has developed to protect a president’s ability to obtain candid counsel from his advisers without fear of immediate public disclosure and to protect his confidential communications relating to official responsibilities.But that privilege has its limitations in extraordinary situations, as exemplified during the Watergate scandal, when the Supreme Court ruled it could not be used to shield the release of secret Oval Office tapes sought in a criminal inquiry, and following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.Monday's lawsuit was filed by Jesse Binnall, an attorney based in Alexandria, Virginia, who represented Trump in an unsuccessful lawsuit late last year seeking to overturn Biden’s victory in Nevada. Trump and his allies have continued to make baseless claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election.Trump’s suit quotes from the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2020 ruling in a case by House committees seeking the then-sitting president’s tax returns and other financial records. But that case involved courts enforcing a congressional subpoena. The high court in that case directed lower courts to apply a balancing test to determine whether to turn over the records — it's still pending.Neither the White House nor the select committee had an immediate comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/capitol-hill-riots-trump-sues-to-stop-release-of-jan-6-white-house-records-101634603490946.html

The agency identified the American as Steve Sandusky but did not offer a US hometown for him. It said Sandusky was a resident of Costa Rica and owned the ranch in Puntarenas province south of San Jose, the capital. The ranch is about 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) from the nearest public road.The other five victims are believed to be Costa Rican nationals who Sandusky had asked to come to the ranch to repair agricultural machinery, authorities said. Their families lost contact with them Sunday and went to the ranch to look for them.The dead include a man, his wife, and their 20-year-old son. The bodies of Sandusky and one other victim had been burned; a third had been doused in fuel but not burned. All appeared to have been shot.Authorities said they are still investigating the killings, but that robbery appears to be a possible motive because Sandusky’s home was ransacked and a window was broken.The US embassy said it could not comment on the case because of privacy concerns.The brutality of the killings shocked Costa Rica, the most peaceful nation in Central America, with a homicide rate of about 11 killings per 100,000 people annually.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/6-people-including-an-american-slain-at-ranch-in-costa-rica-101634602068342.html

The UN health agency said it is expecting one additional piece of information from Covaxin manufacturer, Bharat Biotech, which has been submitting data to the WHO on a rolling basis.“We are aware many people are waiting for WHO’s recommendation for Covaxin to be included in the #COVID19 Emergency Use Listing, but we cannot cut corners - before recommending a product for emergency use, we must evaluate it thoroughly to make sure it is safe and effective,” the WHO said in a series of tweets.The WHO’s nod for Covaxin’s emergency use authorisation is necessary for its widespread acceptability as a safe and effective vaccine. “The timeframe for the WHO Emergency Use Listing procedure is dependent on how quickly a company producing the vaccine is able to provide the data required for WHO to evaluate the vaccine’s quality, safety, efficacy and its suitability for low- and middle-income countries,” the WHO tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/awaiting-more-information-on-covaxin-who-101634583372965.html

The report said the feat had “caught US intelligence by surprise”.Asked to share details about the testing, the Chinese foreign ministry on Monday denied it.“It was not a missile, it was a space vehicle,” spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at the regular ministry briefing. “It’s understood that this was a routine test of a space vehicle to verify the technology of the spacecraft’s reusability,” Zhao said.He added that the test was essential to reduce the cost of spacecraft use, providing a convenient and inexpensive way for humans to use space for peaceful purposes.Many firms in the world have conducted similar experiments and the separating part of the spacecraft was its accessory part, and it would burn and break up in the atmosphere and the debris would fall into international waters, Zhao said.“China will work with other countries for the peaceful use of space for the benefit of mankind,” Zhao noted.The tabloid Global Times while questioning the veracity of the FT report said China was narrowing the military capability with the US.“It is meaningless to discuss the credibility of the FT report. But it is important to note the unstoppable trend that China is narrowing the gap with the US in some key military technologies as China is continuously developing its economic and technological strength,” the tabloid said in an opinion piece. “China doesn’t need to engage in an ‘arms race’ with the US - it is capable of weakening the US’s overall advantages over China by developing military power at its own pace,” it added.The US and Russia have tested hypersonic weapons in recent months, and North Korea said in September it had tested a newly developed hypersonic missile.Hypersonic missiles can fly at more than five times the speed of sound and like ballistic missiles can deliver a nuclear warhead.Meanwhile, US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said on Monday that Washington was closely watching China’s development of advanced weapons systems but declined to comment on the FT report.Austin was speaking at a news conference during a visit to Georgia, a Reuters report from Tbilisi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-trashes-ft-report-says-it-tested-spacecraft-not-hypersonic-missile-101634582192835.html

Jashn-e-Riwaaz means festival of tradition. The Urdu phrase was, however, misunderstood to refer to Deepavali or Diwali, the Indian festival of lights.  “Deepavali is not Jashn-e-Riwaaz,” Surya tweeted on Monday. “This deliberate attempt of abrahamisation of Hindu festivals, depicting models without traditional Hindu attires, must be called out. And brands like @FabindiaNews must face economic costs for such deliberate misadventures.”Fabindia on Tuesday said that the contested festive line was not its Diwali collection, PTI news agency reported. The company said its Diwali line will be called Jhilmi si Diwali, PTI reported. The phrase translates to glittering festival of lights. “We at Fabindia have always stood for the celebration of India with its myriad traditions in all hues,” the company spokesperson told PTI. “Our Diwali collection called ‘Jhilmil is Diwali’ is yet to be launched.”Taking a dig at the BJP, former leader of the party Yashwant Sinha, who is now with Trinamool Congress party, tweeted, “I am happy BJP has protected Hinduism by protesting against Fab India’s Rashn-e-Riwaaz dresses and forcing it to withdraw the ad. If it had not been for the BJP Hinduism would not have survived thru’ the ages.” This is not the first time a brand has been attacked by right-wing groups for their advertisements. Tanishq, Tata group’s jewellery brand, withdrew an advertisement on interfaith marriage last year after it was trolled heavily on social media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fabindia-withdraws-diwali-ad-after-row-over-urdu-phrase-101634668193652.html

The singer-turned-politician, who handed over his resignation to Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla, thanked the BJP leadership for showing confidence in him.“It has been a very fulfilling seven years that I have spent in Parliament and I shall always remain indebted to my now ex-party BJP Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modiji, Hon’ble Amit Shah ji and respected Shri J P Nadda ji for giving me the opportunity to serve my country,” the two-term MP from West Bengal’s Asansol said in his resignation letter. In his letter to Birla, the TMC leader sought his blessings to now embark on a “new journey”.“I am proud to have walked the corridors of this historic monument (Parliament) and traversed by many a visionary leaders, statesmen, freedom fighters and luminaries who crafted the history of our motherland and paved the path for her having a secure and glorious future”. He also lauded Speaker Birla for his “affable nature and elegant humour”.“My heart is heavy as I had begun my political career with the BJP. I thank the prime minister, party chief and Amit Shah. They showed confidence in me. I had left politics wholeheartedly. I thought that if I am not a part of the party, I should not keep any seat for myself,” he was later quoted as saying by news agency PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/babulsupriyo-resigns-as-lok-sabha-mp-says-shall-always-remain-indebted-to-pm-modi-amit-shah-101634668136220.html

Thirty-eight-year-old M Riyasuddin was subsequently remanded in judicial custody for a week, the officer added.“He discreetly approached the court which remanded him in judicial custody. We will move the court for police custody,” the senior officer who did not wish to be named said.Riyasuddin is the second accused in the case. His father, Abdul Kareem, 64, is the prime accused in the case and is still at large, police said.A case was registered against the duo in June last year after they fed a 15-year-old pregnant elephant a pineapple stuffed with crackers. The elephant died after the crackers blew in her mouth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/accused-in-pregnant-elephant-death-in-kerala-surrenders-after-a-year-101634667718579.html
19-10-2021||India||UP polls: 40% of seats to be reserved for women, says Congress||Looking to consolidate its support base in Uttar Pradesh, especially among women voters, the Congress on Tuesday announced that 40% of candidates fielded by the party for the assembly elections next year would be women.This was announced in no uncertain terms by party national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra at a press conference held at the headquarters of the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee with ‘Ladki Hoon, Lad Sakti Hoon (I’m a girl, I can fight)’ slogan painted in the backdrop.The AICC national general secretary and in charge of party affairs in Uttar Pradesh said the decision was aimed at making women, who constitute roughly half of the electorate, a “full-fledged partner in power”. “This decision is for every woman who wants to bring about a change, fight for justice and work for unity and development. Only women can bring about a change because they have compassion, they are firm, and they have the power. We promise to ensure full participation of women in the state’s politics,” she said. Gandhi called upon women to join politics to change the “politics in Uttar Pradesh” and said applications for tickets would be accepted till November 15. The announcement was greeted with the bursting of firecrackers and slogan-shouting by women workers at the party office. When asked if Congress would take this to the national level, Gandhi said she was the party in charge of UP and it was for the other states to take a call on this. If she had her way, Gandhi said, up to 50% of seats would be reserved for women candidates. The AICC general secretary tasked with regaining the party’s lost ground in the political heartland, however, was non-committal about contesting the upcoming state polls herself. “It has not been decided yet,” she said in response to a question. About leaders seeking tickets for their wives or other family members, she said, “What is the harm if people want tickets for their wives or other women of their family? When they fight elections, they get empowered.” Gandhi also used the occasion to target the Bharatiya Janata Party government on the Lakhimpur Kheri incident where eight people, including four farmers, were killed on October 3. “This government shows how it can protect those who crush people. This is wrong,” she said. Referring to all women she met over the past two years, including policewomen who detained her in Sitapur when she was on her way to Lakhimpur Kheri on October 4, Gandhi said, “It was pitch dark in Sitapur. I was surrounded by police, including women cops. I also argued with them. They asked me to sit in a jeep and took me to the Sitapur police lines. One of them was Madhu and the other was Pooja. They were on duty till 4am. This decision (40% tickets for women) is for them as well.” Asked whether the party would manage to get sufficient women candidates, Gandhi said: “Yes, we will get candidates and they will contest the election. If they don’t get sufficient strength this time, they will get it next time. We will help them fight the election.” “The Congress has never worked for the women and is now talking about 40 percent reservation for women only in view of 2022 UP assembly elections,” state BJP spokesman Chandra Mohan said. Political watchers saw merit in Congress’ move. “This is a good move. Every political party should follow it. The decision, if followed by other parties too, will bring about a social change and discipline to politics,” said Professor SK Dwivedi, former head of department, political science, Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-polls-40-of-seats-to-be-reserved-for-women-says-congress-101634667773585.html
19-10-2021||India||Amarinder Singh: Floating new party, open to alliance with BJP ahead of Punjab polls||Former Punjab chief minister and Congress leader Amarinder Singh said on Tuesday he planned to soon announce his political party and was hopeful of a seat arrangement with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) if the farmers’ issue was resolved. Singh resigned as the Punjab CM last month after a bitter tussle with Navjot Singh Sidhu amid infighting in the state Congress. The party later picked Charanjit Singh Channi as the next chief minister of the state. “The battle for Punjab’s future is on. Will soon announce the launch of my own political party to serve the interests of Punjab & its people, including our farmers who’ve been fighting for their survival for over a year,” Singh said Tuesday. HT reported earlier this month that Singh was set to launch his own political party and could even consider an alliance or seat adjustment with the BJP. The development could alter radically the electoral landscape in the upcoming polls in Punjab. After resigning as the Punjab CM, Singh announced his intent to quit the Congress. Singh said he will not rest until he secures the future of “my people and my state”. “Punjab needs political stability and protection from internal and external threats. I promise my people I will do what it takes to ensure its peace and security, which is today at stake,” he was quoted as saying by his media adviser, Raveen Thukral. “Hopeful of a seat arrangement with BJP in 2022 Punjab Assembly polls if Farmers Protest is resolved in farmers’ interest. Also looking at alliance with like-minded parties such as breakaway Akali groups, particularly Dhindsa & Brahmpura factions,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarinder-singh-floating-new-party-open-to-alliance-with-bjp-ahead-of-punjab-polls-101634667533369.html
19-10-2021||India||Army’s anti-terrorist ops in Rajouri-Poonch continue||The Indian army continued its operations in the dense forests of the Rajouri-Poonch sector for the ninth day on Tuesday, trying to track down terrorists believed to belong to Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba who have gone to ground in the area. The Indian army has thus far lost nine men in the long operation, but is believed to have inflicted some damage on the terrorists, killing six of them. However, this number was not confirmed by the army which has now adopted a different tack. HT learns that Indian Army commanders have been told to wait and tire out the terrorists rather than pro-actively engaging them. “Casualties to our troops have occurred due to the advantage the terrorists took by operating in pairs of two. This allowed them to continuously change position and engage a larger body of troops, resulting in casualties,” said a top Indian Army commander who asked not to be named.Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Gen Bipin Rawat visited the area on October 16 to hold discussions with the local commanders of the 16 Corps handling the ongoing counterterror operation. According to South Block officials who asked not to be named, as many as nine to 10 LeT terrorists infiltrated from Pakistan into the jungles in the border Rajouri-Poonch districts over the past two to three months. While several infiltration bids were foiled on the LoC and along the fence, according to the army commander cited above, it was always clear that the Pakistan-based terrorists, emboldened by the Taliban’s success in Afghanistan, would try to enter India in substantial numbers. The army commander added that instructions have been issued to establish a cordon around the area. It is now up to the terrorists to make a move as they seek to replenish their supplies from nearby villages, therby exposing themselves, he added. “ Jungle warfare requires patience and the instruction to troops is to be cautious and avoid casualties by engaging the terrorists head-on. Since time is not a constraint, we will tire out the terrorists and eliminate them.” Meanwhile, security forces are continuing to secure civilians, especially migrant workers from other parts of the country, who are being targeted by terrorists. Home minister Amit Shah has been monitoring this process continuously, people familiar with the matter said on a day when the National Investigation Agency took over investigations into six of the killings (thus far this month, 11 civilians have been killed by the terrorists). Two years ago, under the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, the two union territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh came into existence on October 31, and officials in security forces said they expect efforts by terrorists to target civilians on the one hand, and continue to engage with the troops on another to continue, even escalate in the run-up to the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/armys-anti-terrorist-ops-in-rajouri-poonch-continue-101634667299800.html
19-10-2021||India||New law for social media companies in the works||New Delhi: The Union government is considering bringing in a separate law to make social media companies accountable for what they publish as it looks to revise definitions of what constitutes intermediaries and social media firms, people familiar with the matter said. The moves comes at a time when a recent executive move -- the amendments to the Information Technology Rules notified this year -- has been put on hold by orders from several courts. Among the grounds on which the new rules have been challenged, and stayed, are that they do not have adequate legislative basis to mandate the kind of additional liabilities they lay down. “There are laws across the globe that govern how social media functions,” a government official said on the condition of anonymity. “There is still uncertainty (on the new law); it may be a different Act or be introduced as an amendment.” The rules in February, among other guidelines, required social media platforms to appoint new grievance redressal officers and release monthly compliance reports, as well as made their “safe harbour” protections conditional upon their adherence to the new requirements. Safe harbour provisions, which exist in the parent IT Act, protect companies from liability for what their users post.According to the person cited above, the government is looking at the European model to formulate the new law, including the Digital Services Act submitted by the European Commission in December 2020. “The guidelines will depend on the Personal Data Protection Bill,” this person said. DSA spells out additional rights for users -- such as allowing them to report illegal content -- and makes it mandatory for social media companies to adhere to new transparency mandates regarding their content moderation practices. The proposed law, however, does not appear to treat social media companies as publishers -- a step the Indian government is keen on via the Data Protection bill, which at present is being studied by a joint parliamentary committee (JPC). The JPC has been looking into the draft law since 2019 and has been given several deadline extensions — the latest being due to a change in several members, including the chairperson, after former head Meenakshi Lekhi was inducted as a Union minister. The report drafted at the time was yet to be circulated for final inputs by members despite their demands.The report proposes to treat social media platforms as publishers and to add back the condition of “just, fair, reasonable and proportionate” in Section 35 of the proposed amendments to the Personal Data Protection Bill, which deals with exemptions that the government can claim in accessing personal data. The Committee is now working to draw up a new report. The person quoted above said that the proposed changes will be put up for public consultation. “Definitions need to be revised for what constitutes a social media platform and an intermediary,” the person said. According to Supreme Court lawyer N S Nappinai, who is also the founder of Cyber Saathi, a non-governmental organisation working to spread awareness on cyber threats, the issue that will be crucial is what exactly the government bring in. “It’s not a bad idea at all,” she said, on the proposed law. “We can’t club intermediaries of different kinds in one box; this should be able to address specific issues concerning social media platforms.”She added that the new law must go beyond content moderation. “There are very strong proponents of treating social media as publishers, but one needs to be careful.” .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-law-for-social-media-companies-in-the-works-101634667172742.html

Like the others, Kashiram was in Mukteshwar near Nainital -- 786km away from home in Champaran, Bihar -- part of the construction activity that now dots the mountains of Uttarakhand. For the past few months, the shanty had been home, an instrument in his sustenance.But, on Tuesday, the wall of the building next to the shanty came crashing down, burying them in the rubble.It nearly became his death of him.
19-10-2021||India||Overflowing Kosi river threatens wildlife in Uttarakhand||Dehradun: The Kosi river, which runs on the eastern periphery of the Jim Corbett National Park, overflowed its banks due to extreme rainfall in its catchment areas, endangering iconic wildlife and stranding tourists in forest resorts. An elephant almost drowned in the Gola river that runs through the park but managed to wade to safety, foresters said. Stranded tourists around the Kosi were rescued on trackers and buses. There were no reports of rising water in the Ramganga river and its tributaries that flow through the heart of India’s most famous wildlife sanctuary. Forest staff in the national park were on high alert. “We are keeping a close watch,” said Rajiv Bhartari, principal chief conservator of forests. “As of now, there is no report of major loss of wildlife in Corbett.” The ground situation will be known once the rains ease up and water subsides in local water bodies and streams, he said.A cloudburst triggered flash floods at Ramgarh in Uttarakhand’s Nainital district on Tuesday, upstream of the national park. The catchment areas of Kosi river received 227mm to 530mm rainfall in the past 24 hours, official data show. The Jim Corbett National Park, spread across 1,288 square km, is known for its large number of tigers, 231 at the last count on 2018, many herds of elephants and numerous leopards and other animals. As many as 2,026 elephants were counted in Uttarakhand in 2020, almost all of them in Jim Corbett and Rajaji national parks. A video of an elephant stuck on an island in Gola river who managed to swim ashore went viral. The Gola river originates in the Sattal area of Nainital district and flows south past Kathgodam and Haldwani, joining the Ramganga river, a tributary of the Ganga, about 15km northwest of Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh. Forest officials rushed to spot where the elephant was struggling. “The water was flowing very fast but the elephant managed to swim back to the shore,” said JS Suhag, chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand. “We have alerted our staff in Nainital and surrounding areas, including the Corbett landscape, to remain alert and initiate rescue operations wherever they find wild animals trapped or stuck.”An initial assessment showed there have been many landslides in forested areas because of the heavy rains, said Biju Lal, divisional forest officer of Nainital. “Our teams are working to clear roads and streams,” he said, adding that an assessment of possible loss of fauna will be done once the sky clears.The forest department has shifted people from close to 20 villages in Corbett near the Kosi river to safety. People staying in some hotels and resorts near Kosi were also shifted. The national park has been closed for tourists since Monday. The meandering Kosi has flooded like this after many years, according to Ramnagar-based wildlife activist AG Ansari. “Fast moving animals like tigers have the ability to move to safer locations if it rains heavily. Animals like elephants usually get trapped in swirling water,” he said. “Many villagers have voluntarily shifted to safer areas.”It will be clear whether any wild animals were washed away, as their bodies will surely be found downstream after the flood subsides, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/overflowing-kosi-river-threatens-wildlife-in-uttarakhand-101634666878898.html
19-10-2021||India||Climate crisis, land-use change ruining ecology: Experts on Uttarakhand flash flood||Dehradun: The rain in Nainital and adjoining districts on Monday and Tuesday that caused flooding in eastern Uttarakhand, leaving 34 people dead, was the heaviest ever recorded in the region, and another indication that the loss of local ecology due to the climate crisis and changes in land-use patterns has started wreaking havoc on the Kumaon hills.Nainital’s Mukteshwar area reported 340.8mm rainfall 24 hours between 8.30 am on Monday and 8.30 am on Tuesday, the highest since the weather station was set up there in 1897. Before Tuesday, the highest rainfall of 254.5mm was reported on September 18, 1914.“Apart from Mukteshwar, the rainfall has also broken records in Pantnagar in Udham Singh Nagar district, which had reported rainfall of 228mm on July 10, 1990, has now in the last 24 hours, received 403.9mm rainfall,” said director of the meteorological centre Dehradun Bikram Singh.According to India Meteorology Department data, the state reported 178.4mm rain in first 18 days of October — 485% more than the average. In the last 24 hours starting on Tuesday morning, districts such as Chamoli and Udham Singh Nagar received around 10,000% more rain than the average. Over the last 24 hours, Chamoli has reported 127.5 mm rain, against the average of 0.6 mm; while US Nagar reported 232.1 mm rainfall against the average of 1.6mm. Singh attributed the spurt in extreme rainfall events in the area to the climate crisis, saying that heavy rainfall in short spells has increased in the state -- a phenomenon that has been confirmed by various studies conducted by IMD and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology between 2016 and 2020. To be sure, this is in line with the rainfall patterns recorded across the country in recent years. According to IMD, Uttarakhand has reported over 7,750 extreme rainfall events and cloudbursts since 2015 -- a majority of them in the last three years. An extreme rainfall event is recorded when a location receives more than 204 mm of rain in 24 hours. Till July this year, the state reported 979 extreme rainfall events. In 2020, this number was 1,632 for the whole year, and went as high as 3,706 in 2018.Weather experts, however, said that the actual number of cloudbursts or extreme rainfall events in Uttarakhand must be much higher but most areas don’t have weather stations to record them.“Officially, this year we recorded three cloudbursts -- in Haldwani, Champawat and Dehradun. Traditionally, cloud burst is defined as over 100mm/hour within a limited geographical area of a few square kilometres. But we have only 25 weather observatories in the state. The state has set up 107 observatories, but more such measuring stations are required to get near to the exact numbers,” Singh said.Experts say that although the climate crisis was causing extreme rainfall, destruction of local ecology, unplanned development, and unscientific road cutting also contributed to the weather events, which have claimed over 4,000 lives since 2014, and been the cause of 1,961 major landslides in the last seven years. They attributed this to major development projects in higher reaches of the Himalayas, especially hydel power projects; encroachment of seasonal streams; and population growth, which has led to the proliferation of construction activities in narrow valleys, often in close proximity of rivers and rivulets. Nainital, for example, has over 7,000 structures on its slopes around the Nainital lake -- up from 520 in 1901-02. Experts say the increase in rain-induced landslides in the state has also been due to road-cutting, the unscientific disposal of muck, illegal mining activities, increase in hill agriculture, and no significant increase in the forest cover of the state to compensate for these activities. In the last two surveys conducted by the Forest Survey of India, over a period of four years from 2015 to 2019, Uttarakhand did not manage to report even a 1% increase in forest cover. “There are human factors which are aggravating the human loss in such events. We are cutting trees for development projects, we are cutting hills and destabilising slopes by cutting hills for roads, we have built hydel power projects in fragile Himalayan valleys, we are mining river beds discriminately. All these factors also contribute to the changes in the Himalayan ecology,” Anil Joshi, founder of Himalayan Environmental Studies and Conservation Organization, a Dehradun-based NGO said.DP Dobhal, a noted glaciologist and retired scientist from Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG), said that the impact of the climate crisis on the rainfall and snowfall patters in the Himalayas was clearly visible. “The Himalayas are witnessing less snow compared to the past but simultaneously rainfall is ascending higher into the Himalayas. When more rain meets steep terrain, it results in higher precipitation and quicker funneling of water downstream, which creates flash floods and flooding in general,” he said. Dobhal added that, over the last 50 years, the snowline has gone up from nearly 4,800 metres to 5,200 metres. “Also due to climate change, the average temperature has risen by 0.3 to 0.6 degrees Celsius in the Himalayas in the last 100 years or so.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/climate-crisis-land-use-change-ruining-ecology-experts-on-uttarakhand-flash-flood-101634666873414.html
19-10-2021||India||Clashes erupt during processions in MP||Bhopal/ Jabalpur: There was tension in three cities of Madhya Pradesh — Dhar, Jabalpur and Barwani — on Tuesday after clashes broke out during the Eid-i-Milad un-Nabi celebrations, police said. Eid-i-Milad un-Nabi or Mawlid is celebrated as the birthday of Prophet Muhammad. Processions are taken out on the occasion. In Dhar, those part of a procession tried to alter the route at Utawad Darwaja area by removing police barricading. Police alleged that some miscreants threw stones at them following which they carried out a lathicharge to disperse the crowd. A video of the incident was widely circulated on social media in which police personnel were allegedly seen pulling at the beard of a Muslim man. Dhar superintendent of police Aditya Pratap Singh said, “A case has been registered under sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting with a deadly weapon), and 353 (use of criminal force to deter public servant from discharging of his duty) of the Indian Penal Code against unidentified people and organisers. On Sunday evening, the organisers and the district administration held a meeting to finalise the route, but some tried to change it.” The procession carried on peacefully later. Elsewhere in Jabalpur, some people were taking out a procession in the Gohalpur area, and when police tried to stop them, they threw firecrackers at police personnel, police said. Later, police used teargas and a baton charge to break up the mob. Jabalpur superintendent of police Siddharth Bahuguna said, “As many as 30 teargas shells were fired to control the mob. In the attack, six police personnel have been injured. Two separate FIRs are being registered for rioting with a deadly weapon, assaulting a public servant to deter him from discharging his duty and violating the orders duly promulgated by a public servant.” Six people have been detained, police said. Jabalpur collector Karamveer Sharma said, “Section 144 has been imposed in the city. Now, the situation is under control.”In the third incident in Barwani, members of two communities clashed over the playing of some objectionable songs during a procession in the Raipur area of the town. They pelted stones at one another, but the police controlled them. Barwani superintendent of police Deepak Kumar Shukla said, “Some members of the Muslim community were playing objectionable songs. Locals registered their protest over it. Police asked them to stop, but they didn’t listen. Later, some members of the Hindu community pelted stones at the procession. Muslim community members also retaliated.”Police detained over 10 people, and six people from both communities were injured. They are being treated, and an FIR will be registered after that, Shukla added. Any eyewitness versions? Police are clearly blaming Muslims here.

The suggestions of the expert group could be incorporated for consideration in future budget sessions of Parliament, said the document issued by health ministry’s tobacco control division. HT has reviewed a copy. “…the tax and price policies are widely recognised to be one of the most effective means of influencing the demand for and thus the consumption of tobacco products. To develop a proposal for comprehensive tax policy for all tobacco products with a public health perspective, it has been decided to constitute an expert group…,” read the office memorandum. The group will be tasked to analyse the existing tax structure for all forms of tobacco, according to the directive. The experts will also develop a road map for tobacco tax policy and recommend immediate steps that need to be taken for making India MPOWER compliant. In 2008, the World Health Organization identified six evidence-based tobacco control measures, known as MPOWER, which are the most effective in reducing use. The measures include monitoring tobacco use and prevention policies; protect people from tobacco smoke; offer help to quit tobacco use; warn people about the dangers of tobacco; enforce bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship; and raise taxes on tobacco.The expert group is also mandated to suggest various options or models of tax rates and standards for consideration in budget 2022-23 and future budget sessions. Taxes need to be increased periodically to offset the effects of inflation and of rising incomes and purchasing power, the UN health agency said in its Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic, 2013. “If the real price of tobacco after inflation does not increase faster than consumer purchasing power, consumption will increase because tobacco becomes relatively more affordable,” it said.In India, tobacco products are taxed at 28% under GST. In 2014, the health ministry ordered that all tobacco products should have pictorial warnings that should cover 85% of the packaging. The members of the newly constituted nine-member expert group include Vikas Sheel, additional secretary and mission director, Union health ministry; Pulkesh Kumar, deputy secretary, health ministry; Rijo M Jhon, health economist, Rajagiri College of Social Sciences, Kerala; and representatives of Niti Aayog, department of revenue, department of central board of indirect taxes and customs, GST Council, and WHO country office for India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panel-to-advise-centre-over-taxes-on-tobacco-says-health-ministry-101634666513292.html
19-10-2021||India||Army chief takes stock of Poonch operations, returns to Delhi||Amid a protracted encounter between army and terrorists that entered ninth day on Tuesday, the Army chief General MM Naravane visited the forward areas in Poonch-Rajouri belt to review the ground situation, officials said. “General MM Naravane COAS visited forward areas of White Knight Corps and undertook a first-hand assessment of the situation along the Line of Control. COAS was briefed by commanders on the ground about the present situation & ongoing counter-infiltration operations,” Additional Directorate General of Public Information (ADGPI) Indian Army shared a tweet on its official handle. Gen Naravane reached the union territory on Monday on a two-day visit to review the security situation amid recent targeted civilian killings in the Valley and the ongoing gunfight in the Poonch- Rajouri sector. “The Army chief reached Rajouri, Jammu from Delhi on Monday and on Tuesday morning, he visited the forward areas. He was also briefed about the ongoing counter terror operations in Nar Khas and Chamrer forests by the army commanders. General Naravane was also briefed about the strategy put in place to eliminate the terrorists hiding in the jungles,” an Army officer, requesting anonymity said. The army chief returned to Delhi on Tuesday afternoon.In the encounter that began on October 11 in Poonch sector, the Army lost nine soldiers including two Junior Commissioned Officers (JCOs) within four days. Five Army personnel were killed in Chamrer area of Surankote forest on October 11 while four soldiers died in another encounter in the Nar Khas forest in the Mendhar area of Poonch on October 14. Security forces on Sunday detained three people for allegedly providing logistical support to terroristsOn Tuesday, the army and terrorists had intermittent exchanges in Nar Khas forests. “Such operations take time because the terrain is difficult. There is thick wild growth in the dense forest of Nar Khas where natural caves are there and visibility is also an issue,” a senior police official said on Monday.Last week, the Jammu and Kashmir Police said the terrorists were believed to be hiding in the jungles since August this year. Separately, at least, 11 civilians, including five migrant labourers, two teachers from minority communities and a renowned Kashmiri Pandit pharmacist, were killed by terrorists in different parts of the Kashmir this month. Last week, the Jammu and Kashmir police detained and questioned hundreds of people as part of their probe into the civilian killings. The counter insurgency operations were also intensified. At least 13 terrorists, including a top Lashkar-e-Taiba commander, have been shot dead by security forces in October, police said.Union home minister Amit Shah is likely to visit Kashmir in the last week of October to review the security situation and also inaugurate developmental projects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-chief-takes-stock-of-poonch-operations-returns-to-delhi-101634666452729.html
19-10-2021||India||UP police, SIT release photos of suspects of Lakhimpur violence; announce ‘rewards’ for information||Aimed at furthering the investigation into the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, which cost the lives of eight people, including four farmers and a journalist, Uttar Pradesh police and the Special Investigation Team (SIT) on Tuesday released photos of some people suspected to be involved with the violence.The police and the SIT have urged people to “give information about these suspects,” and have also announced “appropriate rewards” for the same, news agency ANI reported.This development comes a day after the six-hour ‘Rail Roko’ agitation, which was carried out by farmer unions across India and majorly impacted Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan. Several trains in over 100 locations across the three states were affected as farmers squatted over railway tracks and even staged sit-ons. Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait said on Monday that the farmer unions will chalk out their “further strategy” and will continue to showcase such movements until Union MoS Home Ajay Mishra Teni resigns.Notably, as many as 10 persons have so far been apprehended in the case, and Teni’s son Ashish Mishra is one of them. He has been alleged of being inside the SUV that mowed down the farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh on October 3. Of the 10 people arrested, four were held on Monday and one of them was a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker Sumit Jaiswal.Last week, a court in Lakhimpur Kheri denied bail to Ashish and his accomplice Ashish Pandey, and sent both to a 14-day judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-sit-release-photos-of-lakhimpur-violence-suspects-seek-cooperation-101634665538441.html
19-10-2021||India||Kolkata twin murder case: Police suspect more than 1 killer involved||Probe into the murders of Subir Chaki, managing director of prominent engineering firm Kilburn Engineering, and his driver in Kolkata has indicated the involvement of an acquaintance of the victim and a property dispute, police said on Tuesday. The bodies of Chaki (61) and his driver Rabin Mondal (65) were found with multiple stab injuries on their neck, legs and back at an ancestral building owned by the businessman on Sunday night, in South Kolkata.Police on Tuesday also questioned some employees of Chaki in connection with the case. The Kolkata Police took a sniffer dog to the crime scene, which “picked up a smell and led the officers to the Ballygunge railway station located less than a kilometre away. The dog went to a platform after climbing the over-bridge. It is possible that someone came to the house either on Sunday or earlier walked down to the station to board a train.”“The investigators on Tuesday also recreated the crime scene using a three-dimension imaging device. Statements of residents were recorded since they claimed to have heard several voices, including that of a woman, coming from the house on Sunday. Security camera footages are also being examined,” the officer added. “We are not ruling out professional rivalry, although preliminary information points towards the sale of the property which should cost around ₹2 crores because of the prime location,” said a second police officer. The bodies, which bore multiple stab injuries, were found inside Chaki’s ancestral house at Kankulia Road in the Gariahat police station area of south Kolkata on Monday morning. Chaki’s body was found on the first floor while the driver’s body was lying on the second floor. Chaki, 61, who lived at New Town on the eastern outskirts of the city with his wife, mother and mother-in-law and also owned property at a posh south Kolkata condominium, was trying to sell the old three-storey building for the last six years, residents of Kankulia Road told the police. In the past, Chaki sent Mondal, 64, with the keys when prospective buyers came to see the property. The police suspect that Chaki could have been close to sealing a deal and hence, came to the house on Sunday. This has raised the possibility of a cash transaction. The Kolkata Police did not officially share any information with the media. Chaki’s car was found on the road outside the building. Several food packets and some legal documents were found inside the vehicle. Members of Chaki’s family told the police that he called them on Sunday evening and talked about some repair work required at the house. His phone was switched off around 7 pm. Mondal’s phone was switched off as well. Since both devices were stolen, police are examining call lists collected from the service providers. Nobody lived on the upper floors of the house. There was nothing valuable there that might have led to a robbery, officers said. The ground floor was rented out to a private company. Its office was closed on Sunday. When the employees reported for duty on Monday morning, they found the door connecting the ground and the first floors shut from inside, which was unusual. Chaki, who studied at Kolkata’s St Xavier’s School, IIT Kharagpur and IIM, Kolkata, worked for well-known companies all his life. His son and daughter live in London and Bengaluru respectively. Chaki earlier worked as president (manufacturing) for Eveready Industries India Limited and as director for McNally Sayaji Engineering Limited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kolkata-twin-murder-case-police-suspect-more-than-1-killer-involved-101634666214850.html
19-10-2021||India||Security ops stepped up, Kashmir on edge||Security agencies intensified searches across the Kashmir valley on Tuesday, with thousands of migrant workers queued up outside bus stops and railway stations, hoping to get tickets out of the restive Union Territory after a series of targeted killings of civilians and minorities.People familiar with the matter said that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) is likely to take over the probe into the wave of violence, with The Resistance Front (TRF) and other Pakistan-based outfits emerging as the main perpetrators.Terrorists have killed 11 civilians, including five non-local labourers, this month, and multiple gunfights have broken out during operations by security forces to find those responsible for the attacks.“These types of attacks obviously attract a greater security response. We have intensified the measures in type and number wherever we thought necessary,” a security official said, asking not to be named.Of the 11 killings, seven happened in Srinagar.Indian Army chief General MM Naravane visited forward areas along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and was briefed on the ground situation in the region and ongoing counter-infiltration operations. The Indian Army has so far lost nine soldiers since the counter-insurgency operations began on October 11 in the region – the highest casualties the army has suffered in a week in recent years. One such operation in the forest belt of Jammu & Kashmir’s twin border districts of Poonch and Rajouri entered the ninth day, even as local police made public announcements in some areas, advising locals to stay indoors for their safety.Following the attacks, the latest on Sunday, security has been stepped up around government offices, including the civil secretariat. Multiple checkpoints and roadblocks have also been installed across Srinagar.“The security is very stringent and searches have intensified. Police and CRPF parties have been patrolling in larger numbers. There are also sudden spot and flash searches of vehicles,” Bilal Ahmad, a resident in the Old City, said.The forces have also increased mobile bunkers in sensitive areas, and deployed women paramilitary personnel.The high security presence, however, has added to the unease in the area. “The attacks have suddenly changed the atmosphere in the city. There is an uneasy silence. Fewer people prefer to move out fearing the deterioration of the situation,” a person in Srinagar said.In Jammu, security in and around the railway stations and bus stand was beefed up as a precautionary measure, officials said.Migrant workers, with their entire families, were seen waiting outside the railway station in Jammu on Tuesday without the basic facilities of water and shelter. “There is grave fear and terror after the killings of labourers. This has never happened in the past. So we fled the Valley to save our lives and also our children,” Santosh Kumar of Bihar’s Sitamarhi district said.A brick kiln worker in the Rajpora area of Pulwama district, Kumar said most of those fleeing are scared as there is no guarantee of their security.The Jammu & Kashmir labour department says approximately 140,000 migrant workers come to Jammu and Kashmir each year in early March for skilled and unskilled jobs such as masonry, carpentry, welding and farming, and most return once winter sets in, only to return next year. Others say the number is easily three times that.In Poonch, the people were alerted through public address systems of local mosques and asked to not venture into forest areas. The forest area of Mendhar in the district is under tight security cordon, officials said, with terrorists believed to be hiding there since August. Security forces are preparing a final assault to neutralise the terrorists, they added. Since the violence broke out on October 2, police have detained and interrogated hundreds of people. Suspected terrorist sympathisers and members of banned outfits, including the Jamaat-e-Islami, have also been questioned to ascertain their roles in the murders.Eight suspects, including a mother-son duo, were also detained in Bhatta Durrian for allegedly providing logistic support to the terrorists, officials said. It is yet to be ascertained whether the support was given voluntarily or under duress, the officials said. Union home minister Amit Shah is likely to visit the Union territory in the last week of October to review the security situation and also inaugurate some developmental projects.“General MM Naravane COAS visited forward areas of White Knight Corps and undertook a first-hand assessment of the situation along the Line of Control. COAS was briefed by commanders on the ground about the present situation & ongoing counter-infiltration operations,” ADGPI Indian Army wrote on its Twitter handle. “He was also briefed about the ongoing counter terror operations in Nar Khas and Chamrer forests by the army commanders,” said an army officer. There was an intermittent exchange of fire between the Army and terrorists in Nar Khas forest area of Poonch on Tuesday.

19-10-2021||India||3 in 4 Indians get at least 1 jab as total doses near the billion mark||A little over nine months since India’s mass vaccination programme against Covid-19 kicked off, the country is on the cusp of two major milestones – nearly three out of every four adults in the country have now received at least one shot of the vaccine, and the total doses administered are nearing a billion.The vaccination landmarks come at a time when the recession of the second wave has continued, with new infections and active cases in the country at the lowest levels since early March, or in at least seven months. Till Tuesday night, 990.9 million shots of the vaccine were administered across the country to around 701 million people. Based on current daily vaccination rate, the country’s billionth shot is likely to be delivered as early as Thursday morning.In absolute numbers, this makes India only the second country in the world (next to China with 2.2 billion shots administered) in terms of Covid-19 vaccine doses administered. Of the 701 million people who have been administered these shots, 411 million have been partially vaccinated, while another 290 million people fully vaccinated. When seen alongside India’s estimated population of 940 million adults, 43.7% of the country’s adults have been partially vaccinated and another 30.8% have been given both jabs.A cause of concern for the drive, however, is that daily dose administration has now seen a near-consistent decline from the peak levels seen during the second half of September – a factor that Union health ministry officials and experts have attributed to low turnout during the ongoing festive season and the vaccine hesitancy threshold finally being visible.The seven-day average of daily dose administration, a statistic that evens out the dip generally seen over weekends, touched a peak of 9.7 million for the week ending September 23 when several states increased daily numbers to mark Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday on September 17. Since then, however, it has dropped nearly 60% to around 3.9 million shots a day for the week ending October 19.An easy way to understand the impact of this drop in vaccination pace is to see it as the required run rate in the final overs of a cricket match. In the race for vaccination, as is the case in a run chase, a slower run rate in the middle of an innings requires heavy slogging in the final few overs. In the case of vaccination, if the country had sustained its administration rate of around 10 million doses a day around the third week of September, then it would have been on course to meet its December 31 target of fully vaccinating all adults. But since this rate has dropped in the 25 days since, the required rate has shot up – now India needs to administer more than 12 million doses every day till the end of the year to meet this target.At the rate of administration in the past week (3.9 million a day), however, this target will be delayed by more than five months, data shows.That calculation assumes that the entire adult population of the country will want vaccines, an unlikely proposition. Most experts believe the vaccine drive will hit a ceiling around the 75-80% level. Senior government officials said that the Union government plans to start a dedicated campaign to create awareness among masses to overcome vaccine hesitancy once the billion dose target is achieved. “After 100 crore (1 billion) Covid-19 vaccine doses are administered in the country, we will work on running a massive campaign for generating awareness about taking the second dose, and also addressing overall vaccine hesitancy,” said a top government functionary who asked not to be named.“On weekends and festivals we see a slight drop in numbers but overall, the drive is progressing well. We are looking at covering the entire eligible population as soon as possible; there is no point in talking in terms of deadlines, etc. There is a task at hand that we are trying to accomplish to the best of our capabilities. The number that we have achieved in such a short span of time is remarkable and even higher than the population of several countries,” this person added. The Union health ministry has reviewed the status and progress of Covid vaccination with states, urging them to focus on second dose coverage of vaccination as there is a sizeable chunk of population that is overdue for their second dose.“Highlighting that the nation is close to administering a billion doses, the health secretary congratulated the states/UTs on their effort to vaccinate all citizens. It was highlighted that a sizeable number of beneficiaries who are eligible have not received their second dose. States and UTs were urged to focus on the second vaccination dose...,” the Union health ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. The states have also been advised to identify and prioritise districts that are reporting poor coverage for focused action and explore requirement for mobilisation efforts, addressing localised challenges, need for additional vaccination centres or improving access in hard-to-reach areas. Vaccine hesitancy, which was not apparent in the initial months of the drive due to limited supply of doses and high rush for shots in a country the size of India, is becoming more visible now as coverage has reached high numbers in recent weeks. Experts across the world have warned that any supposed vaccine hesitancy would start showing signs after countries hit a high coverage threshold (say around 70% or so). This is because those who were going to get their shots have now done so, and those who still remain away from vaccination centres are the ones who are hesitant. This has been the reason why even countries such as the United States, which have far better vaccine coverage than countries like India, have been unable to hit 100% coverage.“Vaccine hesitancy is not that big a problem right now as it was at the start of the vaccination drive, but there is still a section that needs convincing to take the shot. It is also important for everyone who has already taken one dose to take their second shot ... taking both are important for maximum protection,” a second senior government official aware of the matter said on condition of anonymity.Experts say that Centre needs to draft an evidence based communication strategy to deal with hesitancy. “The government should hire a professional agency that understands communication to generate data on reasons behind vaccine hesitancy among different age groups as the reasons might be different. And not just age-level, there should also be subgroups such as rural and urban as people in these groups may have different reasons for not coming out to get vaccinated. The data that is generated like this should be used to draft targeted, evidence-based communication strategy for their messaging to be more effective,” said Chandrakant Lahariya, senior public health and vaccine expert, on dealing with vaccine hesitancy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-in-4-indians-get-at-least-1-jab-as-total-doses-near-the-billion-mark-101634665974641.html

19-10-2021||India||Kerala cannot ignore signals of climate change anymore, warn experts||The unseasonal downpour last week has left a trail of death and destruction in Kerala, but a closer look at the weather condition in the state shows that there is a clear shift in rain pattern in the last five years. From the 2018 flood of the century to the October 2021 flash floods, the change is quite visible. Experts say a rise in sea surface temperature in the Arabian Sea is one of the reasons for it and they cite frequent cyclonic circulations over the Arabian Sea to emphasise their point. “The temperature over the Arabian Sea has gone up by 1.2 to 1.4 degrees Celsius in the last two decades increasing the frequency of cyclonic events along the western coast,” said Roxy Mathew, planet scientist with the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune. He said usually temperature in the Arabian Sea is 1.5 degrees lower than the Bay of Bengal and this is one of the reasons for less cyclonic circulations and low pressure in the Arabian Sea. But of late, the situation is changing. What is disturbing is that the warming is seen not only in top layers of sea but also in the deeper layers of the ocean, he said. “We all know more than 90% of the heat on earth is absorbed by oceans. Usually the temperature in the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal is above 28 degrees Celsius and in Arabian Sea it is between 26 to 28 degrees Celsius. But the Arabian Sea is warming up fast. It is quite visible in the last decade or so,” Mathew said. He said a big shift in rain pattern is quite visible these days. “Though monsoon rainfall may decrease, the frequency of heavy rainfall will increase. This leads to an increase in flash floods and landslides,” he said. Kerala should have been very careful in land use because the state is endowed with many hills and rivers and has a slanting geographical landscape. The frequency of cyclonic circulation over the Arabian Sea has also increased manifold-- while there was a 52 per cent increase in cyclonic movement over the Arabian Sea between 2001 and 2019 there is a decrease of 8 per cent during the same period over the Bay of Bengal. The India Meteorology Department statistics show nine cyclones or major depressions had formed in 2020, out of which four were over the Arabian Sea. Experts say one of the reasons for high temperature is chemical reaction in the sea induced by pollution. According to a study conducted by the Central Marine Fisheries Institute of India (CMFRI) in 2018 major oceans will have more plastic than fish. By 2050 more than 850 metric tonne of plastics will be found in the sea whereas fish will be 821 metric tonne by then. Another study conducted by a global body Alfred Wegenar Institute says seas near Mumbai, Kerala and Andaman Nicobar Islands are among the most polluted in the world. “It is sad in Kerala discussions start only after a tragedy and everyone forgets about it soon. It is high time the state will have to give top priority to environmental impact studies when it takes up developmental projects. Cloud bursts, flash floods and landslips are here to stay. The state will have to pay a heavy price if it goes ahead ignoring such climate change signals,” said Dr MG Manoj of the Advanced Centre for Atmospheric Radar Research with the Cochin University of Science and Technology. The state is yet to learn its lesson from the many tragedies including the 2018 flood, said Dr Dr VS Vijayan, a member of the Madhav Gadgil committee on Western Ghats and founding director of the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology. “For us development is plundering of natural resources and cutting of trees. Kerala will have to redraw its development concept completely. Again, we are talking about elevated high-speed railway line, ghat highways and coastal townships,” he said. “Kerala can take the lead in implementing the UN General Assembly resolution on sustainable development. Our overdependence on natural resources will be reduced naturally and we can think of a better tomorrow. Whether you take Uttarakhand, Kerala or the Northeast calamities are leaving untold miseries. But for this, we need a committed political leadership,” he said. The UN General Assembly had passed a resolution in 2017. It is a set of suggestions to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all by 2030. Noted ecological scientist Madhav Gadgil, who headed an expert group to study degradation of Western Ghat mountain ranges, said people will have to take more proactive roles to protect their place of living, surroundings and environment. “I agree lopsided developmental activities aggravated the intensity of natural disasters. But I still have hope about Kerala. It was the first to take up decentralised planning. Let people take up their bread and butter issues along with sustenance,” he said adding states like Maharashtra and Goa also experience similar tragedies year after year but Kerala gets wider publicity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cannot-ignore-signals-of-climate-change-anymore-warn-experts-101634662613035.html

We have decided to get it done. The value of it would be ₹60 to ₹65 crore. The government is capable of undertaking the task of doing it...We have decided to buy from the Reserve Bank of India. We will complete the fundraising and buy the gold from RBI so that we get pure gold," Rao told reporters during his visit to Yadadri.The Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) chief said his family will donate the first 1.16kg of gold to the temple and other ministers and legislative members will also come forward with similar donations.Work to convert the famous hill shrine of Yadadri into a popular hub for religious tourism was launched at the cost of ₹1,200 crore. Rao had said in the state legislature that his government has prioritized development of all religious structures, including mosques and churches.Yadadri is considered to be Rao’s dream of building a temple that matches the opulence of Tirumala in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. Hundreds of sculptors and artisans have been working round the clock in the picturesque hills of Yadagirigutta (which has now been renamed Yadadri), about 70-km away from Hyderabad, to make his dream come true.The latest endeavour of the TRS government to plate the temple in gold is also inspired by the Tirumala temple, and Rao said the government is consulting the experts who carried out a similar exercise at the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-to-buy-125kg-gold-from-rbi-for-temple-tower-at-yadadri-chief-minister-to-donate-the-first-116kg-101634661888092.html
19-10-2021||India||India, EU discuss Covid-19 crisis and resumption of negotiations on trade pact||India and the European Union (EU) discussed ways to jointly tackle the Covid-19 pandemic and the resumption of negotiations for a free trade agreement during a review of their strategic partnership on Tuesday. At a meeting in Brussels, senior officials from the two sides also discussed cooperation to address challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, and to contribute to the success of the upcoming Climate COP26 in the UK next month. Following the India-EU Summit on May 8, the two sides had decided to carry out a comprehensive review of their strategic partnership in line with a roadmap that will guide relations till 2025. This was the third strategic partnership review. “Both sides exchanged views concerning best ways to join forces in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic and its effects on economies, societies as well as individuals,” said a joint statement issued after the meeting. India and the EU also discussed next steps to operationalise the decision by leaders of the two sides to resume negotiations for a balanced, ambitious, comprehensive and mutually beneficial trade agreement, and to launch talks on a stand-alone investment protection agreement and a separate agreement on geographical indications, the statement said. Negotiations on a trade agreement had stalled in 2013 because of differences on issues such as market access for European products and mobility for Indian professionals. India and the EU decided to separate the negotiations on an investment protection agreement as the two sides have fewer differences in this area. The meeting in Brussels also discussed next steps for implementing the India-EU connectivity partnership that was agreed at the summit in May. The two sides further discussed ways to cooperate in research, technology and digital transformation, and the continued implementation of the Common Agenda on Migration and Mobility. “Recalling the successful 9th India-EU Human Rights Dialogue in April 2021, the EU and India looked forward to the next edition of the Dialogue in 2022,” the statement said. The meeting was co-chaired by Reenat Sandhu, secretary (West) in the external affairs ministry, and Helena König, deputy secretary general for economic and global issues in the European External Action Service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-eu-discuss-covid-19-crisis-and-resumption-of-negotiations-on-trade-pact-101634660993158.html

19-10-2021||India||India should not play matches with Pakistan in T-20 World Cup, says Ramdas Athawale||Union Minister Ramdas Athawale slammed Pakistan for the spurt in terror activities in Jammu and Kashmir, including targeted killings of migrant labourers, and said India should not play cricket with Pakistan as part of the T-20 World Cup. Athawale, leader of the Republican Party of India, which is an ally of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) said the country should have an ‘aar paar ki ladaai’ with its neighbour to set things right. Athawale while speaking in Pune on Tuesday said India should not play its scheduled T20 World Cup match against Pakistan on October 24 in order to teach the latter a lesson. “The neighbouring country has not learnt any lessons. If Pakistan does not stop its activities in the (J-K) Valley, then there has to be an ‘aar paar ki ladaai’ (all-out war to settle things once and for all). In J-K, attacks are taking place on migrant labourers, local Kashmiri Pandits are being targeted. It is Pakistan’s ploy to not allow development in the Valley,” Athawale said while responding to a question on the latest spate of violence in the valley. In the past fortnight, as many as 11 civilians including five labourers from outside Kashmir have been killed by terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir, prompting migrant workers to leave the valley. The string of latest round of targeted attacks has prompted reactions from some quarters with BJP leaders such Subramanian Swamy questioning if there was any urgency to hold the India-Pakistan fixture. When asked if the two countries should play cricket matches and whether he will convey his opinion to BCCI office bearers, Athawale said, “I am personally of the opinion that India should not play against Pakistan. I will express this to BCCI secretary Jayesh Shah.” The minister then went on to add that this is also his party’s stand. According to the Union minister, attempts are being made by terrorists to spread fear in the valley among the workers who are coming to the Valley from UP and Bihar. “By resorting to such militant attacks, there is an attempt to spread fear among the workers who are coming to the Valley from UP and Bihar. But the Centre will not fall prey to such tactics,” the minister added. The minister also expressed unhappiness over the rising prices of petrol and diesel, and demanded that both the state government and the central government withdraw some taxes on fuel. Athawale was in the city and interacted with the media on Tuesday, when he spoke on various national and state-level issues. Speaking about rising fuel prices, Athawale said, “It is true that the common man is suffering a lot due to increasing fuel prices. I will raise this issue in the next cabinet meeting and also brief the prime minister about how the common man is suffering.” Athawale said both state and central government should take some burden and bring down the taxes on fuel. On talks about an alliance between the BJP and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) in Maharashtra, Athawale said, “If the BJP enters into an alliance with the MNS, it will have a negative impact on the BJP.

19-10-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: October 20, 1944 — Indian troops capture Tiddim||It is reported that Tiddim has fallen. It was near Tiddim that the 1942 retreat from Burma became a stand.Seven months after the Army left Tiddim in flames and marched out on their 150-mile withdrawal to Manipur, men of the Fifth Indian Division have re-entered this village, says a Press Note. Tiddim, key to the mountain roads through the Chin hills, has been in Japanese hands since March 13 this year, when Major. General David Cowan gave orders to his 17th Indian Division to start back along the road to Imphal. The 14th Army has battled for 31 weeks through the worst of the monsoon. Tiddim was recaptured after a fortnight of intensive air attack and steadily increasing pressure by ground forces, which were deployed in a huge are round the village. The Japanese broke finally on the northern outskirts. With their strong points shattered by almost continuous bombing the fierce resistance with which they had stood up to all attacks vanished overnight. Indian troops who pushed in from the north-west and north-east entered the village without further opposition. Now they are moving on again along the road which leads from Tiddim down the Chindwin valley at Kalewa. Contact with the retreating Japanese is reported a mile from Tiddim and heavy fighting must lie ahead round Kennedy Peak and Fort White, both heavily fortified. Fighting has been in progress north of these points on the Tiddim-Kalemyo road for more than a week, as our forces were moving round in a long outflanking book that anticipated the fall of Tiddim and the enemy’s withdrawal along the road. RANGOON AIRFIELDS RAIDED Wednesday’s attack on airfields near Rangoon was the biggest sweep yet made in this theatre at such a range. Complete reports are not available, but already it is known that the sweep was highly successful. Enemy fighters made vain attempts to drive off the British and U.S. aircraft. One formation of U.S. Thunderbolts shot down two single-engined Jap fighters and destroyed three and damaged three on the ground at Mingaladon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-october-20-1944-indian-troops-capture-tiddim-101634656312754.html

The organisation also called for the United Nations to send a peace keeping force to Bangladesh in order to put an end to the violent attacks on Hindus.“The VHP warns the Bangladesh government that if they want to stand in the line of developing countries, they will have to break free from their radical image. Extremists will have to be dealt with in the same manner as was done in 1971,” the statement read.
19-10-2021||India||Pakistan claim about blocking submarine questioned by India||The Pakistan Navy’s claim of blocking an Indian submarine from entering the country’s territorial waters was questioned on Tuesday by the Indian side, which noted the vessel allegedly involved in the incident appeared to have been operating in international waters. A statement issued by the Pakistani military’s media arm said the navy had detected and blocked what was reportedly an attempt by an Indian submarine to enter Pakistani waters in the Arabian Sea on October 16. “It is the third incident of its kind wherein an Indian submarine has been prematurely detected and tracked by Pakistan Navy’s long range maritime patrol aircraft,” the statement said. The Pakistan Navy has been keeping a “strict monitoring watch” to safeguard maritime frontiers in the prevailing security milieu, it said. However, people familiar with the matter on the Indian side questioned whether the vessel involved in the purported incident was an Indian submarine. The people said on condition of anonymity the vessel purportedly detected by the Pakistan Navy appeared to be 140 to 150 nautical miles away from the port city of Karachi, according to GPS coordinates shown in a video released by the Pakistani military. The people said, a country’s territorial waters extend to 12 nautical miles from the shore, and any vessel can freely operate in international waters. The authenticity of the video also was not known, they added. “The recent incident reflects the deplorable Indian machinations vis-à-vis commitment and resolve of Pakistan Navy to defend maritime frontiers of the motherland,” the Pakistani statement added. There was no official word from the Indian side. The Pakistan Navy had earlier claimed it had detected Indian submarines trying to enter the country’s territorial waters in November 2016 and March 2019. Both those incidents had been dismissed by the Indian side. The militaries of two countries have been on high alert since 2019, when India conducted an airstrike targeting militants inside Pakistan following a suicide bombing at Pulwama in Kashmir that killed 40 Indian troopers. In February this year, India and Pakistan agreed to adhere to the 2003 ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir following months of back-channel contacts between the two sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-claim-about-blocking-submarine-questioned-by-india-101634654452322.html

19-10-2021||India||IMD predicts rainfall, snow in parts of country in coming days||The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has made forecasts of rain and snowfall in certain parts of the country in days to come. Even as the monsoon has retreated from most parts of India, states like Delhi, Kerala and Uttarakhand received heavy rainfall in the past few days. Experts said formation of low pressure areas and cloudbursts are behind incessant rainfall in these states.At 94.6mm of rainfall, the national capital witnessed its wettest October since 1960, according to the IMD. Just last month the city broke another record, after reporting the highest amount of rainfall since September 1944. Heavy rainfall caused waterlogging and created traffic disruptions all over the city.Uttarakhand also witnessed incessant rainfall, leading to landslides all over the state. At least 16 people have died in various rain-related incidents so far. On Monday, Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami ordered Char Dham Yatra be halted in the state for the next three days.IMD made a forecast of heavy rainfall in Uttarakhand for the next three days. "As predicted, rainfall activity has reduced significantly over northwest and adjoining central India from today (Tuesday). However, due to western disturbance and its interaction with easterlies at lower levels, fairly widespread rainfall with isolated heavy rainfall very likely over Uttarakhand on today and dry weather subsequent three days," the IMD bulletin said.Incessant rainfall triggered flooding, leading to destruction of properties, submerged roads. Several people are feared trapped under debris. Nainital was cut off from the rest of the state as three roads leading to the town were blocked owing to landslides.Heavy downpour battered Kerala since Friday, triggering landslides and heavy flooding across the state, and claiming at least 27 lives. Meanwhile, the IMD has issued an orange alert for districts such as Thiruvananthapuram, Pathanamthitta, Kottayam, Alappuzha, Ernakulam, Idukki, Thrissur, Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode and Wayanad, most of which were earlier put on red alert.The state administration started opening the sluice gates of many dams to release excess water, as water levels were nearing the danger mark. The state disaster management authority carried out evacuation drives for inhabitants of low-lying areas.The weather agency has also predicted heavy rainfall in eastern and northeast India. “Intense spell of rainfall activity very likely to continue over East and Northeast India very till 20 October 2021 and reduction thereafter,” IMD tweeted, adding that “Fresh spell of rainfall activity over south peninsular India (Kerala and Mahe, Tamil Nadu and Coastal & SIK) during next 4-5 days."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imd-predicts-rainfall-snow-in-parts-of-country-in-coming-days-101634646986734.html

19-10-2021||India||Centre's hoardings written in Assamese allegedly defaced by local organisations in Barak valley: Report||Police in Silchar lodged an FIR against local organisations on Tuesday for allegedly smearing government hoardings written in Assamese with black ink in Barak valley, news agency PTI reported.Assam’s Barak Valley, which comprises Cachar, Karimganj, and Hailakandi districts, is an area predominantly inhabited by the Bengali-speaking community. The government signposts and hoardings contain both Assamese and Bangla. However, the bone of contention was with the Jal Jeevan Mission hoardings which were written only in Assamese.Unidentified people defaced the posters of the Jal Jeevan Mission in front of Silchar railway station and reportedly wrote ‘Banglay likhun’, insisting upon using the Bangla language in the posters of the Centre’s scheme. The names of two organisations were reportedly scribbled below the message written over the posters. Visuals reportedly surfaced that showed unidentified people climbing a ladder to deface the posters, news agency PTI reported. However, Hindustan Times could not verify the authenticity of the visuals.Activists of Barak Democratic Yuva Front (BYDF) and All Bengali Students Youth Organisation (ABSYO) are suspected to be associated with the incident, the report said. The BYDF questioned the usage of Bengali. Reacting to the FIR, BYDF leader Pradip Dutta Roy questioned why Bangla was not used despite being designated as an authorised official language in that part of the state following a language agitation in the 1960s.Cachar superintendent of police Ramandeep Kaur said the FIR was lodged based on a complaint made by the Jal Jeevan Mission officials. She said that strict action will be taken against those involved. “On the basis of the complaint, we have registered an FIR at Silchar Sadar police station on Monday. Appropriate action will be taken against the culprits after investigation,” Kaur said.Ironical that the language issue has cropped up only days after HCM @himantabiswa spent the whole ‘Saptami’ of #DurgaPuja with the ‘Bengalis’ of #barakvalley !Is this plain coincidence or is there a malacious intent behind ? Smells fishy !@CMOfficeAssam pic.twitter.com/ZrOB8Mi3gRSilchar MP Rajdeep Roy warned people against divisive elements, saying that they could use language as an issue to foster enmity between communities. “Do not fall prey to such designs,” Roy said. Trinamool Congress MP Susmita Dev condemned the blackening of the posters but alleged that the hoarding disrespected the ‘Language Act’.The Barak Valley is home to more than 3.6 million people. The use of Bangla as a language for official purposes was authorised following a movement by the Bengali-speaking community of the Barak valley, which saw the death of 11 protesters in police firing at Silchar railway station on May 16, 1961.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centres-hoardings-written-in-assamese-defaced-in-barak-valley-report-101634643297254.html

Soon, a massive backlash followed on Twitter with many slamming the food delivery app for “imposing Hindi” on its customers. This also led to hashtags "Reject_Zomato" and "ZomatoSpeakTamil" trending on top on the social media platform."Customer care says amount can't be refunded as I didn't know Hindi. Also takes lesson that being an Indian I should know Hindi. Tagged me a liar as he didn't know Tamil. @zomato not the way you talk to a customer," a user who goes by the handle "@Vikash67456607" tweeted. He also shared screenshots of his purported chat with the customer care agent in question.The customer also urged Zomato to consider giving the agent proper training instead of terminating her. "Hello@zomato. Apart from the clarification regarding the issue, I request you to reconsider on recruiting back the employee rather than terminating. I suggest to give them a proper training instead. The legacy of Tamils is self-respect and not revenge,” he said in a tweet later.In response, Zomato issued an apology in Tamil and English and also threw in the Tamil greeting of Vanakkam. The company said it has sacked the employee as her "behaviour was clearly against the principles of sensitivity that we train our agents for on a regular basis".In a statement issued on Twitter, the company also said it was in the process of building a local Tamil call/support centre in Coimbatore in the state. "We understand food and language are core to any local culture and we take both of them seriously," it added.Vanakkam Vikash, we apologise for our customer care agent's behaviour. Here's our official statement on this incident. We hope you give us a chance to serve you better next time. Pls don't #Reject_Zomato ♥️ https://t.co/P350GN7zUl pic.twitter.com/4Pv3Uvv32uHowever, Zomato founder Deepinder Goyal said hours later they were reinstating the agent as there was no reason to sack someone and that these things can be easily learned going forward. Defending the agent further, he said it was "an ignorant mistake" on the part of the employee.In a series of tweets, Goyal lashed out at people criticising Zomato, stating that the "level of tolerance and chill" needs to be much higher in the country. "An ignorant mistake by someone in a support centre of a food delivery company became a national issue. The level of tolerance and chill in our country needs to be way higher than it is nowadays. Who's to be blamed here?” he said."And remember, our call centre agents are young people, who are at the start of their learning curves and careers. They are not experts on languages and regional sentiments. Nor am I, btw.”An ignorant mistake by someone in a support centre of a food delivery company became a national issue. The level of tolerance and chill in our country needs to be way higher than it is nowadays. Who's to be blamed here?“Having said that, we should all tolerate each other's imperfections.

19-10-2021||India||Centre may allow private funding for wildlife conservation||The Centre may soon allow private and corporate funding for India’s wildlife conservation efforts by forming a national-level public trust, officials aware of the matter said. The proposal for this was floated at the last meeting of the standing committee of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) held in late September.“The budget available for the management of protected areas is insufficient. Hence, the proposal was floated... to mobilise funds from other sources. Even though it is still at a nascent stage, but we are moving in that direction,” said a Union environment and forest ministry official, requesting anonymity.Officials said the Centre would soon invite suggestions and opinions from forest officials across the country, including chief wildlife wardens of states, conservationists, experts and NGOs. A committee would be formed to study the suggestions before giving shape to the foundation.Experts have welcomed the proposal. “This is a very good idea, but the government has to ensure that the corporate sector does not have a disproportionate say in the decision-making process,” said Raman Sukumar, an ecologist, who attended the meeting.H S Singh, an NBWL member, said he suggested in the meeting that such a foundation should be formed at the state and not at the national level. “The first idea is to involve every section of the society-- be it an individual, an NGO or a corporate firm. Funds would follow.”Also Read: Maharashtra approves 10-year action plan for safety, conservation of wildlifeA National Tiger Conservation Authority official said similar foundations have been formed at the level of tiger reserves across the country.A second Union environment and forest ministry official said the money collected from tourists entering the tiger reserves are deposited in the tiger conservation foundations and are utilised for conservation. “The national foundation would be working on similar lines.

Muthalik is heard saying the mosque, which is among the biggest religious institutions in Gadaq, was a temple that was “forcibly converted” by oppressive Muslim rulers.HindutvaWatch, which calls itself an independent research initiative monitoring reports of attacks on minorities and marginalised communities in India, on Tuesday posted the video of Muthalik’s provocative speech in Gadag on Sunday.“For 72 years we had to fight for Ram Mandir. After 72 years of struggle, we were able to complete our resolve to demolish it and construct a grand temple. In the same way in Gadag, I challenge that the place known as Jumma Masjid is actually Venkateswara Temple,” Muthalik said. “During Tipu Sultan’s period, this temple is among those that were demolished, and we have evidence. We will fight for this.”“We already have two documents that state that this (Jumma Masjid) was a temple. We have applied for documents under RTI (Right to Information Act) and will start our struggle from there,” Muthalik told HT on Tuesday. He added that they would start from Gadag and then focus on other parts of the state where temples were allegedly converted into mosques and reclaim them.The comments come amid a rise in communal violence and hate crimes in the state. A video purportedly showing a group of Bajrang Dal and Vishwa Hindu Parishad members forcing their way into a church in neighbouring Hubballi-Dharwad and chanting bhajans earlier went viral on social media. The group accused Christian priests of trying to lure people from backward communities to convert.Also Read | Name a Muslim as Karnataka CM face: Congress MLA to KumaraswamyKarnataka’s Bharatiya Janata Party government has sought to introduce an anti-conversion law.

Those emotions should not be affected, and such should be the behaviour. When such emotions are hurt there is likely to be an action and reaction,” Bommai told reporters in Mangaluru, about 350 km from Bengaluru.Congress leader Siddaramaiah attacked Bommai over the remarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sri-ram-sena-leader-seeks-to-reclaim-17th-century-mosque-in-karnataka-101634639378484.html

As I have joined the TMC, there is no point in holding on to my seat in Asansol. I have come into politics because of Asansol. I will do as much as possible for that constituency,” he had said after joining West Bengal’s ruling party.Earlier he took potshots at Sisir Adhikari, who joined the BJP in March this year before Bengal assembly elections but continues to hold on to his Kanthi Lok Sabha seat which was won as a TMC candidate, saying it should be vacated.

This took the toll from rain-related incidents in the state to at least 22 since Monday as incessant rains lashed Uttarakhand for the third day.District magistrate Dheeraj Singh Garbiyal said that at least 12 bodies have been recovered from the spot while rescue efforts continue at the scene where several people were suspected to have been buried under the muck.The cloudburst, or a sudden and very heavy localised rainfall, was reported around 5 am and led to flash floods in Ramgarh and Okhladanda blocks. “...the cloud burst in Ramgarh block, about 35 km from Nainital town, caused a flash flood. It resulted in heavy damage in Ramgarh as well as Okhladanda block ...” said Garbiyal. He added the roads leading to the affected areas have been badly damaged and forced them to seek the Army and Indian Air Force’s help. “(They) are now assisting the state agencies in the rescue and relief work.”Five people died while one was rescued in Mukteshwar after a wall of a college collapsed on a shanty.Preeti Priyadarshini, superintendent of police (Nainital), said the six people were labourers and were staying in the shanty when the wall collapsed on them Tuesday morning due to heavy rains in the area.“The local police and SDRF (State Disaster Response Force) rushed to the spot for rescue operation... five bodies were retrieved while one was rescued and sent to nearby hospital for treatment.

Apart from this, 100 people from various waterlogged areas of Uddham Singh Nagar district were also rescued... on Tuesday.”Dhami chaired a meeting at the state disaster management control room to assess the damage caused to life and property. “During the meeting, he also called up the district magistrates of Rudraprayag and Chamoli to especially focus on the char dham yatra route to ensure the pilgrims do not face any problem. He is also getting regular updates from all the district magistrates on the rain situation in their respective districts,” said an official, who did not want to be named. “He also directed the authorities to provide compensation to the victims as soon as possible.”Dhami later left for aerial and ground surveillance of the rain-affected areas with disaster management minister Dhan Singh Rawat.He later appealed to the people “not to panic and keep calm.”“I urge the people to keep calm as the government is providing all possible help to the affected ones.

In her complaint, the mother of the teenager said her daughter was sexually assaulted while she was 17 and was scared to approach the police. Since the woman was a minor at the time of the alleged assault in 2019, police booked Mavunkal under the Pocso Act. The case has been transferred to the special investigation team (SIT) probing cases against Mavunkal.“When we asked why they delayed the complaint, they said they were really scared and mustered enough courage after his arrest,” an investigator said, requesting anonymity. Many top police officers were reportedly close to Mavunkal, who used deceit to dupe people and rubbed shoulders with the who’s who of the state.Mavunkal was arrested on September 26 after five businessmen complained to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan that he cheated them of ₹10 crore by promising shares in the upcoming international antique museums in Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram. Later, other businessmen filed cheating complaints against him. A rape survivor also alleged Mavunkal threatened her to withdraw the complaint against her tormentor.Also Read: Gates of Idukki dam opened in rain-battered Kerala, rescue ops onThe government constituted the SIT, which last week recorded the statement of Italy-based Malayali woman Anitha Pullayil, who reportedly introduced many senior police officers to Mavunkal .

After cheating cases surfaced against Mavunkal, Pullayil told news channels she advised many allegedly conned by him to approach the police. Pullayil added she was unaware of the shady deals of Mavunkal and stayed away from him after she got an inkling regarding some of them.Details of cover-up and laxity came to light after Mavunkal’s arrest. Many police officers regularly visited his house, museum and a cosmetology clinic in Kochi that he ran on the basis of a fake degree.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-fake-antique-collector-mavunkal-booked-for-raping-minor-101634628637667.html

The bill proposes the authority will be in an advisory capacity and no longer be tasked with conducting tree census. It says it will have to only “maintain a record of tree cover outside forests based on the report of the Forest Survey of India”.The district-level authorities were responsible for “the preservation of all trees within its jurisdiction”. The state-level authority will now only be “advising the government and all concerned for preservation of all trees within its jurisdiction.”“The Bill seeks... to ensure [a] holistic approach with a single apex authority at the State level for effective guidance and supervision for protection and conservation of trees in Goa,” the government said in the statement. “The proposed Authority shall act as a principal advisory [body] to the government for protection, preservation and conservation of trees covered under the Act.”Also Read: Schools in Goa reopen for classes 9 to 12 with COVID-19 protocols in placeThe state has two authorities for each district.

The BJP has called the scheme “Muslim appeasement”.State minority affairs minister Saleh Mohammad rejected the BJP’s criticism as “baseless politics” and underlined the scheme is in line with the Prime Minister’s 15-point programme for the welfare of minorities. “If they have issues, they should ask the Prime Minister to stop the programme,” he said.Under the scheme, the seminaries are provided with computers, internet connectivity, smart classes, furniture and other basic necessities. Mohammad said the state government wants to promote quality education for 200,000 students studying in these seminaries and allocated ₹3 crore in 2019-20, ₹5 crore in 2020-21, and ₹17 crore for 2021-22 for the scheme. He added there are 6,000 registered Muslim seminaries in the state. Mohammad said only those that fulfil the conditions under the scheme will get the grants.Also Read: Rajasthan to introduce stringent provisions to check unfair means in recruitment examsBJP leader and former education minister Vasudev Devnani said there cannot be a bigger example of Congress’s “appeasement politics” than the scheme.

The government is providing ₹25 lakh for the development of madrasas. The bonus is being given to madrasas ahead of Diwali.

19-10-2021||India||From Cabinet to Congress, leaders and political parties shun digital meetings||Sitaram Yechury is a busy man these days. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary is coordinating with leaders of at least 18 Opposition parties for a meeting—a physical one—in New Delhi. The last such meeting on August 20 was an easier affair. It was online and leaders from Tamil Nadu to West Bengal just logged in from their offices instead of flying to the national capital.As Covid-19 cases in India continue to dip and more and more people are getting vaccinated, political parties have begun to shun digital meetings—the mainstay for India’s political and administrative activities for over 18 months. Two months after the pandemic hit India in January 2020, India’s top decision-making body, the Union cabinet, switched online for meetings by March as a nationwide lockdown was imposed to check it. Initially, a big centre table in the Cabinet room was removed to make space for the social distancing of ministers. Later, ministers were told to log on through a secured portal for online Cabinet meetings.Union cabinet meetings have been held in offline mode over the last two months. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also chaired two meetings of the Union council of ministers (78 members) in the spacious Rashtrapati Bhavan cultural centre on September 14 and September 28.President Ram Nath Kovind, whose meetings and tours were earlier restricted, addressed union ministers at the September 14 meeting. He also resumed his official tours and went to his ancestral village near Kanpur in June.Also Read: Punjab cabinet opposes Centre’s decision to extend BSF’s jurisdictionThe Congress, too, held the first offline meeting of the party’s top decision-making body, Congress Working Committee (CWC), in 18 months on October 16. Congress president Sonia Gandhi presided over three CWC, as well as two meetings with the party’s Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha lawmakers online in view of the pandemic. She also held a meeting of Opposition leaders online on August 20.The Congress also called former foreign secretaries Shiv Shankar Menon and Shyam Saran for an online briefing on Afghanistan a day before external affairs minister S Jaishankar held an all-party meeting on the situation in India’s neighbourhood in August.Yechury’s party, which once infamously opposed computerisation in West Bengal, has held meetings of its Politburo and Central Committee online. The last Politburo meeting was held offline in New Delhi last week.The Bharatiya Janata Party, too, has scheduled its next National Executive meeting offline this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-cabinet-to-congress-meetings-are-back-offline-101634625277643.html
19-10-2021||India||China ramps up scale, duration of military drills in Arunachal sector||China has ramped up the scale and duration of its military drills across the contested border in Arunachal Pradesh after a standoff with India erupted along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Ladakh sector, and the reserve formations mobilised by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) last year are still deployed there, Eastern Army commander Lieutenant General Manoj Pande said on Tuesday. Pande said both sides were also attempting to scale up infrastructure near the LAC in the eastern sector. “Annual training exercises by PLA have increased in their depth areas. Reserve formations mobilised (after the Ladakh standoff began in May 2020) still remain in training areas in the depth,” Pande said, while briefing reporters on the LAC situation in the east at the Rupa-headquartered HQs 5 Mountain Division. He said the focus of PLA’s exercises was on integrated operations by its forces. He added that the Indian army had noted the developments across the LAC and taken counter measures to deal with any contingency. “Adequate forces are deployed in all sectors to deal with any contingency. We are also rehearsing and preparing for various contingencies that may arise,” he said. “In certain areas where our deployment was thin, steps have been taken to strengthen it.” His comments came days after the 13th round of military talks between India and China to cool tensions in Ladakh reached an impasse on October 10, with PLA not agreeing to suggestions made by the Indian Army. The military dialogue took place more than two months after the last round of talks that led to disengagement of forward deployed troops from Gogra, or Patrol Point-17A, which was one of the flashpoints on the LAC in Ladakh. Although the eastern sector has not seen the same level of activity as in Ladakh, the LAC is equally contested throughout its length, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd). “Therefore, Eastern Command will remain prepared for all contingencies including additional deployment to strengthen the defensive posture. As long as disengagement and de-escalation remain stalled, the situation will remain tense,” he added. The Asapila sector in Arunachal Pradesh was among the areas where the Indian Army observed infrastructure development by PLA close to LAC, and it had led to a corresponding increase in troop deployment there, Pande said. Commenting on the face-offs between rival troops at Naku La in north Sikkim, he said patrols came face-to-face in the area because of differing perception of LAC, and protocols were in place to resolve the situation even though sometimes confrontations lasted longer. Scores of Indian and Chinese soldiers were involved in a tense face-off in Naku La in May 2020, with rival troops suffering injuries in the incident. Another face-off took place in Naku La between the two sides earlier this year, with the developments making the area a possible flashpoint in the east. The Indian Army has stepped up surveillance along LAC and in Chinese depth areas using satellites, long-range unmanned aerial vehicles and other hi-tech intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) systems, Pande said. Both India and China have sharpened focus on building infrastructure in forward areas to support military deployments, he said. “PLA is taking measures to build capabilities. We are doing the same to counter the threat,” he said.General Pande said the army’s focus was on sharpening its surveillance capabilities using niche technologies including modern aerial platforms, superior network of radars, hi-tech night vision systems and modern communication equipment. Hindustan Times reported on Tuesday that the army is making a big surveillance push using latest technology to offset the requirement of deploying extra troops on the contested border with China in Arunachal Pradesh. He said the army’s new mountain strike corps, raised to counter the Chinese threat in the east, is fully operational now. “We are looking at the integrated battle group (IBG) model to enhance its operational efficiency and have better options,” he said. Existing and future threats require the army to be “agile, lean and mean” so that it can deploy at a swift pace, Pande said, explaining the significance of the IBG concept that is being embraced by the army.“Technological developments in mobility, long-range strike capability and other areas also demand we change the concept of war fighting and evolve new structures. IBGs are a logical step towards fighting and winning future wars,” he said. He added that new equipment deployed in the Ladakh sector was being simultaneously inducted in the east, with the focus being on enhancing mobility, drone and counter-drone systems, precision-guided ammunition and surveillance systems. On the vulnerability of the Siliguri corridor connecting the North-east with the rest of India, he said the armed forces, Central Armed Police Forces, Central agencies and state governments were working in tandem to mitigate the threat. Bhutan, with which China has a border dispute, is central to India’s national security as the country lies next to the Siliguri corridor and any territorial compromise made by Bhutan will have an adverse impact on Indian defences in the area. Bhutan and China on Thursday signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on a “three-step roadmap” for expediting negotiations on their boundary dispute, prompting a cautious response from India against the backdrop of the standoff on the LAC.The agreement was signed four years after Indian and Chinese troops were involved in a 73-day face-off within Bhutanese territory at Doklam. That face-off began in June 2017 after India sent in its troops to prevent the construction of roads and infrastructure by Chinese troops in violation of agreements between Bhutan and China.Bhutan and China have held 24 rounds of talks between 1984 and 2016 to settle their border issue and, according to discussions in the Bhutanese parliament and other public records of these meetings, these discussions have only focused on disputes in the western and central sections of the boundary. The two sides have also held 10 meetings of an expert group.Pande flagged concerns about the “dual use” of villages being set up by China in forward areas, and said the army was factoring in the development in its operational planning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-ramps-up-scale-duration-of-military-drills-in-east-after-ladakh-border-row-101634624737381.html

19-10-2021||India||J&K civilian killings to be probed by National Investigation Agency||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) will take over the probe for now into six of the 11 targeted killings of civilians in Kashmir this month with The Resistance Front (TRF) and other Pakistan-based outfits emerging as the perpetrators, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.The NIA is already probing a larger conspiracy in the killings and has arrested nine persons and raided over two dozen places linked with TRF. Its investigations have found the killings are part of a well-hatched conspiracy from across the border to create an atmosphere of fear in the Valley and derail the government’s efforts to increase industrial activities there, an official said on the condition of anonymity.The people cited above said the NIA has got some clues about people coordinating these attacks and more raids will be carried out. The NIA will take over the probe into the killings of Makhal Lal Bindroo, who ran a popular pharmacy in Srinagar, street vendor Virendra Paswan, Supinder Kaur, a Sikh teacher, and her colleague, Deepak Chand, as well as labourers Raja Reshi and Joginder Reshi. The federal anti-terror agency is expected to take over the probe into other five killings later.Also Read: Migrants crowd railway station to catch a train out of KashmirUnited Liberation Front (ULF), a shadowy organisation, claimed responsibility for the fresh attack on civilians on Sunday that left Raja Reshi and Joginder Reshi dead, saying it was carried out as a reprisal while asking migrant workers to leave the region. The attack on Sunday was the third on migrant workers in two days. Arvind Kumar Sah, a resident of Banka in Bihar, was killed in Srinagar and Sageer Ahmad, a carpenter from Saharanpur, was shot dead in Pulwama on Saturday. Five of the 11 civilians killed this month in Kashmir were migrant workers. Mohammad Shafi Lone, a Kashmiri taxi operator, was also killed.The Jammu and Kashmir administration has moved thousands of migrant workers to “safer areas”.

19-10-2021||India||Indian Army guns down six LeT terrorists in Rajouri jungles, fire-fight on||The Indian Army has gunned down six terrorists belonging to Pakistan based Laskhar-e-Taiba (LeT) in the ongoing encounter in the thick jungles of Rajouri sector with efforts on to neutralise the remaining three to four Islamic jihadists by the 16 Corps troops.After the Indian Army lost nine men in engaging the terrorists in Rajouri jungles, Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Gen Bipin Rawat visited the area on October 16 to hold discussions with the local commanders handling the ongoing counter-terrorist operations. It is understood that the Indian Army commanders were told to wait or tire out the terrorists in deliberate operations rather than pro-actively engaging them on their terms.“Casualties to our troops have occurred due to the advantage the terrorists took by operating in buddy pairs of two. This allowed them to continuously change position and engage a larger body of troops, resulting in casualties,” said a Indian Army commander.According to South Block, as many as nine to 10 LeT terrorists infiltrated from Pakistan towards the jungles between Rajouri-Poonch district borders in the past two to three months. While many  infiltration bids were foiled on the LoC and along the fence, the Pak terrorists were buoyed with their success in Afghanistan and to that extent the terror surge was anticipated by the Indian Army and the security agencies.While the Indian troops were raring in “josh” to get the terrorists, on the spot instructions were issued to establish a cordon around the area with presence of terrorists. The change in tactics was that now it was left to the terrorists to make the movement to get replenishments from the nearby villages for survival and thus expose themselves as targets. “ Jungle warfare required patience and the instructions to troops are to be cautious and avoid casualties by engaging the terrorists head-on. Since time is not a constraint, we will tire out the terrorists and eliminate them,” said a commander.Although it is a matter of time when the Indian Army counter-terrorist troops eliminate the remaining terrorists, the plethora of weapons and night vision devices left by the US troops in Afghanistan will raise the level of violence in Kashmir as Pak based jihadists groups believe that they can occupy Jammu and Kashmir like Taliban militarily occupied Afghanistan.The Pakistani deep state is also brimming with confidence as they were the real force behind Taliban occupation of Afghanistan. For them, the new agenda is Islamization of Jammu and Kashmir with Pakistan terrorists taking on the Indian Army on LoC and their local proxies targeted non-Muslims to ensure that the Valley is turned into a Muslim ghetto.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-army-guns-down-six-let-terrorists-in-rajouri-jungles-fire-fight-on-101634621499786.html

According to Prime Minister's Office (PMO), the inauguration will be marked by landing of inaugural flight at the airport from Colombo carrying Sri lankan delegation of over 100 Buddhist monks and dignitaries, including a 12-member holy relic entourage.The Prime Minister will also participate in an event marking Abhidhamma Day at Mahaparinirvana Temple, said the PMO. Later in the day, he will attend a public function to inaugurate and lay the foundation stone of various development projects in Kushinagar. Kushinagar is the place where Gautam Buddha attained Mahaparinirvana. It is an international Buddhist pilgrimage centre, the centre point of the Buddhist circuit, which consists of other sites at Lumbini, Sarnath and Gaya.Uttar Pradesh governor Anandiben Patel, chief minister Yogi Adityanath and Union minister for Civil Aviation Jyotiraditya Scindia will also be present at the inauguration ceremony among others.The international airport will get operational this week to ease cumbersome travel of earlier times and facilitate the air travel requirements of international Buddhist pilgrims in India, said the PMO.Tourism inflow is expected to rise by up to 20 per cent with the inauguration of the flight.The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has developed the Kushinagar airport with a new terminal building spread across 3600sqm, at an estimated cost of ₹260 crore in association with the government of Uttar Pradesh considering the demand of the domestic and international visitors and pilgrimage.The new terminal is equipped to handle 300 passengers during peak hours.The airport will serve a population of more than two crores since the airport has a hinterland of around 10-15 districts and will be a great support for the large migrant population of Eastern Uttar Pradesh and Western/Northern parts of Bihar, said the PMO. This will also boost the opportunities for the export of horticultural products like bananas, strawberries and mushrooms, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-visit-kushinagar-on-wednesday-to-inaugurate-international-airport-101634619991960.html
19-10-2021||India||Kerala's rain pattern has seen a big shift, say experts||The unseasonal downpour last week left a trail of death and destruction in Kerala amid a shift in rain patterns in the state over the last five years. From the 2018 flood of the century to flash floods this month, the change is evident. Experts say the temperature over the Arabian Sea has increased by 1.2 to 1.4 degrees C in the last two decades, increasing the frequency of cyclonic events along the western coast. Usually, the temperature in the Arabian Sea is 1.5 degrees lower than the Bay of Bengal and this is one of the reasons for less cyclonic circulations and low pressure in the Arabian Sea. But of late, the situation is changing. Experts say the warming is not limited to the top layers of the sea.“...more than 90 of the heat on earth is absorbed by oceans. Usually, temperatures in the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal are above 28 degrees C and in the Arabian Sea, it is between 26 to 28 degrees. But the Arabian Sea is warming up fast. It is quite visible in the last decade or so,” said Roxy Mathew, a scientist with Pune’s Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.He said a big shift in rain pattern is quite visible and added Kerala should have been very careful in land use because the state is endowed with many hills and rivers and has a slanting geographical landscape.The frequency of cyclonic circulation over the Arabian Sea has also increased manifold. There has been a 52% increase in cyclonic movement over the Arabian Sea between 2001 and 2019 and eight per cent during the same period in the Bay of Bengal. The India Meteorological Department statistics show nine cyclones or major depressions were formed in 2020, out of which four were over the Arabian Sea.Also Watch: Couple floats to wedding venue in cooking vessel in rain-hit KeralaExperts say one of the reasons for high temperature is a chemical reaction in the sea induced by pollution. According to a Central Marine Fisheries Institute of India study in 2018, major oceans will have more plastic than fish. By 2050, over 850 metric tonnes of plastics will be found in the sea whereas fish will be 821 metric tonnes. Another Alfred Wegener Institute study says seas near Mumbai, Kerala, and Andaman Nicobar Islands are among the most polluted in the world.“It is sad in Kerala discussions start only after a tragedy and everyone forgets about it soon. It is high time the state gives top priority to environmental impact studies when it takes up developmental projects. Cloud bursts, flash floods, and landslips are here to stay. The state will have to pay a heavy price if it goes ahead ignoring the climate change signals,” said M G Manoj of the Advanced Centre for Atmospheric Radar Research, Cochin University of Science and Technology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cannot-ignore-signals-of-climate-crisis-warn-experts-101634620116830.html

He had earlier described the attacks on Durga Puja venues in the neighbouring country a well-planned assault on the Sanatani Bengali community.The Bangladesh government had ordered a probe into the matter, however, ISKCON authorities on Sunday asked for intervention by the United Nations secretary general, Antonio Guterres. The attack on ISKCON at Noakhali is the latest in a series of attacks on Hindu religious places in Bangladesh during the Durga Puja celebrations.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson in West Bengal, Samik Bhattacharya accused the Sheikh Hasina government of inaction. “Such incidents of atrocities on Hindus have increased over the past few months. The government remained a mute spectator,” Bhattacharya added.The BJP also held processions in several districts in West Bengal to protest against the attacks on Hindu temples and minorities in Bangladesh.Other political parties such as the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) have also condemned the communal violence targeting Bengali Hindus. The TMC’s general secretary and spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said, “Serious allegations of vandalism of Durga Puja pandals have poured in from Bangladesh. This is worrisome. It should be investigated. If it is found to be true, the Bangladesh government should take action.”Also Read: BJP protests after youth wing leader shot dead in Bengal’s Uttar DinajpurVice president of the ISKCON temple that was attacked last Friday, Radharamn Das claims that at least two of the temple devotees, Jatan Kumar Saha and Partha Das were killed and around 20 others were injured.

The state health department is planning to ramp up testing, which had dropped during the festive season, in the coming weeks senior officials said. “The number of RT-PCR tests had dropped to almost half during the puja. We are going to increase it now. While 39,661 tests were done on October 1, the number of tests dropped to around 21,217 on October 15. We have already starting ramping up [the number of] tests. On October 17, we conducted 27,148 tests. This will be increased further,” said a senior official of the state health department. During the first wave of the infection last year, West Bengal recorded maximum number of Covid-19 cases on October 22, when 4,157 new cases were registered following shopping spree ahead of Durga Puja festivities. At the peak of the second Covid wave in the state on May 14, just after the assembly elections ended this year, the daily count had shot up to 20,846. In both instances health experts blamed huge gatherings that too without adhering to safety norms for the spike. “This year we saw that Covid-19 safety protocols were flouted rampantly. Pandal hoppers hit the streets in thousands with huge gatherings seen outside puja pandals. Many were not even wearing masks, forget social distancing and sanitising. The next two weeks will be very crucial,” said Sukumar Mukherjee, member of the expert committee that was set up in 2020 to advise chief minister Mamata Banerjee on pandemic-related matters. Also Read: BJP protests after youth wing leader shot dead in Bengal’s Uttar DinajpurEven though the high court had banned entry of visitors inside puja pandals, visitors gathered in large numbers at the barricades put up outside pandals. The police had to stop the entry of visitors in one pandal at Salt Lake, which was modelled on Burj Khalifa and became a major crowd puller. The Eastern Railway too had to cancel around 13 pairs of trains to stop people from coming to Kolkata for pandal hopping on the puja days. “Even though there has been no surge yet but we are getting ripples with the daily Covid-19 cases increasing and falling. We need to increase our testing and keep a close watch. The coming weeks will be very crucial,” said Manas Gumta, general secretary of Association of Health Service Doctors in the state. This becomes all the more important because the state education department has initiated the process to reopen schools and colleges. Educational institutions are likely to reopen in November. Local trains still remain cancelled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-weeks-crucial-to-check-fresh-covid-19-surge-in-west-bengal-say-experts-101634616396541.html

PM is afraid of speaking on China. Our 9 soldiers died (in J&K) & on Oct 24 India-Pakistan T20 match will happen,” news agency ANI quoted Asaduddin Owaisi as saying in Hyderabad.Owaisi's remarks came in the backdrop of rising fuel prices which were further hiked by ₹35 paise a litre on Sunday. While the price of petrol rose to its highest-ever level of ₹105.84 a litre in Delhi, the prices in Mumbai were ₹111.77 per litre. According to reports, the auto fuel was costing a third more than the rate at which aviation turbine fuel (AFT) is sold to airlines. Meanwhile, the cost of diesel in Mumbai was ₹102.52 a litre and in Delhi, ₹94.57.Owaisi was referring to the standoff between India and China since the Galwan Valley skirmish in June last year. Since then, both the countries have held a series of talks on disengagement in the remaining friction points along the Line of Control (LAC) in Ladakh but the standoff has not ended. Recently, the 13th round of talks took place in the backdrop of two recent incidents of attempted transgressions by the Chinese troops - one in the Barahoti sector of Uttarakhand and another in the Tawang sector in Arunachal Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-never-speaks-on-2-things-owaisi-takes-a-jibe-101634611104335.html

The meeting, described in some quarters as a “new Quad”, also focused on ways to expand economic and political cooperation in the Middle East and Asia and to enhance maritime security.The meeting was joined by external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Israeli foreign minister Yair Lapid from Jerusalem, US secretary of state Antony Blinken from Washington and UAE foreign minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan from Abu Dhabi. Jaishankar is currently on a bilateral visit to Israel.In a tweet, Jaishankar described the discussions as “fruitful” and said the foreign ministers agreed on a speedy follow-up. The Israeli foreign ministry said the four ministers intended hold an in-person meeting at Expo 2020 in Dubai in the coming months.“Discussed working together more closely on economic growth and global issues. Agreed on expeditious follow-up,” Jaishankar said.Blinken tweeted that the meeting had focused on “shared issues of concern in the region and globally, and the importance of expanding our economic and political collaboration”.Lapid, who initiated the process for the meeting during a recent visit to Washington, said at the start of the meeting: “Around this virtual table, there is a unique set of capabilities, knowledge, and experience that can be used to create the network that we all want to see created.”The synergy between the four countries will help them work together on infrastructure, transport, maritime security and other issues, he said.The key to success is moving from a “government-to-government” approach to a “business-to-business” approach and turning the initiative into a “working process that will put boots on the ground, changing infrastructure around the world”, Lapid added.The ministers decided to establish an international forum for economic cooperation, the Israeli foreign ministry said. The ministers also discussed joint infrastructure projects in transportation, technology, maritime security, and economics and trade, as well as additional joint projects, the ministry added.Each country will appoint senior professionals to a joint working group that will formulate options for cooperation.US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement that the foreign ministers “discussed expanding economic and political cooperation in the Middle East and Asia, including through trade, combating climate change, energy cooperation, and increasing maritime security”.They also discussed people-to-people ties in technology and science, and ways to support global public health in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Blinken reiterated the Biden administration’s “support for the Abraham Accords and normalisation agreements and discussed future opportunities for collaboration in the region and globally”, Price said.Price also told a news briefing that the US, the UAE, Israel and India share many interests and the meeting was an opportunity for the ministers to discuss a range of topics, including expanding economic and political cooperation in their respective regions, climate change, energy cooperation, and maritime security.The meeting built on the momentum created by the Abraham Accords of last year, and it was held less than a week after Blinken met Lapid and Sheikh Abdullah in-person in Washington on October 13 to review progress in the normalisation of Israel’s relations with Arab states.This normalisation can be a force for progress between Israel and Arab states and also between Israelis and Palestinians, Blinken said at the time.The three countries also launched two working groups on religious coexistence and building tolerance, and on water and energy. The trilateral partnership made it possible for the countries to discuss urgent regional security issues such as Iran and Syria, Blinken said then.India, Israel and the UAE have already stepped up trilateral cooperation, especially in trade and investment, since the US brokered the Abraham Accords in August 2020.The meeting also dovetailed with India’s efforts to build new plurilateral and multilateral partnerships focused on cooperation in areas ranging from security to connectivity and energy. India has robust defence, security and trade cooperation with Israel and the US, while the UAE is a key energy partner.The UAE is home to more than three million Indians, and security cooperation has been growing rapidly, with the first ever visit by an Indian Army chief taking place last year.India has backed the Abraham Accords process, following which Israel also normalised relations with Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco. The external affairs ministry has said these efforts are in line with India’s support for “peace and stability in West Asia which is our extended neighbourhood”.In May this year, India, Israel and the UAE concluded the first trilateral partnership whereby an Israel-based company will produce a robotic solar cleaning technology in India for a project in the emirates.A statement issued at the time by the Israeli embassy in New Delhi said the Abraham Accords agreement between Israel and the UAE had “paved the way for friendships and business partnerships across the region”. The statement added: “India being a friend of both the UAE and Israel is clearly the preferred partner to leverage the global potential of the UAE, Israel and India trilateral.”Former ambassador Vivek Katju, who closely tracks developments in the region, said it remained to be seen how the initiative by the four countries would be perceived across West Asia. “The real issue is not the agenda of economic cooperation of the four countries but how the purposes of these countries getting together are perceived by the major powers and important regional players. Will they see it as a beginning of India departing radically from its traditional approaches towards West Asia?” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-israel-uae-us-meet-to-expand-cooperation-maritime-security-101634613936348.html

The two structures are the Idukki dam - Asia's biggest arch dam constructed across the Periyar River - and Idamalayar on one of its tributaries in Ernakulam district.Rain-related incidents have claimed 35 lives across Kerala.Also Read | Kerala floods: Another man-made disasterWater minister Roshy Augustine said on Monday that water level in Idukki dam reached 2,396.86 feet at 7am on Monday and there is a possibility it would breach the upper limit of 2,398.86 feet by Tuesday. "In view of the rising water levels of Idukki dam, it has been decided to open two of its shutters by 50 centimeters to let out 100 cubic metre per second of water flow," said the minister."The decision is based on past experience and was meant to allay people's concerns," Augustine added. The Idukki dam is designed to hold 2,403 feet of water.Ernakulam district collector Jafar Malik said yesterday that two shutters of Idamalayar dam will be opened by 80 centimetres each on Tuesday. "Due to this, no significant change in the water level of the Periyar river is expected," he added.The official said that this move has been taken as a precautionary measure in anticipation of heavy rains and floods in the coming days.He further said that the people living near the Periyar river and its tributaries are requested "to be vigilant and follow the instructions of the officials and the people's representatives".The sluice gates of Kakki and Pamba dams in Pathanamthitta district have already been opened.As release of water from Idamalayar and Idukki dams would flow through Aluva, the commercial hub of Ernakulam, state industries minister P Rajeev held a meeting to deal with resulting consequences.After the meeting on Sunday, Rajeev said in a release that steps are being taken to ensure water from these two dams do not flow into the Periyar together.The announcement regarding opening of the dams comes in the wake of the general directions issued by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in a review meeting held to assess the situation with regard to the rainfall and water levels of various dams in the state.Kerala revenue minister K Rajan and state health minister Veena George said at a press conference that red alert has been issued for 10 dams in Kerala.

The meeting with Birla will take place at 11am, Supriyo announced a day ago. “Sincere gratitude to honourable Speaker Sir Om Birla for granting me his time to formally resign as MP. I will not hold on to the berths/perks/salary of an MP now that I am no longer a part of the BJP that I won the seat for.

However, as I have joined the TMC, there is no point in holding on to my seat in Asansol. I have come into politics because of Asansol. I will do for that constituency as much as possible,” he said after joining Bengal's ruling party.On July 7, the two-term and sitting parliamentarian from Asansol was dropped from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Cabinet, where he served as the Minister of state for environment, forest and climate change. Then, on July 31, Supriyo, in a Facebook post, announced his “resignation” from politics, adding that he won't join any other party.

19-10-2021||India||Amid tensions, army chief in Jammu to review security||Army chief Gen MM Naravane travelled to Jammu region on Monday to assess the security situation and operational preparedness of troops against the backdrop of tensions over targeted attacks on civilians and a string of terrorist strikes.Naravane is visiting the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir at a time when nine soldiers have been killed in counterterror operations that began on October 11, the highest casualties suffered by the army within the span of a week in the region in recent years.Two migrant workers were killed and another injured in an attack by terrorists in Kulgam district on Sunday, the latest in a string of targeted attacks.A vendor from Bihar and a carpenter from Uttar Pradesh were shot dead on Saturday evening.The army launched its operations to counter these attacks on civilians, which have resulted in the death of 32 people so far.Five soldiers were killed in a fierce gun-battle during an operation at Chamrer in Surankote forest on Monday. Four more soldiers died in another gunfight at Nar Khas forest in Mendhar area of Poonch on Thursday evening.An army spokesperson said on Twitter: “General MM Naravane #COAS is on a two-day visit to Jammu Region wherein GOC White Knight Corps will give an update on security situation and operational preparedness. #COAS will visit forward areas and interact with troops and commanders on ground.”An army official said on condition of anonymity, “He will seek an update on the ongoing operations in Poonch area and visit forward areas to meet troops and get feedback from commanders.”Jammu and Kashmir Police believe the terrorists have been hiding in jungles since August.Another army officer said drones and a helicopter were being used in search operations in Nar Khas forest.“Para action is on, but there is nothing conclusive so far. Drones and a helicopter are being used in Nar Khas but there is no breakthrough. The search operations are on in both the places—Nar Khas and Chamrer,” said the second Army officer.“We suspect that there could be two groups [of terrorists] and one of them reached Chamrer on the way to Shopian via Pir Ki Gali, where they gunned down five soldiers,” the officer added.“Now, such operations take time because the terrain is difficult. There is thick wild growth in the dense forest of Nar Khas where natural caves are there and visibility is also an issue,” he said.The recent attacks on civilians are believed to be the handiwork of Laskhar-e-Taiba (LeT) fighters infiltrated across the Line of Control (LoC) in Poonch-Rajouri sector, security officials said. They said drones were used to drop Chinese-made pistols to overground workers of LeT and these weapons were used in the targeted killings||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-tensions-army-chief-in-jammu-to-review-security-101634585929361.html
19-10-2021||India||Kerala rain toll rises to 35; IMD sounds yellow alert for 11 districts||As the rains eased up in the worst-hit districts of Kerala, many people were shocked to discover no traces of their houses remained. Even as the death toll increased to 35 on Monday, there might still be stormy weather ahead in the southern state. The India Meteorological Department issued yellow alerts in 11 districts effective Wednesday, a warning for possible severe weather. In Kokkayar, a rescue team retrieved the body of three-year-old Sachu Sahul, while a search continues for two missing persons. In Kottayam, the death toll rose to 15 after 12 people were killed in two different landslides at Kavali and Plapalli, while three were swept away by flood waters. The St Mary’s church in Kavali saw heart-rending scenes as six people from the same family, including three children, were buried on Monday. A video clip of a house being washed away in the floods went viral on social media, and its owner, KP Jebi, a private bus driver, said his 25 years’ of savings vanished within seconds. He and his family members had a miraculous escape minutes before the house was swept away by the flash flood. “I am speechless. I have to start from the scratch,” Jebi said. The floods and landslides left many residents of Mundakayam area in Idukki homeless. Although the downpour subsided on Monday, it is still raining in the catchment areas of many dams, increasing water levels sharply. Authorities issued red alerts in 10 dams. The sluice gates of Kakki and Pamba dams in Pathanamthitta district were opened. The pilgrimage to Sabarimala hill temple was halted due to a rise in water levels in Pamba and other rivers, said state revenue minister K Rajan after a review meeting in Pathanamthitta. After opening the sluice gates of Kakki dam, water level in Pamba River will rise by at least 15cm, and it was not an ideal situation for the pilgrimage, the minister said. Pilgrims, who arrived in Kottayam and Pathanamthitta from neighbouring states, were sent back by the authorities. As dam gates were opened, many areas of Kuttanad and Alapzuha saw heavy waterlogging. Sluice gates of Asia’s biggest arch dam Idukki will be opened at 11 am on Tuesday, water resource minister Roshy Augustinesaid, after water level in the reservoir rose to 2,398 feet on Monday. It is designed to hold 2,403 feet of water. Idukki MP Dean Kuriakose has asked the state government to open a few sluice gates to ease pressure on the dam. Augustine is camping in the district to review the situation. Unlike the 2018 floods, when haphazard opening of dam gates aggravated the situation, the government is cautious this time. “In view of the rising water levels of Idukki dam, it has been decided to open two of its shutters by 50 centimeters to let out 100 cubic metre per second (100 cumecs) of water flow.“The decision has been taken to control the water level of the dam at 2,395-2,396 feet in the wake of a warning from the Central Meteorological Department that there would be heavy rains in the coming days. The decision was also based on past experience and was meant to allay people’s concerns,” the minister said in a state government release.Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday chaired an emergency meeting in the state capital to review the situation. He constituted an expert committee to regulate the release of water from some of the dams filled to bursting. The expert panel includes weather experts, hydrologists, structural engineers and climatologists. “We are closely monitoring the situation,” Vijayan said after the meeting. Kerala might witness widespread rainfall, with isolated heavy downpour for three to four days starting from Wednesday due to a fresh spell of the easterly wave, the weather department predicted. The government has opened more relief camps and advised people not to hurry back to their damaged homes. The state witnessed heavy rainfall on Friday and Saturday, which triggered flash floods and landslides at many places in Kottayam and Idukki districts. Many rain-ravaged areas turned sunny on Monday as affected people slowly pieced their lives together. At least 400 houses have been damaged in two districts, the state revenue department said.The state received 412mm rain in the first 17 days of October, a whopping 84% of the usual 492mm of rain between October to December, according to the regional Met office in Thiruvananthapuram. Some areas like Peerumedu in the Idukki district received 297mm high intensity rainfall in the past two days, it said. Meanwhile, a blame game started on Monday as the death toll rose to 35. Relief operations were delayed and warnings were not conveyed properly, opposition leader V D Satheesan of the Congress party said after visiting areas affected by landslides. “In some of the affected areas, rescue teams reached a day after the mishap,” he said. “Despite strong warnings, how did it happen? We need an answer from the government.”There was no delay on the part of the government, minister Rajan said, dismissing the complaints.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-rain-toll-rises-to-35-imd-sounds-yellow-alert-for-11-districts-101634585558057.html
19-10-2021||India||Army’s surveillance push along LAC amid increase in Chinese patrols in Arunachal sector||RUPA (ARUNACHAL PRADESH) A big surveillance push using latest technology to offset the requirement of deploying extra troops on the contested border with China in Arunachal Pradesh and a massive thrust on building infrastructure to improve connectivity with forward areas for faster mobilisation of soldiers are the top priorities for the Indian Army in the sensitive sector, the commander of a key mountain division in the eastern sector said on Monday.There has been an increase in Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) patrols along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Arunachal Pradesh sector, officials familiar with the development said on the condition of anonymity.“We are employing technology in a big way to boost our awareness of the situation. It allows us to do away with the need to push troops to forward areas in peacetime,” said Major General Zubin A Minwalla, the commander of the Rupa-based HQs 5 Mountain Division. The division’s responsibilities encompass the sensitive Tawang sector. “We are creating more (battlefield) transparency through the use of technology ---the fusion of an array of sensors including ground-based and air-based sensors, a network of radars and unmanned systems. The adversary cannot surprise us,” Minwalla said.His comments came days after the 13th round of military talks between India and China to cool tensions in eastern Ladakh reached an impasse on October 10, with PLA not agreeing to suggestions made by the Indian Army.The military dialogue took place more than two months after the last round of talks that led to disengagement of forward deployed troops from Gogra, or Patrol Point-17A, one of the flashpoints on the LAC, in early August.The use of latest technology at the mountain division’s hi-tech surveillance centre is playing a critical role in tracking the developments and PLA activities along LAC in Arunachal Pradesh and across it, Minwalla said. “We get live feeds of all their activities round the clock --- movement of troops from rear to forward areas, their patrolling patterns along LAC and steps being taken to ramp up infrastructure on the other side,” said an officer at the surveillance centre, asking not to be named. The surveillance centre is tasked with collecting, analysing and disseminating critical information to commanders on the ground.While eastern Ladakh is the focus of the current round of border tensions between India and China, the Indian Army is also keeping a strict vigil on the eastern front. “Our analysis of the situation across LAC in Arunachal Pradesh is pretty accurate. There has been an increase in frequency of PLA patrols owing to the current operational situation. There is also a slight increase in area domination patrols,” said a second officer, asking not to be named. “There is also an increase in visits to forward areas by senior PLA officers,” he added. China is also ramping up infrastructure on its side at a fast pace. The Indian Army is regularly picking up increased vehicular movement across LAC due to improved infrastructure on the Chinese side. There is a tremendous thrust on building infrastructure in Arunachal Pradesh whether it is through the development of border roads or the efforts of the civilian government, Minwalla said. “We have a confident approach in dealing the overall situation in the sector. We are not reacting to what they are doing. We have our own plans and are working on them,” he added.Several new roads, bridges and tunnels are coming up in Arunachal Pradesh to cut down travel time for the army.These projects include the Sela tunnel that forms part of a strategic road project that will reduce travel time to Tawang, a sector where the Indian Army is heavily deployed.The Sela tunnel, announced by the government in the 2018 Budget, is part of the Balipara-Charduar-Tawang road, one of the strategic projects along the Chinese border. The tunnel, which will be operational by August 2022, will cut down travel time to Tawang by at least two hours, improving border connectivity for the army.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/armys-surveillance-push-along-lac-amid-increase-in-chinese-patrols-in-arunachal-sector-101634585556931.html
19-10-2021||India||Andhra man lynched for killing woman who resisted rape: Police||A 60-year-old man was lynched by angry villagers on the suspicion of killing a 42-year-old woman when she resisted his attempt to rape her in Andhra Pradesh’s Prakasam district on Sunday night, the police said. The incident happened at Kamepalli village of Jarugumilli block at around 8.30 pm. The deceased man was identified as Vallepu Obaiah, a quack, who had been treating people for various ailments with country-made medicines, the police said.According to Singarayakonda police inspector M Lakshman, the woman, an agriculture labourer, had been taking treatment from Obaiah for the last few days for her knee joint pains. On Sunday, too, she had gone to his clinic at around 7 pm.“Preliminary investigations revealed that Obaiah, who was in an inebriated condition, attempted to rape the woman. When she resisted his attempts, he tied her limbs with ropes and hacked her to death with an axe,” Lakshman said.Though the neighbours had heard the woman’s cries, they thought it was all part of the treatment being given by the quack. However, an hour later, when a neighbour noticed Obaiah coming out of the house in a disturbed state of mind, she alerted her brother who in turn informed the police.“Immediately, Jarugumilli sub-inspector Razia Sultana went to the village along with a couple of constables and took Obaiah into custody. By then, the agitated villagers, who came to know about the alleged rape attempt and murder of the woman, started beating up Obaiah with sticks and iron rods,” the police inspector said.The villagers even assaulted the cops when they tried to stop them from beating Obaiah. By the time additional police forces from Singarayakonda rushed to the village, following an alert from the sub-inspector, Obaiah was beaten to death by the agitated villagers.Apart from Singarayakonda police, Ongole deputy superintendent of police U Nagaraju, Kandukuru DSP Srinivasul and others also went to the village and brought the situation under control.“We are yet to register the FIR and have not made any arrests so far as the murder of the man involved a large number of people. We have pressed into service dog squads and Clues Team to collect the evidence from the spot,” Lakshman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-man-lynched-for-killing-woman-who-resisted-rapepolice-101634585555260.html
19-10-2021||India||Tamil Nadu ex-health minister booked in ₹27.22 cr disproportionate assets case||A case was filed by the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption wing on Monday against C Vijayabaskar, who was the Health Minister in the previous AIADMK regime, for possession of disproportionate assets to the tune of ₹27.22 crore.The AIADMK condemned the action, saying it was yet another instance of DMK regime’s political vendetta. Vijayabaskar is the fourth former AIADMK Minister to face a case of disproportionate assets.Filing an FIR against him and his spouse as well, the anti-graft sleuths held searches in 48 locations spread across seven districts of Tamil Nadu. The locations include Vijayabaskar’s residence here and premises linked to his relatives and associates. According to the FIR, a verification process revealed that Vijayabaskar accumulated maximum assets, ‘intentionally enriched himself’ during the check period from April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2021. Vijayabaskar’s wife Ramya, by holding properties like an apartment, by making investments in partnership firms, banks, insurance policies, ‘intentionally abetted’ her husband, it said.The former Minister, during the check period, possessed pecuniary resources and properties in his name and in the name of his dependent wife to the tune of ₹27.22 crore, which is disproportionate income, it said. Listing 13 educational institutions in Pudukottai district, established by a trust formed by Vijayabaskar’s family members, the FIR said a ‘reasonable suspicion’ arose that these institutions were established by Vijayabaskar under the guise of this trust using the ‘ill-gotten money.’ A prima facie case is made out and sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act and the IPC is invoked, the FIR said. The searches were held in Chennai, Chengelpet, Kanchipuram, Coimbatore, Tiruchirappalli, Madurai and Pudukottai districts. “Each team in every location comprises at least six personnel in addition to policemen deployed for security purposes,” a vigilance official told PTI. Totally, over 250 personnel are involved in search operations.Asked if any documents or materials have been seized during searches, the official said “the process of consolidation is on in 48 locations.” After the DMK captured power in May 2021, similar case of disproportionate assets have already been filed against K C Veeramani, S P Velumani and M R Vijayabaskar, all former Ministers during the previous AIADMK regime. Searches had been carried out by the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption personnel in premises related to them.AIADMK top leaders O Panneerselvam and K Palaniswami condemned the raids and case, saying it showed political vendetta, an effort to get ‘temporary happiness’.The DMK government could not tolerate the state-wide celebrations of the AIADMK’s golden jubilee celebrations and jubilation among cadres. “The AIADMK is a great organisation, similar to a fathomless ocean,” they said in a statement, adding the party would not be cowed down by the DMK regime’s raids.Though the DMK may spread slander and “whatever may be the cases against as many party office-bearers, we would like to convey that no one will be able to stop the huge victories of the AIADMK in future.” The AIADMK’s legal wing joint secretary R M Babu Murugavel said the case against Vijayabaskar is yet another instance of DMK government’s political vendetta.“The FIR against Vijayabaskar is nothing but mere accusations. We will fight the case legally and win,” he told PTI.Murugavel, a former MLA and party’s legal advisory committee member, said the DMK government could not tolerate the enthusiasm of his party, which is celebrating the golden jubilee of its founding. Objecting searches at Vijayabaskar’s residence, where the former Minister’s wife and elder daughter were being treated for Covid-19, the advocate said it was a gross violation of human rights. Vijayabaskar, who is also the AIADMK’s organisational secretary and Pudukottai north district secretary, was elected from Viralimalai Assembly constituency in the Cauvery delta district for a third time in a row in the Assembly election held in April this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-ex-health-minister-booked-in-27-22-cr-disproportionate-assets-case-101634585553185.html

19-10-2021||India||Search ops continue in Poonch, Rajouri||Security forces on Monday continued combing operations in the forest belt of Jammu & Kashmir’s Poonch and Rajouri border districts where nine soldiers were killed in two separate gunfights with terrorists over the past week.Five Army personnel, including a junior commissioned officer (JCO), were killed in a fierce gunfight during a counter-insurgency operation in Chamrer area of Surankote forest on Monday. Four soldiers, including another JCO, died in another encounter in the Nar Khas forest in the Mendhar area of Poonch on Thursday evening.“Para action is on, but there is nothing conclusive so far. Drones and a helicopter are being used in Nar Khas but there is no breakthrough. The search operations are on in both the places—Nar Khas and Chamrer,” said an Army officer.The Jammu and Kashmir Police have said the terrorists were believed to be hiding in the jungles since August this year. A senior police officer said the terrorists believed to have sneaked in August from Balakote before reaching Nar Khas forests and Chamrer.“We also suspect that there could be two groups and one of them had reached Chamrer in Surankote on way to Shopian via Pir Ki Gali before they gunned down five soldiers on Monday last,” he added.When five soldiers were killed in Chamrer area of Surankote, the terrorists were hiding at vantage positions and had opened fire from two different directions, said people familiar with the develop- ment.“Nothing substantive was shared by intelligence agencies before five of our men were downed on Monday in Chamrer. Now, if these terrorists are there since August, it clearly shows the failure of intelligence agencies and at the same time local support to them cannot be denied,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/search-ops-continue-in-poonch-rajouri-101634584548946.html
19-10-2021||India||‘Terrorists told to kill non-Muslim civilians’||Instructions to kill non-Muslims in Kashmir, including by name, are being passed on to local militants in the Valley, several security officials told HT, even as they grapple to secure the soft targets.“The instructions are clear. Pakistan is directing local militants to specifically target non-Muslims,” one security official said. Another top official confirmed, saying, “Some non-Muslim names were passed on to local militants and we were able to secure them.” Neither official wished to be identified.Violence has spiked dramatically in the Valley over the last few weeks and at least 11 civilians have been killed in the month of October alone. Two non-local labourers from Bihar were killed in South Kashmir on Sunday and another grievously injured.The Valley is currently full of non-locals, especially since it is apple-picking season, and security estimates put their number at 300,000 to 400,000.To be sure, it isn’t only non-locals that are being targeted. It is also locals belonging to minority communities.Earlier in October, ML Bindroo, a well-known Kashmiri Pandit pharmacist was gunned down, as was a Sikh teacher, leading to large-scale insecurity amongst the minority communities. According to security estimates, close to 50,000 Sikhs and Pandits reside in the Valley.“Fears of a demographic change are spurring the targeted killings. The new ‘non-Muslim’ attacks also started after the Union Territory started a portal for Pandits in mid-August, to help then reclaim the property they had left behind. The Centre is perceived as being anti-Muslim,” said another official, who did not want to be identified.The administration has started moving non-Kashmiri labourers to the safety of security camps but the exercise is difficult because they have to step out for work.In a change in strategy, local youth joining the ranks of militants are now not announcing their arrival to the path of violence, so as to not garner attention. The recruitment of locals by terror outfits Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad has not ebbed. According to home ministry officials, at least 87 locals joined the ranks of militants by August-end this year. The figure for 2020, for the same period, was 103.The Jammu and Kashmir Police has detained and arrested several hundred over-ground workers (OGWs), or those who provide logistical support to the terrorists and is hunting down the militants behind the recent spate of attacks. But as one security official, quoted above, said, “The situation is challenging because it is difficult to secure lakhs of non-locals who come in search of a livelihood.”Muslim civilians too have been killed but according to officials, it is only those classified as “informers” and “BJP sympathizers” are being attacked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terrorists-told-to-kill-non-muslim-civilians-101634584125794.html
19-10-2021||India||‘Quashing ’21 tribunal law violates separation of powers’||Any attempt by the Supreme Court to strike down the new law on administration of tribunals will violate the constitutionally mandated separation of powers between different organs of the State, the Union government has cautioned the top court, which is examining a clutch of petitions against the validity of the 2021 Tribunal Reforms Act.Asserting its authority to enact laws and policies, the Centre has also registered its strong objection against invocation of the principles of independence of judiciary by the Supreme Court to annul laws and rules which, it said, are otherwise valid. “The Government of India is distressed by the fact that both laws and statutory rules made by parliament and executive in areas of pure policy are being held to be void by invoking independence of judiciary when such laws and rules do not violate fundamental rights or any provision of the Constitution, and is wholly within competency,” stated the affidavit filed by the Centre through the department of revenue.“The government equally believes that the court striking down these pure matters of policy violates the separation of powers by the judicial wind of the state,” maintained the affidavit, emphasising that the Union government is ready to place before the court judicial precedents declaring the exclusive right of parliament and executive to frame policies and execute them.The response from the central government has come following strictures passed by a bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, in September for bringing back the very same provisions for administration of tribunals in the 2021 law that were struck down by the court in July.The bench observed that it is “very upset” by the government, which, it added, is “bent upon not honouring” the orders of the court and has rather sought to overrule a judgment by enacting a “replica” of the old law.A bunch of petitions, filed by Madras Bar Association, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh and others, have requested the top court to quash the new law, which was passed by both the houses in the monsoon session of parliament. The petitions argue that the Centre has re-enacted the same provisions relating to tenure and some other service conditions that were struck down in July on the ground of tinkering with independence of judiciary and violating basic structure of the Constitution.The government, however, maintained that basic structure in the Constitution can only be used to test the validity of a Constitutional amendment but has no relevance when it comes to validity of a statute.About tenure and other service conditions, it pointed out that they are all issues of policy and if the parliament is denied the right to make laws relating to policy by invoking the principle of independence of judiciary, “a vital concomitant of legislative power would be lost to parliament, violating the constitutional separation of powers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quashing-21-tribunal-law-violates-separation-of-powers-101634583704323.html

However, several ASEAN member countries, including Vietnam, the Philippines and Brunei, have counterclaims.According to the defence ministry, Singh stated that India supports consensus based principles and a peaceful, open, rule based and stable world order as a responsible maritime stakeholder.He said that only those countries whose navies are strong have been successful in gaining dominance across the world and “I am happy to say that our Navy is playing an important role in our maritime and national security”.The statement said that Singh expressed happiness that in the last five financial years, more than two-thirds of the Navy’s modernisation budget has been spent on indigenous procurement.It is a matter of great pride to know that out of 41 ships and submarines ordered by the Indian Navy, 39 are from Indian shipyards. This is a testament to the Navy’s commitment to ‘Aatma Nirbhar Bharat’, he said.The three-day long conference, which began on Monday, will focus on addressing the contemporary security paradigms while seeking ways to enhance the capabilities of the Indian Navy, the ministry stated.Chief of Defence Staff Bipin Rawat, Army Chief General M M Naravane and Air Chief Marshal V R Chaudhari will also interact with the naval commanders during this conference to address convergence of the three Services, the ministry mentioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-maintain-peace-stability-in-maritime-zone-to-boost-trade-rajnath-singh-101634583516234.html
19-10-2021||India||Indian Army wins gold medal at Cambrian Patrol Exercise in UK||The Indian Army won a gold medal at the Cambrian Patrol Exercise held in the UK while competing against 96 teams representing special forces and regiments from around the world. The 4/5 Gorkha Rifles (Frontier Force) represented the Indian Army at the drill held at Brecon, Wales, during October 13-15. The event is considered the ultimate test of human endurance and team spirit and is considered the “Olympics of military patrolling”. The Indian Army team performed well in harsh terrain and inclement weather. These conditions added to the challenges of simulated situations to assess the reaction of the teams in a combat setting. The Indian Army team was lauded on its navigation skills, delivery of patrol orders and overall endurance for completing the patrol, said a statement from the Indian high commission in London. This year, only three international patrols out of the 96 participating teams were awarded a gold medal. The award ceremony was attended by Gen Mark Carleton-Smith, the chief of general staff of the British Army, who presented the gold medal to the Indian Army team. Brig Vikramjit Singh Gill, military advisor at the Indian high commission, also attended the event. The Indian high commissioner, Gaitri Issar Kumar, felicitated the Indian Army team at India House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-army-wins-gold-medal-at-cambrian-patrol-exercise-in-uk-101634583393543.html
19-10-2021||India||Kolkata company executive, driver found murdered||A senior corporate executive and his driver were found murdered inside the former’s three-storey ancestral house at Kankulia road in Gariahat police station area of south Kolkata on Monday morning, police said. The bodies of 61-year-old Subir Chaki, managing director of Kilburn Engineering Ltd, and his 64-year-old driver, Rabin Mondal, were found with multiple injuries on the first and second floor of the house, respectively. According to police, local residents of Kankulia road said that Chaki, who lived in New Town on the eastern outskirts of the city, was trying to sell his ancestral house for quite some time. The businessman already owned another property at a posh south Kolkata condominium, they added. Police suspect Chaki must have gone to his ancestral house to meet a prospective buyer or collect an advance payment over a deal with a buyer when the incident took place on Sunday evening.“Nobody lived on the upper floors of the house. There was nothing valuable kept that might have led to a robbery. The ground floor was rented out to a private company. Its office was closed on Sunday. When the employees reported for duty on Monday morning, they found the door connecting the ground and first floors shut from inside which was unusual,” an officer from Gariahat police station said on condition of anonymity. “Both were stabbed multiple times, including on the wrists and ankles. The blows somehow appeared to be random, not something a trained killer might have inflicted. Their mobile phones were also missing. The service providers have been asked to generate the call lists. Chaki’s bank accounts are also being checked,” a second officer who did not wish to be named said. “It seems that the accused knew that Chaki was coming to his Kankulia road home. On earlier occasions, he would send his driver with the keys when prospective buyers wanted to see the property. It is possible that Chaki might have come to collect some payment in cash. Local residents said they heard several people talking inside the house on Sunday evening. They also claimed to have heard a woman’s voice. These claims are being verified,” the officer added. The businessman’s car was found outside the building with several food packets in the back seat. An alumnus of St Xavier’s School in Kolkata, IIT-Kharagpur and IIM-Calcutta, Chaki worked with several top firms. “His son and daughter live in London and Mumbai, respectively,” the second officer cited above said. Dilip Mondal, the son of the driver, said: “My father worked for Chaki for more than 20 years. He used to come home only once a month. My father was treated well by his employer. We have no idea what happened.” Chaki used to live in the New Town apartment with his wife, mother and mother-in-law. The bodies were sent for post-mortem and later handed over to the families while a team of forensic experts collected samples from the scene of crime. A murder case was registered by Gariahat police but the investigation was taken over by the detective department of Kolkata Police on Monday afternoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kolkata-company-executive-driver-found-murdered-101634583332963.html
19-10-2021||India||Amit Shah directs officials to tackle situation firmly||New Delhi: The targeting of minorities and outsiders in the Kashmir Valley came up during the National Security Strategy Conference (NSSC) meeting chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday. During the meeting, attended by police chiefs of all the states and UTs as well as director generals of central paramilitary forces and intelligence agencies, Shah asked the security officials to deal with the flare-up of targeted violence in Jammu & Kashmir with a fort hand, an official familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. A multi-agency pan-India effort has begun to completely neutralize Pakistan backed terror networks involved in the targeted killings of minorities and non-local labourers in Jammu and Kashmir, other people familiar with the mater added. Thus far 11 civilians, including five labourers have been killed by terrorists in the valley this month. As part of the coordinated crackdown, central agencies including the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), Intelligence Bureau (IB), and the anti-terror and intelligence units of states will continuously share inputs about outfits such as The Resistance Front (TRF) and Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP), while police forces will track and arrest sleeper cell members, overground workers and financiers of terror groups operating from Kashmir and other parts of the country, the people added. TRF is believed to be front for the Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is already probing a larger conspiracy in the targeted killings and has arrested nine persons and raided over two dozen places linked with TRF. Its investigations reveal that the targeted killings are part of a well-hatched conspiracy from across the border to create an atmosphere of fear in valley and derail the government’s efforts to increase industrial activities there, a senior counter-terrorism official said on condition of anonymity. “Pakistan based handlers of proscribed terror outfit LeT and their associates based in J&K had conspired to cause extensive terror activities for harming general public. They had planned that responsibility for the terrorist acts so committed would be taken by the pseudo-acronym TRF so as to maintain plausible deniability and evade law enforcement agencies,” NIA said last week in a statement. During Monday’s meeting, Shah, who has been closely monitoring the situation in J&K , and the police and security officials also discussed strategies to deal with terrorism, left wing extremism, cyber-terrorism, narco-terrorism, the radicalization of young people and the general law and order issues in various states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-directs-officials-to-tackle-situation-firmly-101634583215116.html
19-10-2021||India||Chhattisgarh minister TS Singh Deo returns to Delhi amid power tussle with CM Baghel||Raipur: Conversations between Chhattisgarh’s top leaders and the party’s central leaders have started again amid reports of a power-sharing formula between Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel and his cabinet colleague health minister TS Singh Deo, with the latter looking for clarity going forward, according to people familiar with the matter. While Baghel met senior leaders separately on Friday, Singh Deo has been in and out of the Capital for the past three days.Last Friday, on the sidelines of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting in Delhi, chief minister Baghel separately met with senior party leaders, including general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. Functionaries close to Baghel, however, denied that the meeting had anything to do with a possible change in guard. “Nothing about the power-sharing formula was discussed in the meeting on Saturday evening, nor was there any hint about it. The discussion was about the strategy of upcoming elections in Uttar Pradesh,” the functionary said. On Saturday, Singh Deo flew down to Delhi for a meeting with leaders in Delhi. Speaking to reporters at Raipur airport before leaving, Singh Deo characterised the visit as routine but said that he would call on the senior leadership. “It is a routine visit to Delhi... If I get time with senior Congress leaders of Delhi, I will definitely meet them...I called up Punia ji ( PL Punia ) but he said that he is outside Delhi… I will be there for two days and try to meet the leaders,” he said. On Sunday, Singh Deo returned to Chhattisgarh after the death of four infants at the government medical college in Ambikapur, which is his constituency. “Singh Deo has cancelled all scheduled programmes... In view of the seriousness of the issue, the health minister has directed to send a special team of health departments from Raipur and Bilaspur to Ambikapur,” a statement issued by his office on Sunday said. The health minister, however, was back in Delhi on Monday, with meetings possible over the next few days. “I believe that Singh Deo is trying to meet the party high command in Delhi and will definitely talk about the power-sharing formula. Some political development is expected in the next couple of days,” said a senior Congress leader from Chhattisgarh who asked not to be named. On August 28, even as over 45 MLAs camped in Delhi, Baghel held a marathon meeting with the top brass including Rahul Gandhi, where Baghel seemed to have bought himself time, announcing that Gandhi would soon travel to Bastar on his invitation as chief minister. The next day, when Singh Deo returned, he said that he had spoken to the leadership too and they had kept a “decision safe”. Since then, the matter has simmered both in Chhattisgarh and in Delhi, bookmarked by multiple MLAs arriving in Delhi at the start of October, and a war of words in Bilaspur, where supporters of Singh Deo alleged that they were being proceeded against by the police with bias. People close to Singh Deo said that he has not put a timeline on returning for Chhattisgarh at this moment, and the attempt is to reach a sense of clarity for all sides, particularly with the reported two-and-a-half year deadline now long gone, and assembly elections in just over two years. “Every week, rumours are rife about the power-sharing formula in Chhattisgarh… Everyone in the state is in confusion… It would be positive for Congress high command to send a concrete message and resolve this issue as soon as possible,” said Sudeip Shrivastava, a political commentator based in Chhattisgarh. In December 2018, in the aftermath of a dominant Congress performance where the party won 68 of 90 seats, even as the party’s Delhi leadership sought to put out leadership fires in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh emerged as a problem too. Four state leaders, Baghel, home minister Tamradhwaj Sahu, speaker Charan Das Mahant, and Singh Deo flew to Delhi, all eyeing the chief minister’s post. As Mahant settled for speaker, friction between Baghel and Singh Deo meant that Sahu first emerged as the front-runner; but pushed by the idea that a third leader would take the top position, Baghel and Singh Deo, along with Punia and Rahul Gandhi, reportedly arrived at a power-sharing arrangement over the next five years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-minister-ts-singh-deo-returns-to-delhi-amid-power-tussle-with-cm-baghel-101634583093057.html
19-10-2021||India||India boosts vigil along LAC||A big surveillance push using latest technology to offset the requirement of deploying extra troops on the contested border with China in Arunachal Pradesh and a massive thrust on building infrastructure to improve connectivity with forward areas for faster mobilisation of soldiers are the top priorities for the Indian Army in the sensitive sector, the commander of a key mountain division in the eastern sector said on Monday.There has been an increase in Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) patrols along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Arunachal Pradesh sector, officials familiar with the development said on the condition of anonymity.“We are employing technology in a big way to boost our awareness of the situation. It allows us to do away with the need to push troops to forward areas in peacetime,” said Major General Zubin A Minwalla, the commander of the Rupa-based HQs 5 Mountain Division.The division’s responsibilities encompass the sensitive Tawang sector. “We are creating more (battlefield) transparency through the use of technology ---the fusion of an array of sensors including ground-based and air-based sensors, a network of radars and unmanned systems. The adversary cannot surprise us,” Minwalla said.His comments came days after the 13th round of military talks between India and China to cool tensions in eastern Ladakh reached an impasse on October 10, with PLA not agreeing to suggestions made by the Indian Army.The military dialogue took place more than two months after the last round of talks that led to disengagement of forward deployed troops from Gogra, or Patrol Point-17A, one of the flashpoints on the LAC, in early August.The use of latest technology at the mountain division’s hi-tech surveillance centre is playing a critical role in tracking the developments and PLA activities along LAC in Arunachal Pradesh and across it, Minwalla said.“We get live feeds of all their activities round the clock — movement of troops from rear to forward areas, their patrolling patterns along LAC and steps being taken to ramp up infrastructure on the other side,” said an officer at the surveillance centre, asking not to be named. The surveillance centre is tasked with collecting, analysing and disseminating critical information to commanders on the ground.While eastern Ladakh is the focus of the current round of border tensions between India and China, the Indian Army is also keeping a strict vigil on the eastern front.“Our analysis of the situation across LAC in Arunachal Pradesh is pretty accurate. There has been an increase in frequency of PLA patrols owing to the current operational situation. There is also a slight increase in area domination patrols,” said a second officer, asking not to be named.“There is also an increase in visits to forward areas by senior PLA officers,” he added.China is also ramping up infrastructure on its side at a fast pace. The Indian Army is regularly picking up increased vehicular movement across LAC due to improved infrastructure on the Chinese side.There is a tremendous thrust on building infrastructure in Arunachal Pradesh whether it is through the development of border roads or the efforts of the civilian government, Minwalla said. “We have a confident approach in dealing the overall situation in the sector. We are not reacting to what they are doing. We have our own plans and are working on them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-boosts-vigil-along-lac-101634582756234.html
19-10-2021||India||CBSE exams to begin on Nov 30||The Central Board of Secondary Education on Monday announced that the term 1 exams for major subjects for Class 10 students will be conducted between November 30 and December 11; and December 1 and December 22 for Class 12.The examinations for term 2 will be conducted in March-April, the board said.Earlier this year, the board announced that the examinations would be conducted in two terms to avoid an unprecedented situation arising out of the Covid-19 pandemic — theory examinations this year were scrapped after the second wave of Covid-19 took hold.“Duration of each paper of major subject will be 90 minutes. Reading time will be 20 minutes instead of 15 minutes. Keeping in view the winter season, exam will start at 11.30am instead of 10.30am,” controller of examinations Sanyam Bhardwaj said in the official notice. The examinations will have objective-type questions.Examinations for minor subjects will start on November 17 for students of Class 10 and November 16 for Class 12, the board announced.There are nine major subjects for Class 10 and 19 for Class 12. These include core subjects like mathematics, physics, chemistry, English and economics, among others.“We have issued the datesheets of all major subjects of class 10 and 12. Now, the datesheet for minor subjects will be sent to schools because these exams would be conducted by the schools though the question papers will be provided by CBSE. But all these minor subjects are not offered by all schools therefore we will be sending datesheets to these schools,” Bhardwaj said. There are over 2,100 schools in Delhi that are affiliated with CBSE.Bhardwaj said that schools will be sanitised before examinations and the board will ensure students do not have to travel for long distances to write their exams.“I feel a large number of schools would be fixed as self-centres keeping in view the distance and comfort of students. CBSE would be putting efforts in terms of examination centres and observes so that examinations are conducted safely and in a fair manner,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbse-exams-to-begin-on-nov-30-101634582792234.html
19-10-2021||India||Target of Net zero emission against climate justice: LMDC||The Like-Minded Developing Countries — a group of developing countries which have a similar stand in the United Nations climate negotiations — have said that a net zero goal for all countries by mid-century is “anti-equity” and against “climate justice”.In a strongly worded statement, the countries said, “Despite their lack of ambition shown in the pre-2020 period, as well as in their Paris Agreement NDCs (nationally determined contributions) major developed countries are now pushing to shift the goal posts of the Paris Agreement from what have already been agreed by calling for all countries to adopt net zero emissions targets by 2050.” Net zero emissions for all countries by 2050 will exacerbate existing inequities between developed and developing countries, the statement added.The Paris Agreement refers to achieving a balance between emissions and removal by sinks in the second half of this century as a global aspiration rather than as national targets for all countries. “Achieving this global aspiration is on the basis of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities, in the context of ensuring sustainable development and poverty eradication in developing countries and taking into consideration equity,” the statement endorsed by all LMDC ministers said.During their own industrialisation phase, the developed countries have overused their domestic carbon space and used those of developing countries as well, the countries said.“Developed countries should, in acknowledgement of such historical cumulative and per capita cumulative carbon emissions, leave the remaining atmospheric space for the developmental rights of the developing world and aim for their full decarbonisation within this decade. If they continue to emit and occupy more atmospheric space for the next 30 years, the Paris Agreement’s global goals and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change’s objective will not be met,” the statement concluded.In 2012 in Doha, developed countries agreed to revisit their emission reduction targets by the end of 2014 and to raise their ambition level. Developed countries have, in fact, increased their emissions between 1990 and 2020, the statement highlighted.On the issue of delivery of climate finance, developed countries agreed in 2010 to mobilise $100 billion per year by 2020. “Regrettably, here too they have fallen short of their agreement. In Paris, the 2020 timeline to deliver on the USD100 billion was shifted to 2025, with no assurance that it would be reached or with higher ambition, while at the same time developing countries are requested to raise their ambition on climate actions. These failures to deliver on the commitments agreed to by developed countries undermines trust and confidence in the multilateral system,” the statement said.Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav, who represented India at the LMDC ministerial meeting chaired by Bolivia on Monday, said the world needs rapid and transformative actions.“I stated that delayed climate action and lack of leadership from developed countries has increased the cost of mitigation and adaptation in developing countries… LMDC countries should closely work together to protect their interests and ensure that global efforts for net-zero should be guided by the principles of the UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement, and also by national circumstances and priorities,” Yadav tweeted after his address. LMDC countries include Algeria, Bangladesh, Bolivia, China, Cuba, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mali, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Sri Lanka, among others.“2050 as a global goal for net zero is too little, too late. It buys wealthy countries time to continue to emit more, while resource-poor countries face the consequences in the short and medium term. Delayed mitigation also presents the risk of uncontrollable warming later this century. So, from both a scientific view, as well as the perspective of historical cumulative emissions, developed nations must bring emissions to zero or as close as possible, within this decade,” said Avantika Goswami of the climate change programme at the Centre for Science and Environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/target-of-net-zero-emission-against-climate-justice-lmdc-101634582732401.html
19-10-2021||India||Security huddle on J&K, migrants begin to leave||The Jammu & Kashmir administration moved thousands of non-local workers to “safer areas” overnight and through the day, while hundreds others left the Valley after a string of targeted attacks on minorities and civilians, including those from outside the Union Territory, officials said on Monday.Terrorists have killed 11 civilians, including five labourers from outside Kashmir, this month, and multiple gunfights have broken out during operations by security forces to find those responsible for the attacks. The wave of violence prompted deliberations at a security huddle in New Delhi, where Union home minister Amit Shah directed top officials to deal with the flare-up on priority as a multi-agency pan-Indian effort was underway to neutralise Pakistan-linked threats in the region.On Monday, inside Srinagar’s main railway station in Nowgam, dozens of people, mostly workers from other states, could be seen anxiously waiting for a train that would take them to Banihal in the Jammu division. One of those waiting was Jitendra (who gave only one name). Jitendra, from Bihar, made a living by selling ice cream from a cart in Habba Kadal in Srinagar’s old city, but following the targeted killings, he decided to leave. He left his rented accommodation early in the morning along with six other men to catch the train to Banihal, the first leg of their journey out of the UT.Cabs, buses, trains, workers from outside the UT jumped onto whatever mode of transport was available on Monday, after another targeted attack on some workers at Wanpoh in Kulgam district on Sunday night that left two dead and another grievously injured.Many spent the night in camps set up by security forces or in police stations.The targeting of minorities and outsiders in the Kashmir valley came up during the National Security Strategy Conference (NSSC) meeting chaired by the Union home minister on Monday. During the meeting, attended by police chiefs of all the states and UTs as well as directors general of central paramilitary forces and intelligence agencies, Shah asked the security officials to deal with the targeted violence in Jammu & Kashmir with a firm hand, an official familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.“We moved thousands of workers to secure places and are facilitating their return home,” a senior police official told Reuters, asking not to be named. A government spokesperson in Srinagar declined to comment on the movement of migrant workers.Many workers, however, also chose to stay back, a matter of livelihoods mattering more than lives. Handlers from across the border have orchestrated targeted attacks on civilians, either from minority communities such as the Pandits or the Sikhs, or outsiders, in an effort to disrupt the peace, and play on the UT’s Muslim majority’s fear of a demographic re-engineering, and to force an exodus out of the Valley.Zahir ul Islam, from Malda district in West Bengal, said they received a call from the police last night and were asked to reached the police station in Ganderbal: “We were 20 people staying in four rooms at Ganderbal; after noting down our details, we all were taken to the nearby camp at Dignibal where more than 500 non-local workers were already assembled.”He added: “Only few hundred people were given food, rest remained hungry. In the afternoon, we were allowed to go. The police officers asked us whether we wanted to go home and many of us declined.”At Sopore, non-local workers were called to the local police station late on Sunday and then kept in a school building on the national highway and in a college hostel.“When we reached police station, we were taken to a school building close to the army and police camps. Some of our colleagues left for homes early by taking cabs. We are still in the school building,” said Dalip Paswan, a labourer from Bihar. “I will stay here for some more days and will leave by mid-November.”Most of those leaving said they hoped to be back.“I did not want to go back before January, but attacks on non-locals have left all of us scared. I have been coming to this place for the past two decades, but we are worried. If things improve, I will be back but only after winter,” said Darmendra from Bihar.He added that everything was fine till the killings started. Officials were tight-lipped about the departures. This is not the first time that migrant workers have found themselves in the crosshairs of terrorists. In October 2019, soon after the imposition of governor’s rule in Jammu and Kashmir, six migrant workers were killed in South Kashmir, in a single attack at Katersoo Kulgam, while another worker from Bihar was killed in Kulgam in September. After each attack, some migrant workers left the Valley fearing for their lives, only to return the following season. Workers are hard to find in a UT where many of the locals avoid manual labour.The Jammu & Kashmir labour department says approximately 140,000 migrant workers come to Jammu and Kashmir each year, and most return once winter sets in, only to return next year. Others say the number is easily three times that.The migrant workers mostly hail from Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab and work at construction sites, paddy fields, and apple orchards. Some small roadside kiosks and many are engaged as barbers, masons, jewellers or work in residents’ homes.As part of the coordinated crackdown, central agencies including the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), Intelligence Bureau (IB), and the anti-terror and intelligence units of states will continuously share inputs about outfits such as The Resistance Front (TRF) and Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP), while police forces will track and arrest sleeper cell members, overground workers and financiers of terror groups operating from Kashmir and other parts of the country, the people added. TRF is believed to be front for the Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is already probing a larger conspiracy in the targeted killings and has arrested nine persons and raided over two dozen places linked with TRF. Its investigations reveal that the targeted killings are part of a well-hatched conspiracy from across the border to create an atmosphere of fear in the Valley and derail the government’s efforts to increase industrial activities there, a senior counter-terrorism official said on the condition of anonymity. “Pakistan based handlers of proscribed terror outfit LeT and their associates based in J&K had conspired to cause extensive terror activities for harming general public. They had planned that responsibility for the terrorist acts so committed would be taken by the pseudo-acronym TRF so as to maintain plausible deniability and evade law enforcement agencies,” NIA said last week in a statement. During Monday’s meeting, Shah, who has been closely monitoring the situation in J&K, and the police and security officials also discussed strategies to deal with terrorism, left wing extremism, cyber-terrorism, narco-terrorism, the radicalisation of young people and the general law and order issues in various states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/security-huddle-on-j-k-migrants-begin-to-leave-101634582672220.html
19-10-2021||India||Glasgow climate summit likely to adopt India’s plan of global solar grid||The Glasgow climate change conference (COP 26) will likely adopt an ambitious plan to build a global solar grid that was put forth by India. The plan is called One Sun One World One Grid (Osowog), and it envisages building a global solar grid that will facilitate the transfer of solar power from one part of the world to another. The International Solar Alliance or ISA is the body in charge of implementing this initiative.“The government asked ISA to carry out a study on the viability of the initiative. We hope to share a declaration (on Osowog) that can be adopted at COP 26,” said Ajay Mathur, director general, ISA. TERI, and French energy firms AETS, and EDS are also working on the plan.Osowog is one of the main issues that will be discussed at the ongoing fourth general assembly of ISA. The others are a $1 trillion investment road map for solar energy generation capacity, and a blended financial risk mitigation mechanism.The UK and the government of India will also jointly launch a global ‘Green Grids Initiative – One Sun One World One Grid’ (GGIOSOWOG) at COP 26 focused on global technical, financial and research cooperation to help facilitate cross-border renewable energy transfer projects, ISA said.The concept of a single global grid for solar energy was first suggested by India at the first assembly of the ISA in 2018. It involves building and scaling interregional energy grids to share solar energy across the globe, leveraging the differences of time zones, seasons, resources, and prices between countries and regions.“We are assessing the readiness for Osowog which would mean connecting regional grids. The sun never goes down; when one side of the planet is dark there is light on the other side. For example, East Asia gets the first light of sun and it is also where the sun sets first but India still gets sunlight when its sunset in East Asia so electricity can flow from India (to East Asia) during those hours. Similarly, west Asia and Africa can supply electricity to India when it’s dark here. The concept offers an opportunity to use solar energy 24 hours a day. ISA is studying the viability of the concept through the World Bank and Électricité de France. They have already found that under certain circumstances this transfer can be economically viable,”explained Mathur at the assembly.“With India’s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, the World Bank and the ISA signing a tripartite agreement on Osowog, the initiative could be the world’s most important renewables catalyst,” an ISA statement added.US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, John Kerry and the European Commission Executive Vice President for the European Green Deal, Frans Timmermans will be addressing ISA assembly on Wednesday.“With the rising share of renewable electricity, balancing demand and supply will become critical. Just as Norway acts as a giant “battery” for Europe, so can such an interconnected grid enable India and Asia to effectively use renewable power. Some studies have estimated that at more than 70-80% of renewable energy, the cost of grid integration can grow exponentially. So, building such a grid shows foresight in preparing for the low carbon energy transition,” said Ulka Kelkar, Director, Climate Program, World Resources Institute India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/glasgow-climate-summit-likely-to-adopt-india-s-plan-of-global-solar-grid-101634582619421.html
19-10-2021||India||Heavy October rain chokes Monday traffic in the Capital||Heavy rain on Monday, which made this the wettest October in Delhi since 1960, threw life out of gear in the national capital, leading to widespread waterlogging and traffic snarls with the traffic police advising commuters against taking some key arterial roads that remained jammed through the morning peak hours.The mismanagement by civic and government agencies was compounded with heavier than usual traffic on the roads as people returned to work on Monday after a long weekend due to the Dussehra break.Delhi continued its trend of breaking weather records for the 15th month in a row, as heavy rain in the National Capital Region surpassed the figure for 24-hour data in October from 1956.This year, 94.6mm of rainfall has already been recorded in the city in October. According to data shared by the India Meteorological Department, the months of October in 1910 recorded 185.9mm rainfall, 238.2mm rainfall in 1954, 236.2mm rainfall in 1956, and 93.4mm rainfall in 1960. In 2004, 89mm rainfall was recorded in all of October.On Sunday, the national capital recorded 87.9mm rainfall, the fourth highest in a day ever in October and the highest since 1956 when the city received 111mm rain, according to IMD data.As rush hour began, arterial stretches were jammed as waist-deep waters disabled several vehicles. Crucial spots in and around Minto Road, ITO, Dhaula Kuan and Moolchand were among those badly hit, as were high-profile Lutyens enclaves such as Chanakyapuri, Shanti Path and Connaught Place.Major roads were intermittently closed for movement after overnight rainfall, which continued for most of Monday. While the Pul Prahladpur underpass at the Mehrauli-Badarpur Road was barricaded for traffic again as it was flooded, long traffic jams were reported in areas including Lajpat Nagar, Ashram intersection, Moti Bagh, Sri Aurobindo Marg, Hauz Khas, Dwarka Link Road and Noida Link Road.Experts said that Delhi needs to have a traffic management plan to avert a traffic mess every time there is heavy rain. “We need a plan on two levels; one is that we need to fix our drainage systems to accommodate the current population load of the city and the second is to have a dedicated traffic management plan for rainy days. For every arterial stretch that routinely gets choked because of water logging, agencies need to come up with multiple alternative routes where traffic can be diverted. This information can be communicated to commuters via the variable messaging sign boards or through traffic police’s social media handles,” said professor Sewa Ram from the School of Planning and Architecture.An official said that the worst affected stretch was the Ring Road, where traffic crawled through for several hours at a stretch. Under-construction projects, coupled with torrential rainfall and waterlogging led to commuters getting delayed by several hours, the official said.“We had deployed maximum staff on the roads to direct traffic but there is only so much we can do during such intense and widespread rainfall. The roads are drowned in rainwater, two-wheeler riders also tend to seek refuge below flyovers, which also tends to block a portion of the road and visibility is also an issue because of which traffic movement slows down,” a senior traffic police official said, asking not to be named.Every month since August 2020, Delhi has broken at least one weather record, IMD data shows. Met officials and scientists said that while these extreme weather recordings are the immediate result of temporary atmospheric events over (and in and around) the national capital, the larger role of the climate crisis in the overall shifting of weather patterns is evident.Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change) at Skymet Weather Services, a private weather forecasting agency, said that a low-pressure area formed over the Bay of Bengal extended its impact till southwest Uttar Pradesh.“Because of this, moderate easterly winds started blowing over the northern plains, up to Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. A deep trough was also extending from Punjab to Arabian Sea across Rajasthan and Gujarat, which also brought moisture into the region. The convergence of these two humid winds, along with a western disturbance over north Pakistan combined to form such a weather condition that led to such intense and widespread rain in the entire northwest region,” Palawat said.The city has around 150 pain points that get flooded every time it rains. On Monday, traffic officials placed diversion at several of these spots as waterlogging made them impossible to cross. Officials of the Delhi government declined a comment.East Delhi mayor Shyam Sunder Aggarwal said that the reason behind waterlogging is the bigger drains managed by PWD and flood control department not being cleared. “Corporation’s smaller drains have outfall in the bigger drains. When the larger drains are not cleared the water outflow can not be managed. Majority of waterlogging has been seen on roads bigger than 60ft,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-october-rain-chokes-monday-traffic-in-the-capital-101634582552314.html
19-10-2021||India||India is key to a safe and secure Afghanistan: Italy||G20 president Italy believes India has a key role as an important regional actor in ensuring a stable and secure environment in Afghanistan, and both countries are of the view that the Afghan people need immediate and unhindered access to humanitarian aid. While any action in tackling the humanitarian crisis and preventing an economic collapse in Afghanistan will require interacting with the Taliban, such contacts wouldn’t be tantamount to recognition of the group, Italian ambassador Vincenzo de Luca said in an interview. Speaking on the outcomes of the extraordinary meeting of G20 leaders on Afghanistan convened by Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi on October 12, de Luca said his country decided to act because of a “sense of urgency with respect to a possible humanitarian catastrophe” in the war-torn country. “Being an important regional actor, India’s involvement in consultation and coordination activities is key to ensure a stable and secure environment and effective initiatives aimed at the humanitarian assistance to Afghan people,” he said. “Italy and India share the view that Afghanistan needs immediate and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance. To this end, the continued presence of the United Nations (UN) in Afghanistan must be preserved.” Italy will contribute through a “consistent national financial pledge” and also back initiatives by the European Union (EU), which announced a one billion euro support package for Afghanistan at the October 12 meeting. Asked about G20 leaders making it clear that they will not recognise the Taliban and the opposition to unfreezing Afghanistan’s foreign assets, de Luca said, “Any action in tackling the current situation in Afghanistan would require interacting with the Taliban. If we want to respond to the humanitarian crisis effectively and to prevent the economic collapse of the country, there is no alternative to having contacts with the Taliban. This, however, will not entail their recognition.” Afghanistan has also been hit by a “crisis of the payment system and risks the collapse of its banking system”, and this must be “urgently addressed because if money doesn’t flow and payments cannot be done, the entire economy of the country might crumble, making any sort of assistance nearly impossible”, he added. The ambassador pointed to the UN’s central role in ensuring the effective distribution of aid, and said the world body has received a broad mandate to coordinate all relief efforts directed at the Afghan people. The G20 leaders’ meeting expressed support for the UN to carry out this mandate to “make sure that aid is delivered in an efficient and non-discriminatory way”. On the issue of the Taliban delivering on counter-terrorism commitments, de Luca pointed to the UN Security Council resolution 2593, which was adopted on August 30 while India held the rotating presidency of the body, and said the document contained a “strong expectation that the Afghan territory is not used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or to finance terrorist acts”. “There is a common understanding on the importance of combating terrorism in Afghanistan and on the fact that security, including counter-terrorism, and development are intertwined,” he said. “At the G20 leaders’ meeting it was clearly reiterated that Afghanistan must not become a safe haven for terrorists and a threat for international security.” During the G20 leaders’ meeting, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for a unified response by the world community to ensure desired change in the situation in Afghanistan. However, the Chinese and Russian presidents skipped the meeting; the two countries were represented by their foreign ministers. Asked if the absence of the top leaders of China and Russia at the summit suggested there were divisions on the approach to Afghanistan, de Luca sought to play down the matter and said all G20 members were involved in the preparatory process for the leaders’ meeting and both China and Russia actively contributed to the virtual G20 foreign ministers’ meeting on Afghanistan on September 22. The G20 leaders’ meeting led to “consensus on some lines of action”, he said. This included the G20 playing an “advocacy role” within the world community to fully support UN activities, the G20 calling on “Afghan authorities to ensure the safety, security, and freedom of movement of all UN and associated personnel”, and the G20 states calling on the “Taliban to rescind their links with terrorist groups and tackle their presence on Afghan soil”. The G20 leaders’ meeting made a strong request to Afghan authorities to “respect human rights, with particular regard to women’s and minorities’ rights”, de Luca said. “The Taliban were also urged to fully respect their own commitment to allow the safe passage of those who wish to leave the country,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-is-key-to-a-safe-and-secure-afghanistan-italy-101634582432211.html
19-10-2021||India||Maha govt creates disputes to divert people’s attention from issues: BJP leader||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA and leader of opposition in the Maharashtra legislative council Pravin Darekar on Monday said that the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government’s objective is to create “disputes” on a daily basis by diverting the people’s attention from basic problems.Speaking at a press conference in Mumbai, Darekar said that no leader from the Sena-Nationalist Congress Party-Congress coalition government is ready to talk about the work done by the state’s ruling dispensation for the development of Maharashtra, according to news agency PTI.His remarks come in the backdrop of Sena’s jibe at the BJP on using central agencies such as the CBI, Enforcement Directorate (ED), IT Department and the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) for their agenda. Through its mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, Sena alleged that these attacks by the saffron party are like “using Shikhandi as a shield.”Darekar further stated that Sena was crossing their limits in their criticism of BJP leaders. His comments were in reference to Sena saying in Saamana that the saffron party was “smoking a low-quality weed.”Also Read | Are you on the side of drug sellers, consumers? Fadnavis' question to Uddhav Thackeray“People in Maharashtra know it well, who take the side of (those consuming) drugs and weed," he was quoted as saying by PTI.Dareka was shot back at NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Sena MP Sanjay Raut for their respective comments against BJP, saying that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah are “capable of making decisions” about the central government and also the security of Jammu and Kashmir.The Maharashtra BJP leader said that Sena should instead dig into the minds of their own leaders, MPs and MLAs since there is unrest within the party. “The current Shiv Sena is dominated by outsiders. I challenge Shiv Sena to count the number of outsiders in both the parties (Sena and BJP),” Darekar told PTI.On this year’s Dussehra, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray slammed the NCB for the ongoing arrest and custody of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son, Aryan Khan, in the cruise ship drugs’ case. “All they are interested in is to catch celebrities, get their pictures clicked and make some noise,” Thackeray said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-govt-creates-disputes-to-divert-people-s-attention-from-issues-bjp-leader-101634581575121.html
19-10-2021||India||Govt may consider single tax rate for online gaming||The government may consider one single tax rate for online gaming as two different rates of 18% and 28% based on the distinction between so-called games of skill and games of chance are prone to misuse and litigation on account of the overlap between the two categories, two people aware of the thinking in government circles said.A final decision on this matter will be taken by the GST Council, the apex decision-making body on matters of the indirect tax, they said on condition of anonymity. The council, a federal body, is chaired by the Union finance minister and has representations of state finance ministers. The GST Council on May 24 constituted a group of ministers (GoM) to address issues related to the online gaming sector for taxation purposes. Initially, it was a seven-member ministerial panel under the chairmanship of Gujarat. Later, on June 11, the finance minister of Telangana was added in the group as the eighth member. “The GoM is expected to submit its report to the council next month. The council may discuss all issues related to online gaming and take a considered view,” one of the people said. The GoM is to ascertain whether GST should be applicable only on the amount retained by the platform or also levied on the prize money.The second person said it is often difficult to ascertain whether a game is purely one of skill or chance. “For example, rummy is a game of skill, but distribution of cards to players is nothing but chance. Secondly, unlike physical casinos, where the age of a player can be easily verified, in online gaming platforms, there is no effective way to check entry of kids as young as 13, which could be detrimental for the society. Hence, online gaming should be treated like lottery, a sin product, and attract the highest rate of 28%.”“There is no objectively definable test or regulatory guideline or administrative forum to assess and determine if a game will be characterised as a game of skill or game of chance,” said a Niti Aayog discussion paper, quoting a report of the Sports Law and Policy Centre, a Bengaluru-based think tank focussing on sports law and policy.Like lotteries, a single tax rate on online gaming is desirable to avoid litigation, the two people said. The GST Council in December 2019 levied a uniform 28% GST on both state-run and state-authorised lotteries. Earlier, state-run lotteries attracted 12% GST, while the levy on state-authorised lotteries was 28%. The lottery industry had been demanding a uniform GST rate of 12%.“The higher rate of 28% tax on this entertainment space will certainly be subject to judicial review as these are games of skills and not of chance,” said Abhishek A Rastogi, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co. “The equally bigger issue is the valuation of service – whether tax is applicable on the aggregate value of contribution of each player, or on the margin or revenue of the online platform.”“The Council can always amend the legislation to avoid multiple interpretations and judicial reviews,” the second person said. Rastogi, however, said the government needs to take a “pragmatic approach,” else players will have no choice but “to participate on foreign online platforms,” which will be detrimental to all stakeholders.All India Gaming Federation (AIGF) CEO Roland Landers said the association has recommended that the government continue with the current GSt at 18%. Citing four precedents by the Supreme Court, he claimed online games are based on skill and should not be imputed with games of chance.AIGF’s members are leading online game operators such as MPL, Paytm First Games, Gameskraft Group, Baazi Games and Adda 52.“Various high courts have unambiguously held various online games like Online Rummy, Fantasy Sports (eg. Dream 11) etc., as games of skill and distinguished them from games of chance,” said Bipin Sapra, partner, tax and regulatory services, indirect tax at consultancy firm EY. “The online gaming platform is akin to any other e-commerce platform and connects various players who play the game. The fee charged by the platform is in lieu of the service provided and is the only taxable value.”Arguing for an 18% GST, Landers said, “This is in line with global best practices where tax rates have been seen to range from 6% to 21%... If rates are increased beyond this threshold, there is a tendency for both operators and players to resort to black market operations, even within the Indian online gaming community.”On the distinction between games of chance and games of skill, AIGF president, policy and planning, Sutanu Behuria said: “Games of skill require players to invest a lot of time and effort in training and honing their skills like any commonly played sport. Herein, games of skill are differentiated when skill clearly outweighs chance with respect to the outcome of the game.”As per the gaming acts of various states, given that gaming is a state-run subject, games such as Rummy, Poker, Bridge, Fantasy Sports and E-sports are considered games of skill, he said. Behuria is a former bureaucrat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-plans-uniform-tax-for-online-gaming-101634582312172.html
19-10-2021||India||BJP worker among four arrested over Lakhimpur Kheri violence||The Uttar Pradesh Police on Monday arrested four more people in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, taking the total number of arrests to 10, officials said.Among the four arrested was a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker, Sumit Jaiswal, who was present in the vehicle that allegedly mowed down four farmers during a protest against the agricultural laws on October 3. The other three arrested people -- Shishupal of Lakhimpur Kheri, Nandan Singh of Lucknow and Satya Prakash Tripathi of Kaushambi -- were present in the remaining vehicles which were part of the convoy.“Four persons were arrested on Monday by the Crime Branch of the Lakhimpur Kheri police along with the SWAT team. The SIT investigators and other senior officials are interrogating the accused and further probe is underway,” the state police said in a statement.The SWAT team also recovered a revolver and three live cartridges from Tripathi, the statement added. “The accused will be questioned about the incident and their role in it. We will also apply for their police custody remand if they fail to cooperate in the interrogation,” a senior police official said, seeking anonymity.In a video that went viral, Jaiswal was seen leaving the leading vehicle in the convoy after it rammed into the protesting farmers. He later told reporters that the vehicle was under attack as protesters pelted stones, due to which the driver lost balance and the vehicle turned turtle, leading to the accident. The vehicle belonged to Union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni. Farmers maintained that the minister’s son Ashish Mishra was in the vehicle at the time of the incident. While the father and son have rejected the allegations, a murder case was registered against Ashish who was arrested on October 9. On Monday, Ashish, along with others accused in the case were also sent into judicial custody from police custody. Besides the farmers, two BJP workers and a driver were beaten to death allegedly by angry protesters, while a local journalist was also killed in the violence that ensued that day.Meanwhile, five farmers from Tikunia and nearby areas who participated in the protest on October 3 also appeared for questioning before the investigation team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjpworker-among-four-arrested-over-lakhimpur-kheri-violence-101634582252828.html
19-10-2021||India||Lawyer shot dead in UP court, colleague arrested: Police||A 40-year-old lawyer was shot dead by a colleague at Shahjahanpur district court in Uttar Pradesh over an old rivalry on Monday, police said. The accused was later arrested and four policemen were suspended for a security lapse, they added.According to Shahjahanpur superintendent of police (SP) S Anand, advocate Bhupendra Pratap Singh was shot dead by advocate Surendra Kumar Gupta at 11.40 am when Singh visited the record room on the second floor of the complex in connection with a case. Eyewitnesses claimed they rushed to the room after a gunshot was heard and found Singh in a pool of blood. The accused fled from the spot, the SP said.“A country-made .315 bore pistol was also found near the body. We have sent the body for a post-mortem examination and formed a team to investigate the case,” he added.Gupta, however, was detained from outside his house at 2 pm after police ascertained his role with the help of CCTV footage. He was arrested after he confessed to the crime. A forensic field unit was also called in to collect evidence from the site. “Gupta has confessed to the crime... Singh had filed two dozen cases against the accused which prompted him to take the drastic step,” the SP said.An FIR under sections 302 (murder) and 120 b (criminal conspiracy) was also registered against the accused lawyer at Sadar Bazar police station.Taking strong exception to a serious crime like murder on the court premises, four police personnel, including an inspector, were placed under suspension, assistant superintendent of police (city) Sanjay Kumar said.As a mark of protest, the Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh announced that lawyers across the state will abstain from work on Wednesday. The council also demanded a compensation of ₹50 lakh and a government job for kin of the deceased. Meanwhile, opposition parties attacked the state government over the law and order situation. “The judicial fraternity is an integral pillar of our democracy. The brutal murder of an advocate on court premises in broad daylight is another chilling reminder that no one is safe in today’s UP - not women, not farmers and now not advocates,” Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra tweeted. Former chief minister and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said the state has become number one in the country in “ease of doing crime” under the BJP. “The public murder of the lawyer in the court complex in Shahjahanpur has exposed the truth behind the false propaganda of the ‘encounter sarkar’. Under the BJP government, UP has become ‘number one in ease of doing crime’,” he tweeted. Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati tweeted, “The murder of a lawyer on the court premises of Shahjahanpur is very sad and shameful, which exposes the law and order situation under the BJP government here and their claims in this regard. Now, finally the question arises as to who is safe in UP? The government should pay proper attention to this.” “It turns out to be a case of personal rivalry. Police also acted swiftly and arrested the accused. Of course, it is sad and unfortunate. It’s a crime, not a law and order situation. Yet, the opposition parties are playing politics over it,” a senior BJP leader said, preferring anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lawyer-shot-dead-in-up-court-colleague-arrested-police-101634582012769.html
19-10-2021||India||Has hunger increased in India?||The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2021 rankings were released last week. India was placed at 101st rank among 116 nations covered in the report. India was ranked 94th out of 107 countries in the 2020 GHI rankings. India’s fall in the rankings has been used by some to argue there has been a worsening of hunger in the country.Such arguments, to put it simply, are wrong. They are a result of reading GHI rankings without understanding how they are tabulated. This does not mean there are no nutrition-related concerns in India. Here is a brief summary of what GHI rankings tell us.How are GHI rankings calculated?Rankings are always a relative rather than absolute measure of any indicator. GHI rankings are based on Hunger Index Scores, which are a weighted normalised average of four indicators: PUN or prevalence of undernourishment (insufficient calorie intake), CM or child mortality (mortality rate of children under the age of five), CWA or child wasting (share of children under the age of five who have low weight for height) and CST or child stunting (share of children under five who have low height for age).Each of the four components is given a standardized score based on thresholds set slightly above the highest country level values observed worldwide since 1988. The respective thresholds for PUN, CWA, CST and CM are 80, 30, 70 and 35, respectively.The standardized scores take a value from zero to 100, where zero is the lowest level of a given measure of undernourishment and 100 the highest. The aggregate GHI score is a weighted average of the four indicators where PUN and CM have a weight of one-third and CWA and CST have a weight of one-sixth each.The GHI report is unambiguous on non-comparability of scores overtime. “GHI scores are comparable with each year’s report, but not between different years’ reports...like the GHI scores and indicator values, the rankings from one year’s report cannot be compared to those from another,” the 2021 GHI report says.Moreover, the report adds that there have been significant changes to the methodology of GHI, including addition of new countries. To be sure, the latest GHI report does allow for a comparison of 2021 GHI scores over three reference years: 2000, 2006 and 2012.What has happened to India’s hunger score between 2000 and 2021?It has come down, not gone up as is being inferred by many people from the latest rankings. India’s global hunger score was 38.5 in 2000, 37.4 in 2006, 28.8 in 2012, and 27.5 in 2021.The GHI report gives a disaggregation of the four components, which yielded the aggregate global hunger score for 2000, 2006, 2012 and 2021. These statistics flag areas of concern in the fight against hunger in India. Two of the four indicators – the proportion of undernourished in the population and prevalence of wasting in children under five years of age – actually show a rise between the 2012 and 2021 reference periods for the global hunger score. On the other two indicators, there has been a secular improvement between 2000 and 2021. Hunger and undernutrition vary drastically across IndiaGiven India’s economic and social diversity, its performance in dealing with hunger and child undernutrition depend a lot on the performance of states. Some of the poorest states have the highest share in the population of children aged less than five years. Findings of the fifth round of the National Family and Health Survey (NFHS), conducted in 2019-20, show a difference in performance of states in dealing with child undernourishment. Out of the 22 states and Union Territories for which NFHS-5 data is available, the share of stunted, wasted and underweight children increased in 13, 12 and 16 states and UTs, respectively, between 2015-16 and 2019-20.“The inclusion of child stunting and wasting in the rankings like the GHI means that we have to go much beyond the issue of simple adequacy of food in the search for solutions. Child outcomes matter a lot in the long-run for societies and they are as much a result of social factors, such as the condition of women and economic conditions of households,” said Purnima Menon, senior research fellow at International Food Policy Research Institute. “Of course, there cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach to tackling child undernutrition in India, and you have to focus on the big states, where both the population of children and prevalence of undernutrition among them is big.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/has-hunger-increased-in-india-101634579740013.html
19-10-2021||India||Bengal BJP holds protests over Bangladesh violence; spotlights plight of Hindus||KOLKATA: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday held protests across 23 West Bengal districts including state capital Kolkata against communal violence during Durga puja in Bangladesh and alleged that Hindus were being systematically targeted in the neighbouring country.Suvendu Adhikari, the leader of the opposition in the Bengal assembly, offered puja with BJP legislators at a temple in Kolkata and led a delegation to the Bangladesh deputy high commissioner’s office in the city.“He (Adhikari) expressed concern regarding the ongoing attacks on the Hindu minority in Bangladesh,” the BJP said in a statement on Monday evening.Durga Puja pandals and temples were vandalised by mobs at several places in Bangladesh on Wednesday last following posts on social media about the alleged desecration of the Quran at a pandal in Cumilla district.Hindu-owned temples and shops in Feni, about 150km from the country’s capital Dhaka, were vandalised and robbed on Saturday during clashes that broke out after a counter-attack on demonstrators protesting against attacks on Durga Puja venues in several places in Bangladesh. On Sunday, a Hindu temple was vandalised.The BJP said the attacks on minority Hindus in Bangladesh was “part of a bigger plan” to scare them away and it was with this in mind that the BJP-led central government had mooted changes to India’s Citizenship Act to protect them, a point also made on Sunday by BJP spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya.CAA, which was notified on December 12, 2019, seeks to grant Indian citizenship to persecuted minorities belonging to the Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist, Parsi and Christian communities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan who entered India on or before December 31, 2014. The law provoked protests across the country -- in many parts, against the exclusion of Muslims from it; and in Assam, from fears that it could legitimise outsiders in the northeastern state.The BJP made CAA an issue during the March-April assembly polls which the TMC won with 213 seats.Bhattacharya said the violence against Hindus in Bangladesh was “part of systematic ethnic cleansing that started decades ago”, and went on to launch a sharp attack against the Trinamool Congress which, he said, continued the erstwhile Left Front government’s move to offer ration cards and voting rights to infiltrators from Bangladesh. This, he added, resulted in a radical change in demography in certain parts of the state and pressure on the local economy.”Toufique Hasan, the Bangladesh deputy high commissioner, did not make any statement on the development.Without naming the BJP, Trinamool Congress (TMC) Rajya Sabha member Sukhendu Sekhar Roy said, “Our leader Mamata Banerjee has already condemned the attacks. No political party should use a tragedy to carry forward its agenda.” The Left parties, including the Communist Party of India (Marxist), also voiced their protest during the day. In a memorandum submitted to the Bangladesh deputy high commissioner, the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation, or CPI(ML) Liberation, said, “The first attack on a Durga puja was carried out at Cumilla on the pretext of alleged disrespect shown to the Quran. This attack by fundamentalist forces was given recognition so that subsequent attacks could be carried out at Chandpur, Hajiganj, Hatia, Chittagong and other places.”“The subsequent attacks were preplanned and politically motivated,” said the memorandum signed by Abhijit Majumdar, state secretary of the CPI(ML) Liberation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-bjp-holds-protests-over-bangladesh-violence-focuses-on-plight-of-hindus-101634576673405.html
19-10-2021||India||India, Israel share ties of centuries: Jaishankar||The Indian diaspora in Israel has served as an umbilical cord that has nourished relations between the two nations, and there is a need to better document the heritage and history of the community, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said. Jaishankar made the remarks while interacting with members of the Indian Jewish community and Indologists in Jerusalem on Sunday. He is on his first visit to Israel after becoming foreign minister, and is holding talks with officials to boost bilateral relations. He said he was happy to be in Israel, a “land with which we have ties of centuries”, and amid the Indian Jewish community that has “in many ways been an umbilical cord” that has nourished these relations. Some Indian Jews were “uprooted in more difficult times and moved against their will”, while others made “more prescient choices” to move out of the country, he noted. “But among all of them, I would say that the Indian Jewish community is in many ways very unique because one, like other communities, it is a community that has existed peacefully in India for hundreds of years, which maintained its Jewish identity despite a long period of isolation from other Jewish communities,” he said. Those who chose a new life in Israel are a “basis for creating a new bond between” the two countries and the community has carried some flavours of India that have been retained or assimilated. There is the influence of the mangalsutra and mehendi among Bene Israelis, and the adorning of Torah arks with jasmine garlands and use of manara by Cochini Jews, Jaishankar said. “It is, therefore, not surprising that people like you say, ‘Israel is my fatherland and India is my motherland’,” he said. India’s connections with Jerusalem go back 800 years and the Sufi saint, Baba Farid, meditated in a cave in Jerusalem. This place later became a pilgrim lodge for travellers from India that is known as the Indian Hospice and symbolises India’s presence in the old city, Jaishankar said. Hundreds of Indian soldiers also fought and died in the region during World War I. Also Read: Jaishankar urges Israel businesses to focus on IndiaJaishankar said there is an urgent need to tap the Indian Jewish community and Indologists to better document the heritage and history of the community and societal cross flows. “How do we preserve the memory and experiences of the community elders? How do we listen to the younger generation of the community, understand their aspirations and make them a part of this living bridge? How do we enhance the reach of the work being done by the Indologists both within the community and outside? We will be happy to hear from you and would support your endeavours in this direction,” he said. Jaishankar also tweeted about a “productive meeting” with Israeli chambers of commerce and innovators. “Appreciate their visible enthusiasm for doing more partnerships with India.
