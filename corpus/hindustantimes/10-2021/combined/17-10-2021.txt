The state health department has rescheduled its recruitment examination for 6,200 posts for October 24 and October 31, after cancelling it in September. BJP leaders have also demanded the resignation of health minister Rajesh Tope. “The minister should immediately resign. If that’s not hapening, the CM should sack him,” said BJP spokesperson Atul Bhatkhalkar.Last month, BJP leader Pravin Darekar made allegations of irregularities over the awarding of the tender to this firm by the state government. “The Government Resolution (GR) is being changed from time to time for awarding tenders to the private companies. There is a scam behind this and it is should be investigated by the CBI, CID or by a retired judge. We had demanded that this recruitment examination be conducted by the MPSC and not by any private company,” said Darekar. Kumar, NCPL MD said, “We have been awarded the tender by the Maharashtra government IT department (MahaIT) and the state health department has given a clarification about giving us the contract. The black listing part in Madhya Pradesh and Punjab was been withdrawal at that time itself, around four years back. We submitted the clarification to the state health department. So the Maharashtra government and all its departments have made a proper verification about our company.” Kumar added, “We are doing our preparations well to conduct an error-free examination, learning lessons from previously scheduled exams. The allegations made against us are not true and we are going through the policy set by the state government.” Student organisations are not impressed. Kuldeep Ambekar, president of the Helping Hand organisation said, “It is simple logic. If there is a company which has bad record in other states, why is our Maharashtra government so keen to bring them here. There are thousands of good IT companies who can take run recruitment examinations smoothly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/health-department-exam-private-firm-running-recruitment-exam-claims-full-verification-by-state-101634495243443.html

The production has already started,” he added.“These idols and diyas are made from cow dung. After the cow dung is dry, it is added with wood dust and the mixture is then poured into a mould for make an idol or diya from it. These idols and diyas are inexpensive as compared to their clay and ‘Plaster of Paris’ counterparts and also eco-friendly,” said Tiwari.“If this trail initiative is successful, we will take up production of diyas and idols using cow dung at other gaushalas from next year,” he added. Eco-friendly cow dung diyas and idols have been in demand for the past two years in Sangam city with many people embracing them in their effort to celebrate the festival of lights in a greener way.“Now people are ditching earthen lamps and instead are rooting for those made of cow dung as they see it also as a way of empowering cow shelters and local communities,” he claimed.“If the sale of diyas and idols goes as expected, it will help gaushala authorities in better upkeep of rescued cows. The diyas and idols will be made under the supervision of a VHP volunteer,” Tiwari said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/vhp-gaushala-in-prayagraj-making-idols-diyas-of-cow-dung-101634495183298.html

Against the total installed capacity of 1,379 megawatts in 10 power houses on both right and left banks, eight power plants of 1,110 megawatts are in working order. One powerhouse on each bank has been shut down leading to a daily loss in power generation of 265 megawatts. Low water level in the reservoir after the end of its dam filling season on September 20 is a cause of concern for the Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB). Deficient rain this monsoon in the catchment of Bhakra dam reservoir is said to the reason. As per data from the board on Saturday, the level was 1,648 feet, at least 37 feet lower than the maximum filling level of 1,685 feet. To date, the targeted hydel power generation was 2,870 Million Units (MUs), as fixed by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), but only 2,521 MUs (88%) has been generated. If compared to the situation when all power houses are operated, the shutdown is leading to a daily shortfall of 63 lakh units from total generation capacity of 330 lakh units. The BBMB that manages the Bhakra Dam and other hydel generating units is under pressure from the state governments of Punjab and Haryana and the centre for generating maximum power possible, as it offers the cheapest rate of ₹1.4 per unit, which is calculated on the basis of operation and maintenance cost of the dam system. Owing to power shortage, Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has purchased power from outside the state at ₹12 a unit. Now, however, due to a fall in temperature, power demand has crashed and rates have also come down to between ₹4 and ₹5 per unit. Coal supplies are also expected to resume in the upcoming week. “We are trying to generate the maximum power, but at BBMB regulating the flow of water for drinking and irrigation purposes is important, power generation is a consequence,” said a director level officer, who manages operations at the State Load Dispatch Centre (SLDC). According to director, generation, PSPCL Paramjit Singh the state corporation is pushing for more power from the hydel generating units. “They (BBMB) have increased generation but there is a scope for more,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjabs-hydel-power-generation-also-falls-due-to-low-water-level-in-bhakra-101634493624746.html
17-10-2021||Chandigarh||Stubble burning: Kejriwal blames Punjab, UP Haryana for pollution in Delhi||As Delhi’s air quality plunged into the “very poor” category on Sunday morning, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said that increase in pollution was due to stubble burning in neighbouring states as governments were “doing nothing” to help farmers to stop it.He appealed to the governments of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to understand their responsibilities towards reducing stubble burning and controlling pollution. “For the past one month, I have been tweeting data of air quality in Delhi. Pollution has increased in the last 3-4 days and it is due to stubble burning in neighbouring states. Farmers in neighbouring states are compelled to burn stubble as their governments are doing nothing for them (towards stopping stubble burning),” Kejriwal said in an event organised to lay the foundation stone of a 1,430 bed new government hospital in Shalimar Bagh. Later in a statement, the government said that “Red Light On, Gadi Off” campaign will begin in the city from Monday for one month.The CM said the national capital has two kinds pollution, one is its internal pollution that emanates from vehicles, dust, while the other one is because of stubble burning in neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Kejriwal said the Delhi government is doing every bit from anti-dust campaign to spraying of bio-decomposer liquid in fields to controlling inbound pollution, but the neighbouring states were yet to act.“To stop stubble burning in Delhi, we sprayed bio-decomposer solution in fields. Farmers don’t need to burn stubble after spraying it. Why can’t state governments of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh spray this liquid?” Kejriwal asked.“I request governments of neighbouring states to understand their responsibilities (towards stopping stubble burning) and help their farmers responsibly,” he said.At 2 pm on Sunday, the AQI in Delhi was 339, which is in the “very poor” category. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered good, 51 and 100 satisfactory, 101 and 200 moderate, 201 and 300 poor, 301 and 400 very poor, and 401 and 500 severe.Earlier in the day, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai also reiterated similar concerns and said that air quality in the city was deteriorating because of increasing incidents of stubble burning in neighbouring states.He also appealed for a responsible approach from governments of these states.Rai said that it was a normal trend that as the incidents of stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh increase, the air quality starts deteriorating in the city. He said that the AQI was 171 on October 13 but as the incidents of stubble burning increased in neighbouring states, the AQI started getting worse and it was 284 on Sunday.According to NASA pictures, the number of stubble burning incidents that day was low but within the last three days, incidents of stubble burning have increased with great speed in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, he said.“This has been a normal trend. We have appealed to neighbouring states to control incidents of stubble burning but to no avail. We have started spraying of bio-decomposer in fields as an alternative to stubble burning the similar should be done by neighbouring states.“We need a responsible approach from (neighbouring) states in reducing the number of stubble burning. They should make arrangements to spray bio-decomposer in their states so that pollution can be controlled,” Rai said.He said that the central government has given about ₹250 crore to Punjab for the stubble management, with which bio-decomposer can be sprayed free of cost in 50 lakh acres of land.Rai said that to control the city’s internal pollution, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government was taking a number of measures, including spraying of a bio-decomposer solution in fields and also cracking down on violators.“We have started anti-dust campaign and are taking action against violators. From Monday, we will also launch ‘Red Light On, Gadi Off’ campaign to reduce vehicular pollution. “As a long term solution, we are promoting electric vehicle policy and working of tree plantation issues. We have also shut coal operating Badarpur plan to reduce pollution,” the environment minister said.He also said that awareness campaigns such as appealing to public to stop use of private vehicle at least for one day are also being started. Later in a statement, Rai said that wherever there are mountains of garbage, excavation work is being done on a permanent basis, which is causing dust pollution. “We will not hesitate in taking even the toughest step if required. Will take every step that is needed to reduce pollution in Delhi,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/stubble-burning-kejriwal-blames-punjab-up-haryana-for-pollution-in-delhi-101634493623292.html
17-10-2021||Chandigarh||Price rise to juice up income of Punjab’s kinnow growers||BATHINDAPunjab’s “king fruit” kinnow is giving hope of a handsome return to farmers even as its production is likely to dip this year by more than 50% as compared to the 2020-21 season. Traders have started finalising advanced deals for up to ₹25 per kg, an increase of over 100% over last year’s average price of up to ₹11 per kg. The reason for this price appreciation of the citrus fruit, to be harvested in second week of December, is attributed to lesser yield this season, say experts.The South is the biggest market for Punjab’s kinnow and the region plays a vital role in deciding the pricing, say orchardists.Punjab leads in the cultivation of kinnow, a hybrid between king and willow leaf mandarin. Abohar produces 60% of the state’s fruit with 33,000 hectares under its cultivation. Last season, Abohar produced 8 lakh metric tonnes of kinnow.A grower from Gidderanwali in Fazilka district, Pardeep Dawra, said farmers were paid ₹10-12/kg for bulk orders in 2020-21. “In the last two seasons, kinnow production was exceptionally high. But climatic conditions in March this year were non-conducive for trees at the flowering stage as the temperature was high. This time, the average yield was expected to be hit but higher rates will compensate farmers,” he added.Kinnow trader and grower Surinder Charaya said the fruit has a major market in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Gujarat.“Market rates of kinnow may escalate further as it depends on crop of orange, kinnow’s competitive citrus fruit. We are looking for the railways to facilitate kinnow producers a cheaper transport alternative to different markets of the country,” said Charaya.Ambala divisional railway manager GB Singh said a team has been deputed to finalise negotiations with the kinnow producers.“We have surplus freight trains to customise requirement for fruits. Railways has proposed to transport kinnow to Bengaluru and other southern states and West Bengal for export to Bangladesh,” he added.But a section of growers is apprehensive about the intervention of the railways.“A truck takes five days to reach the main destination in Bengaluru or WB from Abohar whereas freight trains may hit these destinations on the second day. But mass transportation may lead to a glut and crash in rates in markets,” said orchardist Arvind Setia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/price-rise-to-juice-up-income-of-punjab-s-kinnow-growers-101634493444029.html

17-10-2021||Lucknow||Deepotsav to dazzle with 9 lakh diyas in Ayodhya, 45 lakh more across Uttar Pradesh||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said his government would ensure nine lakh diyas (earthen lamps) were lit in Ayodhya during Deepotsav along with an additional 45 lakh of them across Uttar Pradesh in as many homes of beneficiaries of the BJP government’s schemes. The Deepotsav function is held on the Diwali eve which falls on November 3 this year.There are an estimated nine lakh beneficiaries of PM’s and CM’s Awas Yojanas (housing schemes) in urban parts of Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Adityanath said on Sunday that his government would light one diyas for each of them during the Deepotsav. “While these nine lakh earthen lamps (diyas) would represent the housewarming ceremonies of as many people in urban Uttar Pradesh, the government would also light earthen lamps at the houses of 45 lakh people across the state who have got a house,” Adityanath told members of the Prajapati community for whose benefit a Maati Kala Board was also set up by the BJP government. The move comes 12 days after the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Lucknow where he expressed the wish to see that along with Ayodhya, the homes of the beneficiaries of government schemes also shine bright with lights emanating from earthen lamps prepared by local potters. Adityanath also appealed to the people to buy locally made clay idols of Lakshmi and Ganesh on Diwali.The government push for clay ahead of Diwali is being seen part of a major outreach towards the Other Backward Caste (OBC) Prajapati community comprising potters. On October 5, during his visit to Lucknow, PM Modi had tasked the UP government with a “homework and a challenge”. “I am told that UP government plans to light up 7.5 lakh diyas in Ayodhya during this year’s Deepotsav. I want to task you with homework. Can we also see as much brightness emanating from the homes of those who got their new house under the PM or CM Awas Yojana? Will you accept this challenge?” Modi had said. “Through Maati Kala Board we managed to ignite fresh hope among the potters. We organised exhibitions of their products in Lucknow and elsewhere across the state too and it was quite successful,” said minister of state Dharamvir Prajapati who headed the board till recently. He was appointed as one of the seven new ministers in the Yogi Adityanath government last month. Prajapati said that Adityanath’s appeal to the people to buy Lakshmi and Ganesh idols prepared by local potters and to light up earthen lamps would also help the community. “A similar appeal by Prime Minister Narendra Modi was made a couple of years back. That helped a lot. Now, this appeal by chief minister Yogi Adityanath would also benefit in a big way. Moreover, the entire exercise is also part of the exercise to boost local products and to stop mindless reliance on China which had been hitting the local potters by flooding the market with not-so-quality goods,” Prajapati said.Since 2017, the Adityanath government has been holding the Deepotsav function in Ayodhya, beginning with 51,000 earthen lamps in the inaugural year to 4, 10, 000 diyas in 2019 and 6, 06, 569 lamps in 2020 – setting newer Guinness world records.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/deepotsav-to-dazzle-with-9-lakh-earthen-lamps-in-ayodhya-45-lakh-more-across-uttar-pradesh-101634490142978.html

He also questioned Punjab chief minister Charanajit Singh Channi’s decision to allow the Border Security Force (BSF) to extend its jurisdiction in the state. “Chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi should come clean and tell Punjabis why did he acquiesced to extending the jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF) to cover nearly half of the state during his meeting with union home minister Amit Shah,” Sukhbir told reporters after paying obeisance at Bhagwan Valmiki Tirath Sthal. “Punjabis expect decisive action from you to defeat the conspiracy to establish central rule over Punjab through this decision which is also against the principles of federalism as well as the very ethos of democracy,” he claimed.He also targeted the Congress party for going in for symbolism alone in appointing a Scheduled Caste leader as the chief minister. “The leader should have intent to work and the Congress should allow him to work,” he added. Addressing a gathering, Sukhbir added that once the SAD-BSP government was formed in the state it would establish a University in the memory of Bhagwan Valmiki in the Doaba region. He said this University would be in addition to the one which would be established to commemorate the memory of Dr BR Ambedkar.Earlier in the day, SAD senior leader Bikram Singh Majithia slammed Navjot Singh Sidhu for his abusive language and unwarranted interference in state government affairs. He said instead of trying to befool people, both Sidhu and the CM needed to focus on how they will fulfil plethora of promises that they their party had made to the people in 2017, as almost all of these remained unmet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/singhu-lynching-barbaric-says-sukhbir-101634488942567.html

Response time should be less as much as possible with immediate relief for the affected people,” said Dhami. He also directed the authorities to specially focus on the Char Dham Yatra route. “Special care should be taken of the Char Dham pilgrims. I appeal to the pilgrims not to take the pilgrimage in the next two days as the route is expected to witness extremely heavy rain, especially in the hilly areas. On Sunday morning, there were about 16,000 pilgrims at Kedarnath shrine. I spoke to the Rudraprayag district magistrate to quickly enable the pilgrims to offer their prayers and leave the shrine for their lodgings due to heavy rain,” he said. The CM will later hold a meeting with the minister of disaster management Dhan Singh Rawat and other officials concerned on the preparations of the agencies to handle any emergency situation on October 18 and 19. The state police has appealed to the pilgrims of Char Dham Yatra to stay put where they are at present. “I appeal to the people to not travel in the hilly areas and stay where they are due to warning of heavy rainfall.

17-10-2021||Pune||Covid: Mission “Kavach Kundal” extended till October 31 in Pune||PUNE Although mission “Kavach Kundal” aimed to vaccinate the entire eligible population in the district with a first dose, and 75% of beneficiaries with a second dose by October 14, the target have not been met.District collector Rajesh Deshmukh on Sunday issued an order to health officers in the district to continue the mission till October 31. The collector has also stated that blocks including Haveli, Daund, Bhor, Indapur and Baramati have been able to vaccinate only 60-70% of its eligible population with the first dose, while the district average is above 90%. Although mission Kavach Kundal was launched by the central ministry and so the supply of vaccines remains smooth, the administration has not been able to meet its target. The collector also noted that healthcare workers, frontline workers and those above the age of 60 years have not yet been fully vaccinated. This despite the fact that the vaccination drive for these groups began in the month of January. Deshmukh said, “We aim to complete 100% first dose vaccination of all eligible beneficiaries and then atleast 75% complete vaccination. We will prioritise women beneficiaries for both shots. In villages which have seen a poor response to the vaccination drive, we will conduct special awareness programmes to dispel vaccine hesitancy. We will ensure that after October 31, no one in Pune district will remain devoid of vaccination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-mission-kavach-kundal-extended-till-october-31-in-pune-101634486842409.html
17-10-2021||Patna||Bihar goes whole hog on Covid vaccination, 3 mega camps before Chhath||Beginning Monday, Bihar will hold three vaccination mega camps to administer Covid jabs to as many adults as possible before Chhath, a major Hindu festival celebrated in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand, in which devotees propitiate the Sun God. The other two mega camps are scheduled for October 28 and November 7, said the executive director of the State Health Society, Bihar, Sanjay Kumar Singh, also the nodal officer for vaccination in the state. The four-day Chhath puja begins with “Nahaye Khaye” on November 8 this year. The state health department doesn’t want to slacken either its vaccination or testing tempo during the festival months of October and November. Bihar has set a target to vaccinate most of its 7.34 crore adult target population by December 31. Anticipating the fact that people would throng puja pandals during Dussehra, celebrated after a gap of two years after the pandemic in 2020, the state health department converted it into an opportunity to vaccinate those who flocked to puja pandals. A reasonable 17% (144,876 doses) of the state’s 854,979 Covid shots between October 11 and 15 were administered at puja pandals. The state health department had tasked district magistrates and civil surgeons to set up special vaccination camps at major puja pandals in their respective districts. With 9,321 jabs, Muzaffarpur topped the districts in terms of doses administered at puja pandals during the five-day period. East Champaran (9,055 doses) and Gopalganj (8,272) came second and third, respectively. State capital Patna was sixth, having administered 7,530 doses, which was 10.55% of the 71,323 doses administered in the district during that period. Sheikhpura topped in terms of coverage percentage, having administered 52.66% of its 2,772 doses at puja pandals during the five-day period. Bhojpur came next, with 43.05% of the district’s 18,895 doses administered at pandals. East Champaran’s performance was good both in terms of the number of vaccination doses administered to beneficiaries and coverage percentage (37.45%) at puja pandals during Dussehra. Jamui, with 1,070 doses administered at puja pandals against the district’s 12,402 shots to beneficiaries during Dussehra, Banka (1,007/12,056 doses), Jehanabad (944/13,914), Kishanganj (923/6,012) and Sheohar (179/3,396) were among the five most laggard districts. Bihar’s reported 495 new Covid cases during the Chhath festival on November 20 last year, when the state tally of active cases was 5,603. The situation is better this year. The state did not report any new Covid-19 case during the last 24 hours on Saturday. The count of active cases had also come down to 43, as per the state Covid-19 bulletin released on Saturday. “We want to keep up the tempo and vaccinate the maximum number of the target population while also simultaneously testing as many people as possible to ward off the threat of Covid-19. Though the situation is better, we do not want to lower our guards. We will have three mega vaccination camps before Chhath and will try to vaccinate as many people as possible before the festival,” said Singh. As on Saturday, the state’s first dose vaccination achievement was 65% while that of Patna was 76%. Its second dose achievement against the first dose is 30% against Patna’s 60%. Chief minister Nitish Kumar had on Saturday directed officials to test those coming from outside the state either by road or train during the festival season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-goes-whole-hog-on-covid-vaccination-3-mega-camps-before-chhath-101634486663741.html

Around 37 of the 73 hotspots demarcated by the district administration to contain the spread of the virus are from these three blocks alone, with 15 in Ambegaon, 10 in Haveli, and 12 in Junnar. As of Saturday, rural Pune accounted for 57% of the total 2,468 active cases reported in the district with Manchar village in Ambegaon reporting the highest number of active cases (80); followed by Wagholi in Haveli (71); Otur in Junnar (44); Awsari Khurd in Ambegaon (43); and Mandavgan Farata in Shirur (38). Villages with more than 10 active Covid-19 cases have been listed as hotspots by the district administration.Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer of the Pune zilla parishad, said, “Although the number of new Covid-19 cases is falling and as a result, commercial activities are reopening, more people are interacting and we have to demarcate these villages as hotspots because the number of active Covid-19 cases is more than 10 and so, we are limiting the movement of people in these villages as they are hotspots so that there is a break in the chain of infection. However, we must also note that we have hundreds of villages under the Pune zilla parishad that have absolutely zero active Covid-19 cases and are absolutely free of the infection currently.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-three-blocks-in-rural-pune-account-for-50-active-cases-101634486662293.html

Sunday’s rallies saw Tejashwi asking voters to extend their support to the RJD, besides the leader of opposition slamming the Nitish Kumar government for its alleged failures on several fronts such as employment, development and checking corruption. Several prominent leaders, including former MPs Alok Kumar Mehta and Jai Prakash Yadav, accompanied Tejashwi during the rally. According to party sources, Tejashwi will be camping at the constituency for next few days before leaving for Kushweshwar Asthan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/tejashwi-kicks-off-rjd-s-campaign-from-tarapur-101634486303834.html
17-10-2021||Patna||Bihar bypolls: Cong sets up panel to coordinate campaigning||The Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) has set up a seven-member panel to ensure smooth coordination among the party’s star campaigners for Kuesheshwar Asthan and Tarapur by-elections, scheduled for October 30.The panel, led by former Youth Congress president Kumar Ashish, was constituted a day after RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s elder son and MLA Tej Pratap Yadav threw his support to Congress nominee Atirek Kumar, who is contesting from Kusheshwar Asthan assembly seat in Darbhanga.BPCC chief spokesman Rajesh Rathore said that the committee had already taken up the work to coordinate with the grassroots-level workers to the state leaders for the campaigning ahead of the much-talked visit of former JNUSU leader Kanhaiya Kumar on October 22. “Mrinal Anamay, Neeraj Yadav, Rajesh Kumar, Rajiv Sinha, Kamal Kumar Kamlesh and Gyan Ranjan are committee members,” said Rathore.The Congress party received a shot in the arm in the midst of campaigning for the by-elections as Tej Pratap Yadav announced his decision to campaign for the Congress’s nominee in fray for Kusheshwar Asthan, much to the discomfiture of his younger brother and opposition leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav.Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) working president Ashok Kumar, whose son Atirek Kumar is contesting Kusheshwar Asthan seat as the Congress nominee, said it was a great gesture to strengthen the secular forces that Tej Pratap would campaign for Atirek. “Tej Pratap had talked to Atirek and chalked out his tour programme,” said Ashok Kumar.Atirek is seeking election from Kushshwar Asthan, which remained a stronghold of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) since 1995. The Congress had won the seat last in 1985. In 1995, Raj Kumar Mahaseth, who represented the constituency as an Independent in 1990, won it for the Janata Dal. However, it’s been in the kitty of either the BJP or the JD(U) since 2000. JD(U) has bet on Aman Bhushan Hazari, while the RJD pins hope on Arun Kumar to wrest it for the party.Tej Pratap’s decision to support the Congress candidate might be seen as an embarrassment to his younger brother and opposition leader Tejashwi Yadav, who had unilaterally announced that the RJD would contest both Kusheswhwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly seats. The Congress resented the RJD’s decision as a ‘breach of coalition dharma’ and decided to contest both the seats.The Congress was planning to contest only one seat, Kusheshwar Ashthan, which was allotted to it under seat adjustment among the Grand Alliance (GA) in 2020 elections, and leave the other for the RJD. It has fielded Rajesh Mishra from Tarapur against the Janata Dal (United) candidate Rajiv Kumar Singh and RJD’s Arun Kumar Sah.BPCC president Madan Mohan Jha and party MLC Prem Chandra Mishra kicked off the party’s campaigning in Kusheshwar Asthan by paying their obeisance to the ditties at the famous local temple. Citing huge public support during the party’s meeting, Mishra claimed that the Congress was sure to win both seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-bypolls-cong-sets-up-panel-to-coordinate-campaigning-101634486302349.html
17-10-2021||Mumbai||12-year-old boy drowns in weir at Shahapur in Thane||A 12-year-old boy drowned in a weir at Shahapur taluka in Thane district on Saturday after he had been to the spot to wash his bicycle. Villagers claimed that the sand mafia had excavated sand from the area, which created a deep pit. Owing to this, the boy fell deep inside the water and was unable to come out.Shahapur police are investigating the incident. The victim, Rohit Gulave, was a resident of Kasara Vithhalwadi area of Shahapur. He used to visit a small part of the dam area near Moghavane village which is 2km away from his residence. On Saturday evening, he and his friends went to wash their bicycles and then stepped into water for a swim. Gulave got into the water from a different side and slipped deep inside. It is unclear why he was unable to see the surface of the water. His friends and the locals began a search for him.An officer from Shahapur police station said, “Some villagers and divers fished out the boy’s body on Sunday morning. We have registered an accidental death case and are investigating about the villagers’ claim on sand mafia.”A Moghavane village resident Shyam Dhumal said, “The weir is small but the sand mafia has ruined it so much. Now we can see deep underwater pits but the child didn’t understand [the depth] and drowned. Our children are regular visitors and now the weir poses a danger to their lives. We all went to Shahapur police station and submitted a complaint letter to them, stating details of the sand mafia’s activities and urged them to take action immediately.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/12yearold-boy-drowns-in-weir-at-shahapur-in-thane-101634486002325.html
17-10-2021||Mumbai||‘New aviation policy to give fillip to export of aircraft maintenance services by 2025’||In its bid to encourage air service operators to carry out aircraft maintenance activities within the country, the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) in September announced a new policy, which includes leasing of land through open tenders and abolishing royalty charged by the Airport Authority of India (AAI) for the Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO) business. Besides, as per the policy announced by civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, land allotment for entities setting up MRO facilities will be for a period of 30 years from the current three to five years as the government aims to make India a “global MRO hub.” Industry experts said the new policy will not only aid in the growth of domestic aviation industry but could also spur export of MRO services outside India, especially in South-East Asia. At present, air service operators send their aircraft for maintenance to foreign countries – mainly to the Middle East and the South-East Asian region – as it is less expensive than the domestic market. Available market reports peg the Indian MRO industry (excluding defence) to be worth USD 2 billion annually, with domestic players barely handling 16% of the total business. The remaining 85% or almost USD 1.7 billion, especially in the area of components and engines, is currently done abroad. Early last year, the Centre reduced the goods and services tax (GST) rate on aircraft repair and maintenance work to 5% from 18% and announced that it will lease out airports’ land to repair units at discounted rates to attract investment and boost growth. “AAI is trying to facilitate the development of MRO industry in the country, in line with MoCA’s positive steps to stimulate the industry through National Civil Aviation Policy 2016 and in-sync with the prime minister’s campaign of creating an Aatmanirbhar Bharat,” an AAI spokesperson said. The spokesperson added that tenders for setting up of MRO facilities at five AAI-run airports –Chennai, Begumpet, Chandigarh, Bhopal and Juhu – are in the “final stages”. Within MRO services, there are four main segments – airframe maintenance, engine maintenance, components maintenance and daily and weekly checks (termed as line maintenance). Of these, engines and airframes account for about 50%-55% of the work by value, with engine and component airframe maintenance the most lucrative business within the segment. Anand Bhaskar, managing director and chief executive officer at Air Works Group, which runs an independent MRO unit with facilities across locations, said the policy initiatives will boost investment in MRO sector and will also support the expected growth of the domestic aviation industry. Air works is the country’s largest private provider of line maintenance services (across 21 international airports) to foreign airlines flying into India. As per the Oliver Wyman report released early this year, India’s air fleet is expected to grow more than double by 2030 and see significant growth in its MRO market. “With the country’s aviation industry on a growth trajectory, it makes ample sense to capitalise this precious opportunity and expand the country’s aviation maintenance capabilities for greater self-reliance, job creation and to scale up the value chain, instead of just concentrating on airframes, which most Indian MROs currently do,” added Bhaskar. Just prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, the now-privatised Air India’s engineering arm, Air India Engineering Services Ltd (AIESL), had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Pratt & Whitney to launch a joint engine MRO facility in Mumbai. At present, the airframe MROs in India caters to overseas customers owing to the requisite infrastructure. “MRO industry will have to invest substantially in infrastructure to meet the challenges of fleet growth in both commercial and business aviation. With the new policy going to be implemented, we are looking to close these gaps over the next couple of years and ramp up to meet the demand of South Asia initially,” president of MRO Association of India and chairman of Max AeroSpace and Aviation Bharat Malkani said, adding that MRO Association expects exports of these services to take off by 2025 from India, attaining a value of USD 5 billion. Delhi-based infrastructure group GMR, which runs an MRO facility from Shamshabad airport in Hyderabad, said reduction in GST rates has reduced the cost of MRO services within India for domestic airlines, and the new MRO policy will help strengthen domestic business and boost investment. Industry experts believe that while overseas business is indeed attractive, Bhaskar said, “It is important that India also takes appropriate steps, not necessarily similar, to strengthen its indigenous aviation maintenance industry, on which all aircraft – regardless of type (commercial/business/defence) – depend.” With the number of aircraft to be inducted into the fleet of Indian air operators expected to be twice its current strength over the next few years, Bhaskar estimated that the domestic MRO industry could well grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10% or more, for the next few years. “In order to make India an MRO hub, the focus is required on creating infrastructure and building technology for engines, landing gears and major components maintenance. Presently, most engines, landing gears and components are being sent out of the country for maintenance,” a GMR spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/new-aviation-policy-to-give-fillip-to-export-of-aircraft-maintenance-services-by-2025-101634485942617.html

Later, Yogi Adityanath addressed people of both Shravasti and Bahraich through the virtual medium.Stating that both the districts have historical importance, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister said Shravasti is a holy place for Buddhists while Bahraich is associated with the sage Balark and also witnessed the valour of Maharaja Suheldev.It is said that Lord Buddha spent most of the ‘chaturmas’ (a holy period of four months) in Shravasti.The people in the country as well across the world look at Shravasti with immense faith, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister said, adding that it is the focal point of the four districts of the Devipatan division. The division has three aspirational districts including Shravasti. The government has made a concrete action plan for the development of these districts, Yogi Adityanath said.The Uttar Pradesh government has launched several projects to give a thrust to tourism in Shravasti and the construction of a new airport is progressing rapidly, he said.He said Bahraich has a special significance from the point of view of spirituality and culture, adding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had launched the construction of a memorial at the historic victory site of Maharaja Suheldev.This memorial will emerge as a new tourist centre, adding to the pride and dignity of people of Bahraich, he said.The Prime Minister has given the mantra of “sabka saath, sabka vikas” for the development of the country and the state, the chief minister said, adding that the central and state governments were working to improve the life of every citizen without any discrimination.Under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana scheme, 42 lakh poor families have been provided houses in the state, he said. In Bahraich, housing has been provided to 1,36,105 beneficiaries under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Rural), 8,462 under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) and 2,049 beneficiaries under Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana, he said.Under the Swachh Bharat Mission, 4,85,384 individual toilets have been constructed in Bahraich.

These toilets have become an important means of protecting women’s dignity along with realising the vision that each citizen remains healthy, Yogi Adityanath said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-adityanath-launches-611-crore-projects-for-shravasti-bahraich-in-uttar-pradesh-101634485822130.html
17-10-2021||Pune||State’s health department exam in sick bay over scheduling issues||PUNE: The state government has embarrassed itself once again, with several students complaining about multiple centres across different cities having been allocated for the same paper (subject) on the same day for the Maharashtra public health department exam scheduled on October 24 and 31.This time too, the government has outsourced the conduct of the exam to Nyasa Communication Private Limited (NCPL) which was blamed earlier as well for the fiasco wherein the government had to cancel the exam at the eleventh hour due to lack of preparation in filling up over 6,200 vacant posts in the state health department.Sandeep Godane, an aspirant, is facing the dilemma of having to appear for examinations for two different posts on the same day but in different districts. He had applied for group C posts of ‘telephone operator’ and ‘junior clerk’ with the state health department. While he has been allotted Kolhapur district for one examination, he has to give the other examination in Satara district, with both examinations scheduled on October 24.“I had applied for two different posts as I was eligible for them and have been preparing for the examination. But I was shocked after receiving my admit card. For one of the posts, I have got the exam centre in Kolhapur while for the other, I have got Satara district. How can I appear for two separate examinations to be held on the same day in different districts! This is complete mismanagement on the part of the state government and the agency appointed for conducting these exams,” said Godane. Godane is not alone for there are a total 8 lakh job aspirants who have applied for various posts with the public health department under groups C and D.Kamlakar Shete, student and vice-president of Yuvak Kranti Dal organisation, Pune city, said, “There are hundreds of students who are facing various types of issues related to hall tickets, addresses, examination centres and others for the recruitment exams. This has already happened last month and students had to pay the price for it as exams were cancelled at the last moment. Rather, the state government should have cancelled the company’s contract and given it to another company instead to carry out the examination this time.”Rohit Pawar, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) legislator and grand-nephew of Sharad Pawar, hit out at Nyasa Communication saying that such agencies should stop playing with the future of aspirants. “The aspirants work hard while their parents, too, spend a lot of money on them. However, firms conducting the exams play with the future of these aspirants. This is not fair. It’s time exams are conducted through the Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC),” Rohit Pawar said in a series of tweets.A Congress leader on condition of anonymity criticised the way the exam is being conducted amid several issues. “When the firm cancelled the exam at the last moment, the government should have replaced it with any other competitive agency. It seems the people in the establishment did not learn their lesson,” he said.However, Nyasa Communication Private Limited (NCPL), refuted all such allegations saying that there are no issues with the exam centres.Puneet Kumar, managing director of NCPL, said, “Our arrangements for the scheduled examination on October 24 and 31 are going on well and we are trying to ensure zero error in the exercise. We have started issuing hall tickets to students as per the policy set by the state health department. About complaints coming from aspirants that they have been given different centres for the posts they have applied for, it is all as per the post and district circle where that student has applied.” If a student based in Pune has applied for a post in Akola district, he or she will be given an examination centre located in Akola district, he explained. “There are some people unnecessarily creating confusion and the students are getting worried,” said Kumar.Asked why the company had not learned its lesson from the previous experience, Mr Kumar said, “This time, we have taken extra care of all the arrangements and preparations. Accordingly, each and every examination centre has gone through an audit, not only by us but also by state health department officials. In each district, officials have checked the examination centre and its arrangements. We have then upgraded our call centre and increased its strength to 50. Our technical team is also working round the clock to make the entire online process of issuing hall tickets and other things errorless.”Health department response Meanwhile, Dr Archana Patil, director of the state health services department, said, “We have 52 cadres and eight different mandals under the department and if we conduct the examination for each cadre separately, this issue might get solved. But it is not possible and all the instructions related to this specific examination were given on the website clearly since the beginning. Applicants have applied for several posts in different districts and so, they have been given centres in that specific district. Still, we are trying to allocate the same examination centre for the posts applicants have applied for within the same division or district.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/states-health-department-exam-in-sick-bay-over-scheduling-issues-101634485704888.html
17-10-2021||Mumbai||Contract killings replaced by ‘govt killings’ to end opponents, Shiv Sena slams Centre||Attacking the Centre over the action by probe agencies against members of the ruling coalition Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), the Shiv Sena on Sunday said that contract killings have now been replaced by “government killings” to finish off political rivals.Party’s Member of Parliament (MP) Sanjay Raut in his weekly column ‘RokhThok’ listed down the Narcotics Control Bureau’s (NCB) action against Nawab Malik’s son-in-law and the Income Tax (I-T) department’s raid against deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and his relatives. “Use people’s money, government machinery to remove political opponents... Once upon a time, contract killings were prevalent in Mumbai. Hitmen were hired on contract to kill rivals. Now government killings have replaced contract killings. It appears that the central agencies are engaged in contract killings for party in power in Delhi. The policy now is to finish off unwanted political opponents by using the central agencies,” Raut wrote in his column in Sena mouthpiece Saamana.“The drama to defame Maharashtra is going on by falsely levelling allegations of corruption. The objective of these raids is to harass people and get them to bend down. But Maharashtra will not bow down, and that has been made clear by right from [CM Uddhav] Thackeray to [Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar],” wrote Raut.The Sena leader further slammed the Centre, stating that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) was raiding homes of former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh five times instead of finding the whereabouts of former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh. Singh had accused Deshmukh of corruption when he was serving as the state home minister.“Singh had levelled allegations on paper and then fled. Find him. Singh alleged that Deshmukh asked police officers to collect ₹100 crore, and since then, right from CBI to ED (Enforcement Directorate) have been politically active with a sense of duty. But where is the police officer who levelled the allegations?” questioned Raut.He also targeted the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM Cares Fund) and asked why no questions were raised on it.Raut said the current Central government has made a “mess” of the democracy in the country. “Who is engaging in corruption, and who are the raids carried out on? This is a really important question. Nobody is ready to make the details of PM Cares Fund public. It is said that this fund is not a government fund but a private one. Funds worth crores of rupees are collected in PM’s name,” he wrote.Meanwhile, Sena’s ally Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), responding to former chief minister (CM) Devendra Fadnavis’ remarks that if the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Central government had misused the probe agencies then half of the state cabinet would have been inside jail, said that the Opposition leader must not make such threats. “We dare them to put the entire state cabinet in jail. The Maharashtra government will not be scared by such threats. The central agencies were misused to harass the West Bengal [government] but people responded to BJP [in the Assembly polls] accordingly.

17-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Reopen closed extortion case against two constables, railway court orders||The railway court on Friday rejected the summary report filed by the government railway police (GRP) officers and asked them to represent the case against two constables who were accused of extorting money from outstation train passengers at Tilak Nagar railway station.According to the metropolitan magistrate court, there was sufficient evidence in the case to try the constables for extortion and assaulting the complainant Ajay Bose on February 22, 2017.According to the complainant Bose, who worked as a booking clerk in railways at Tilak Nagar railway station, he had witnessed two constables from Wadala GRP Pravin Patil and Sunit Chauhan, who were on duty at the exit gate, extorting money from passengers by checking their luggage, claiming security procedures and demanding money after spotting any flammable substance, even the hair oil or gutkha etc. Bose began recording a video on his mobile phone but was spotted by the constables and was assaulted by three people including the constables.The accused then deleted the video on his phone. The complainant registered a first information report (FIR) against the two constables under section 384 of the Indian Penal Code for extortion.The investigating officer and assistant commissioner of police Machindra Chauhan had then filed a summary report in front of the court after he found no evidence to book the accused.Bose followed the case and recovered the CCTV recordings of the spot showing the two men and the complainant recording the video. With the help of forensics, Bose also recovered the deleted video of 30 seconds showing the accused making enquiries with the passengers.The court observed that a prima face case was established against the accused for extortion, voluntarily causing hurt and destruction of evidence along with common intention. The court then ordered the rejection of the summary report filed by the assistant commissioner of police and asked the police to represent the case in front of the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaireopen-closed-extortion-case-against-two-constables-railway-court-orders-101634485522651.html
17-10-2021||Pune||Dusserah, Navratri vehicle sales down this year as compared to 2020||PUNE Vehicle sales during the festival of Dusserah this year have been lower than 2020, as per data on new vehcles registered released by the Pune Regional Transport Office (RTO).The decrease is seen both the car and the two- wheeler segment during the the nine-day Navratri period, traditionally an auspicious time for customers to invest in a new vehicle. Despite this, the total revenue generated by the RTO from new vehicle registrations has increased in 2021 by ₹1.5 crore+. Last year, a total of 6,454 new vehicles were registered during the Navratri period, for a total revenue of ₹31,97,78,668. Whereas this year, new vehicle registration has gone down to 4,330 in total, but revenue increased to ₹33,53,06,175.In the car segment last year, a total of 2,338 cars were registered and this year it droped to 1,249. “There is considerable drop in the sale of cars during the Navratri period compared to last year. Also two-wheeler registration has decreased,” said regional transport officer Ajit Shinde. Last year 3,794 new two-wheelers were registered, which went down to 2,684 this year. “There are two reasons for the drop in two-wheeler sales this year. Colleges are closed youths so parents didn’t buy vehicles this year. Another reason is as majority of workers use motorcycles to travel to their work place, they are not in town,” added Shinde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/dusserah-navratri-vehicle-sales-down-this-year-as-compared-to-2020-101634485343324.html
17-10-2021||Mumbai||Mess in recruitment exams of Maharashtra health department, say candidates; state denies claims||A week ahead of the examinations to fill the 2,739 vacant Class C category posts of the state public health department, as many as 2,869 candidates have complained of issues such as allotment of examinations centres in different districts, their photograph or signature on admission card (hall ticket) not matching, among other things. The health department, however, said that the candidates, who have applied for posts in various divisions, will get centres as per the division in which they applied. This means if a candidate applies for a job in Akola division, the candidate’s examination centre will be in Akola district.The state has received 405,163 applications to fill up 2,739 posts for which the examination is scheduled for October 24. The department started getting complaints from candidates after the hall tickets were distributed online on October 15.In an embarrassment for the state government, these examinations were postponed at the eleventh hour on September 24 after the firm, Nyasa Communication Pvt Ltd was unable to finish the preparations in time. The exams were scheduled for September 25 and 26. The recent complaints from candidates can cause further embarrassment to the government due to the aggrieved reactions.Nitesh Dadmal, a candidate from Chandrapur district, applied for two posts — a junior clerk in Akola, and a telephone operator in Thane. “I had chosen Nagpur as the centre for the examinations. But I was allotted a centre at Thane and another at Karanja, Washim for the exam on the same day. I am not financially well-off enough to travel to Thane for the examination,” Dadmal said. He claimed that when he applied for the same posts for the examination in September he was allotted a centre in Nagpur.Another candidate, Aditya Dinesh Wasawey, in a tweet said, he sought centres at Nagpur, Yavatmal, Akola, but got his centre in Ahmednagar. Wasawey, according to the hall tickets, had applied for two posts, junior clerk in Akola and chemical assistant, application for which was made to the office of deputy director of health services in Pune. He has received a centre at Yavatmal for the junior clerk position in Akola. While he received the centre at Nevasa in Ahmednagar. Dadmal added, “We expect the government to provide centres for which we applied and don’t create this confusion.”Responding to the issue of examination centres the state health department said that the candidates are expected to apply for a job in the district where they wish to work. Officials said if this condition is not kept then candidates, if appointed, will not resume work, or will seek transfer to their home district, such issues will adversely impact tribal areas. With regards to issues related to the photograph and signatures, the candidates have been advised to contact the firm Nyasa which will resolve the issue.“The applications of each candidate are examined individually, and examination centres are allotted based on the division of the appointment officer for the post. For instance, if a candidate applies for a post in the Akola division, the candidate would get an examination centre in Akola. The candidates are expected to appear for examination in the division they wish to work,” stated a state health department statement.It further said, “If we do not keep this condition then applicants will apply for posts elsewhere in the state. If appointed, then they might not join work or might not work after resuming work or seek a transfer from day one of the job. If this happens, the tribal areas will bear the bad consequences of this.”The department clarified that some candidates have made multiple applications for a post in multiple divisions. If exams are held for each of them it will take 1.5 to 2 years for this selection process to complete. “When candidates apply for a post they are unsure of which one they have liking or aptitude towards. Considering the probability of getting the job, they make multiple applications to different divisions, for different posts. And till the last moment, they are undecided as to which exam they would appear for.“The health department allows multiple applications, but they will only be considered for a post that they appeared for in the examination. These rules are noted in the advertisement, the guidelines and the notification. Still, candidates insist on being given the opportunity to appear for all the examinations,” said a statement from the health department, shared by Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary, health.Dr Archana Patil, director of health services, said, “There are news reports in the media that there is a lot of mess and confusion in the recruitment process. These examinations are conducted as per the rules and nothing has been done to create confusion.”Rohit Pawar, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) legislator and grand-nephew of party chief Sharad Pawar tweeted that the government must resolve the issue as many people would have to skip one examination. “Many will have to skip one exam as there are examination centres in different districts for two exams on the same day. The government should immediately instruct the company conducting the examination to solve the related problem and start the help centre and relocate the examination centre as per the convenience of the examinees (sic),” said Pawar, in a tweet on Sunday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mess-in-recruitment-exams-of-maharashtra-health-department-say-candidates-state-denies-claims-101634485342244.html
17-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai University releases SOPs for degree colleges set to resume on October 20||Three days ahead of reopening of classes for degree-college students, the University of Mumbai (MU) on Sunday released a standard operating procedure (SOP) for its affiliated colleges. While some colleges are ready to open their gates to students on October 20, others will hold internal meetings with their staff and management to discuss modalities and finer details. According to SOP, institutes that do not fall under any containment zone can reopen and only fully vaccinated students will be allowed to attend college. The university’s circular stated that colleges should give students an option for online as well as offline sessions. Institutes should possess Covid-19 vaccination certificates of every student and staff attending physical sessions. A six-to-eight feet gap between the lecturer and first benchers should be maintained. Last week, the state government had announced that colleges in the state can reopen on October 20, and individual universities in the state should take a final call and prepare a detailed SOP. Laying down rules to be followed at the entry gate and within the institute, the SOP has also listed measures that need to be taken if a Covid-19 case is detected. Every institute needs to have a medical practitioner available at all times. Any symptomatic person spotted should be isolated, and the nearest medical facility and concerned authorities should be informed in case a positive case come to the fore. Institutes need to ensure staggered timings for various streams or courses to avoid crowding at entry and exit points. Any shops, stalls or cafeterias inside or within the vicinity of campus should remain closed. Regular sanitisation of common surfaces and office spaces needs to be undertaken. These SOPs were released after a detailed meeting between college heads and vice chancellor at the university premises. TA Shiware, speaking for the management of Wilson College, said, “Initially, we will only call students for practicals. We have created a cluster of ten colleges in the vicinity and are conducting a vaccination drive during the weekend for students. However, there continues to be a big gap between two doses for certain vaccines. Hence, it will take time for all students to be able to attend college.” Shiware is also the chairman of Mumbai Association of Non-Government Colleges. Principals and college managements said they are yet to take a call on the reopening protocols. “The SOP was released on a Sunday. We need to discuss the same with the college management and staff before we take a final call. Moreover, Diwali vacations are due. So, we need to plan accordingly,” said a principal from a suburban college. Hemlata Bagla, principal, KC College, Churchgate, said, “We will first have a meeting with the staff on October 20 and discuss students from which stream or programme should be given priority based on the university SOP. We will also release an SOP that needs to be followed within our institute.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-university-releases-sops-for-degree-colleges-set-to-resume-on-october-20-101634485282549.html

17-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai reports zero Covid-19 deaths on Sunday||Mumbai reported zero deaths due to Covid-19 on Sunday, October 17, the first time – according to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) data – since March 26, 2020. The state health department, whose daily figures vary from BMC’s on account of a reconciliation process, last recorded a zero-deaths day on February 22, 2021. On Sunday, Mumbai recorded 366 new Covid-19 cases, taking the city’s tally to 751,659, while the death toll remains unchanged at 16,180. The metropolis has reported 727,084 recoveries so far, a recovery rate of 96%. The city’s case fatality rate (the number of deaths per 100 positive cases) is 2.15% and there are 5,902 active cases. To be sure, Mumbai has been reporting fewer than 10 deaths per day for over two months. The last time Mumbai recorded deaths in double digits was August 1, with 10 deaths. Suresh Kakani, BMC’s additional municipal commissioner said, “The difference (between BMC and state data) may be due to the reconciliation process. Updates are made to the state data after verification. This may cause the BMC and state numbers to vary a bit. The major reason behind zero deaths in the city is due to vaccination and other reasons such as early detection and treatment.” Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal tweeted, “Mumbai recorded zero Covid deaths (for the first time) after March 26, 2020. This is great news for all of us in Mumbai. As municipal commissioner, I salute Team BMC for their spectacular performance. Let us all keep the mask on our face and let every citizen of Mumbai get vaccinated if some of us have not yet. I appeal to everyone to help us keep Mumbai safe.” According to BMC officials, though, the next one month up to November 20 will be crucial to keep Covid under control, and for the city to not witness a likely spike after festivals such as Navratri and Diwali, and after the reopening of schools, religious places, cinema halls and auditoriums. One official said that despite the Ganpati festival, the reopening of local trains, and the Navratri celebrations, there has been no spike yet. “However, the impact of Navratri and Diwali will be only known by November 20,” the official said. BMC allowed reopening of shops on all days up to 10 pm in the first week of August, followed by the reopening of local trains for fully vaccinated citizens on August 15. Further, in September it allowed Ganesh festival celebrations for citizens following Covid-appropriate norms and restrictions. The city allowed schools to reopen for Grades 8 to 12 to reopen on October 4, with religious places allowed to start functioning from October 7. This week, the BMC is also expected to allow reopening of colleges, cinema halls and live-entertainment auditoriums in the city. However, the BMC anticipates that even if a third wave hits the city, it will be milder than the second wave when Mumbai reported around 10,000 cases a day. Kakani said, “The period till December 31 is crucial, but we will observe it in phases. In the first phase, the impact of spread due to festivals and relaxations will be known by November 20. In the second phase, there will be New Year and Christmas celebrations which will have to be monitored, too. There is a possibility of international passengers arriving in Mumbai as many have long leave during Christmas and New Year. If there are more social gatherings during this period, it may result in a spike.” According to BMC officials, however, the chances of a spike will have to be viewed in tandem with the city’s vaccination status. The city has 9.2 million eligible adults, of which around 97% have received their first dose and 55% are fully vaccinated. By the end of October, the BMC aims to vaccinate every eligible citizen with the first dose. Civic officials pointed out that with so many festive days ahead, testing and vaccination may reduce as people may not visit a lab or a hospital for either, unless it is completely unavoidable. Until Saturday, 13,435,419 vaccine doses had been administered in the city of which 4,833,869 citizens were fully vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-reports-zero-covid-19-deaths-on-sunday-101634484986833.html

17-10-2021||Other||{2015 sacrilege cases} DGP forms new special team to trace three dera members; withdraws order||Faridkot A day after forming a four-member team for a ‘special operation’ in connection with the sacrilege cases, Punjab director general of police (DGP) Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota has withdrawn his order. Sources said the new team was to be tasked with tracing ‘three absconding members’ of the Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda’s national committee, who are accused in sacrilege cases of Guru Granth Sahib in 2015.The decision (to form a new team) had caused consternation among officers as it was being seen as an attempt to undermine the power of the special investigation team (SIT), led by IG Surinder Pal Singh Parmar, that was already probing sacrilege cases.  The three absconding members of the dera’s national committee — Pardeep Kler, Harsh Dhuri and Sandeep Breta — remain untraced, after they were named as accused in 2018 in the Moga sacrilege case. They were nominated as accused in the Bargari sacrilege case earlier this by the SIT-led by IG Parmar. The SIT claims that the instructions to execute sacrilege at Bargari, Moga and Gurusar were given by the three to the district dera committee members. The trio was purportedly in direct contact with the sect headquarters for hatching the conspiracy. In the absence of the ‘linking evidence,’ the SIT has not gone for the questioning of dera Sirsa head Gurmeet Ram Rahim. After the retirement of IG Ranbir Singh Khatra in April, IG Parmar had recommended the name of DIG Bhullar to be nominated as a member of the SIT probing the sacrilege cases. However, no new member has been appointed even after six months.In May, the Parmar-led SIT had arrested six dera followers in connection with two sacrilege cases wherein torn pages of a ‘bir’ (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib was found scattered at Bargari on October 12, 2015, and derogatory posters were pasted at Bargari and Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village on September 25, 2015. In July, the SIT filed a charge-sheet against the accused. A supplementary charge-sheet in the case of theft of a ‘bir’ from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village is pending.PATIALA RANGE LAW AND ORDER REVIEWEDPatiala The state DGP, Sahota, also meet SSPs falling in Patiala Range to review the policing and law and order situation in this territory. Patiala IG Mukhwinder Singh Chhina was also present in the meeting. With assembly elections to be held next year, the DGP asked the SSPs to adopt a zero tolerance policy against the smuggling of drugs. He told the force that chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi had ordered that unscrupulous or corrupt police officers were not to be spared. He added district police heads were to dispose of the pending cases at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2015-sacrilege-cases-dgp-forms-4-member-team-to-trace-three-absconding-dera-followers-101634483182003.html
17-10-2021||Lucknow||Akhilesh Yadav attacks BJP over Nitin Agarwal filing nomination for deputy speaker post||Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party over SP MLA Nitin Agarwal filing his nomination for the deputy speaker’s post in the Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly with the support of the ruling party.“Which party does the candidate put up by the BJP belong to?” he asked.Nitin Agarwal was a minister of state in SP chief Akhilesh Yadav’s government. He, along with his father Naresh Agarwal, joined the BJP in 2018. The SP’s petition seeking Nitin Agarwal’s disqualification was rejected recently and he, technically, continues to be an SP MLA even after joining the BJP.“What can be expected of a government which inaugurates already inaugurated projects, and lays the foundation stone of the projects, for which the foundation stone has already been laid?” the SP chief asked.Akhilesh Yadav also said the BJP government “has no work to do except changing names (of places or the projects of the previous government).”In a play on words, he said, “Uttar Pradesh needs a ‘yogya’ (competent) government and not a Yogi government.” The Samajwadi Party chief was speaking at a press conference at the party headquarters in Lucknow soon after former Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) state president RS Kushwaha and former MP Kadir Rana joined the SP.Akhilesh Yadav reiterated his party’s demand for a caste census. When the Congress was in power at the Centre, Netaji (Mulayam Singh Yadav), RJD (Rashtriya Janata Dal) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav and Sharad Yadav had demanded that a caste census be done, he said.The Samajwadi Party chief also attacked the BJP government over the rising prices of petrol, diesel and LPG.“At a number of places, the price of petrol has crossed ₹100 per litre, and the public is forced to buy everything at a higher price. The prices of diesel and LPG cylinders have also increased. Do they have an answer to this?” he asked.The Samajwadi Party chief, who has claimed that his party will win 400 seats in the 2022 UP assembly elections, said: “It has been heard that the BJP is going to deny tickets to its 150 MLAs. In the past, 100 MLAs protested in the state assembly against chief minister Yogi Adityanath. We already have 50 MLAs. So, the calculation is simple. We have crossed 300 seats already.”(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/akhilesh-yadav-attacks-bjp-over-nitin-agarwal-filing-nomination-for-deputy-speaker-post-101634482702709.html
17-10-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh deputy speaker election: Backed by BJP, plain sailing likely for Nitin Agarwal||The stage is set for a direct contest between the BJP government’s nominee Nitin Agarwal, technically a Samajwadi Party (SP) MLA, and the main opposition SP’s Narendra Verma for the election to the post of deputy speaker of the Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly here on Monday.It is likely to be plain sailing for Agarwal, 40, in the election to the post of deputy speaker view of the BJP’s large majority (315 plus with allies and independents) in the 403-member Uttar Pradesh assembly that has seven vacancies.“We are going to have voting for election to the deputy speaker’s post after paying homage to former chief minister Kalyan Singh and others in the House at 11am. A decision in this regard was taken at the meeting of business advisory committee here on Sunday,” said UP legislative assembly speaker Hriday Narayan Dikshit.Nitin Agarwal was a minister of state in SP chief Akhilesh Yadav’s government. He, along with his father Naresh Agarwal, joined the BJP in 2018. The SP’s petition seeking Nitin Agarwal’s disqualification was rejected recently and he, technically, continues to be an SP MLA even after joining the BJP.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath who, along with minister for parliamentary affairs Suresh Khanna, accompanied Nitin Agarwal for the filing of nomination papers, said traditionally the post of deputy speaker was reserved for the main opposition party. He said the BJP has followed the tradition and accepted the Samajwadi Party leader as the candidate for the post.The BJP, by fielding Agarwal, wants to give a positive message to the Vaish community whose representative the then finance minister Rajesh Agarwal resigned amid indications that he was being dropped ahead of the Yogi ministry’s reshuffle on August 21, 2019. Verma, 57, on the other hand, was accompanied by six BSP rebels and senior Samajwadi Party leaders, including leader of opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary. He said the deputy speaker’s post should go to the main opposition party. Agarwal was like a younger brother to him, but had joined the BJP, he added. Verma alleged the BJP government was violating all democratic norms. The Samajwadi Party has 49 MLAs in the House and hopes for cross-voting from the BJP and BSP camps too. The SP has obviously fielded Verma, a Kurmi leader, to give the message that the party is a well-wisher of the Other Backward Classes (OBCs). Chaudhary said the SP was working out a strategy and he would not like to share the same at this stage. He also said the deputy speaker’s post was given to the main opposition and if the government agreed to this the SP candidate would get elected unopposed.“We are also getting ready for voting,” said Chaudhary.Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Aradhna Mishra ‘Mona’ said the party would take a call on supporting a candidate after consulting the high command soon. Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) legislature party leader Shah Alam aka Guddu Jamali was not available for comment. The Apna Dal (Sonelal), a BJP ally, has also requested the BJP government to field a Dalit or an OBC leader for the deputy speaker’s post. Senior Apna Dal (S) leaders were, however, not available for comment on the issue.“Yes, traditionally the post should have gone to a leader of the SP. The BJP is supporting Nitin Agarwal, who has left the Samajwadi Party and joined the BJP. This is politics being pursued ahead of the 2022 assembly election,” said Professor SK Dwivedi, former head of the department of political science, Lucknow University.This is not for the first time that an election is being held for the post of deputy speaker in the Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly.There have been occasions when the state assembly voted to elect a deputy speaker in the past. On September 14, 1984, the late Hukum Singh, who was the minister for parliamentary affairs in the Congress government and later joined the BJP, was elected to the post securing 292 out of 319 votes polled. Two votes were declared invalid while the opposition candidate Riyasat Hussain got only 25 votes.Senior Congress leader and the then chief minister late Narain Dutt Tiwari said in the House he was feeling sad to hear the accusations that the opposition was not consulted before the election. Tiwari said consultations were held on the issue 10 to 12 times. Tiwari said he was still ready for consultations in the next five minutes though he would like to ensure that the election was completed now.“It is not proper that Uttar Pradesh assembly, an important House, does not have a deputy speaker. If you want, we are still ready for consultations,” he said.The opposition, however, insisted that the government did not have any consultation with any leader of the opposition parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-deputy-speaker-election-backed-by-bjp-plain-sailing-likely-for-nitin-agarwal-101634480601898.html

17-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai coastal road project: Koli fishing port to face permanent closure?||Cleveland Bunder is one of four artisanal fish landing centres in Worli Koliwada, which is one of Mumbai’s earliest fishing villages, in existence since before the Seven Islands of Bombay were merged through successive land reclamation projects in the 19th century. Now, fisherfolk say, the bunder is under serious threat of permanent closure due to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) coastal road project (CRP), arguably the city’s next frontier in land reclamation. Aaditya Thackeray, cabinet minister for environment and climate change (and MLA representing Worli constituency) did not respond to requests for comment. As of date, Koli community leaders estimate that Cleveland Bunder supports at least a fourth of around 500 families in Worli Koliwada who still rely entirely on artisanal fishing as a source of income. It provides harbour for a varying fleet of motorised and non-motorised boats, which range between 45 to 60 on any given day, and also employs several migrant fish workers in addition to the Kolis.Those operating from the bunder – locals estimate it to be at least 100 years old – may soon find themselves unable to access their customary fishing grounds. A barrier to their movement, in the form of an interchange bridge to connect the CRP with the Bandra-Worli Sea Link (BWSL) is on the anvil. MCGM recently began preparing to construct this segment of the controversial infra project, prompting nearly 200 boats from across the Worli fishing zone to gherao a temporary jetty at the CRP construction site on October 14.The plan and problems faced by fisherfolkThe civic body plans to construct two connecting bridges between the south-end of the BWSL and the north end of the CRP, as part of a link that will allow traffic to flow seamlessly between the two. Like BWSL before it, fisherfolk said this interchange will run parallel to Cleveland Bunder and severely constrict the only navigational route available to boats venturing out to open seas.As fishing boats leave the harbour, they traverse a narrow, zig-zag path to their fishing grounds which extend from the north near Mot Mauli (or Mount Mary) in Bandra to Walkeshwar in south Mumbai. The boats pass between two pillars (about 30 metres apart) that support the Bandra-Worli Sea Link overhead.Both the inter-tidal and sub-tidal areas of the beach are extremely rocky, and this route needs to be manoeuvred with great skill to prevent accidents. “We have been using the same navigation route for generations. After the Bandra Worli Sea Link came up, the route has become narrower and we have to be very careful,” says Rupesh Patil, member of the Worli Koliwada Nakhwa Vyavsay Sahakari Society.Unlike cars on the road, steering a boat in open water is more complicated, with the wind and waves playing a major role in the safety of the vessel and its passengers. “One strong gust of wind can send our boats crashing against the pillars. It happened to many boats when BWSL was being constructed. Also, more than one boat cannot pass through the span at a given time. The pillars have slowed us down and made it an everyday risk just to reach our fishing grounds,” explains Deepak Vasudev, a fourth-generation artisanal fisherman from Worli Koliwada.As per the design plans for phase 2 of CRP — from Baroda Palace at Haji Ali to BWSL — another four pillars are to be erected directly within this precarious navigation route, which is used by fishermen every day. BMC has proposed to leave a gap of 60 metres between these pillars, which fisherfolk say is simply too little.“We require a span of at least 200 metres between the pillars to ensure safe passage. There is no doubt that if BMC continues as per their original plans, we will have to shut down Cleveland Bunder entirely. There will be no use for the boats because we won’t be able to take them out,” says Nitesh Patil, director of the Worli Koliwada Nakhwa Vyavsay Sahakari Society (WKNVSS). Patil emphasised that they have appealed to multiple authorities to consider redesigning the interchange.Not a recent demand The first time that fisherfolk at Worli Koliwada raised the issue of their navigational channel dates back to at least October 2016, followed by representations sent to MCGM, fisheries department and various other arms of the state government in April 2017, November and December 2018. In yet another, dated October 2020, Vijay Kishor Patil (WKNVSS chairman), wrote, “The construction of two additional bridges in front of Cleveland Bunder... will completely cut off our access to the sea and nearshore areas which comprise our fishing zone.”“It is therefore imperative that the design is changed and that the distance (between the proposed pillars for the CR-BWSL interchange) is increased to at least 200 metres as we have highlighted in countless representations in the past,” the letter continues. Over a year and at least two more such representations later, fisherfolk say they have not received any formal acknowledgement of their concerns, from any authority.“We have met all sorts of officials to discuss this matter many, many times. All we are told is that adequate compensation will be given to project-affected persons. But that is not what we want. We want to continue fishing and there is no way we can do that if these pillars come up. What trade will we teach our children?” questions Marshal Koli, a resident of Worli Koliwada and a spokesperson for the Akhil Maharashtra Machimaar Kruti Samiti, a state-wide fish workers union.Work in progressThe predicament, which has loomed over Cleveland Bunder for the past several years, is fast coming to a head. On October 14, the Hindustan Construction Company (which is tasked with building Package 2 of the CRP, from Baroda Palace at Haji Ali to BWSL) anchored three buoys in the fishing waters just off Cleveland Bunder, to facilitate the movement of barges and tugboats in the area.“The anchors are there to support barges that will carry construction materials and machinery from our jetty to the construction site. We are just about to start digging the foundations of the bridge. It is the final arm of the coastal road’s southern stretch and is scheduled for completion by 2023,” an official with the BMC’s coastal roads department confirmed to HT on the day. However, when asked for a comment regarding the fishermen’s navigation route, the official declined to comment — as did two others who are directly involved in the project. Vijay Nighot, chief engineer in the BMC’s coastal roads department, said, “There will be no redesign of the interchange”.HT also reached out to officials in the fisheries department but did not receive a response in the matter. Former fisheries minister Aslam Shaikh, whom fisherfolk have written to directly, could not be reached for comment despite attempts. However, an official (formerly occupying the post of district fisheries officer), said while seeking anonymity, “It is up to BMC to take appropriate steps as the coastal road is their project. It is not the fisheries department’s job to intervene in these disputes. The Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute has already conducted a social impact assessment for the project and a survey has been commissioned by from Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) to give the fishers proper compensation.”Demand for a design change to continue Shweta Wagh, an architect and researcher who has been closely mapping the impact of the CRP on fishing communities in Worli, remarked that reclamation has already grievously affected the livelihood of the community and that their demands can be easily accommodated through a design change. Given that physical works on the bridge have not yet commenced, and that the coastal road itself has been subject to design changes including the addition of 21 hectares of reclaimed land, a modification is certainly possible, Wagh claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-coastal-road-project-koli-fishing-port-to-face-permanent-closure-101634477001367.html
17-10-2021||Mumbai||Pune land deal case against Khadse: Sub-registrar gets bail; deed not undervalued, says court||While giving bail to the sub-registrar in the Pune land deal case registered against senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Eknath Khadse and his wife Mandakini, a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court has observed that prima facie it does not appear that the sale deal registered in 2016 was undervalued to pay the stamp duty. The court also observed that there was a lack of material showing any connivance or meeting of minds of accused with each other, and actual involvement in any process connected with the proceeds of crime, including concealment, acquisition or use etc.Additional sessions judge, HS Sathbhai had granted bail to Ravindra Muley, a sub-registrar from Haveli, Pune on October 4.Advocate Mohan Tekavade had appeared for Muley and had argued that there was no loss to the state exchequer due to the registration of the agreement, the no-objection certificate (NOC) of MIDC was not required and the section of PMLA was not applicable in the case.In the detailed order, the court has said that from the material available on record, it is not established prima facie that prior to April 28, 2016 — the date of registration of land — accused Muley was a part of a conspiracy with alleged accused Eknath Khadse, Mandakini and son-in-law Girish Chaudhari. There are allegations of assisting the other accused or knowingly operating all the activities of using proceeds of crime for sale transaction, the material on record is not substantial to attract sections 3 and 4 of PMLA Act for money-laundering and punishment for money laundering.A specific charge against the accused Muley states that while working in the capacity as sub-registrar, he misused his position and registered the instrument sale deal showing a value of only ₹3.75 crores, which was originally valued at ₹22.83 crores. He also ignored the rights of MIDC over the land and did not insist on the NOC of MIDC, while registering the instrument.The judge observed a perusal of the papers of complaint and observed that the consideration shown was ₹3.75 crores, as per ready reckoner of the state government; however, the land was fetching the value of ₹22.83 crores. It appears that on the reckoner, the stamp duty of ₹1.37 crores was paid by the person who presented the document to Muley for registration. The judge stated that appropriate stamp duty of ₹1.37 crores was paid at the rate of 6% of market value on the deal. The judge further added prima facie appears no loss has been caused to the state exchequer; Muley cannot be blamed because the executors of the sale deal showed the consideration value as only ₹3.75 crores.The special judge further observed that the name of MIDC was not appearing in the ownership column of the land in question. The name of only one Abbas Ukani was appearing. Prima facie, it is not shown by the complainant that for registering the instrument, prior permission or NOC of MIDC was required. A perusal of the Registration Act, 1908, that the registration officer is not required to verify the title of the transferor, the judge said.He added that when the name of MIDC was not appearing in the ownership column of the land, of which, the sale deal came from registration before Muley and name of MIDC was appearing in the other right column of 7/12 extract, there was no propriety to ask for any NOC of MIDC, before registering the document.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had alleged through counsel Hiten Venegoankar and Kavita Patil that Muley had misused his position and in connivance with other accused registered the instrument sale deal of land having a value of ₹22.83 crores by showing its market value at ₹3.75 crores. While registering he also did not take into account the rights of MIDC and did not insist on the NOC of MIDC, before registering the document.On September 4, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had filed a charge sheet, naming Eknath Khadse, Mandakini, son-in-law Girish Chaudhari, sub-registrar Ravindra Muley and Benchmark Buildcon Private Limited as accused in the Bhosari (Pune) land deal case.The court had taken cognizance of ED’s charge sheet and had issued a process against the accused to appear before it, after which Muley was taken into custody by the court.The anti-corruption bureau (ACB) had registered a first information report against Khadse, Mandakini, Chaudhari and the original landowner Abbas Ukani on HC’s directions. However, the agency and Pune Police later closed the case. It is alleged that when Khadse was the revenue minister in 2016, he used his position to manipulate the actual market price of the land, and it cost the state exchequer a loss of ₹61.25 crore. ED had alleged that Chaudhari and Khadse bought the land for ₹3.75 crore when its actual price was ₹22.83 crores.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pune-land-deal-case-against-khadse-sub-registrar-gets-bail-deed-not-undervalued-says-court-101634476821378.html

Talking against the former chief minister and making allegations show his irresponsible behaviour," said Khan.The Congress leader said that Siddaramaiah has done everything for the benefit of the minority community, and alleged that JDS chief HD Devegowda does not have any concern towards the minority community."There were chances in Hassan and Ramanagara where Muslim candidates could have won the elections but he did not give tickets to minority candidates in Hassan and Ramanagara. And, now he is making allegations. Why could not he give a ticket to the grandson of former union minister Jaffer Sharief in Mandya instead of his son? It is the silly family politics," he added.HD Kumaraswamy earlier made allegations that Congress and Siddaramaiah are trying to destroy the minorities in Karnataka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/announce-muslim-candidate-as-cm-face-in-k-taka-cong-mla-challenges-kumaraswamy-101634475744713.html
17-10-2021||Chandigarh||‘Fewer cases of stubble burning in Haryana this time’, says Manohar Lal Khattar||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Sunday said that the government has asked industries to use stubble for producing ethanol in a bid to stop farmers from burning the crop residue, which results in severe deterioration of air quality.“This time there are fewer cases of stubble burning. At some places those who are doing it, we are taking strict action against them,” Khattar added.The Haryana government has engineered a strategy to prevent farm fires during the paddy stubble burning season. Over 34 lakh acres are engaged in harvesting paddy crops in the state.The government has offered monetary incentives to farmers, introduced staggered paddy harvesting, created awareness through various campaigns, and panchayats have passed zero stubble burning resolutions to discourage farmers from burning crop residue.The government has also tied up with gaushalas, packaging companies, brick kilns, paper making and furniture industries to help utilise the crop residue. “The government is providing ₹1,000 per acre to farmers and industries are also coming to buy stubble this time,” Khattar told reporters and reiterated that they “will not let the pollution increase”.For 2021-22, ₹141 crore has been released under the crop residue management (CRM) scheme. The government is also planning on putting to use an additional previously unspent amount of ₹58 crores for stubble management this year.The ministry of environment, forest and climate change said on Friday that paddy residue burning has gone down by 18.28% in Haryana, in comparison to the same time last year. The state has reported 487 paddy burning incidents in comparison to 596 such incidents reported last year, the ministry added.The three districts of Karnal, Kaithal, and Kurukshetra account for 80% of stubble burning incidents in the state. The state government put 922 hotspot villages, 199 in the red zone and 723 in the yellow zone, under active monitoring. Fatehabad, Kaithal, Jind, Karnal, Sirsa and Kurukshetra districts were put under a red alert. All red and yellow zone farmers were given permission to buy crop residue management machines this year.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fewer-cases-of-stubble-burning-in-haryana-this-time-says-mohar-lal-khattar-101634472875659.html

17-10-2021||Lucknow||Key rituals of Bade Hanuman temple, Baghamabari Gaddi Math in Prayagraj to be streamed live soon||All religious events and discourses of Baghambari Gaddi Math, besides aarti as well as other ceremonies of the Bade Hanuman temple in Prayagraj would be streamed live on YouTube.Swami Balbeer Giri, the newly appointed Mahant (head priest) of the Baghambari Gaddi Math and successor of Mahant Narendra Giri, is taking the initiative for the live streaming of events. He will soon launch a YouTube channel that will also show recordings of all important religious ceremonies of the Baghambari Gaddi Math and the Bade Hanuman temple. Content would be uploaded on the channel on a regular basis, Math officials said.The step is being seen by many as an effort of the newly appointed Mahant to resume the task of propagating the Sanatan Dharma after weeks of turbulence following the death of Akhil Bhartiya Akhada Parishad (ABAP) chief and Baghambari Gaddi Math head Mahant Narendra Giri, who was found hanging in his room on September 20.“The clips of puja at Bade Hanuman temple were uploaded on YouTube in the past too, but only intermittently. Now we will be uploading content for the devotees on a regular basis on the dedicated YouTube channel that will also live stream events from time to time, of both the Bade Hanuman temple, the Math and the Lord Baghambeshwar Mahadev temple of Lord Shiva located within the Math,” said Mahant Balbeer Giri, who took charge of the Math and the Bade Hanuman temple on October 5 after a grand anointment ceremony. “We perform abhishek daily at the Lord Baghambeshwar Mahadev temple and this will be shown on the YouTube channel for the very first time. Likewise, on all major festivals and auspicious days, various religious activities are performed at the Math, which too would be shared with the people through this channel,” he said. Balbeer Giri said that some of the events that the people would be able to see online include Akhand Shat Chandi Path performed during Navratris, the bhandara or community meal held on Guru Purnima and the abhishek of Lord Shiva during the pious month of Shravan (the fifth month of the Hindu solar calendar).“We plan to also showcase the Vedic mantra recitation by the batuks or child scholars enrolled in Shri Mahant Vicharanand Sanskrit Mahavidyalaya, also located on Baghamabari Gaddi Math campus, through the channel,” he said.“Though all saints and senior workers of the Math and the priests of the Bade Hanuman temple, who are tech savvy would help in content generation, the rights to manage the content upload on the YouTube channel would be handled by me and one other person only. This is being done to ensure that only appropriate and befitting content that would evoke good interest among the devotees gets uploaded,” Balbeer Giri said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/key-rituals-of-bade-hanuman-temple-baghamabari-gaddi-math-in-prayagraj-to-be-streamed-live-soon-101634468481195.html
17-10-2021||Pune||Curtain Call: Allow theatres to operate at 100% occupancy||Theatres are reopening at long last in Maharashtra! Just a week more. I have met many people who asked me how I am feeling about this, since it has been a long wait. It certainly has! But I still didn’t have a concrete answer to “how am I feeling about this?”. The government has issued SoPs to restart cinema halls and theatres at 50% capacity. I have a Marathi film which is ready and awaiting release since the past one year. Before anyone asks why we did not release it on an OTT platform, which is the norm these days, I would like to inform them that it is not entirely in the hands of the producers. Also, the demand from OTT platforms for regional films is not that high. So, I am happy that cinema halls are reopening. Once the date of reopening was declared, my theatre group also went ahead and booked venues for performances. We started planning for the shows in excitement and realised that there is no way we can cover our per show expenses! We went through our expenses line by line, trying to cut corners wherever we can. But we have been cutting corners for the past ten years now. We know the drill well. But even with all this, the probability of a financial loss was high. Granted, that we are a non-profit group and the only intention is to present as many good performances that we can. But there is no way we can survive at 50% capacity. Especially at smaller venues. I spoke to other theatre groups and producers, who work at an amateur and commercial level. And everyone is facing the same problem. It is even worse for producers of commercial plays! Their team depends on the collection from the performances for their livelihood. The past year and a half have forced everyone to take up alternate professions. Many have taken up farming, selling vegetables, catering, driving or whatever can earn money for their family. There was some help from the government and NGOs, but I think everyone understands that there is only so much that others can do. Once we realised that there was going to be a loss because of 50% capacity, we reached out to the venue authorities and checked if we could save on rent expenses. But they explained that they have to incur maintenance costs and salaries of their staff as well. Salaries, which they (thankfully) paid when the theatres were shut. So, the only option is to increase ticket prices. But how much of a burden can we pass on to the audience? We cannot double our ticket prices, that would be unfair! And, also a poor move. The number of people who will come to watch the show will dwindle even further. It is a textbook catch-22 situation. I do think that the government has absolutely no vision for artists and the art. What our leaders should realise is that any particular place is known in the world because of its art. Whether it is architecture, gastronomy, museums, theatre, music. Unfortunately, that is being ignored here and is being allowed to die a slow death. Even an artist turned Minister of Parliament, Mr Amol Kolhe - who belongs to one of the ruling parties – has written a letter to the honourable chief minister regarding this. Cinemas can have multiple hundred shows at a time. It is difficult, but still, they can survive the 50% capacity clause in some way. But for theatre, it is impossible. Either the government should increase the seating capacity or should help the venues by providing some sort of a subsidy on rent. Just yesterday, I was stuck in a traffic jam because there was a crowd of people of the road who had visited a temple on the occasion of Dussehra. Multiple people were going through a metal detector at one time, pushing and pulling each other. At that time, I had an answer to the question “How are you feeling about theatres reopening?” – “I don’t know. I just don’t know”. Nipun Dharmadhikari is a storyteller and looks forward to telling them on stage, in front of the camera or in person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/curtain-call-allow-theatres-to-operate-at-100-occupancy-101634467700217.html
17-10-2021||Pune||Your Space: Bandh, a democratic right, should not hit normal life||We have seen a lot of bandhs during the Covid pandemic. Several business operators are merely surviving and trying to keep their trade floating. I think it is unwise to again ask them to shut shop even for a day. We sympathise with the cause, but political parties need to find other ways to stage protests when continuous lockdowns have bled all sectors. Bandhs are not the way anymore. Businesses have suffered a great deal of loss during the lockdowns and they mostly cooperated with the authorities when they were ordered to shut shops. Such type of bandhs promoted by politicians irrespective of any political party would demoralise the business operators. We need to understand that it is just not about the shop owner. Many workers are also dependent on this sector. As the threat of a Covid third wave is still upon us, businesses should not have any restrictions and should be allowed to operate with maximum capacity before the possible wave hits us. Ankit Banpurkar Protest essential part of democracy The bandh was just for a day and all the essential services were allowed to operate. It is important to show solidarity with the victims. Non-violent protest is an essential part of democracy and sometimes certain issues need more attention. Santosh Nangare Bandh should not hit normal life It is a different situation when people by their own will decide to call a bandh. However, forcing it after the lockdowns does not seem appropriate. Bandh is indeed a non-violent form of protest, but it should not be misused and overused again and again. Many business operators have already suffered and are trying to revive trade during the unlock phase. I agree that some issues are extremely important and need public attention, but not at the cost of livelihood and public inconvenience. Adhishree Kulkarni Bandhs help to highlight injustice The recent bandh helped in sending across a strong message of solidarity. It is important that people know what has happened. Usually in a peaceful bandh, essential services are not affected. So, the daily lives of people are not hampered. Sometimes markets observe voluntary bandhs to highlight their issues. The issue of injustice reached people and many became aware of what really had happened. We should not shield injustice. It only gives strength to the oppressor. It is a collective responsibility of society to stand for each other and fight for justice. Amogh Dhamale Strikes affect businesses Traders and shop owners are responsible citizens and they have always cooperated with the administration and other stakeholders in society. That is why shops were closed for half of the day. There is a need to understand the needs and challenges faced by businesses as well.

17-10-2021||Patna||Campaigning set to pick up post puja for high-stake battle in Bihar’s Kusheshwarsthan||Bihar is witnessing two types of elections - a by-poll for two assembly seats and panchayat elections. While the stakes are high for the two assembly seats for both the Janata Dal-United (JD-U) and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), the panchayat elections, though not held on party lines in Bihar, too, have high-stake engagement, as is reflected through the scale of campaigning.Cars, SUVs, auto-rickshaws, hand carts, all been moving around announcing the claims of their candidates to transform the rural landscape like cities, with school pick up facilities for children, roads, hospitals, community centres, electricity, etc. Promises are raining. Durga Puja provided the opportunity for candidates to make their visibility more pronounced and connect with the migrants who have arrived and are likely to stay at least till Chhath or beyond.“Stakes are high this time, as funds for a lot of government schemes are now routed through the panchayati raj institutions. This has resulted in a higher number of candidates vying for posts. In rural areas, people are still largely ignorant and look up to local Councilors, mukhiya and other panchayat representatives for everything, be it the inclusion of name for old age or disability pension, Kisan Samman Yojana or crop loss compensation or just anything,” said Manoj Kumar, a labourer in Darbhanga’s village Kurson. But he, too, has his eyes on Kusheshwarsthan by-poll, which he feels could be a prestige battle.Barely a few kilometres from there, on the smooth road to pilgrim place Kusheshahwarsthan, the mood changes, with heavy security keeping watch on vehicles passing through and carrying out routine checks. The deployment of security personnel makes the importance of Kusheshahwarsthan amply clear, where Congress has also fielded its candidate defying the RJD diktat. The fissures in the Opposition rank, with Congress veteran Ashok Ram’s son Atirek Kumar jumping in the fray, may appear to fritter away advantage, but JD-U is not ready to be complacent even a wee bit, as it has pushed its top leaders into campaigning. Union minister and former JD-U president RCP Singh, whose ministry has included Chirag Paswan in its committee to spring a surprise, is also on the star campaigners’ list, while the party’s general secretary and state minister Sanjay Jha has been virtually camping there.With puja over, the campaigning by top NDA leaders is likely to gather momentum, with chief minister Nitish Kumar scheduled to join in the last leg. Before that, former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi, education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary, VIP Party’s Madan Shahni and other senior leaders of the NDA will build the momentum. “JD-U has the edge because people have faith in Nitish Kumar as a leader who walks the talk, who delivers and who is head and shoulder above the rest. I have spent days in Kusheshwarsthan and I can feel the pulse a bit. Migrants coming to Kusheshwarsthan from far off places, alighting at Darbhanga airport and having a jerk-free ride to their homes narrate the difference. The experience of travelling 16 years ago is still a terse reminder to them. Even during the flood, the CM himself reached out to them by boat and ensured that they got relief without delay. Flood is not new to the area, but the changed response of the government is what has won people’s trust,” said Jha.In RJD, the responsibility rests on the shoulders of Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, as party chief Lalu Prasad is unlikely to make it. To make things more complicated, there is speculation that his sulking brother Tej Pratap Yadav would campaign for Congress candidate Atirek and that could be a reason why Lalu Prasad has decided to stay away from the family drama. Former CM Rabri Devi is, however, back. Tejashwi, on the other hand, is gunning to pick up from where he left during the Assembly election, playing up youth issues like unemployment and corruption in a bid to corner the government, as he did in the Bihar Assembly. “Unemployment, corruption and poor condition of the state will be the key issues in the by-election and the people will certainly show the mirror to the double-engine government, which has delivered nothing,” he said on his arrival in Patna, hinting that Lalu Prasad’s frail health may not allow him to come to Patna despite his strong desire.In Kusheshwarsthan, there are eight candidates in the fray, including Chirag Paswan’s LJP (Ramvilas) candidate Anju Devi. It will be interesting to see which way Chirag cuts votes this time. Last time, he was openly against the JD-U. The LJP is known for its influence in the area, but this time Chirag’s uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras is with the NDA. Another interesting aspect is that former MP Pappu Yadav’s Jan Adhikar Party (JAP) has fielded Yogi Choupal from there, while his wife Ranjita Ranjan is the Congress observer for Kusheshwarsthan. But the contest is likely to be mainly among JD-U’s Aman Bhushan Hazari, son of late Shashi Bhushan Hazari, RJD’s Ganesh Bharti and Congress’ Atirek Kumar, while others could play spoilers for any of them in an electoral battle that could have serious ramifications on state politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/campaigning-set-to-pick-up-post-puja-for-high-stake-battle-in-bihar-s-kusheshwarsthan-101634466561526.html
17-10-2021||Lucknow||‘BJP govt working in the wrong direction’: Akhilesh Yadav on India’s global hunger index ranking, malnourishment in UP||Samajwadi Party (SP) supremo Akhilesh Yadav hit out at the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Uttar Pradesh over India’s ranking in the global hunger index (GHI).“Central government said we will make a 5 trillion economy, the UP government said it will make one trillion economy but India is behind Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal in the Hunger Index,” Yadav said at a press conference.He also alleged that the presence of the highest number of malnourished children in UP shows “that the BJP govt is working in the wrong direction”.Yadav was referring to the 2021 global Hunger index rankings in which India slipped to the 101st position out of 116 countries from its 94th position of 2020. Neighbouring countries Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and coup-hit Myanmar in spite of being included in the ‘alarming’ hunger category have fared better than India. The report was published by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, a German non-profit.The Indian government called the report, which was based on estimates by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, “unscientific”, and claimed the assessment was done by an American firm that conducts global opinion polls. Welthungerhilfe has however denied claims of the report being based on an opinion poll.The Union government has come under heavy criticism from opposition parties for India’s fall in GHI.It is not clear which report Yadav was referring to when he claimed Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of malnourished children in the country, but Union minister for women and child development, Smriti Irani, had informed the Rajya Sabha in July that UP accounts for over 40% severely acute malnourished children in the country."As per ICDS-RRS (Rapid Reporting System) Portal, as on 30th November, 2020, 9,27,606 severely acute malnourished (SAM) children (6 months - 6 years) have been identified in the country, out of which 3,98,359 are from the State of Uttar Pradesh," Irani told Rajya Sabha in response to a question.Yadav also touched on the topic of caste census during the press conference, stating that “SP wants caste census to happen”.He also took a dig at his 2017 assembly poll coalition partner Congress, and claimed that political leaders like his father and the erstwhile party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Lalu Yadav, and many other prominent leaders from South India wanted a caste census to be carried out during the tenure of the Congress-led government “but that did not happen”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-govt-working-in-the-wrong-direction-akhilesh-yadav-on-india-s-global-hunger-index-ranking-malnourishment-in-up-101634465455544.html

He was recently released on bail in the infamous kidnapping and murder of ANM Bhanwari Devi. He was suffering from cancer and died at 7.44 am on Saturday. His daughter, Divya Maderna, is a sitting MLA from Osian assembly seat in Rajasthan. Maderna was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and after long judicial custody, he was out on bail for treatment. Several leaders, including chief minister Ashok Gehlot, condoled his demise. “Deep condolences on the demise of former minister and senior Congress leader Mahipal Maderna. I pray God to give strength to the family members to bear the shock and peace to the departed soul,” Gehlot tweeted. Former deputy CM, Sachin Pilot, tweeted, “The news of the demise of former minister Mahipal Maderna is extremely sad. My deepest sympathies are with the family of Maderna in this very difficult time. May God give peace to the departed soul and strength to the bereaved family to bear this loss.” Leader of Opposition, Gulab Chand Kataria, said, “Sad to hear about the passing away of Mahipal Maderna. May God grant the departed soul a place at his feet and strength to the family members to bear this loss.” Maderna was a cabinet minister in the Gehlot government. He was in jail for around 9 years in the Bhanwari Devi case. On August 24, he was granted bail by the High Court. Bhanwari Devi was a government nurse in Jodhpur. Maderna and former MLA Malkhan Singh allegedly had illicit relations with her and she was abducted and murdered in 2011.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/former-congress-minister-mahipal-maderna-passes-away-at-69-101634464940985.html

It will now be known as Mount Manipur, officials said.Union home minister Amit Shah made an announcement in this regard while addressing a public function at Port Blair in Andaman and Nicobar islands on Saturday.Shah said Manipur played a significant role in resisting the British in the Northeast during the 1857 revolution and in 1891. Manipur never gave up and the people there continued to fight. The state was the only one to implement its own constitution. Manipur war hero Yubraj Tikendrajit and General Thangal were publicly hanged in Fida, Imphal. The British thought that by hanging them, they had crushed the freedom movement but it did not happen. After that, Maharaja Kulachandra Dhwaja Singh and 22 freedom fighters were sent to Kalapani and kept on Mount Harriet. Today, in his memory, we would like to honour his contribution by renaming Mount Harriet Mount Manipur.Mount Harriet, the third-highest island peak in Andaman and Nicobar islands, where Manipur’s Maharaja Kulchandra Singh and 22 other freedom fighters were imprisoned during the Anglo-Manipuri war (1891).The Centre will also assist the Manipur government in constructing a memorial site at Mount Manipur in Andaman & Nicobar Islands.Expressing happiness on hearing the news, Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh tweeted, “In a fitting tribute to Maharaja Kulachandra & other Manipuri freedom fighters imprisoned at Mt Harriet in Kalapani, Hon’ HM Sh @AmitShah Ji has renamed Mt Harriet as Mt Manipur. We’re immensely thankful to PM @narendramodi Ji & Amit Shah Ji for such a great honour of our heroes.”In another tweet, Biren Singh said, “Further Hon’ HM Sh @AmitShah Ji has also announced that the Central Govt will assist Manipur in establishing a memorial site at Mt Manipur in Andaman Nicobar Island. The process for signing lease agreement between Andaman Government and Manipur Government is under process.”“Yet again, PM @narendramodi Ji & HM @AmitShah Ji has kindly given most befitting recognition to Manipur’s contribution to The Freedom Struggle, sealing for us a connection with national history. Indebted forever, Manipur salutes your leadership. Thank you,” he added.During this year’s patriot’s day observation in Manipur on August 13, the state government unveiled a monolith dedicated to the unsung heroes of the Anglo-Manipur war in 1891. As many as 21 names, including Maharaja Kulachandra, have been engraved on the monolith.In February 2003, an 18-member All Manipur Working Journalists’ Union visited Mount Harriet as part of their fortnight-long journey of tracing links with the past and called the then Lt Governor for the development of a memorial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mount-harriet-in-andaman-to-be-named-mount-manipur-in-tribute-to-freedom-fighters-101634462840801.html

17-10-2021||Patna||Bihar’s Purnia and Saharsa divisions fighting losing battle against drugs||On September 13, Sunny Sinha, a 22-year-old employee of a private bank, was knifed to death near his house at Barihat locality under Purnia town area of Bihar. He opposed drug addicts cum drug suppliers who were consuming the substance beside his house. Later, police arrested four accused - all drug peddlers cum addicts, said officials.On October 12, Deepak Kumar Thakur, a 23-year-old was allegedly stabbed several times by drug addicts cum suppliers. Later, his body was recovered from near his house at Chainpur village under Bangaon police station of Saharsa district. Police arrested three accused, all drug addicts. Notably, the village came into the limelight in 2018 when Sagar Kumar Jha, a resident, secured 13th rank in the UPSC exam. The twin divisions of Purnia and Saharsa have been fighting a long battle against the drug menace. Blame it on the porous Indo-Nepal border, lack of awareness about the repercussions of drug abuse, months’ lockdown or the lure of easy money, the youth as well as children are steadily falling prey to drug abuse and its harmful consequences. “Smack (heroin) is the new lifestyle chemical drug craze, especially among the youth and children not only in these two divisions but in the whole state,” a senior police officer of Purnia told HT.He said, “Day-to-day recovery of contraband and arrests of youths below 22 years of age has worried us and we are shocked to learn the number of people involved in the racket.”Purnia superintendent of police Daya Shankar vowed to eliminate the racket after the murder of Sunny Sinha but nothing has come out of it. Police acted swiftly and arrested four of the accused, all drug addicts and drug suppliers, within a week but the racket continues to thrive.“Special police teams have been set up to keep a watch on drug abusers and drug suppliers and our effort has started yielding results,” the officer said. He exhorted the people to cooperate with police teams.Kamlesh Kumar Singh, station house officer of Bangaon police station in Saharsa, confirmed the drug angle behind the killing of the youth in Chainpur village. “Police will launch special drive against both drug addicts and peddlers.”“We are unsafe as drug addicts can be seen roaming in the streets almost every time and commit petty to heinous crimes to buy smack,” Kumar Pratyush 23, a law graduate of Purnia said, adding, “Recently, my cycle was stolen from inside the premises of my rented house.” He said, “I have lodged an online complaint to district police in this regard but nothing has come out of it.”“It is a matter of deep sorrow that our villages and towns are fast falling prey to drugs,” Saharsa-based social activist Amit Anand said and demanded a concrete and concerted drive by police and intellectuals to check drug menace. He expressed dismay over the alleged killing of the youth in Chainpur village by drug suppliers/addicts.Anand said, “Both Purnia and Saharsa killings have the same nature and they show that drug addicts and suppliers can go to any extent to satisfy their craze for drugs.”He hoped Sagar Sabita Devi’s mother, who won Mukhiya election this time, would do something to check the spread of drug menace in her Chainpur panchayat.“My prime focus is to bring progress and prosperity, and without education, it is not possible. Hence, my priority will be to spread education”, she said, adding, “Through consistent awareness campaigns, this can be checked.” Heroin, commonly known as smack, is sold in roadside shops in rural areas and youths below 25 years of age, as well as school-going, children can be seen consuming smack. “During the lockdown, when schools and colleges were closed, these children and youths fell into the grip of drugs,” a retired high school teacher of Khamgarha village in Araria, Narendra Mohan Jha, said. “It is not easy for police to bring them back on track,” he said. Chemically, smack is diacetylmorphine, a white, odourless, bitter crystalline compound which is easily available in shops in rural areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihars-purnia-and-saharsa-divisions-fighting-losing-battle-against-drugs-101634454080210.html

17-10-2021||Bangalore||32 families evacuated after police building tilts in Bengaluru: Reports||A multi-storeyed residential building belonging to the police department in Bengaluru tilted on Sunday after cracks reportedly developed near its basement, following which 32 families were evacuated. According to reports, families living in the three-year-old building in the police housing complex near Binny Mills have now been shifted to the newly constructed police quarters in the city's Nagarbhavi area.WATCH | Bengaluru building razed earlier this month after foundation started to collapseReports said that the Karnataka state police housing corporation has already initiated a probe into Sunday's incident, but occupants, on the condition of anonymity, told reporters that the work undertaken by the contractor was “substandard”. It is likely that the situation was made worse by the recent heavy rainfall in the city — since the beginning of October, Bengaluru received 77% more rain at 140 mm as against the normal 79 mm — the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) said. Several areas across the city were inundated leaving homes, cars, and property submerged along with the lives and livelihoods of people residing in low-lying areas of the city.The commissioner of the Bengaluru civic body told reporters that in view of the situation in the recent weeks, officials have now identified as many as 300 buildings for “safe demolition”, all of which are deemed to be in precarious condition. However, the owners of these residential buildings have been asked to provide evidence that the structures are safe, without which the authorities will carry forward with the demolition.WATCH: Three-storey building dramatically collapses in BengaluruAs many as four buildings collapsed in Bengaluru during the past three weeks and one of them was demolished after it tilted precariously.

Thousands of people attended the festival organised the day after Dussehra. Bharat Milap, which reflects spirituality, antiquity and tradition, also carries forward the traditional legacy of the city. The festival began with the worship of Lord Rama, Sita and Laxman at Chitrakoot Ramlila Bhavan, few metres from the Imali Ground. Clad in white dhoti and undershirts with saffron gamachhas on their head, ‘Yadav Bandhus’ carried the chariot with those dressed as Lord Rama, Sita and Laxman, on their shoulders to the ground from the Bhavan. On the occasion, the spiritually charged people also chanted ‘Har Har Mahadev and ‘Jai Sri Ram’. As the chariot reached the ground, the priest offered prayers to Lord Rama, Sita, Laxman and Lord Hanuman. Kunwar Anant Narayan Singh, chief of the Kashi Royal family, also offered prayers to Lord Ram, Sita, Laxman and Hanuman amid chanting of mantras by priests. After the puja, he gave a gold coin to the priest like the previous years and then Lord Rama and Laxman met their brothers, Bharat and Shatrughan. Like the past year, the event also drew a huge crowd. A large number of young devotees took selfies, while others captured the moments into their cameras. Many people of Kashi settled in other cities also visited to witness the annual event. Special arrangements were made by the administration for the event. Besides, tight security arrangements were in place and cops in plain clothes were deployed at the venue. The Bharat Milap event is organised every year a day after Dussehra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/historic-bharat-milap-event-in-kashi-leaves-audience-spellbound-101634446937926.html

17-10-2021||Kolkata||Bearing brunt of rain, farmers in coastal Bengal stare at uncertain future||In May, after a very severe cyclone Yaas ravaged the coastal districts of West Bengal, 48-year-old Abani Mondol saw a glimmer of hope. Even though saline water from the rivers had gushed into his farmlands, the state government came to his help providing some varieties of paddy which were salt tolerant. Four months down the line, Mondol is again staring at an uncertain future. The extremely heavy and erratic spells of rainfall this monsoon in July and September killed all the salt-tolerant paddy crops which he was banking upon. “I had sowed salt-tolerant paddy in around seven bighas of land. The seeds were provided by the state government. But because of the extremely heavy spells of rain, the crops were lost. It rained so heavily that the fields remained waterlogged for at least two weeks. This was not just once. It happened multiple times this monsoon,” said Mondol, a resident of Sandeshkhali-II block in North 24 Parganas. After Yaas, around 1200 MT of salt-tolerant paddy seeds were distributed in the three coastal districts – East Midnapore, South 24 Parganas and North 24 Parganas. More than 38,000 farmers would have befitted from the seeds had they yielded paddy. “Each farmer was given a kit comprising six kilos of seeds along with seed-treating chemicals. Six varieties of paddy seeds – CSR-10, CSR036, CSR-43, Luna Swarna, Luna Sampad, Lunishree and Dudeshwar were distributed. Luna Swarna was distributed for the first time,” said Omkar Singh Meena, secretary of the state agriculture department. But most of the crops got damaged, even before they could be transplanted, as heavy rains battered the districts of south Bengal in July-end, resulting in floods in some districts. “The seedbeds, which were prepared with salt-tolerant paddy, remained submerged under waist-deep water for nearly two weeks killing all the crops. Later, some of the farmers sowed the conventional varieties but even that got damaged in the extremely heavy rainfall that hit the coastal districts again in September-end. In Sandeshkahli-II block, Aman paddy is cultivated across 9800 hectares. But only 2% – 3% crop coverage of salt-tolerant paddy now exists as most of the crops died,” said Chowdhury Monirul Haque, assistant director of agriculture, Sandeshkhali-II In Gosaba, a block in South 24 Parganas where paddy is grown in around 6000 hectares, nearly 90% of the salt-tolerant crops got damaged. “As the farmers could grow nothing after that failure, nearly 25% of the farmlands in Gosaba have been reported as fallow land,” said Ritesh Kundu, assistant director of agriculture, Gosaba. “With the help of the state government, we had prepared community seedbeds and sowed salt tolerant paddy in over 15 bighas of land. But the extremely heavy spells of rain in July and September damaged around 10 bighas,” said Gunadhar Patra, another villager from Gosaba. With their crops gone, farmers like Mondol and Patra are now mostly dependent on government schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojna and the state government’s Krishak Bandhu scheme. “We get free rice and wheat from the state and central schemes. This apart we also get financial assistance from the state government under the Krishak Bandhu scheme. This is enough to sustain my family,” said Ananda Das, a villager from Sandeshkhali-II.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bearing-brunt-of-rain-farmers-in-coastal-bengal-stare-at-uncertain-future-101634441419629.html

17-10-2021||Chandigarh||Jubbal Kotkhai: Turf of two former CMs set for keen triangular contest||The Jubbal-Kotkhai constituency has remained the political battleground of two former chief ministers, Thakur Ram Lal and Virbhadra Singh. In this by-election, the contest is triangular between Congress’s Rohit Thakur, BJP’s Neelam Saraik and BJP rebel Chetan Bragta, who is fighting as an independent candidate. The fourth candidate in the fray is Suman Kadam, an independent, but he has not been able to cut much ice with the voters. An affluent apple-growing region, the constituency is known for throwing up big surprises in poll results. The segment has been reshaped since it was carved out initially. About a dozen villages of Nawar valley, which used to be part of the Rohru constituency earlier, were clubbed with Jubbal-Kotkhai about a decade back, changing the demography and equations for the political parties. The constituency had for long been the bastion of former chief minister Thakur Ram Lal. He first won it in 1967 as an independent by defeating then Jansangh’s Balanand Chauhan. Thakur later joined the Congress and continued his winning streak in 72, 77 and 82 till the time he was appointed governor of Andhra Pradesh. Thakur, a close confidant of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, had to step down as chief minister after his son’s name figured in the mass tree-felling scam. Virbhadra Singh, who was then the industries minister for state in the Union government, was Indira’s pick for the chief ministership in 1985. Virbhadra chose to contest his by-election from Jubbal-Kotkhai and won. Thakur Ram Lal returned to the state after a major controversy in Andhra Pradesh after N Bhaskrao was appointed chief minister when Telegu Desam stalwart NT Rama Rao was away to the United States for surgery. Thakur returned but couldn’t go along well with Virbhadra. He contested the next elections as a Janata Dal nominee against sitting chief minister Virbhadra and won. Thakur won three more elections and remained a member of the Vidhan Sabha till his death in 2003. Thakur’s grandson Rohit Thakur has won two elections. In 2017, he lost to Narinder Bragta of the BJP by a narrow margin of 1,060 votes. Narinder Bragta’s untimely death in June 2021 necessitated the by-election. His son Chetan is harping mainly on his father’s legacy — his contribution as the horticulture minister for the apple-growing region, mainly introduction of anti-hail guns. Chetan, who till recently was touring the constituency with BJP ministers, is now out of the saffron fold. He has been allotted ‘apple’ as the election symbol. “Na hum Congress waley, na hum BJP waley, hum sab seb waley” is the motto of his supporters, mostly BJP workers, during campaigning. “I will live up to the dreams and vision of my father for the constituency,” says Chetan. As an MLA and chief parliamentary secretary, Rohit largely contributed towards strengthening the road network in the constituency. He has the strong Congress vote bank and his personal rapport going in his favour. Rohit is repeatedly attacking the BJP government over the poor roads in the area. “The Theog-Hatkoti road, which is the lifeline of the apple belt, is still incomplete. The BJP made mere announcements and did nothing on the ground,” says Thakur. BJP candidate Neelam Saraik, the three-time Zila Parishad member, is facing a tough situation in her very first big election, especially in the wake of resignations by party office-bearers of the entire block in favour of Chetan. Neelam is counting on her grassroots electoral experience to set the tide in her favour. There are more than 36,000 women voters in the constituency and she is the lone woman candidate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jubbal-kotkhai-turf-of-two-former-cms-set-for-keen-triangular-contest-101634421848292.html

17-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Drop-out cases among TB patients doubled in Covid pandemic||The district has witnessed a two-fold increase in the number of tuberculosis cases reported in the district since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, which is known to prove fatal for those with a compromised immune system. The findings in the industrial town of Ludhiana are not unique, as per the World Health Organisation there has ubiquitously been a significant increase in cases of students afflicted with the disease dropping out. Drop outs among tuberculosis patients in Ludhiana increased from 4% to 8% during the pandemic.As things are return to normalcy, there has also been a spike in the number of tuberculosis cases being reported across the district. As per district TB in-charge Ashish Chawla during the first and second waves of the pandemic, the drop out rate had been almost 8%.“It was largely because of the exodus of migrant labour districts. Those who lost their jobs returned home and many discontinued their tuberculosis treatment. Now with the labour returning, tuberculosis cases are also beginning to rise again,” said Chawla, adding that locals who stayed behind continued to be treated. Patients also took advantage of the government scheme of allowing patients to keep a stock of medicine for a month. “Normally, we would detect 6,000 to 7,000 cases in a year, but this year the figures have crossed 13,000 already. However, there has been no rise in tuberculosis deaths and it maintained an average of 4%,” said Chawla.No spike in Covid deaths due to tuberculosisWhile most people believe that tuberculosis patients are more susceptible to Covid, but the report compiled by the district health department has shown no such trend.“Around 1% of tuberculosis patients were found to be Covid positive, which is the same as the national average of cases. I believe it was largely because of the widespread coverage of the coronavirus vaccination program,” said Dr Chawla.Most tuberculosis cases detected in dingy migrant coloniesIt was seen that more cases were being reported from urban areas due to a a large influx of migrants and poor working and living conditions in water-tight compartments. “The lifestyle of the urban population is such and they do not pay much attention to the warning signs, owing to which, more cases are detected from urban areas. As may as 80% of the cases are of pulmonary tuberculosis,” he said.What WHO report saysAs per WHO’s 2021 global tuberculosis report, reporting of tuberculosis cases in India went down by 41% between 2019 and 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The UN health agency said 1.5 million people worldwide had died of the bacterial disease last year, a slight rise from the 1.4 million deaths in 2019. The increase in tuberculosis deaths, a first in more than a decade, took place in mainly 30 countries with the highest caseload, including India. The report said the number of people newly diagnosed with TB and those reported to national governments fell to 5.8 million in 2020 from 7.1 million in 2019.WHO estimates that some 4.1 million people currently suffer from tuberculosisbut have not been diagnosed with the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-drop-out-cases-among-tb-patients-doubled-in-covid-pandemic-101634420648291.html

17-10-2021||Chandigarh||Different speed signages in Chandigarh confuse motorists||Ever since uniform speed limits were notified in the city in April, speed signages all over city roads are being updated and new ones are being installed at many places. However, on some roads, the old signages haven’t been taken down yet. So, much to the surprise of commuters, on some roads, the speed limit for light motor vehicles is both 50km/h and 60km/h. A check of roads in the city revealed that on many roads both signages are present. These were seen on various intersections along the entire Sukhna Path. There were also two boards put up together on the Sector 7/8 dividing road. President of the Sector 8 Resident Welfare Association (RWA) RS Gill said, “This is something we have recently noticed near our sector. The authorities must ensure that such speed signs are removed as soon as possible as commuters are being confused.”Road safety activist Harpreet Singh said, “The confusion will also be among the traffic police who have to implement the speed limit. People following different speed limits can be dangerous.”However, the traffic police claimed to have put up speeding nakas only on roads where the speed limits have been updated and where the previous signages had been removed. Senior superintendent of police (SSP), Traffic, Manisha Choudhary said, “We have been regularly following up this issue with the UT engineering department to complete the work at the earliest. We are also getting our own survey conducted to find out such discrepancies and will inform the department so that these can be rectified.”The traffic police were informed about two signages with different speed limits put up together on the Sector 36-37 dividing road. However, the older signage stays put.As per the updated rules, speed limits for light motor vehicles are 60km/h on dual carriageway roads (roads with dividers) and 50km/h for single carriageway roads (roads without dividers). Earlier on some of the dual carriageway roads, the speed limit was 50km/h, which is why the signage is being updated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/different-speed-signages-in-chandigarh-confuse-motorists-101634420417108.html

As the sale of crackers is also prohibited in the city, a shopkeeper from Sector 42 was also booked for violating the order.May face six-month jailAll FIRs have been lodged under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code. If proven guilty, the convicts may face imprisonment up to six months or fine up to ₹1,000.Reacting to the police action, president of the Sector 28 Ramlila Association, Bikram Singh said, “It has hurt our religious sentiments as Hindus. Other religious communities are allowed to celebrate their festivals anyway they like, so why the bias against us? The administration will harass us in a similar manner on Diwali.”Gulshan Kumar, president of the Sector 20 Ramlila Association, that had organised the Dussehra celebrations in Sector 34, said, “These cases are frivolous. Why wasn’t the ban on crackers shared when we were given permission for the event? Adhering to the ban, which came two days before the event, would have required ripping the effigies apart to remove the crackers.”City BJP chief to take up matter with governorBJP unit head Arun Sood, who was present at the Sector-34 event, where crackers were burst despite a warning by the SDM (South), said any criminal action against people for just celebrating a festival was unacceptable.Stating that he will speak to the Punjab governor and UT administrator about this, Sood said, “The authorities with their dictatorial orders have hurt Hindu sentiments. After I raised concerns over whether the NGT order will be applicable in Chandigarh on Dussehra, why didn’t the administration check its legality? It is not wrong to break an unfair law and Gandhiji had done the same by making salt at Sabarmati.”Sood added that effigies erected in Sector 40 and Ram Darbar couldn’t even burn properly without crackers, which was inauspicious as per Hindu customs regarding cremations.He said a complaint had also been submitted at the Sarangpur police station about cops, who misbehaved with children and kicked down a four-foot Ravana made by them.A day before the festival, Sood had called a meeting with two Ramlila bodies of the city and told them to celebrate the festival as per traditions and that he will ensure they don’t face any action. Even after the FIRs, the organisers laid blame with the authorities.“We have registered FIRs against the violators, and anyone found instigating people to violate the cracker ban will not be spared,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cracker-ban-goes-up-in-smoke-on-dussehra-chandigarh-police-lodge-10-firs-101634420413971.html

17-10-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz | The myna that fled Kabul||Horrific images of Afghans clinging to the wheels and falling of evacuation aircrafts onto Kabul rooftops defined global perceptions of the aftermath of the Taliban takeover in August. But a tale of a unique escape has emerged several weeks later and it serves as a small but heart-warming counterpoint to the evacuation tragedy. The revelation came this month from no less an entity than the French Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, Xavier Chatel, and he had kept this little story locked up in his kind heart all these weeks. Chatel took to Twitter and his recount of the great escape of a Common myna and her Afghan refugee owner, Alia, found global resonance.It emerges from Chatel’s narrative that Alia arrived at the Al Dhafra air base in the UAE. Alia had fled Kabul exhausted, with an unusual possession: a bird. “She had fought all the way at Kabul airport to bring the treasured little thing with her. For sanitary reasons, the bird could not embark on the plane from Al Dhafra air base to Paris. She cried silently. I was moved. I promised to take care of the bird at (my) residence, feed him. She could visit him anytime and take him back. I won’t forget her look of desperate gratefulness,” tweeted Chatel.Chatel took Alia’s myna under his wing, accorded the myna diplomatic treatment and the bird currently occupies pride of place at the Ambassador’s residence in Abu Dhabi. The myna has learnt to mimic the French word, Bonjour, but after inflicting a series of petulant pecks on the good Chatel and peppering his gleaming car with nervous poop! Alia, who is safely in Paris, managed to trace Chatel on Twitter, and was anxious to know the fate of her feathered sweetheart. Her separation from the myna turned into a symbol of fleeing Afghans torn apart from their homes, families, possessions and life itself. “She was so happy to see her bird cared for. She wanted me to teach him French. Alia, your bird has become the embassy’s mascot, but he is here for you, and if I can, I’ll take him personally to you one day,” was Chatel’s promise to a grateful, reassured Alia on Twitter.The jungle’s necklace Nishant Prabhakar likes to label himself a “tree entrepreneur”. A resident of Panchkula’s Sector 7, Prabhakar’s family owns lands 2 km away from Morni town under the revenue jurisdiction of village Balig. He has innovatively planted trees of the Himalayan high-altitudes such as the Deodar, spruce, fir and oak in the Morni hills. When he is not attending to his beloved trees, Prabhakar is busy saving the snakes that wander into his homestay at village Balig. The local workers he employed killed a couple of the snakes before Prabhakar put an end to the needless killings. A firm believer in granting rights to exist to every living being, including plants, Prabhakar also saved a baby cobra that wandered under his bed and then climbed the curtains in sheer fright.Last week, a veritable necklace of the Morni jungles, cast in gorgeous jade, strayed into the homestead. A local lady from Balig, who collects fodder from the jungles, spotted the venomous species, a Northern White-lipped pit viper (Haryal) draped in the thick foliage. She informed Prabhakar so that he could kill the viper and thus supposedly rid the homestay of “danger”. But to the surprise of the locals, and it set the long tongues wagging, the viper has stayed put in the homestay till now, safe under Prabhakar’s indulgent eye. A persistent Prabhakar strives to change the locals’ perception of wildlife, especially snakes, by taking calculated risks and leading from the front to conserve biodiversity. vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-the-myna-that-fled-kabul-101634416149309.html
17-10-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column | All of us must give back to society||Every individual can make a unique contribution, positive or negative, to society. Those who have much to give in terms of knowledge and skill decide to shut themselves and live in a cocoon due to reasons best known to them, which deprives society of a chance to make a difference in the lives of those in need. It is the responsibility of every person to share the knowledge they have acquired as it not only helps others but also the person sharing the knowledge. They must let their skills help others let the unique fragrance of their personality to pervade society. Personality is a complex and confusing word. It is generally understood, especially in this part of the country, in a rather narrow sense of the word. Most perceive it to imply certain evident traits such as physical attributes, charm, smartness, communication skills, social acceptability and so on. However, in truth, personality is to a person what fragrance is to a flower. Just as a big and beautiful flower is useless unless its fragrance saturates the air, similarly a handsome man or a beautiful woman needs to let their personality shine through. Those with a beautiful mind can become a tool of social change if they adopt the mission of spreading goodness and happiness. The tricity, because of its quaint charm, is a home to many people who are blessed with a unique power to give in diverse fields such as art and culture, business, education, or sports, but most of them are indifferent to the fate of others as they are comfortable in their own locked jails. Fortunately, there are some who are proactive and have taken upon themselves to make a positive difference and are changing many lives through their interventions.Some philanthropists may feel happy by simply signing a cheque to get rid of the guilt of their luxurious lifestyles, but this may mean little unless they accept bringing social change as their personal responsibility.I am lucky to be working with some who want to make the tricity beautiful in every possible way. During my close association with some of them, I have realized that they are not doing it for photo-ops and are genuinely concerned about certain issues that deserve urgent attention. It may be in as diverse fields as generating ideas to help administration, motivating the youth or encouraging young writers, and sportspersons or helping preserve our culture and heritage. My personal focus is om efforts to stop the sharp decline in moral values of the youth. Gifted achievers such as general VP Malik (retd), VK Kapoor, IPS(retd), Vivek Atray (IAS,retd), BN Goswami, NishaLuthra, and many others have dedicated themselves to the common good to improve the lot of others.Though silent personal examples of such achievers have inspired and influenced many lives when they were in position of authority, they are now devoting quality time to various organisations for a better reach. Because of their concerted efforts many organisations such as the think tank Suvichar, Chandigarh Literary Society, Vibrant Networking Forum, PlayWrite, Chandigarh Chapter of Indian National Trust for Culture and Heritage, and The Narrators to name a few are doing an admirable work and more and more responsible citizens are supporting the noble causes.There is need to create a shared awareness among the fortunate and gifted citizens, necessary for collective action for improving individuals, especially the youth, who are trustees of posterity and functioning of government and private organisations. I hope it will motivate otherwise indifferent and unconcerned achievers who have the choice of expanding their lives and becoming nobler than themselves to celebrate the sheer joy of giving.colcheema1942@gmail.com(The writer is a Panchkula-based freelance contributor)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-all-of-us-must-give-back-to-society-101634415787760.html

In a press release, Sharma alleged that Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait was fanning anti-national sentiments and is playing with fire by giving “provocative speeches” in a desperate attempt to further his political career. The state BJP chief said the Singhu and Tikri borders have turned into hubs of heinous crimes like murders, assaults and lootings. “Every time a crime is committed, the union leaders immediately distance themselves from it. This is a democracy and the law of the land cannot be taken into hands by people who further their political ambitions. People have suffered immensely for one year as this agitation has disrupted their daily lives,” he said.“I was attacked on the Jalandhar-Pathankot highway a few months ago and the police are yet to take any concrete action against those behind the murder attempt,” said Sharma. The law and order situation in Punjab was in a shambles but the chief minister was more concerned about travelling to other states to lodge protest, he alleged. “He should focus on giving good governance to people in the state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmer-union-leaders-opposition-parties-responsible-for-singhu-lynching-punjab-bjp-chief-101634415067503.html
17-10-2021||Chandigarh||Singhu lynching: Will upgrade security, say farmer unions||Facing flak over the gruesome killing of a man at the Singhu border, farmer leaders on Saturday said they will upgrade security by installing CCTV cameras and increasing the number of volunteers at the protest sites even as they asserted that the incident will have no impact on the agitation against the Centre’s three agri laws. Lakhbir Singh, a 36-year-old Dalit farm labourer, was lynched on Friday allegedly by a group of Nihangs who accused him of desecrating a Sikh holy book. His body was found tied to an overturned police barricade at the Singhu Border protest site, with the left hand chopped off and over 10 wounds caused by sharp-edged weapons. One Sarabjit Singh has been arrested and remanded in police custody for a week. The Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of farmer unions is spearheading the protests, issued a statement on Friday distancing itself from the incident and said that it wanted to make it clear that “both the parties to the incident”, the Nihang group and the victim, have no relation with the Morcha. Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), which is leading the charge at Ghazipur on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border, said more cameras would be installed and there shall be a change in the deployment of volunteers at the protest site in the wake of the Friday incident. “So far volunteers affiliated to local groups of farmer unions were deployed at the protest site to monitor the situation and coordinate security-related issues. But it has been decided now that such volunteers shall be deployed only by SKM at protest sites,” BKU’s media in-charge Dharmendra Malik told PTI. It was also decided that the groups or individuals who are participating in the movement but hold ideologies that are different from the SKM’s policies shall be asked to vacate the protest sites or adopt the agendas of the farmers’ collective, he added. Farmer leader Abhimanyu Kohar of Bharatiya Kisan Mazdoor Mahasangh, which is part of SKM, said that the farmers’ body stays proactive whenever such an incident occurs and revises its security details, if needed. Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary of BKU (Lakhowal), alleged that the incident was a ploy to divert attention from the Lakhimpur Kheri incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/singhu-lynching-will-upgrade-security-say-farmer-unions-101634415007817.html

In a social media post, Sialka, a lawyer, said, “At the Singhu border, the Sikhs present there took action as per the Khalsa tradition. I will pursue the case registered against nihang Saravjit Singh.” Talking over phone, Sialka said that nothing was above the Guru for a Sikh. “If anyone comes to attack Guru, a Sikh has right to defence. Some forces are making a hue and cry over it. They are actually justifying the sacrilege,” he added. Incident tragic, says Jagir KaurTerming the Singhu border incident as tragic, SGPC president Jagir Kaur claimed that conspiracies were being hatched to derail the farmers’ struggle against the central government’s three agriculture laws. “Had the government come forward to resolve the farmers’ issues, these unfortunate incidents would not happen. It has been 10 months since the farmers are sitting at the Delhi border, but the government is not addressing their concerns,” she said. Sikh seminary Damdami Taksal chief Harnam Singh Khalsa said the Sikhs who took the step had no option but to uphold dignity of their religious scripture. “The Centre and Punjab government have not shown sincerity toward resolving the issues of sacrilege. The sangat will contribute to help the nihangs fight legal battle,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sgpc-general-secretary-offers-legal-aid-to-singhu-lynching-accused-101634414827544.html
17-10-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column | Pitfalls of stardom without claim to fame||A young man with no claim to fame, except that he is a superstar’s son, has landed himself in a soup. Strangely, barring his genealogy, the 23-year-old has absolutely no credentials to speak of, be it noteworthy educational qualifications, or an oeuvre of work, and yet he has been the blue-eyed boy of the paparazzi and has been touted as the ‘next star kid to look out for’ by media moguls and pundits.The social media has been his crib and has cradled him with much aplomb. He was ‘papped’ partying hard with friends, ‘vacaying’ at gorgeous locations across the world and even captured as he left and entered his house. He has 1.6 million followers on a particular social media site and an exclusive fan club to his name, and yet he does not have a single movie to his credit, except lending his voice to a cartoon character in the dubbed version of a Hollywood film.In a twist in the tale, the golden boy is in knee-deep trouble for substance abuse. The social media is abuzz with the viral videos and snapshots of the young man in custody and crying his heart out. The opinions are diverse and so are the reactions of the well-known and not-so-well-known. Our very own Parliamentarian famous for his gargantuan vocabulary has not been found lacking in both–his grandiloquent expression of the situation and in doling out sympathy towards the distressed family. However, here are a few lessons to be learnt from the episode. For one, how much attention should be paid to star kids? Should they be exposed to this kind of unwarranted media attention or should there be a restriction? Psychologists believe that most stars or public figures are adults and are, therefore, able to handle the media attention and pressure in a significantly better manner. Unnecessary publicity and the glare of glamour is a completely different ball game when it comes to child stars, let alone star kids who have not intentionally chosen to be a part of it. In foreign countries, a number of celebrities have chosen strict restrictions on how the paparazzi can take their pictures. It is also their right to have their kids’ faces blurred when ‘papped’. Such restriction can certainly allow the star kids some privacy and let them lead a peaceful life ‘far from the madding crowd’.The second lesson to be learnt is what happens when the media attention is not unwarranted and the star kids start enjoying the celebrity status meted out to them ignoring their lack of individual identity? Once again psychologists believe that this is a threatening situation where the child stars or star kid get accustomed to fame and develop serious disorders as their lives are initially constantly broadcast and later they fight the threat of invisibility. As they enjoy celebrity status, they tend to overstep some boundaries, which may be decency or law and order. The drama that has unfolded after the arrest of the superstar’s son is similar to what happened to the son of an actor-turned-parliamentarian. The actor has practically lived his life in and out of prison and rehabilitation centres. Between his stints at jail, Bollywood’s very own ‘Khalnayak’ showed streaks of talent and immense potential, which could have been exploited further had he been able to stay grounded. The third lesson is for the media and the public. Both should learn to give some star kids some space and not unnecessarily harangue them or lavish them with undeserved idolatry. Let them attain celebrity on their own merits, rather than for their lineage.sonrok15@gmail.com(The writer is an associate professor at SD College, Ambala Cantt)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-pitfalls-of-stardom-without-claim-to-fame-101634414647389.html

We may even launch a ‘jail bharo’ agitation,” he added. It is not a mere coincidence, he alleged, that Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi met Union home minister Amit Shah on October 5 and the decision was taken nine days later.“CM Channi tried to wash his hands off the issue with a mere statement instead of opposing the move in concrete terms. State home minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa has no right to continue in office after this move as it was the second time he sold off the interests of the state to the Centre,” the Akali leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/unite-like-minded-parties-against-centre-s-bsf-jurisdiction-extension-akali-dal-leader-to-badals-101634414467535.html
17-10-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column | My journey from the fourth estate to PR||My parents wanted me to become a doctor, but Fate had other plans and I failed to clear the Punjab Medical Entrance Test, which was held for the first time in 1980 for MBBS aspirants. Disappointed with my performance, I decided to pursue graduation in arts and later pursued masters in journalism and mass communication from Punjabi University, Patiala. I strived hard to become a journalist but destiny still had other plans. I eventually, joined as a public relations officer in the government.As an intern, I opted to join the Indian Express for my practical training in 1985 while pursuing a masters degree in journalism. Those days, it was reputed to be nursery for budding journalists as hands on training was immaculately imparted by an expert team of sub-editors, who made trainees write a lucid copy or cull out apt headlines for news stories. I still remember several pleasant and unforgettable instances during my brief stint of little over six weeks as a trainee. The brief training speaks volumes for the creativity and ingenuity, which was the hallmark of its editorial team that taught me the ins and outs of the profession. At the time, Rahul Singh, the son of the renowned columnist Khushwant Singh, was the resident editor of the Chandigarh edition. Once I edited an agency story and suggested a very crispy header that hit the headlines on page one of all its editions across the country. Resultantly, my news editor who was impressed took me to the resident editor’s office next morning. After a cursory glance at the story, he not only appreciated my work as projected by the news editor but also offered me cup of tea, which I hesitatingly declined in anxiety. Then he asked me whether I was interested to work as a reporter in the field. Without giving a second thought, I replied in the affirmative. Showing magnanimity, he even went a step ahead to offer me a job of stringer at Ropar, my native place. With this lucrative offer in hand to start a career from prestigious national daily as a journalist was nothing less than a bonanza that too without passing through the ordeal of unemployment. I was on cloud nine. Having expressed my gratitude to the news editor for his personal indulgence and benevolent gesture, I hesitatingly asked, “Sir, what would be the salary.” He said, “It won’t be salary but remuneration on basis of column-wise contribution, which will generally come to be something around ₹ 600 to ₹750 per month.” He, however said,” Once you prove your worth as professional with utmost dedication, resilience and sincerity, you’ll be permanently taken on pay rolls as a staffer, but mind it... it’s a long journey. Few people leave it in mid way. Others hit the bull’s eye and now the choice is yours”. Obviously, these words of caution fell flat on my ears.Enthused, to become an inseparable part of the fourth pillar of democracy, I anxiously discussed the matter with my father, who at once sarcastically retorted, “Couldn’t you find a better job than this, that too with a meagre salary.” Being a staunch votary of government service, he always enumerated its countless merits in terms of job security coupled with pensionary benefits to lead a happy post retirement life. My father, who was already in government service, convinced me not to join as a scribe till the result for the gazetted post of information officer, for which I had applied almost a year ago, was declared. Finally, the much-awaited verdict came and my father’s wishes were fulfilled when I got an appointment letter to join a Class-I job in the Punjab government. Destiny deprived me of a God-sent opportunity to become a journalist of a national daily and pushed me into altogether a different stream of PR, as both professions are absolutely diverse and poles apart!opinder.lamba@gmail.comThe writer is additional director (press) to the Punjab chief minister||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/my-journey-from-the-fourth-estate-to-pr-101634413987327.html

Sonepat deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Virender Singh, “During interrogation, the accused has named four more Nihangs in the gruesome murder, besides identifying others. The number of accused in this case is likely to be more than five. We had sought two weeks’ remand. We will also invoke the SC/ST Atrocities Act against the accused. We have to make some recoveries from the accused, including weapons used in the crime and the clothes the victim was wearing. We will also take him to Gurdaspur and Chamkaur Sahib for the identification of other accused involved in the crime,” the DSP added. A senior police official pleading anonymity said they had recovered a sword from the accused but it was not used in the crime. Advocate Monark Bhardwaj, who appeared for Sarabjeet Singh, said the court has directed the police to conduct his counsel’s medical examination daily. “ The court has also directed the police to ensure that I get to meet my client to discuss the case. The police will have to submit report of my client to the court daily,” he added. Sarbjeet allegedly hurled ‘abuses’ at some mediapersons when asked about the reason behind the lynching when he was coming out of the court. Meanwhile, members of the Nihang community have started leaving the protest site where they had been camping for months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kundli-lynching-case-sonepat-court-sends-accused-to-seven-day-police-remand-101634413928487.html

No Sikh priest was present to perform the Ardas (Sikh religious prayer) and no one from his village Cheema Kalan attended the cremation, police sources said. Only 12 family members including wife Jaspreet Kaur, sister-in-law Simranjit Kaur, mother-in-law Sawinder Kaur, sister Raj Kaur and his three minor daughters were present for the last rites.The district administration had sent a vehicle to Sonepat to bring the body of the deceased, which reached the village about 7pm. It was cremated immediately. According to sources close to the family, as there were allegations of sacrilege against Lakhbir, some people from the village had told the family that only cremation would be allowed and thereafter none of the family members would be allowed to perform any kind of religious ritual.A large contingent of security personnel was deployed at the cremation ground as police escorted Lakhbir’s body in an ambulance. Two people, Sarabjit Singh and Narain Singh, belonging to the Sikhs’ Nihang order have been arrested so far. The body of Lakhbir Singh was found on Friday tied to a barricade at the Delhi-Haryana border, where the anti-farm law protesters have been camping, with a hand chopped off and multiple wounds caused by sharp-edged weapons.Hours after the macabre crime, one Sarabjit Sigh, wearing the blue robes of the Nihang order, claimed that he had “punished” the victim for “desecrating” a Sikh holy book.  — WITH PTI INPUTS||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/singhu-border-lynching-victim-cremated-amid-tight-security-101634413567310.html

17-10-2021||Chandigarh||Forensic report key to establish crime in drug cases, says high court||A high court bench granted bail to an accused in a drugs case, observing that the forensic report in drug seizure form the foundation of the prosecution’s charges and if the same is not there, the entire case would fall flat. The high court bench of justice Gurvinder Singh observed that no doubt the Supreme Court has held that a challan even if not accompanied by a report of the chemical examiner or of the expert cannot be said to be incomplete. “However, it needs to be highlighted that the said cases did not pertain to an offence under the NDPS Act. A case under the NDPS Act can only survive in case the prosecution is able to establish that the article recovered is indeed a contraband and which can only be established on the basis of its chemical examination,” the bench said. The court was hearing a bail plea from one Vinay Kumar from Sirsa arrested in December 2020. According to the police, Kumar was possessing 7,000 Tramadol Hydrochloride tablets when arrested. The challan was presented before the trial court on March 4, 2021, but without the chemical examination report. The period of 180 days, which is mandated for filing of challan as per provisions of NDPS Act expired on June 20, but the prosecution did not file the forensic report. Kumar filed for bail on June 22 on the ground that in the absence of report of FSL, the challan could not be said to be complete. However, the plea was dismissed by the trial court. The court said that in other (not related to drugs) cases, even the ocular version coupled with some medical evidence or some other circumstantial evidence may suffice to bring home the guilt of the accused. “..the contention of the petitioner that the report of FSL form very foundation of the case of prosecution and is an integral part of the challan cannot be brushed aside (in NDPS cases),” the bench said, quashing the trial court’s order and allowing bail to the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/forensic-report-key-to-establish-crime-in-drug-cases-says-high-court-101634413027399.html

17-10-2021||Chandigarh||Air quality ‘very poor’ in three Haryana cities, ‘poor’ in 11||Air quality of at least three Haryana cities has entered the ‘very poor’ category and that of 11 others was ‘poor’ amid the crop-residue burning incidents in the region. An air quality bulletin of the Central Pollution Control Board revealed the jump in the incidents of burning of the crop residue, polluting the air in the region. The report says the air in three cities is of ‘very poor’ category. Manesar has the worst air quality in the state with 327 points on the Air Quality Index (AQI), followed by Karnal’s 326 and Gurugram’s 308. The air quality of 11 other cities of Haryana has been classified as ‘poor’ (see graphic). Of the 20 cities of the state chosen for the air quality bulletin, not even a single city has ‘good’ or ‘satisfactory’ air quality. According to the officials of the state pollution control board, the quality of air has deteriorated with the sudden rise in the incidents of stubble burning. On Friday, the state saw maximum 363 active fire locations (AFLs) as detected by the Haryana Space Applications Centre (HARSAC). The total number of stubble-burning cases in the state this season (between September 15 and October 15) has reached 850. Though the AFLs are far below the last year’s 1,835 for the said period, officials of the state agriculture department are concerned about the imp[ending spurt in farm fire cases as the harvesting of the parmal varieties is at peak. The chief secretary has already issued directions to the deputy commissioners to check stubble burning in their respective areas. Block-level flying squad teams comprising BDPOs, tehsildars, agriculture department officials and police personnel have also been formed by the district administration for the timely action against the erring farmers. Kurukshetra deputy commissioner Mukul Kumar said these teams will access the live reports of the stubble burning and take immediate action against the farmers. Member secretary to Haryana State Pollution Control Board S Narayanan said fresh directions have been issued and concerted efforts are being made to ensure a check on straw fires.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/air-quality-very-poor-in-three-haryana-cities-poor-in-11-101634412547418.html

The drop in air quality has been caused by a spike in activity due to the festive season and drop in average day temperatures as winter sets in, experts suggest.According to the data, the AQI in Agra turned to 274 from 214 within 24 hours, in Baghpat district of West UP the AQI turned to 307 from 176, in Bulandshahr, it went from 202 to 299. Ghaziabad in the NCR region recorded AQI of 349 from 235 within 24 hours. The higher the AQI value the more polluted the air. An AQI above 200 is considered poor while that above 300 is categorised as very poor by the CPCB. Very poor air can have a very severe adverse impact on health if exposed to it for long.Particulate matter 2.5 and 10 formed the major air pollutants in most UP cities that can be caused by increase in human activity that occurs during festivities. Burning of effigies also impacts the air quality but the impact is local, according to experts.The depleting air quality signals towards setting winters where the environment gets dense limiting pollutants to disperse. This results in higher AQI. The average day temperature according to the Indian Meteorological Department has dropped by 2.1 degrees Celsius in a week.“A large AQI value in a region shows that people in that area are breathing in more polluted air. Besides harmful gases, particulate pollution forms a major chunk of polluted air which has long-lasting, adverse impacts on health,” said environmentalist Sukant Sinha.The state of air quality has alerted government officials. “We are closely monitoring the AQI numbers of UP cities. Several measures including fines on polluting industries have been taken to reduce pollution. We have also set in place several strict measures to curb air pollution in the coming days,” said Ajay Kumar Sharma, member secretary of the UP Pollution Control Board||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/air-in-up-cities-turns-very-poor-with-aqi-spiking-in-24-hours-101634412367300.html

Even after adding ₹600 to Bhavantar Yojana, the farmers are incurring a loss of about ₹600 per quintal,” Hooda said.

Demand increases every year, but the government failed to increase power generation, due to which residents are bearing the brunt. The SAD government had set up the thermal power plants. If voted to power, we will again turn the state into a power surplus one,” said Sukhbir, in the city on Saturday to participate in a series of political events in four constituencies of the city including Ludhiana West, Central, South and Atam Nagar. At one of the events, Sukhbir said that the chief minister must not rely upon photo-ops alone, adding, “Punjabis are looking up to you to take decisive action on the injustice done to Punjab by the central government.” During the day, Sukhbir also inducted Moga market committee chairman Rajinder Pal Singh Gill, who had left the Congress recently, into the SAD fold. He interacted with industrialists, traders and other professionals and presented his vision for Punjab to them. Separate interactions were held with Jain and Valmiki community members and economically weaker sections. An event ‘Breakfast with Badal’ was held in Ludhiana west where residents and industrialists met him. He added that the SAD-BSP alliance will establish enough solar capacity to make free power subsidy bill redundant in two years. “We believe that initiatives like availability of assured cheap power coupled with focus on the philosophy of ease of doing business can bring in fresh investment besides encouraging our home-grown entrepreneurs to expand,” he added, claiming that homeless Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes would be given ₹5 lakh each for houses.

The survey covered 11,845 respondents including parents of school going children (Class 1 to 12) and 5,711 children between classes 6 and 12 across major metropolises including Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Pune, Ahmedabad and Bengaluru. The survey conducted after the outbreak of the Covid pandemic found that in Mumbai, 11% of the parents said that their children had been involved in an accident while commuting to or from school, as against the national average of 6%. The research methodology was divided into two components — qualitative and quantitative — using a mixed method research technique. To capture the latter, a questionnaire comprising 10 questions was asked from the respondents, which included queries like whether seats of the school transport were equipped with seatbelts; whether the school conducted any workshops for road safety education and whether riders wore helmets during the commute to and from schools. Additionally, in-depth interviews were conducted with school authorities, school boards, school bus drivers, van or carpool drivers, child road safety experts, traffic police officials, school authorities. The survey found that Mumbai topped in terms of rash driving while Delhi and Vijaywada topped with respect to absence of safety gear in school transport. It also emerged that about 33% children had witnessed a crash during their commute to school, while 6% of them were involved in a road crash or a near-miss situation during their commute to and from school. Data from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) reveals that 11,168 children below the age of 18 lost their lives to road crashes in 2019, contributing to 7.4% of all crash deaths. Out of these 379 deaths were reported from Maharashtra. Factors like poor road infrastructure, relatively unsafe vehicles, limited enforcement, and bad road-user behaviour contribute to the everyday risks faced by school children while commuting. Such risks are faced in both school affiliated and private transport, the study stated. While 47% of the surveyed respondents whose child cycled to school reported that there were no cycling paths en route or even around the school, 30% of parents whose child walked to school reported missing footpaths around the school zone. The survey was undertaken by SaveLIFE Foundation in collaboration with Mercedes-Benz Research and Development India (MBRDI). “As of date, over 25 states and Union Territories have announced the reopening of schools. Our findings through this report have once again emphasised that the right to a safe commute to school is as important as the right to education itself. A comprehensive national and state school transport safety policy can ensure that,” SaveLIFE Foundation founder and chief executive officer Piyush Tewari said. “We hope that this study will help all stakeholders further extend our vision of zero casualties to all modes of road transport,” said Manu Saale, managing director and CEO, MBRDI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-exceeds-national-average-in-crashes-involving-kids-during-school-commute-101634412067185.html

17-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: HIV+ woman sent to detention to prevent her from indulging into prostitution||A Dindoshi session’s court recently upheld the order of the metropolitan magistrate court that had directed the detention of a woman for a period of two-years to counsel her from indulging into prostitution. The court said care and protection, apart from her rehabilitation, can be taken by detaining her. It added that as the woman is HIV-positive – which can be easily transmitted – “the setting free of the victim at large is likely to pose danger to the society.”Additional sessions judge SU Baghele dismissed the application of her father and disposed of the plea. The court refused to agree to her counsel’s arguments that as she was financially sound, she is not likely to indulge in immoral activities. The court said that prima facie, from the first information report (FIR), it appeared that the woman agreed to indulge into prostitution after accepting ₹1 lakh.The metropolitan magistrate had passed an order on August 20, directing the woman’s detention for a period of two-years under the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956. After the police had got a tip-off, they had carried out a raid and rescued the woman.The woman’s father had challenged the magistrate court, claiming that the magistrate had failed to appreciate the factual matrix and the legal provisions in the proper perspective. The state, however, had claimed that there was no error in passing of the said order.The counsel, appearing for the woman’s father, had argued that she was from a reputed family and her father worked with the state government and that the family is financially sound. He can maintain the expenses of his daughter and the woman was willing to go to her family. She was nabbed owing to a misunderstanding and detained because she is HIV-positive, her father’s counsel argued.The counsel also stated that her custody should be given to her father as there was no material to suggest that the woman would pose any danger to the society.The state had argued that the woman was caught red-handed and sent for vocational training. As she was HIV-positive, the order of the lower court is proper.After going through the documents, the court observed that the care and protection of the woman can also be ensured by detaining her, as directed by the magistrate “so as to ensure that the victim leads a normal life in future, after getting necessary brainwashing.” As the woman is suffering from HIV, which can be easily transmitted through sexual intercourse, “the setting of the victim at large is likely to pose danger to the society”, due to which the factual scenario in the case at hand is different from the factual scenario in the cases and judgements relied upon, said the court.Judge Baghele observed that the order of the magistrate is correct and legal and does not warrant any interference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-hiv-woman-sent-to-detention-to-prevent-her-from-indulging-into-prostitution-101634411767296.html
17-10-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik: NCB witness is family friend of Sameer Wankhede||Maharashtra minority welfare minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Nawab Malik on Saturday again raised questions over the operations the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) against the alleged drug peddling pertaining to Bollywood. He claimed that the central agency has used a man named Fletcher Patel, who is a family friend of its zonal director Sameer Wankhede, as a panch or witness in three different cases in the past two years. Malik shared a few documents on Saturday and raised doubts on the agency’s witnesses. By releasing pictures from social media, Malik said Patel was Wankhede’s family friend. He has alleged that Patel had shared a photograph with a woman, calling her ‘lady don’ with hashtag ‘Sister’. The woman is one of Wankhede’s relatives and it needs to be checked if Patel and the woman had any connection with the raids on Bollywood celebrities, the minister said. He also alleged that the woman in the photograph is an advocate and an office-bearer of the film cell of a political party. “An independent panch or witness needs to be an independent citizen in any case registered under any law. Fletcher is a family friend of Wankhede as he has shared a picture with the relative of the officer. Fletcher is also seen with Wankhede in many functions organised to felicitate the officer. Does this not raise questions over the veracity of the cases registered by the agency? Earlier, the courts had rapped the investigating agencies on such dubious witnesses as they weaken the cases,” Malik said.He said as many of the NCB raids were against Bollywood actors, it needs to be checked if there was any nexus involved in it. “How can a family friend be a part of the raids? The agency has been indulging in selective leaks related to the raids to defame the government and the film industry. Many actors were raided and paraded by the agency. It needs to be checked if there was any big game behind all these raids,” he said.Earlier, in two press conferences in two weeks, Malik had alleged that two witnesses in the cruise drug party raids were allowed to handle the accused. He had said one of the witnesses, KC Gosavi, is facing criminal cases, while another, Manish Bhanushali, is a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) officer-bearer. Malik had also alleged that his son-in-law, Sameer Khan, was framed in a drug case.Wankhede refused to comment on Malik’s allegations. Another NCB officer said that Patel is the Mumbai president of Army veterans’ group Sainik Federation and has an Army background. The photograph in which he is seen with Wankhede was an event held at CSMT where the federation had felicitated the NCB zonal director on Kargil Vijay Diwas on July 26. At the event, they pledged to curb the menace and threat of narcotics from the country.The officer further said that Patel is a highly-trustworthy person. “As a panch, we always require people like him who have army background, because such individuals are physically and mentally strong, and especially are of very help in operations against peddlers/suppliers who are strong in physique,” the NCB officer said.Patel said, “I am an ex-serviceman and Mumbai president of Sainik Federation. Yes, Sameer Wankhede’s sister is like an elder sister to me. Even if she is like family to me, that can’t stop me from helping NCB in their drive against drugs. I have been helping NCB as my social responsibility and nobody should question my integrity. “||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-minister-nawab-malik-ncb-witness-is-family-friend-of-sameer-wankhede-101634411707321.html

Sasikala left her residence from Chennai T Nagar residence at 10.30 am, with her supporters standing along the road route to greet her. At Jayalalithaa’s memorial, Sasikala turned emotional and was seen wiping her tears, while laying a wreath.“Everyone knows the reason I came here so late. I don’t want to talk about the past. I have poured my heart to her (Jayalalithaa). I told her whatever happened (in the past five years). I am confident Thalaivar (MGR) and Amma (Jayalalithaa) will save the AIADMK and its cadre. The future will be good,” Sasikala told reporters after the visit. “Amma and I were inseparable. I spent more than half of my life with her,” Sasikala added.Jayalalithaa’s resting place on Chennai’s Marina beach along with other Dravidian stalwarts is significant for the AIADMK. Sasikala last visited this place on February 15, 2017, before proceeding by road to Bengaluru to surrender before Parappana Agrahara prison authorities for serving a four-year jail term in the disproportionate assets (DA) case. Sasikala had planned to visit the memorial following her return from Bengaluru prison earlier in February this year. However, the then AIADMK government led by Edapaddi Palaniswami, whom she had handpicked as Tamil Nadu chief minister before going to prison, had closed the mausoleum, citing maintainable work, just a few days after opening it in a bid to prevent her entry.Sasikala had “stepped aside” from politics before the April 6 assembly elections as none of her former protégés or senior AIADMK leaders met her. But since their defeat, she has been engaging over phone and releasing audio clips of conversations with AMMK and the AIADMK cadre. She has been consoling the AIADMK cadre that she will “set the party right”.Reacting to Sasikala’s visit, former AIADMK minister and spokesperson D Jayakumar described it as “stunt” saying that she can be considered for an “Oscar Award ” for her “acting skills” but will never be allowed back into the party. “Every day lakhs of people visit Amma’s memorial, and she (Sasikala) is just one among them. There is no need to talk more about the visit,” he said.Sasikala will visit M G Ramachandran’s residence in Ramapuram on Sunday morning to mark 50 years of ADMK (later renamed AIADMK). Her visit comes a day before the AIADMK is set to enter in its golden jubilee year, and days after the party’s humiliating defeat in the recently-held local body polls across Tamil Nadu, that was swept by the ruling DMK. The defeat in newly-carved nine districts is the AIADMK’s third since Jayalalithaa’s passing in December 2016. Edappadi Palanisami and O Panneerselvam, both Sasikala’s loyalists turned foes, have been running the party in a dual leadership. Following her imprisonments, the duo expelled Sasikala and her nephew TTV Dhinakaran, who went on to float the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) along with Sasikala’s supporters with the sole aim of retrieving the AIADMK. Despite the AIADMK leadership stonewalling Sasikala, Panneerselvam, in particular, is has been softer towards the idea of her return to the party due to being sidelined by the Palaniswami camp and both belong to the same Mukkalathur community. Sasikala continues to hover and threaten the AIADMK’s present set up, which is currently Tamil Nadu’s principal opposition, leading the NDA alliance after a decade of ruling the state. “As of now, Sasikala’s electoral strength is zero,” said political commentator Raveendran Duraisamy. “No doubt, Sasikala is bold and has a stature and community support, but until she can be an electoral force, the AIADMK will neither respect nor take her back.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aiadmk-cadre-will-be-saved-sasikala-at-jayalalithaa-s-memorial-101634411409737.html

Under the programme, the district authorities would spend time in the villages, understand the problems there and resolve them at the earliest.The chief minister said, “When development reaches people, their struggle reduces helping them live a stable life.”He further said preparations were under way to distribute rations at the doorstep of the people and that the social security schemes too would reach the people that way.He said the people need not visit the Taluk offices to get issues sorted out as they can be resolved, even issues regarding pensions, at the gram panchayats-level.All officials, right from the chief secretary to the gram panchayat officers, must join hands to serve, said the chief minister.The government has also planned to provide all facilities to the gram panchayats under the Janasevaka programme, and the pilot project would be launched in all the 28 assembly constituencies of Bengaluru on November 1 through mobile phone, Bommai said.He said over 400,000 houses for the poor have been built in one-and-a-half years while 100,000 are being built in the cities for the slum-dwellers.Addressing people at Kundur in Honnali Taluk of the district, Bommai said development would take place in rural areas through ‘Amrit Schemes’ launched on the platinum jubilee year of Indian independence.Under the Amrit scheme, each village would get ₹2 crore for developmental work and 7,500 Stree Shakti groups or self-help groups of women would get ₹1 lakh each.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ktaka-cm-bommai-inaugurates-scheme-to-expand-govt-s-public-outreach-101634411407230.html
17-10-2021||Bangalore||Private museum plans encyclopedia to revive museum culture, popularise art in Bengaluru||The Museum of Art and Photography (MAP), a Bengaluru-based private museum, is working to bring out an encyclopedia to make Indian art more accessible and inclusive, as part of its efforts to bring back the museum culture of Bengaluru.Bengaluru has a strong connection with art but it has been mostly limited to interests of a few with little efforts to attract more people like tourists to make museums part of their itinerary in India’s IT capital.“While there are not enough platforms to freely access information on Indian art history, our encyclopedia will help connect the arts with the community. All the content that we produce is designed to engage diverse communities, ranging from young learners atschools to researchers to anyone with a latent interest in art,” a spokesperson from MAP told Hindustan Times in an email response. “Our content will go beyond the usual art forms to include more neglected works of craft and design, as well as folk and tribal art. Through this effort we hope to push the boundaries of what is considered ‘fine art’ to build a more fair and nuanced platform.” With art currently perceived as an activity of the elite, there are few beyond this fraternity who take art seriously or persuade others, especially youngsters, to learn more about the subject that is intertwined with history, culture and tradition.The Congress government between 2013-18 tried to revive the museum culture as part of its Brand Bengaluru initiative to induce tourists spend more on museum visits, creating a new revenue stream for the state coffers.Bengaluru has a rich culture of art and places like Vishweshwaraiah Museum, HAL, Kempegowda, Venkatappa Art gallery, National Gallery of Modern Art, Chitrakala Parishath, and NIMHANS museum, among others, have tried to keep the culture alive in the city.However, museums have become mostly part of the itinerary of excursions for school students. In comparison, Indians who travel to European countries are enthusiastic to visit museums.MAP said that museums in India are elitist spaces.“India thus does not really have a museum-going culture. Even Indians who line up to go to museums abroad shy away in India as museums in our country have unfortunately earned the reputation of being either dry and serious when associated with historical objects or elitist and intimidating when associated with modern and contemporary art. This perhaps is one of the main reasons behind the low footfalls, as people do not feel comfortable enough to walk into a museum on a Sunday to spend the afternoon with their families and kids,” MAP said in its response.Vishweshwaraiah Industrial and Technological Museum, in its activity report for 2019-20, said that it attracted a total of 1.18 million visitors. But of this only 557,000 were general visitors and the remaining were mostly school students or visitors to its outreach programmes like science fairs.Though MAP is a private organisation, its efforts, art experts say, are likely to help revive the culture of museums on Kasturba Road, which has three such establishments and could help connect other galleries in the city.The Karnataka government is working to infuse fresh ideas into the tourism sector with initiatives like a book on unexplored destinations, reviving the brand of the state and its biggest city, Bengaluru, and promoting weekend getaways, as it looks to revive the fledgling travel industry sector in the post-pandemic era, Hindustan Times reported on September 29.From over 180.4 million tourists in 2017, the numbers rose to 228.5 million in 2019 before dropping to 77.6 million in 2020, data from the state economic survey shows. The state had also announced a tourism policy for 2020-25 not just to promote more travellers for exploring the state but also attract investments to ₹5,000 crore and provide direct and indirect jobs to over 1 million people. Karnataka accounts for nearly 12% of overall tourist visits in India and saw over 600,000 foreign tourists coming to the state in 2019, which dropped to 165,000 the following year. The previous BS Yediyurappa-led state government has set aside ₹2,645 crore for the tourism department in its budget for this fiscal.Street arts like that of Baadal Nanjundaswamy -- making mermaids and crocodiles in potholed roads or the “MoonWalk” video in which he made a model walk in a space suit in a crater-filled road of Bengaluru -- are appreciated for their messaging but not as a serious art. Localities like Malleshwaram are witnessing campaigns to create artworks on walls along roads that have become a hit to clean the streets of the city and provide a more colourful experience.Tourism initiatives had earlier included organising museum walks, food walks and other activities in Bengaluru and around it as part of the programme to promote spending at least $100 more by tourists in either visiting such sites or spending on memorabilia and merchandise.“Whoever wants to get into it (merchandising), we have to get someone strong as they have to pump money to sustain it,” Dr CN Ashwath Narayan, Karnataka’s minister for higher education, IT & BT, Science & Technology, told Hindustan Times earlier.Suresh Jayaram, a Bengaluru-based art historian, said that MAP and others are trying to position themselves to infuse fresh ideas to revive the museum cluster in the city. “If you have vision, you can make Bangalore a city with the art community involved and also public, young children who can have a more experiential kind of tours than rushing kids from one end of the other (in museums during school excursions),” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/private-museum-plans-encyclopedia-to-revive-museum-culture-popularise-art-in-bengaluru-101634411350865.html

Pune city has been able to vaccinate the highest number of beneficiaries with both first dose and second dose. More than 0.3 million people have benefited from the mission, highest of whom were from the rural areas of Pune. Under the Mission Kavach Kundal, the administration aimed to vaccinate 100% beneficiaries with the first dose and at least 75% of the beneficiaries with the second dose. The mission continued for over a week during the Navratri and Dussehra celebrations from October 8 to October 14. Under the mission, a total of 386,177 beneficiaries got the jab of which 94,000 are from Pune city, 73,000 from PCMC and 0.218 million from Pune rural. The mission conducted several initiatives to maximise Covid-19 vaccination, including a 75-hour non-stop marathon at over 13 centres. Of the 13 centres, seven were from Pune rural where 16,112 got their first dose and 16,702 got fully vaccinated, PCMC has four centres where 6,549 got their first dose and 10,269 were fully vaccinated and Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) ran only two centres which saw 75 hours of vaccination drive where 425 people got the first dose and 1,185 people got their second dose. In the mission, a total of 51,242 people got the vaccine, of which 28,000 people got their second dose. Highest number of people from the rural areas benefited from the mission. Under the mission, along with government vaccination centres, private vaccination centres were also running with full potential as a result over 0.386 million people got the vaccine, of which 94,000 were from Pune city 76,000 were from PCMC and 0.218 million were from Pune rural. Zilla Parshad chief executive officer Ayush Prasad said, “Due to the smooth supply of the vaccine, we were able to vaccinate the highest number of beneficiaries from rural areas and arrange for the maximum centres. Our staff from other departments were also engaged in the task and so we could bring many beneficiaries to the centre. Hopefully, by this year, the entire district will be completely vaccinated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/more-than-half-of-pune-district-fully-vaccinated-90-first-dose-101634411349623.html

The country has paid the price of upsetting Punjab in the past, he said, referring to former prime minister Indira Gandhi’s assassination during Khalistan militancy.Speaking to reporters at Pimpri near here, Pawar, who has handled defence and agriculture portfolios at the Centre, was replying to a question about the farmers’ agitation on Delhi borders which has been going on for several months.“I have been there (to the protest site) two-three times. The Union government’s stand does not seem rational,” he said.Participants in the agitation are from many states including Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, but most of them are from Punjab, Pawar noted.“My advice to the Union government is, do not let farmers of Punjab get upset, it is a border state. If we upset the farmers and people from border regions, then there will be other ramifications,” he said.“Our country has paid the price of upsetting Punjab, even (then prime minister) Indira Gandhi lost her life. On the other hand, farmers of Punjab, irrespective of whether they are Sikh or Hindu, have contributed to food supply,” the NCP chief said.People living in border areas face several security-related issues which those living in states such as Maharashtra do not experience, he said.“Therefore, when a person who is making sacrifices is sitting in protest with some demands for a long time, paying attention to him is what the nation requires,” Pawar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dont-upset-punjab-farmers-pawar-s-advise-to-centre-101634411348553.html

That will create issues in the future. The contractors have their associations. They can approach the ministry if they have any issues to discuss,” Riyas had told the assembly on October 7.Later, a section of media had reported that Riyas was criticised in the legislative party meeting of the CPI(M) legislators, forcing him to tender an apology.“There was no such discussion in the legislative party meeting of the party MLAs. None of the MLAs raised such an issue. The news reports that it was discussed and I had expressed regret are baseless. But let me clarify that I will not go back from my stand and that is actually the stand of the LDF,” Riyas told reporters.The ruling CPI(M) also came out in support of Riyas saying what he said was the stand of the Left Democratic Front (LDF).Reacting to a query, party state secretary in-charge A Vijayaraghavan said the minister was explaining the stand of the party and the government.“CPI(M) has already made clear its stand on issues like this.

The custodial death brought district officials on their toes and Bhojpur district magistrate Roshan Kushwaha ordered a probe into the matter.According to the assistant director, Child Protection Unit, Bhojpur, Binod Kumar Thakur, the deceased is a resident of a village under the town police station of Buxar district. He was brought to the facility located at Dhanpura under the jurisdiction of the town police station on October 6.Thakur said as per routine, the pre-dinner counting of inmates took place around 7.30 pm. All the inmates then reached the mess for dinner. After taking dinner, the boy went to the bathroom on the first floor of the correction facility. He locked the door from inside and hanged himself with the help of a towel. The incident came to light when other inmates found the bathroom locked from inside and the home staff broke open the door. He was immediately rushed to Sadar hospital where the doctor declared him brought dead. Currently, 87 juveniles are residing in the correction facility in which 14 were staying in quarantine rooms. Taking advantage of the chaos that prevailed after the incident, 10 inmates of the correction home escaped at around 9.30 pm. Thakur said, adding, many adjoining areas of the town have been cordoned off. Parents of the inmates have been informed, he added.Thakur, while talking with reporters said, “The juvenile who died by suicide tried to kill himself earlier as well by consuming phenyl. After the officials learnt about his suicide attempt, he was rushed to the local hospital for emergency treatment.”The deceased’s elder brother informed that his younger brother eloped with a girl and took her to New Delhi. Family members caught them and handed them over to the local police where an FIR was already lodged on the statements of the girl’s kin. The brother alleged murder because he said several injury marks were found on his body.Taking a serious note of the incident, the DM visited the spot on Saturday morning and enquired about the incident. He asked the additional district magistrate (ADM) to conduct a preliminary enquiry of the matter. He said that the body has been sent to Sadar hospital where a post-mortem would be performed by a three-member medical board and it would be videographed. Meanwhile, the mother of the deceased raised question about the police inaction which, according to her, led to the boy’s drastic step. She alleged that the Buxar police have not carried out any conclusive probe regarding the elopement by the deceased.If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.

17-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab fails to frame policy for organic cotton cultivation||Punjab lacks a policy to promote organic cotton cultivation even as farmers associated voluntarily with it see viability of chemical-free production of the cash crop.Farm experts say cotton crop is considered the largest consumer of pesticides and insecticides and Punjab can reduce its chemical load with a dedicated policy on organic farming.Since the chemical-free fields have lesser irrigation requirements, organic farming of cotton can pay dividends in the long term, they say.Jaitu-based Kheti Virasat Mission (KVM), an accredited agency to provide certification to organic growers, has roped in 55 farmers from various districts to opt for organic cultivation of cotton.“Since 2019, we have brought about 100 acres, against Punjab’s 3.25 lakh hectare area this kharif season, under organic cotton. Biggest challenge in organic farming is that a farmer has to keep his field free from any chemical use for three years. The government should frame a policy to grant financial incentive to such farmers for three years,” said KVM executive director Umendra Dutt.He said organic farming is the key for Punjab to reduce pesticide footprint in the agriculture sector. Groundwater table has been depleting due to injudicious extraction of the natural resource and chemical-free farming is needed to meet futuristic needs.SK Verma, head of Sirsa-based Central Institute for Cotton Research (CICR), a central organisation, said non-allergic and toxin-free dyes are a new natural way of clothing.“Like food products, organic fabric has a vast market. People like a natural way of clothing that is free from chemicals and toxins to avoid allergies. The CICR has a bank of traditional seeds that are provided to farmers to boost organic farming, but Punjab is lagging behind in the initiative,” said Verma.Punjab agriculture minister Randeep Singh Nabha admits that the state needs to think and explore ways to promote organic cultivation of cotton.“Cotton is a traditional cash crop in districts of the Malwa belt. Since 2015, it has faced two major pest attacks that crashed the rural economy. We should study models of other states in this direction,” he added.A progressive farmer from Fazilka district’s Katehra, Vinod Jyani, says coordinated efforts can help farmers get handsome returns from the vast market of organic fabric. He has sown conventional seeds on a 17-acre land in his native village.Bt cotton seed field can produce an average of 10 quintals of cotton from an acre whereas Jyani is expecting 8 quintals from certified traditional seeds.“A Ludhiana-based textile company has offered to pay 15% above the highest open market rate of raw cotton that is already touching about ₹7,700 per quintal. Loss in yield can be compensated with higher prices for genuine organic produce,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-fails-to-frame-policy-for-organic-cotton-cultivation-101634411167276.html

17-10-2021||Mumbai||1,553 new Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, lowest since May 2020||Maharashtra on Saturday recorded 1,553 Covid-19 new cases with 26 deaths, which is the lowest one-day figure reported over the past 17 months.On May 16, 2020, Maharashtra recorded 1,606 cases, the highest single-day spike until then, with 11,347 tests, giving a test positivity rate of 14.15%. On Saturday, Maharashtra conducted 100,944 tests, giving a positivity rate of 1.54%. Maharashtra’s overall positivity at present is 10.82%.“The low numbers could be because of the fewer tests carried out due to the Dusshera holiday on Friday,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the Covid-19 task force of Maharashtra. “We typically see a drop after weekends too. There is definitely a gradual decline in the number of cases, but it is always advisable to look at the weekly trends and the test positivity rate,” he said. According to Joshi, the next weeks are crucial because of the upcoming Diwali festivities. “People have to remain cautious and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour in order to avoid a post-Diwali spike,” he said. Experts say that we may see a sudden spike any time a newer variant of the virus strikes. Joshi said that he anticipated the third wave sometime between December and January. The declining Covid numbers have led to reduced hospitalisations too. The civic-run 1850 bed Seven Hills Hospital has been working with 30% occupancy since mid-September. “We are now functioning more like a referral centre and patients are being transferred to us from other hospitals,” said Maharudra Kumbhar from Seven Hills Hospital.The state’s case tally has now reached 6,589,982, while the toll stands at 1,39,760. Pune leads with 19,534 deaths, followed by Mumbai with 16,180 and Thane with 11,401. There are currently 29,627 active patients across the state, of which Pune tops with 8,089 patients, followed by Mumbai with 6,056 active patients and Thane with 3,943.State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said the figures have declined due to vaccinations and medication. “We have been very proactively taking steps to rein in the virus as well as undertaking mass vaccinations. This has paid rich dividends in the form of reduction in cases,” said Dr Awate.Dr SN Mehra, medical director, Masina Hospital, said it appears that the second wave is almost controlled. “We hardly get any Covid-19 patients in our hospital. This is in sharp contrast as in May-June this year, our entire wards were filled with Covid-19 patients,” said Dr Mehra.Meanwhile, Mumbai on Saturday reported 319 Covid-19 cases, the lowest single-day spike seen in October so far. This is also the second time in October that the city has reported cases below 400 in a day. On October 4, Mumbai reported 339 cases. On other days of this month, Mumbai has reported over 400 cases, and an overage of over 500 cases each day. On October 6, Mumbai reported 624 Covid-19 cases, the highest single-day spike in over 2.5 months.On Friday, BMC conducted 33,002 Covid-19 tests. These are slightly lower in number, in comparison to the number of tests conducted on an average daily in October — 39,000-40,000 tests. The positivity rate for Saturday was 0.9%.Authorities said the lower number of tests can be attributed to the festival celebrations of Dussehra on Friday.There were 499,448 vaccine doses administered on Saturday, bringing the total number of doses to 91,280,897.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/1553-new-covid-19-cases-in-maharashtra-lowest-since-may-2020-101634410869177.html

In a statement, Sampla said while handing over the complaints to the NCSC at the commission’s head office in New Delhi, the representatives and office-bearers of various SC organisations condemned the heinous crime. “Lakhbir Singh was murdered with brutality and the victim’s family should be brought to justice as soon as possible,” the NGOs demanded. “The SKM and other farmer leaders, who are sitting on the Singhu border, must be held responsible of this brutal incident as the man was killed despite their high-level security.

17-10-2021||Pune||I insisted that Uddhav Thackeray become Maha CM: Sharad Pawar’s snipe at Devendra Fadnavis||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar said he had insisted that Uddhav Thackeray become the chief minister of Maharashtra after Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) was formed around two years ago. Pawar’s remarks came on Saturday after BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis claimed Thackeray covertly nurtured ambitions to become a CM but kept talking about installing a “Shiv Sainik” on the post. Earlier in the day, Fadnavis, who served as Maharashtra chief minister between 2014 and 2019, had alleged that the MVA government was formed through dishonesty. “I feel that respected Uddhavji should now accept that he had ambitions of becoming a chief minister which he fulfilled. In politics, having ambitions is not wrong. But if you wanted to keep the word, you could have made senior Sena leaders Diwakar Raote, Subhash Desai or Eknath Shinde the CM,” Fadnavis said. Speaking in Pimpri-Chinchwad, Pawar said, “When we held a meeting to form the MVA and to discuss the leadership of the alliance, I forced him (Uddhav Thackeray) to become the chief minister. I have seen these people since their childhood. (Shiv Sena founder) Balasaheb Thackeray and I might have political differences, but we were close.” The NCP president then went on to say that he saw nothing wrong for a son of a person who contributed for Maharashtra to become the CM. “I thought why not the son of a person who had contributed for Maharashtra should become the CM and I insisted Uddhav Thackeray to become the chief minister. Fadnavis had worked with Uddhav so he knows how Uddhav is. He should stop questioning repeatedly about how Uddhav became CM,” the NCP chief said. Pawar said the MVA government will last full five years and the constituent parties will be re-elected (in 2024 polls). Reiterating that the Centre was misusing central agencies in Maharashtra, Pawar said the income tax raids on Pawar family members were unnecessarily carried out for many days as there was pressure on I-T sleuths “The Central agencies are being misused to destabilise the Maharashtra government. But I am sure it would not work and this government will complete five years tenure complete.” Pawar also attacked former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh without taking his name in connection with the Anil Deshmukh case. “Allegations of extortion were raised against (then home minister of Maharashtra) Anil Deshmukh by then Mumbai police commissioner. When it was asked to Mumbai police commissioner whether the police implemented Deshmukh’s alleged instructions to police to collect money then he denied it.” (With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/i-insisted-that-uddhav-thackeray-become-maha-cm-sharad-pawar-s-snipe-at-devendra-fadnavis-101634410570225.html

17-10-2021||Pune||Residents oppose clearing of forest land at Warje Malwadi||The work for Sanjeevan Udyan, urban forest, has begun full-fledged after the inauguration in August 2021, by clearing of the trees on the 35-acre hill near Dukkar Khind, Warje Malwadi. But according to locals, the clearing of trees will affect the avifauna in the area.Arnav Gandhe, a BE Comp student of Msc biodiversity, Garware College, said, “Sanjeevan Udyan has been planned within an area of pre-existing woodland spread across 35 acres. This woodland and the Mahatma tekdi (hill) plateau together are home to more than 115 species of avifauna recorded for the last seven years. It is also home to more than ten species of mammalian fauna, and many amphibians and reptiles which would certainly face a severe habitat loss due to such culling”“Moreover this culling of trees has been started on the onset of winter which is the prime period for winter migrations of avifaunal diversity observed in Pune. Similar to other the hills of Pune Mahatma tekdi is also used as a halt by these migrants, which would hazard their populations,” he said.Gandhe said, “When such a huge project is planned the necessary project impact assessment including the biodiversity assessment is a must.”This is the second such urban forest in Warje after Smriti Van, another urban forest, being jointly developed by the state government, union forest ministry, and a local non-government organisation (NGO).According to the forest department, Sanjeevan Udyan will also be known as ‘oxygen park’ where landscaping, beautification, pollution control and planting of medicinal herbs and plants will be given top priority.Rahul Patil, deputy conservator of forests for the Pune region, said that the forest department will offer all support, including trees to be planted on a 35-acre land parcel.He also clarified, “Only deciduous species are being cleared. Earlier in that area, since it was barren, only Gliricidia trees were planted and according to the Maharashtra forest documents, we are allowed to clear two hectares (5 acres ) of Gliricidia in the urban area. We will be planting more indigenous trees in its place to create a better urban forest.”According to Gandhe, “Winter followed by Summer is another threat to the mass plantation of native species as due low water table and severe heat, the planted trees would get affected. Even if they are watered by PMC tankers, the guarantee of such regular care remains a question.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/residents-oppose-clearing-of-forest-land-at-warje-malwadi-101634409907382.html

17-10-2021||Delhi||Gogi’s aide ordered killing of man who celebrated murder of his boss||Deepak Singh alias Radha, an alleged gangster of the Tillu Tajpuria gang was shot dead by members of the rival Jitender Gogi gang on October 11, because he had thrown a party to celebrate Gogi’s murder, Delhi Police said on Saturday after arresting four men in the case.Police have also confirmed that Deepak’s murder was planned by gangsters lodged in two different jails in Delhi.Police officers privy to the investigation said on Saturday that the police have formally arrested jailed gangsters -- Rohit Moi(Gogi’s second-in-command) from Tihar and another close aide, Kapil Maan from Mandoli jail. Two others, Sahil Solanki and Naveen Sharma have also been arrested.Officers said Moi planned the murder because he had learnt about Deepak throwing a party outside his house in Rohtak, Haryana, on the night of September 24 -- the day when Gogi was shot at 18 times by two gunmen, allegedly members of the rival gangs, inside a courtroom at Rohini district court.The two gunmen entered the court room dressed as lawyers; waited for over half an hour for Gogi and shot him 18 times, within seconds of Gogi entering the court room. Until his arrest in March 2020, Gogi, a resident of Alipur in outer Delhi, who had at least 19 criminal cases, was on top of the list of Delhi Police’s most wanted men. Gogi was arrested from a flat in Gurugram along with his aides Rohit Moi(currently arrested for last week ‘s murder) and Kuldeep Fajja (died in a police encounter earlier this year.)Delhi Police and the prisons are on high alert since Gogi’s murder. Police suspect that Gogi’s associates may try to murder Tillu.A police officer, privy to the questioning of the four men, said Deepak was not an active member of the Tillu gang but had thrown a party after Gogi’s death.“Gangster Rohit Moi got to know about Deepak celebrating Gogi’s murder through his friends. Moi spoke to another key gang member, Kapil Maan, at the Mandoli jail and planned the murder. They also followed Deepak for 4-5 days. Currently, Moi is running Gogi’s gang from inside jail, and another absconding member Deepak Pehal alias Boxer is running the gang from outside,” a police officer said.On the evening of October 11, Deepak was shot dead outside Rohini sector 15-16 market. Deepak had at least five criminal cases against him.Deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Pranav Tayal, said, “ Immediately after the incident, our teams analysed CCTV footage and activated our sources. We also mounted technical surveillance and arrested Sahil Solanki, a close associate of jailed gangsters Rohit Moi and Kapil Maan. They have also been arrested from jail. Another person Naveen Sharma has also been arrested in the case. We are questioning them and probing the case.”The Jitender Gogi gang is embroiled a decade long rivalry with the Tillu Tajpuria gang, led by Sunil Maan alias Tillu Tajpuria. In the last ten years, over two dozen have died in the gang war between the two groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhigogis-aide-order-killing-of-man-who-celebrated-murder-of-his-boss-101634399346278.html
17-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: ‘Thak thak’ gang targets Jammu & Kashmir admin official in Khanpur||A deputy labour commissioner in the Jammu and Kashmir administration was targeted by two members of a “thak-thak” gang who fled with her bag containing some cash, her ID and an ATM card in south Delhi’s Khanpur area, police said.Deputy commissioner of police (south) Benita Mary Jaiker said the 47-year-old woman is a resident of Vasant Kunj. “On Thursday, when the victim was going to Faridabad in a car, two men came on a scooter and signalled her to stop at the Khanpur T-point after claiming that the vehicle was leaking fuel,” said DCP Jaiker.Police said that her 15-year-old son was also present inside the car but she asked him to stay inside.According to the DCP, as soon as she stopped the car and got down to check it, one of the miscreants rushed towards her and snatched her sling bag. In the subsequent struggle, she told police that she received a few scratches, and the men sped away in their two-wheeler.DCP Jaiker said that they have registered a case under sections 392 (robbery) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code against unknown persons.Police said they are scanning the CCTV footage around the area to ascertain the identity of the snatchers.“We are looking at all angles and are further investigating the matter. CCTV cameras installed there are also being scanned,” said the DCP.Talking about the general modus operandi of thak-thak gangs, another police official said that they usually target people travelling alone, and distraction is their primary tool.“Once they notice valuables in vehicles, they distract the driver by claiming a flat tyre, or like in this case, a petrol leak. Once the driver opens the door, they quickly steal the valuables and flee,” said the senior police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhithak-thak-gang-targets-jammu-kashmir-admin-official-in-khanpur-101634399166388.html

Students can also cancel their admissions in previous colleges and take admission in another college after paying a cancellation fee of ₹1,000, university officials said.Though DU has around 70,000 sanctioned seats, colleges have admitted more than their capacity in some courses as DU does not follow the first come first serve policy for admissions. Till Friday, 51,974 candidates had paid their admission fee.This year, 11 undergraduate programmes had released a 100% cut-off in the first list. Of these, seven are still available under the third cut-off list recording a drop in the range of 0.50 to 3 percentage points.Of the courses demanding perfect scores under first cut-off, Political Science (Hindu College), Computer Science (Hansraj College), and Psychology (Jesus and Mary College) had closed admissions in the second list.Ramjas College closed admissions in Political Science on Saturday.Shri Ram College of Commerce had reduced its 100% cut-off in two courses – BCom (Honours) and Economics – to 99.12% and 99.75% respectively for the second list.

There have been overadmissions in several courses,” she said.For Computer Science, which emerged as a popular course this year as three colleges set 100% cut-off in the subject, admissions are closed in 11 out of the 20 colleges offering the course.Most colleges have either closed admissions in Political Science or have continued to set high cut-offs in the subject. Of the 45 colleges offering Political Science, admissions are closed in 17 colleges and are open in the remaining with cut-offs mostly ranging between 97-100%.Students wanting to study Political Science can still apply to Lady Shri Ram College (98.50%), Kirori Mal College (98.75%), Sri Venkateswara College (98.25%), IP College (97%) and Kamala Nehru College (98%).English too is still open in third cut-off in more colleges such as LSR (98.50%), Hansraj College (98%), Ramjas College (98%), and Sri Venkateswara College (97.75%), Gargi College (97.25%), and Kamala Nehru College (96.75%).While students can still apply for Economics at SRCC (99.5%), Hansraj College (99%), and Hindu College (99%), the subject is closed in Miranda House, Kirori Mal College, Rajdhani College, and Aryabhatta College.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/marginal-dip-in-delhi-university-cut-offs-for-top-courses-in-third-list-101634397852157.html

17-10-2021||World||‘Non-recognition of our govt in Afghanistan benefitting ISIS-K’: Taliban||In the aftermath of the gruesome bombing at a Shia mosque in Afghanistan’s Kandahar, the Islamist militant group Taliban – which now controls the country, have said that non-recognition of their interim government is benefitting the Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K). Notably, ISIS-K claimed responsibility for the bombing incident that took the lives of 47 people while leaving 70 more injured.Speaking to Anadolu Agency, Afghanistan’s acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said that the recognition of the Taliban regime in the country and support in the form of international assistance would pave the way to recovery for Afghanistan’s economy.However, Muttaqi refuted any concerns that the ISIS-K posed any threat to Afghanistan.Also Read | Death toll rises to 32 in multiple blasts at Kandahar mosque in AfghanistanMeanwhile, Ariana News reported the Taliban minister as saying that freezing of Afghan foreign reserves by the United States violated international law and human rights. “The real question is, why was this money blocked? What did the citizens of Afghanistan do?” he told Ariana News.On one hand, Muttaqi said, the US and other countries talk about the need to provide humanitarian aid to Afghanistan and respect human rights, on the other hand, “they leave the Afghan people with a population of about 40 million without basic necessities.”His statements come only days after the US-European Union (EU) delegation pledged $1.2 billion in aid to Afghanistan during the Islamist group’s first in-person talks with the international community in Qatar. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen announced the aid package, aimed at averting a “major humanitarian and socio-economic collapse,” at a virtual G20 summit hosted by Italy, AFP reported.Leyen, however, had highlighted that the aid is “direct support” for Afghans and not the interim Taliban government because the EU does not recognise them.Most countries have been against recognising the Taliban regime in Afghanistan owing to their history of brutalities during their earlier rule in the 90s.Meanwhile, the ISIS-K that currently remains the biggest threat to Afghanistan’s road to peace achievement, has issued a warning to Shia Muslims, saying that they will be targeted by the terrorist group everywhere, including their homes and centres. The ISIS-K’s weekly ‘Al Naba’ has published the warning, mentioning that Shia Muslims are perilous. Taliban’s commander of police in Kandahar, Abdul Ghafar Muhammadi, said that his forces will work alongside local volunteers to safeguard the Shia mosques in the province.(With inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nonrecognition-of-our-govt-in-afghanistan-benefitting-isis-k-taliban-101634494004768.html
17-10-2021||World||Anthony Fauci says US may mix and match different Covid-19 vaccines for booster dose||Anthony Fauci, the chief medical advisor to President Joe Biden, said American drug regulator will consider whether those who have been inoculated with one dose of Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine should be administered an mRNA-based vaccine, like Moderna or Pfizer as a booster shot to help induce a higher number of antibodies.“If you boost people who have originally received J&J with either Moderna or Pfizer, the level of antibodies that you induce in them is much higher than if you boost them with the original J&J,” Fauci told reporters during a television interview.Fauci’s comment comes after a second dose of the J&J vaccine was recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for 18 years and above as a booster shot. FDA also recommended a third dose of the Modern vaccine as a booster shot to high-risk adults.Also Read: US will see a drop in Covid-19 deaths this winter: Anthony FauciBoth Pfizer-BioNTech SE and Moderna vaccines are based on mRNA technology while the J&J shot uses adenovirus like India’s Covishield. Experts opine that mix-and-match of vaccines if sanctioned will give individuals greater flexibility in deciding which booster shot they should opt for to help battle waning immunity against the virus.The infectious disease expert had said towards the end of September that efficacy data on the pairing of vaccines will be available in the first two weeks of October, months after the National Institutes of Health started a mix-and-match trial of Pfizer, Moderna, and J&J shots on roughly 150 adults on June 1. All the participants were given a booster shot of a different vaccine three to four months after completing their first vaccine regimen.Fauci also said individuals will have the freedom to choose which booster shot they would like to go for. “I believe there’s going to be a degree of flexibility of what a person who got the J&J originally can do, either with J&J or with the mix-and-match from other products,” he said.For any mix-and-match vaccine regimen to be approved by both FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which reports suggest might come as early as this week.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anthony-fauci-says-us-may-mix-and-match-different-covid-19-vaccines-for-booster-dose-101634491972422.html

But all health indicators were “trending in the right direction,” Ureña said.“President Clinton has continued to make excellent progress over the past 24 hours,” Ureña said.Hillary Clinton has been with her husband at the hospital and accompanied him as he left Sunday.President Joe Biden said Friday night that he had spoken to Bill Clinton, and the former president “sends his best.”“He’s doing fine; he really is,” Biden said during remarks at the University of Connecticut.Clinton, 75, was admitted on Tuesday with an infection unrelated to Covid-19, Ureña said.“He is in great spirits and has been spending time with family, catching up with friends, and watching college football,” said Ureña’s Saturday statement.An aide to the former president said Clinton had a urological infection that spread to his bloodstream, but he is on the mend and never went into septic shock, a potentially life-threatening condition.The aide, who spoke to reporters at the hospital on the condition his name wasn’t used, said Clinton was in an intensive care section of the hospital but wasn’t receiving ICU care.In the years since Clinton left the White House in 2001, the former president has faced health scares. In 2004, he underwent quadruple bypass surgery after experiencing prolonged chest pains and shortness of breath. He returned to the hospital for surgery for a partially collapsed lung in 2005, and in 2010 he had a pair of stents implanted in a coronary artery.He responded by embracing a largely vegan diet that saw him lose weight and report improved health.Clinton repeatedly returned to the stump, campaigning for Democratic candidates, most notably Hillary Clinton during her failed 2008 bid for the presidential nomination. And in 2016, as Hillary Clinton sought the White House as the Democratic nominee, her husband — by then a grandfather and nearing 70 — returned to the campaign trail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bill-clinton-released-from-southern-california-hospital-after-being-treated-for-urological-infection-101634484477003.html

17-10-2021||World||UK MP David Amess murder: Suspect of Somali descent, planned the stabbing for over a week||The killing of British Conservative MP David Amess, who was stabbed multiple times to death in his constituency on October 15, has thrown open some serious questions about political violence and harassment or intimidation of politicians. As British police detectives continue to question the individual who is suspected of fatally stabbing the UK lawmaker, some interesting facts have come to light.Also Read | UK MP David Amess's killer was referred to counter-terrorism scheme: ReportSuspect: British man of Somali descentThe BBC reported, citing Whitehall officials, that the suspect’s name is Ali Harbi Ali – a 25-year-old British Muslim of Somali heritage who a few years ago was referred to ‘Prevent’, the UK's scheme for those who were thought at risk of radicalisation.Meanwhile, the Daily Mail newspaper also cited people familiar with the matter and reported that Ali was the son of Harbi Ali Kullane, a former communications adviser to the prime minister of Somalia. Kullane has confirmed that his son was in police custody and that he was ‘traumatised’ by the arrest.

Ali may have lived in the area at some time in the past, the report said, adding that his present residence is situated in a high-profile north London neighbourhood “in a street of £2 million three-storey townhouses where neighbours include broadcaster Giles Coren and, formerly, the late actor Roger Lloyd Pack, who played Trigger in Only Fools And Horses.”Potential links to ‘Islamic extremism’Meanwhile, the Scotland Yard was reported to have taken over the investigation, and the AFP news agency said citing police officials that “a potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism” is being probed.

It further read that the Shia Muslims will be targeted in their homes and centres, the Khaama Press report said, adding the Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K) remains the biggest threat to the Taliban-ruled government in Afghanistan.The IS-K on Saturday confirmed that it was responsible for the blast in the Imam Bargah-e-Fatima Mosque in Kandahar. Suicide bombers entered the mosque which was full of worshipers attending Friday prayers. Footage showed bodies lying on the floor and injured being taken to the hospital.The United Nations Security Council strongly condemned the bombing and underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice.This was the second bomb attack against a Shia mosque in Afghanistan over the past week. On October 8, a blast was reported from the Sayed Abad Mosque in Kunduz which killed over 100 people and injured several others. The IS-K has claimed responsibility for this attack as well.Since the violent takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban in August, several attacks against religious places in the war-ravaged country have been reported in recent days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/-from-baghdad-to-khorasan-islamic-state-says-shi-ite-muslims-will-be-targeted-everywhere-101634450651170.html

The kidnapping happened as the missionaries were leaving an orphanage in the crisis-engulfed Caribbean nation, the Times said. They were abducted from a bus headed to the airport to drop off some members of the group before continuing to another destination in Haiti, the report added, citing local officials.Jennifer Viau, a spokeswoman for the US state department in Washington, said by email that “we’re looking into this.” The US embassy in Haiti did not respond to a request for comment outside business hours.A spokeswoman for the Haitian police said she was seeking information on the issue. The report did not give details on the missionaries or their church.A surge in gang violence has displaced thousands and hampered economic activity in the poorest country in the Americas. Violence spiraled after the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in July and an earthquake in August that killed over 2,000 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-missionaries-kidnapped-by-armed-gang-in-haiti-report-101634442163388.html

The spaceship will land on the steppes of Kazakhstan.Peresild, 37, and Shipenko, 38, arrived at the International Space Station (ISS) on October 5.They blasted off from the Russia-leased Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, travelling to the ISS with Anton Shkaplerov, another veteran cosmonaut.But they belatedly docked at the ISS at 5.52 pm IST after Shkaplerov switched to manual control. “Welcome to the ISS!” Russia’s space agency Roscosmos said on Twitter.The movie Challenge is about a surgeon played by Yulia Peresild, who is dispatched to the ISS to save a crew member who needs an urgent operation in orbit. Oleg Novitskiy plays the role of the ailing cosmonaut in the movie. Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov, cosmonauts aboard the ISS, are also said to have cameo roles.“There are only 12 hours left before the spacecraft undocks and returns to Earth. I will miss the space views. Thanks to the subscribers for following our expedition. It was very interesting for me to share with you moments from life at the station and receive feedback,” Novitskiy tweeted on Saturday.If the movie project is successful, Russia will defeat a Hollywood project which was announced in 2020 by actor Tom Cruise together with American space agency Nasa and Elon Musk's SpaceX. For years, the United States and Russia locked horns in what was called a space race. Both the countries utilised their resources to the maximum to achieve superiority in spaceflight capability.While Russia became the first-ever country to launch the first satellite and send an animal, a man and a woman into orbit; the United States created history by sending cosmonauts on the Moon.However, the space race between Russia and the US also led to the creation of several conspiracy theories including lost cosmonauts and the fake moon landing.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-filming-first-movie-in-space-russian-crew-heads-for-earth-101634436796959.html

A lawyer for the men said he doesn’t know where they were being taken.The so-called Citgo 6, for the Houston subsidiary of Venezuela’s state owned oil company, were lured to Caracas in 2017 for a meeting when masked police busted into a conference room and took them into custody on embezzlement charges tied to a never-executed deal to refinance billions in Citgo bonds.The apparent retaliatory move came after Saab was put on a chartered US Justice Department flight from Cape Verde, a West African archipelago, where he was arrested 16 months ago while making a stop on the way to Iran for what Maduro's government later described as a diplomatic humanitarian mission.A US official, speaking on condition he not be named, confirmed the flight's departure. A public relations firm representing Saab said in an email that the Colombian businessman was taken from his home without his lawyers being notified.Saab's arrival in the US is bound to complicate relations between Washington and Caracas, possibly disrupting fledgling talks between Maduro's government and its US-backed opposition taking place in Mexico.Maduro’s government has vehemently objected to Saab’s prosecution as a veiled attempt at regime change by Washington. US prosecutors say Saab amassed a fortune wheeling and dealing on behalf of the socialist government, which faces heavy US sanctions.American authorities have been targeting Saab for years, believing he holds numerous secrets about how Maduro, the president's family and his top aides siphoned off millions of dollars in government contracts for food and housing amid widespread hunger in oil-rich Venezuela.However his defenders, including Maduro's government as well as allies Russia and Cuba, consider his arrest illegal and maintain that Saab was a diplomatic envoy of the Venezuelan government and as such possesses immunity from prosecution while on official business.In a statement Saturday, Venezuela’s government again denounced the “kidnapping” of Saab by the US government “in complicity with authorities in Cape Verde."“The government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela repudiates this grave violation of human rights against a Venezuelan citizen, invested as a diplomat and representative of our country before the world,” the statement said.The argument failed to persuade Cape Verde's Constitutional Court, which last month authorized his extradition after a year of wrangling by Saab's legal team, which includes former Spanish judge Baltasar Garzón and BakerHostetler, one of the US' biggest firms.Federal prosecutors in Miami indicted Saab in 2019 on money-laundering charges connected to an alleged bribery scheme that pocketed more than $350 million from a low-income housing project for the Venezuelan government.Separately, Saab had been sanctioned by the previous Trump administration for allegedly utilizing a network of shell companies spanning the globe — in the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Hong Kong, Panama, Colombia and Mexico — to hide huge profits from no-bid, overvalued food contracts obtained through bribes and kickbacks.Some of Saab’s contracts were obtained by paying bribes to the adult children of Venezuelan first lady Cilia Flores, the Trump administration alleged. Commonly known in Venezuela as “Los Chamos,” slang for “the kids,” the three men are also under investigation by prosecutors in Miami for allegedly forming part of a scheme to siphon $1.2 billion from Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, two people familiar with the US investigation told The Associated Press.But while in private US officials have long described Saab as a front man for Maduro, he is not identified as such in court filings.The previous Trump administration had made Saab’s extradition a top priority, at one point even sending a Navy warship to the African archipelago to keep an eye on the captive.On Saturday. Colombian President Iván Duque lauded the extradition of Saab in a tweet, calling it a “triumph in the fight against drug trafficking, money laundering and corruption led by the dictatorship of Nicolás Maduro.”In response, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodiríguez tweeted that “Alex Saab is an innocent Venezuelan diplomat, a victim of kidnapping and human rights violations who has served our country face with an immoral imperial blockade.”However, the Biden administration has downplayed the importance of Saab's problems, saying he can defend himself in US courts and that his case shouldn't affect ongoing negotiations sponsored by Norway aimed at overcoming Venezuela's long running economic crisis and political tug of war.The government last month appointed Saab to its negotiating team and fellow envoys arrived to Mexico carrying signs reading “Free Alex Saab.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/venezuelan-prez-maduro-s-ally-extradited-to-us-on-money-laundering-charge-101634433297187.html
17-10-2021||World||International Day for Eradication of Poverty today: History, theme||International Day for the Eradication of Poverty is observed every year on October 17 and aims to raise awareness about people living in poverty. According to the United Nations’ website, the day is a chance to acknowledge the efforts and struggles of people living in poverty, a chance for them to make their concerns heard, and a moment to recognise that poor people are the first ones to fight against poverty.The day also reflects the willingness of those living in poverty to utilise their expertise to contribute towards its eradication, according to the UN Website.History of International Day for Eradication of PovertyThe observance of this day goes back to 1987 when more than 100,000 people gathered at the Trocadéro in Paris to honour the victims of extreme poverty, violence and hunger at the unveiling of a commemorative stone by a French priest and humanitarian activist Joseph Wresinski. Proclaiming that poverty is a violation of human rights, such people affirmed the need to come together to ensure that these rights are respected.Four years after Wresinski’s demise in 1988, the general assembly, through a resolution adopted on 22 December 1992, declared October 17 as the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. All states were invited to present and promote activities regarding the eradication of poverty and destitution.Theme for International Day for Eradication of PovertyThis year’s theme is “Building forward together: Ending Persistent Poverty, Respecting all People and our Planet.”Covid-19 pandemic and povertyAccording to the World Bank, the coronavirus pandemic, which struck the world in 2020, pushed between 88 and 115 million people into poverty “with the majority of the new extreme poor being found in South Asian and Sub-Saharan countries where poverty rates are already high.” And this year the number might have increased to 143 and 163 million.UN chief Antonio Guterres said on Friday that extreme poverty is on the rise at present, adding that the pandemic wreaked havoc on economies and societies across the globe. “A lopsided recovery is further deepening inequalities between the Global North and South,” Guterres said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-day-for-eradication-of-poverty-today-history-theme-101634432733162.html

Some 10,000 protesters — many of them carrying banners of Islamist political parties — took to the streets outside the main mosque of the capital, Dhaka, a day after demonstrations on the same site ended in clashes with police.The crowd chanted “Down with the enemies of the Islam” and “Hang the culprits”.Photos showing a copy of the Quran — Islam’s holy book — at the feet of a statue in a Hindu temple in the eastern district of Cumilla triggered the protests and incidents of vandalism at Hindu temples across Bangladesh.“We ask the government to arrest those who defamed the Quran by putting it at the feet of an idol in Cumilla,” Mosaddek Billah Al Madani, president of Bangladesh's Islami Movement. He added that protesters demanded “the death sentence” for those responsible for the images.Separately, in a nearby intersection, about 1,000 Hindus protested the attacks on temples and the killing of two Hindu devotees in another district where several temples were vandalized by Muslim mobs.Police said at least two Hindus were killed in Friday’s attacks.Communal tensions have risen as the minority Hindus celebrate their largest religious festival, the Durga Puja.

On June 1, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged to complete reunification with self-ruled Taiwan and vowed to smash any attempts at formal independence for the island.Recently, Taipei has also expressed that it will not start a war with China but 'it is prepared for it'.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-asks-us-to-speed-up-delivery-of-f-16-fighters-as-china-threat-looms-large-101634428398345.html
17-10-2021||World||China tests space capability, launches nuclear-capable missile: Report||China has tested a new space capability with a hypersonic missile, the Financial Times reported on Saturday.The report, citing multiple sources familiar with the test, said Beijing in August launched a nuclear-capable missile that circled the Earth at low orbit before descending toward its target, which three sources said it missed by over 20 miles (32 kilometers).FT sources said the hypersonic glide vehicle was carried by a Long March rocket, launches of which it usually announces, though the August test was kept under wraps.The report added that China's progress on hypersonic weapons "caught US intelligence by surprise."Along with China, the United States, Russia and at least five other countries are working on hypersonic technology.Hypersonic missiles, like traditional ballistic missiles which can deliver nuclear weapons, can fly at more than five times the speed of sound.But ballistic missiles fly high into space in an arc to reach their target, while a hypersonic flies on a trajectory low in the atmosphere, potentially reaching a target more quickly.Crucially, a hypersonic missile is maneuverable (like the much slower, often subsonic cruise missile), making it harder to track and defend against.While countries like the United States have developed systems designed to defend against cruise and ballistic missiles, the ability to track and take down a hypersonic missile remains a question.China has been aggressively developing the technology, seeing it as crucial to defend against US gains in hypersonic and other technologies, according to a recent report by the US Congressional Research Service (CRS).The reported test comes as US-China tensions have mounted and Beijing has stepped up military activity near Taiwan, the self-ruling US-aligned democracy that Beijing considers a province awaiting reunification.The Pentagon did not immediately respond to an AFP request for comment on the FT report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-tests-space-capability-launches-nuclear-capable-missile-in-space-report-101634426984857.html

17-10-2021||World||UK MP David Amess's killer was referred to counter-terrorism scheme: Report||The attacker who fatally stabbed British lawmaker David Amess was referred to a official counter-terrorist scheme for those thought to be at risk of radicalisation, according to media reports.Police said late Saturday that detectives had until Friday, October 22, to question the suspect after he was detained under the Terrorism Act, which allowed them to extend his detention.Veteran Conservative MP David Amess, 69, was talking with voters at a church in the small town of Leigh-on-Sea east of London when he was stabbed to death on Friday.Police have said they are investigating "a potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism". The investigation is being led by Scotland Yard's Counter Terrorism Command.The BBC said it had received confirmation from Whitehall officials that the man's name is Ali Harbi Ali.Ali, a British citizen of Somali heritage, had been referred to Prevent, the UK's scheme for those thought at risk of radicalisation a few years ago, the BBC reported.'Fast-paced investigation'Ali is believed not have spent long on the programme, which is voluntary in nature, and was never formally a "subject of interest" to MI5, the domestic security agency, said the BBC.Police and security services believe the attacker acted alone and was "self-radicalised", The Sunday Times reported, while he may have been inspired by Al-Shabaab, Al-Qaeda-linked Islamists in Somalia.Ali's father Harbi Ali Kullane, a former adviser to the prime minister of Somalia, confirmed to The Sunday Times that his son was in custody, adding: "I'm feeling very traumatised."Police said they have been carrying out searches at three addresses in the London area in a "fast-paced investigation".The Sun tabloid reported that the attacker stabbed Amess multiple times in the presence of two women staff, before sitting down and waiting for police to arrive.The Daily Mail newspaper reported that he had booked an appointment a week ahead.Candle-lit vigilOn Saturday evening, hundreds of mourners attended a candle-lit vigil at a sports field near the scene of the crime, holding a minute's silence in the MP's memory.Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier visited the crime scene to pay his respects on Saturday, laying floral wreaths outside the church with the leader of the opposition, Labour leader Keir Starmer in a rare show of unity.Local residents including members of the Muslim community also heaped bouquets next to the police tape.Britain's politicians were stunned by the highly public attack, which recalled the murder of a pro-EU lawmaker ahead of the Brexit referendum.In June 2016, Labour MP Jo Cox was killed by a far-right extremist, prompting demands for action against what lawmakers said was "a rising tide" of public abuse and threats against elected representatives.Home Secretary Priti Patel on Friday ordered police across the country to review security arrangements for all 650 MPs and The Sunday Times reported that every MP could be granted security protection when meeting the public.'Cannot be cowed' "We will carry on... We live in an open society, a democracy. We cannot be cowed by any individual," Patel told journalists after laying a wreath for her fellow Essex MP.Tobias Ellwood, a Conservative MP who tried to save a stabbed police officer during a 2017 terror attack near the Houses of Parliament, on Twitter urged "a temporary pause in surgeries, or face-to-face meetings with constituents, until the security review is complete.House of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle in The Observer wrote that "we need to take stock" and review whether security measures introduced after Cox's murder are "adequate to safeguard members, staff and constituents, especially during surgeries".Increasing threatsMPs and their staff have been attacked before, although it is rare.But their safety was thrown into sharp focus by Brexit, which stoked deep political divisions and has led to often angry, partisan rhetoric.Cox's killer repeatedly shouted "Britain first" before shooting and stabbing the 41-year-old MP outside her constituency meeting near Leeds, northern England.Amess was at the other end of the political spectrum and backed Brexit.A specialist police unit set up to investigate threats against MPs in the aftermath of Cox's murder said 678 crimes against lawmakers were reported between 2016 and 2020.Amess himself wrote about public harassment and online abuse in his book "Ayes & Ears: A Survivor's Guide to Westminster", published last year."These increasing attacks have rather spoilt the great British tradition of the people openly meeting their elected politicians," he said.MPs have had to install security cameras and only meet constituents by appointment, he added.Unlike some MPs, Amess publicised meeting times for constituents on Twitter and held them in public places, while asking people to book ahead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-mp-david-amess-s-killer-was-referred-to-counter-terrorism-scheme-report-101634425146553.html

She returned Saturday with her daughter Chelsea Clinton around 8 a.m. Saturday in an SUV accompanied by secret service agents.President Joe Biden said Friday night that he had spoken to Bill Clinton and the former president “sends his best.”“He’s doing fine; he really is,” Biden said during remarks at the University of Connecticut.Clinton, 75, was admitted on Tuesday with an infection unrelated to COVID-19, Ureña said.“He is in great spirits and has been spending time with family, catching up with friends, and watching college football,” said Ureña's Saturday statement.An aide to the former president said Clinton had a urological infection that spread to his bloodstream, but he is on the mend and never went into septic shock, a potentially life-threatening condition.The aide, who spoke to reporters at the hospital on the condition his name wasn’t used, said Clinton was in an intensive care section of the hospital but wasn't receiving ICU care.In the years since Clinton left the White House in 2001, the former president has faced health scares. In 2004, he underwent quadruple bypass surgery after experiencing prolonged chest pains and shortness of breath. He returned to the hospital for surgery for a partially collapsed lung in 2005, and in 2010 he had a pair of stents implanted in a coronary artery.He responded by embracing a largely vegan diet that saw him lose weight and report improved health.Clinton repeatedly returned to the stump, campaigning for Democratic candidates, most notably Hillary Clinton during her failed 2008 bid for the presidential nomination. And in 2016, as Hillary Clinton sought the White House as the Democratic nominee, her husband — by then a grandfather and nearing 70 — returned to the campaign trail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/exus-president-bill-clinton-to-spend-1-more-night-in-california-hospital-101634424308123.html

17-10-2021||India||Violence in Bangladesh part of ethnic cleansing, alleges BJP; demands CAA, NRC in Bengal||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday alleged that the communal violence during Durga Puja in Bangladesh is part of a systematic attack on religious minority groups and the situation calls for implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) in West Bengal. Amid protests in Kolkata and district towns, the BJP’s chief state spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said, “What we are witnessing in Bangladesh is part of a systematic ethnic cleansing that started decades ago. Instead of acknowledging the rights of these Hindus, West Bengal’s erstwhile Left Front government offered ration cards and voting rights to infiltrators from Bangladesh. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) carried this forward, resulting in a radical change in demography in certain parts of the state and pressure on local economy.” “To evade responsibility, the CPI (M) and TMC are claiming that the recent incidents were stray in nature. They are wrong. Millions of Hindus fled Bangladesh after its birth in 1971 and in the subsequent years to escape religious persecution. BJP is the only party that differentiates between refugees and infiltrators and wants to enforce the CAA and NRC,” said Bhattacharya, referring to the killings and alleged rapes in different parts of Bangladesh. CAA offers citizenship to non-Muslims who entered India from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh before 2015. Its critics, among whom chief minister Mamata Banerjee is a prominent face, insist that it is discriminatory as it leaves out Muslims and links citizenship to faith in a secular country. The BJP made CAA an issue during the March-April assembly polls. Union home minister Amit Shah said during campaign that if BJP came to power the new government would give a green signal to the implementation of CAA and the Centre would decide when and how to enforce the new law. However, in Assam, where state polls were held around the same time, the BJP made no such announcement although a chunk of the state’s population comprise refugees from Bangladesh. The BJP won in Assam but bagged only 77 of Bengal’s 294 seats. The TMC countered the BJP, saying only the Centre should deal with the situation in Bangladesh. TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh said, “The BJP should not indulge in politics and create communal tension. Minority communities in both countries need protection. Let Prime Minister Narendra Modi deal with this and interact with the Sheikh Hasina government.”Protests were held by the BJP and several religious groups in Kolkata and the districts on Sunday. The party’s state president Sukanta Majumdar will lead a rally in Kolkata on Tuesday, the party announced. A senior state police official said on condition of anonymity that all police stations in Bengal have been put on alert in view of the violence in Bangladesh since Eid Milad un Nabi, which marks the birthday of Prophet Muhammad, will be celebrated on Monday and Tuesday. Radharaman Das, vice-president of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) unit in Kolkata, led a protest outside the Bangladesh deputy high commission’s office in Kolkata on Sunday evening. Citizens also took part in it. “The violence is continuing for nine days but the international community is not saying a word. Two hundred miscreants stormed into our temple in Noakhali on Friday and vandalized all the idols. Two of our monks were killed. Why are international human rights groups and United Nations silent? We will organise protests across the globe” Das said. BJP’s former national secretary Rahul Sinha demanded the arrest of Indian Secular Front leader and cleric Abbasuddin Siddiqui after a video went viral on social media. In the video, Siddiqui, with whom the CPI (M) forged an alliance in the March-April polls, was purportedly heard referring to the Bangladesh violence and saying that he will kill anyone who insults his faith. The ISF attempted to play down the controversy by issuing a statement that called for communal harmony and demanded punishment for the perpetrators of the violence in the neighbouring country. The ISF also wrote to Sheikh Hasina. The incidents in Bangladesh triggered rumours of communal tension and vandalism in Bengal. One such incident took place at Durgapur in West Burdwan district where some local youths clashed on Saturday night over share of money for drinking alcohol. They damaged three vehicles. Since some of these youths were Muslims, the incident was given a communal colour on social media. Abhishek Gupta, deputy commissioner (east) of Asansol-Durgapur police district said, “Some social media posts are showing fabricated reports that some puja pandal has been damaged in Durgapur. This is totally false. Action will be taken against rumour mongers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/violence-in-bangladesh-part-of-ethnic-cleansing-alleges-bjp-demands-caa-nrc-in-bengal-101634494763237.html
17-10-2021||India||2mn hectares of tree cover lost in 20 years in India, 3/4th of it in NE||India lost almost 2 million hectares (Mha) of tree cover between 2001 and 2020, a decrease of nearly 5% since 2000, according to a study of satellite images conducted by researchers at University of Maryland. Seven states in the northeast accounted for three-fourths of that loss, the study found.In past two decades, India’s northeastern states accounted for 76.7% of the 1.93 Mha of lost tree cover, showed research done at University of Maryland in the United States using over a million satellite images.“Tree cover loss is not the same as deforestation. Tree cover can refer to trees in plantations as well as natural forests, and tree cover loss is the removal of tree canopy due to human or natural causes, including fire,” said the study released by Global Forest Watch, an open data initiative of non-profit World Resources Institute.The seven northeastern states were among top 10 states with maximum tree cover loss in past 20 years. Odisha (7th), Kerala (9th) and Chattisgarh (10th) made up the rest.Assam accounted for the highest share of national tree cover loss in past 20 years at 14.1%, the study said. From 2001 to 2020, the state lost 269 kilohectare (kha) of tree cover, equivalent to a 9.8% decrease in the state’s overall tree cover since 2000. In Assam, two hill districts of Karbi Anglong (97.4 kha) and Dima Hasao (63.2 kha) accounted for the majority share (60%) of tree cover loss. On the other hand, from 2001 to 2012, Assam added 29.9 kha of tree cover, equal to 12% of tree cover gain across India during that period.The small state of Mizoram, which lost 247 kha of tree cover, contributed 13% of India’s total tree-cover loss. The three districts of Champhai (67.6 kha), Lunglei (46 kha) and Aizawl (42.1 kha) accounted for 63% of the loss. Mizoram’s tree cover gain between 2001 and 2012 was 26.3 kha, the study said. Nagaland lost 225 kha of tree cover, which was 11.9% of India’s total loss during that period. Significantly, the state lost 17% of its total tree cover in those 20 years — the sharpest decline in the country. Mon, Tuensang, Mokokchang and Peren districts accounted for 57% of the state’s total loss. Nagaland witnessed 44 kha of tree cover gain from 2001 to 2012. From 2001 to 2020, Arunachal Pradesh, the largest state in northeast, lost 222 kha of tree cover, which was 11.6% of India’s total loss. The state saw 3.5% decline in its tree cover in that period. The districts of West Siang, Lohit, Changland, Longding and Lower Dibang Valley accounted for 51% of Arunachal’s total loss. The state gained 47.8 kha of tree cover from 2001 to 2012. With a loss of 196 kha, Manipur was the 5th highest contributor of tree-cover loss among all states, accounting for 10.3% of the total. There was a 12% decrease in the state’s tree cover in past 20 years. Charachandpur and Tameglong districts contributed 52% of the total loss. The state gained 33.8 kha of tree cover from 2001 to 2012, which was 13% of the country’s total gain in that period. Meghalaya lost 195 kha of tree cover in past 20 years, which was 10.3% of the country’s overall loss. The state lost 12% of its tree cover in that period and the three districts of South Garo Hills, East Khasi Hills and South West Khasi Hills were responsible for 56% of that. Meghalaya gained 19.1 kha of tree cover from 2001 to 2012. With 102 kha of tree cover loss (or 5.5% of India’s total loss), Tripura was the lowest contributor among the northeastern states to the national figure. But from 2001 to 2020, the state lost 15% of its tree cover, the second highest after Nagaland (17%). Dhalai and South Tripura districts accounted 53% of the state’s total loss. The state gained just 1.18 kha of tree cover from 2001 to 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2mn-hectares-of-tree-cover-lost-in-20-years-in-india-3-4th-of-it-in-ne-101634493442459.html

Another grievously wounded labourer was being treated for multiple injuries.All three hailed from outside the Union Territory. The terrorists fired indiscriminately on a group of people, killing two and injuring one, a police spokesperson said soon after the attack. Raja Reshi and Joginder Reshi from Bihar died on the spot. Chun Chun Reshi Das, also from Bihar, sustained multiple injuries and was being treated at the Government Medical College in Anantnag.

A carpenter from Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh was killed at Litter in Pulwama district on the same day.So far, 11 people have been killed in targeted attacks in Kashmir, including five hailing from other states. “The gruesome murder of non-locals is nothing but inhuman, and reveals the frustration of militants, which amounts to genocide,” Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Altaf Thakur said.Nasir Aslam Wani, provincial president of the National Conference party, condemned the murders. “This cycle of killing innocent people is unending,” Wani said in a tweet. “Strongly condemn the barbaric act of terrorism. My heartfelt condolences to their loved ones.”Srinagar mayor Junaid Azim Mattu of the Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party also condemned the killings. “In the strongest of terms condemn yet another barbaric terror attack in Kulgam resulting in the death of two non-local workers. Madness! Senseless and barbaric! My heart goes out to the families of the two deceased and I pray for the recovery of the third injured victim,” Mattu tweeted.Arvind Kumar Sah, a resident of Banka in Bihar, was shot at close range by militants in Srinagar’s Eidgah area on Saturday, while Sageer Ahmad, a carpenter from Saharanpur, was killed at Litter in Pulwama district.On October 7, two teachers – Supinder Kaur, principal of the Government Boys Higher Secondary School, and Deepak Chand, a teacher at the same school in Srinagar’s Eidgah – were shot dead by gunmen inside the school.On October 5, three civilians – Makhan Lal Bindroo, a Kashmiri Pandit and well-known pharmacist in Srinagar; Virender Paswan, a street vendor from Bihar’s Bhagalpur; and Mohammad Shafi Lone, head of a taxi union in Bandipora district – were killed in terror attacks.

17-10-2021||India||Last chance to deliver in Punjab: Sidhu to Sonia||Chandigarh In a letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, state party chief Navjot Singh Sidhu has sought directions to Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi to implement a 13-point programme as a “last damage control measure” ahead of the 2022 assembly polls due in four months. In the four-page letter, written on October 15, that Sidhu made public on Twitter on Sunday, the issues raised broadly included justice in sacrilege cases, tightening the noose around the drug mafia, improvements in the agriculture sector, cheap power, cancellation of power purchase agreements with privately owned thermal plants, welfare of SCs (scheduled castes) and BCs (backward classes), employment generation, easing processes for industry and empowerment of youth and women. It also stressed the need to end mafia in the cable, liquor, sand and transport businesses. “… give your august direction to the state government to act in the best interest of the people of Punjab immediately,” the letter said. Political observers said all efforts by the high command to placate Sidhu seemed to be failing, as he had written the letter the day he met former party president Rahul Gandhi and reportedly assured him to be back as the state unit president but a formal announcement is still awaited. A day before that he had met general secretaries Harish Rawat, state affairs incharge, and KC Venugopal, who deals with organisation matters, to sort out issues concerning the state government and the organisation. The meeting was necessitated by Sidhu’s resignation from the post of state unit head on September 28, showing displeasure over some appointments in Channi’s government. Even after the meeting, the matter seemed far from over. According to Sidhu’s letter, the 13 points are the priority areas, part of the 18-point agenda given to the previous chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh for implementation about three months back. Sidhu termed the suggestions in the letter as a “last chance for resurrection and redemption” for the state and said the government must deliver. For at least four months, the party’s state unit witnessed a prolonged political slugfest that led to the removal of Amarinder as chief minister and Channi was given the charge over a month ago. Sidhu had led the tirade against Amarinder. Despite being advised by the high command to desist from making his displeasures public, Sidhu continues to criticise the state government’s decisions and policies, even those taken after Channi took over. In the letter, Sidhu sought a “personal audience” with the party president to discuss the 13-point agenda for the party’s manifesto keeping in view the upcoming assembly elections. The high command is still to react to the letter. The communication sent to Sonia Gandhi was written on a letter head of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee from Navjot Singh Sidhu but without a designation. “He should clarify in what capacity he’s writing,” said a leader in the state unit, who did not wish to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/last-chance-to-deliver-in-punjab-sidhu-to-sonia-101634493382458.html

On Sunday, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami made the announcement, adding that the state has achieved the feat three months ahead of its target.With this, Uttarakhand has joined six states and UTs, which had earlier completed 100 per cent first dose vaccination against Covid-19 among its adult population.Here are the states and UTs that have achieved 100 per cent first dose vaccination:1.     Himachal Pradesh2.     Goa3.     Sikkim4.     Uttarakhand5.     Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu6.     Ladakh7.     LakshadweepThe northern hill state of Himachal Pradesh was the first Indian state or UT to have achieved the feat in August, state health minister Rajiv Saizal had told news agency ANI.

17-10-2021||India||Bihar scales up Covid-19 vaccination, 3 mega camps before Chhath Puja||Beginning Monday, Bihar will hold three mega vaccination camps to administer Covid-19 jabs to as many adults as possible before Chhath Puja, a major Hindu festival celebrated in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand, in which devotees worship the Sun God. The other two mega camps are scheduled for October 28 and November 7, said executive director of the State Health Society, Bihar, Sanjay Kumar Singh, also the nodal officer for vaccination in the state. The four-day Chhath Puja begins with “Nahaye Khaye” on November 8 this year. The state health department doesn’t want to slacken either its vaccination or testing tempo during the festival months of October and November. Bihar has set a target to vaccinate most of its 7.34 crore adult target population by December 31. Anticipating the fact that people would throng puja pandals during Dussehra, celebrated after a gap of two years after the pandemic in 2020, the state health department converted it into an opportunity to vaccinate those who flocked to puja pandals. A reasonable 17% (1,44,876 doses) of the state’s 854,979 Covid-19 shots between October 11 and 15 were administered at puja pandals. The state health department had tasked district magistrates and civil surgeons to set up special vaccination camps at major puja pandals in their respective districts. With 9,321 jabs, Muzaffarpur topped the districts in terms of doses administered at puja pandals during the five-day period. East Champaran (9,055 doses) and Gopalganj (8,272) came second and third, respectively. State capital Patna was sixth, having administered 7,530 doses, which was 10.55% of the 71,323 doses administered in the district during that period. Sheikhpura topped in terms of coverage percentage, having administered 52.66% of its 2,772 doses at puja pandals during the five-day period. Bhojpur came next, with 43.05% of the district’s 18,895 doses administered at pandals. East Champaran’s performance was good both in terms of number of vaccination doses administered to beneficiaries and coverage percentage (37.45%) at puja pandals during Dussehra. Jamui, with 1,070 doses administered at puja pandals against the district’s 12,402 shots to beneficiaries during Dussehra, Banka (1,007/12,056 doses), Jehanabad (944/13,914), Kishanganj (923/6,012) and Sheohar (179/3,396) were among the five most laggard districts. Bihar reported 495 new Covid-19 cases during the Chhath festival on November 20 last year, when the state’s tally of active cases was 5,603. The situation is better this year. The state did not report any new Covid-19 case during the last 24 hours on Saturday. The count of active cases had also come down to 43, as per the state Covid-19 bulletin released on Saturday. “We want to keep up the tempo and vaccinate the maximum number of the target population while also simultaneously testing as many people as possible to ward off the threat of Covid-19. Though the situation is better, we do not want to lower our guard. We will have three mega vaccination camps before Chhath and will try to vaccinate as many people as possible before the festival,” said Singh. As on Saturday, the state’s first dose vaccination achievement was 65% while that of Patna was 76%. Its second dose achievement against first dose is 30% against Patna’s 60%. Chief minister Nitish Kumar had on Saturday directed officials to test those coming from outside the state either by road or train during the festive season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-scales-up-covid-19-vaccination-3-mega-camps-before-chhath-puja-101634491235130.html
17-10-2021||India||The Week Ahead: Mumbai gears up to reopen colleges and cinemas; ICC Men’s T20 World Cup begins||Mumbai On the back of zero Covid-19 deaths in Mumbai on Sunday October 17, the city is gearing up for another round of unlocking this week – with colleges, universities, cinema halls and auditoriums reopening after 18 months of brick-and-mortar inactivity. The country’s worst-affected city with 751,659 cumulative cases and 16,180 deaths has been gradually reopening following a dramatic drop in both cases and deaths. BMC, the city’s civic body, allowed reopening of shops on all days up to 10 pm in the first week of August, followed by the reopening of local trains for fully vaccinated citizens on August 15. In September it allowed Ganesh festival celebrations for citizens following Covid-appropriate norms and restrictions. The city allowed schools to reopen for Grades 8 to 12 to reopen on October 4, with religious places allowed to start functioning from October 7. This week’s developments will be closely watched by the state’s Covid task force. Meanwhile, nationally, India will have vaccinated 75% of its adult population early next week. As of 9 PM on October 16, the number of persons that had received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine was 695.36 million. India’s projected adult population is 940.2 million. In other data, Google mobility index on retail and recreation had reached 96% of baseline levels on October 11, the latest date for which the data is available, the highest since March 12, 2020. This is expected to rise when the data is available for the week that went by, thanks to the festive season. It will also be worth taking note of the trend in new Covid-19 cases, the seven-day average of which has been falling since May 9 this year. The average of 16,907 cases in the week ending October 15 is the lowest since the average in the week ending March 7 this year, when the seven-day average was 16,744. There is some cheer for cricket fans who may have felt deprived of fast-paced T20 action following the conclusion of this year’s IPL. The ICC Men’s T20 World Cup begins this Saturday, with two lip-smacking matches – Australia play South Africa and England face-off against defending champions West Indies. India plays its first match on Sunday against Pakistan, a team it has never lost to in any ICC tournament. Will the law of averages finally catch up? UEFA Champions League action returns after international football break. On Tuesday, Manchester City plays Club Brugge. In addition, there is Atletico vs Liverpool and PSG vs Leipzig. On Wednesday, there’s Benfica vs Bayern and Manchester United vs the Italian club Atalanta. In the Spanish La Liga, Barcelona play their first El Clasico on Sunday since Lionel Messi’s departure. In other leagues the same day, Manchester United face Liverpool in the English Premier League while Juventus play Inter Milan in Serie A in Italy. Meanwhile, let’s hope Olympic gold medallist Neeraj Chopra participates at the national javelin championships in Delhi this Friday and Saturday. Back to the more serious world of politics and law enforcement, though. A Muslim bangles seller’s bail plea will be heard in Indore on October 20. The four accused, who were arrested for thrashing him, have been granted bail and the seller Taslim Ali is still in jail for allegedly sexually harassing a minor girl. The Madhya Pradesh high court is likely to give its judgment on October 20 in an OBC reservation case where demand is to increase the quota from 14% to 27%. In Uttarakhand, the BJP will start Shahid Samman Yatra from October 18 from Garhwal to honour soldiers killed in action. Assam will start classroom teaching for students of Classes 1 to 8 on October 19, after a six-month break. In Kerala, Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan is expected to visit landslide-affected areas of Kottayam and Idukki on Tuesday after the water subsided on Sunday. The Congress is likely to announce the Pradesh Congress Committee list on Wednesday after much delay because of infighting within the party state unit. In Chhattisgarh, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is likely to reach Raipur during the Chhattisgarh tribal festival, which starts from Friday. State Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel will reach there on Thursday on a two-day visit to Bastar. There is, however, no confirmation of Gandhi’s visit even though state Congress leaders are making all preparations for Friday, party leaders said. President Ram Nath Kovind will be in Bihar to participate in the centenary celebration of the Bihar Legislative Assembly building on October 21. It had hosted its inaugural session of the joint Bihar and Orissa Provincial Council on February 7, 1921. Goa will see a two-day session this week of the state Assembly, the final one for the current tenure. It will likely set the stage for the election season to begin in earnest. One of the bills listed is an amendment to the Goa Preservation of Trees Act to remove the need for having a mandatory tree census. In foreign affairs, external affairs minister S Jaishankar will visit Israel for meetings with leaders of the new government led by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and to take forward cooperation in diverse fields. This will be the first major contact between the two sides following months of political turmoil that led to the ouster of former premier Benjamin Netanyahu. UK foreign secretary Liz Truss is expected to travel to New Delhi and Mumbai for meetings that will focus on an interim trade deal and broader security cooperation across the Indo-Pacific.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-week-ahead-mumbai-gears-up-to-reopen-colleges-and-cinemas-icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-begins-101634491233907.html

The Norwegian Nobel Committee announced its decision to award the coveted prize to the 69-year old nun after considering 56 candidates, among them President Jimmy Carter of the United States, President Urho Kekkonen of Finland and Polish Cardinal Stefan Wyszynsky.Last year, President Anwar Sadat of Egypt and Israel Prime Minister Menachem begin shared the peace prize. President Carter was also proposed then, but the nomination was made after the February 1 deadline. The Nobel Peace Prize insignia, a gold medal and a diploma is presented at a ceremony in the Oslo University hall on Dec. 10 the day of the death of Alfred Nobel, inventor of dynamite. The prize money, amounting to 800,000 Swedish crowns ($191,400), is handed over in private. Giving the grounds for the award to Mother Teresa, Mr John, chairman of the five member committee said she left her position as a teacher to dedicate her life to the destitute of Calcutta. In her later years she extended her operation to other cities and countries and the committee decided to award her the Nobel Peace Prize for her work for humanity. The Committee said “The Roman Catholic order of which she is now the head has in recent years extended its activities to include a number of other Indians cities and other parts of the world.“In making the award the Norwegian Nobel Committee has expressed its recognition of Mother Teresa’s work in bringing help to suffering humanity. This year, the world has turned its attention to the plight of children and refugees, and these are precisely the categories for whom Mother Teresa has for many years worked as selflessly.”The committee placed special emphasis on “the spirit that has inspired her activities and which is the tangible expression of her personal attitude and human qualities”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-october-18-1979-nobel-peace-prize-for-mother-teresa-101634490443201.html

Taking to Twitter, WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan informed on Sunday that the technical advisory group, involved in examining the vaccine, will meet on October 26 to consider the Emergency use listing (EUL) for Covaxin. She further stated that the world health body is working closely with the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech to complete the formalities.“The technical advisory group will meet on Oct 26th to consider EUL (Emergency use listing) for Covaxin. WHO has been working closely with BharatBiotech to complete the dossier. Our goal is to have a broad portfolio of vaccines approved for emergency use & to expand access to populations everywhere,” Dr Soumya Swaminathan tweeted.On WHO's request, Bharat Biotech submitted additional information on the vaccine on September 27. On October 5, the world health body extended giving the EUL to Covaxin by a week. With this recent development, India can now expect the Emergency Use approval for the Covid-19 vaccine by the last week of October.The Emergency Use Listing process - done by WHO and the Technical Advisory Group of independent experts - is centred on determining if a manufactured product (e.g. a vaccine) is quality-assured, safe and effective, WHO informed in a tweet earlier.The indigenously developed Bharat Biotech's Covaxin is one of the six vaccines that have received emergency use authorisation from India's Drug Regulator and is being used in the nationwide anti-COVID-19 inoculation programme along with Covishield and Sputnik V. It was developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Institute of Virology (NIV).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-to-meet-on-oct-26-to-consider-covaxin-s-emergency-listing-101634489938335.html
17-10-2021||India||Delhi's air quality ‘steadily deteriorating’, says Kejriwal; reason to worry||Delhi’s air quality has dropped to ‘very poor’ levels and is “steadily deteriorating”, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday, raising the alarm for the national capital as a thick blanket of the dreadful smog envelopes the city sky. With winter approaching and pollution levels rising to dangerous levels like every year, people have turned their attention towards the air quality index (AQI), largely affected by unfavourable environmental factors, along with vehicular fumes and stubble burning.According to the pollution data by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) at 4pm today, Delhi’s air quality slipped to 298 in the ‘poor’ category, deteriorating day by day. Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai earlier pointed out that the AQI in the city was 171 till October 13 that rose to 284 due to stubble-burning in the neighbouring states.Hitting out at the neighbouring states of Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, the Kejriwal blamed them for the rise in pollution now and appealed to them to "understand" their responsibility and help the farmers dispose of their stubble.The chief minister said that the Delhi government controlled the air pollution and the rise in the air pollution in the city now is because of the stubble burning in the neighbouring states. Kejriwal had on Saturday shared a map showing stubble fires across north India.Stubble fires on 13 and 16 Oct - https://t.co/3bRLbCkiob pic.twitter.com/tsUZogUFHY"Delhi's own pollution, including vehicles and industries, is within the safe limit. I have been tweeting pollution data in Delhi for the last 1 month. Pollution has started increasing from the last 3-4 days, it is the pollution of stubble, which is burning in the surrounding states," Kejriwal said while inaugurating a hospital in Shalimar Bagh.The chief minister further highlighted the Delhi government’s efforts to control the pollution and said that the government made a solution which “if you sprinkle it on the stubble, there is no need to burn it thereafter".How to measure air quality index (AQI)In India, air quality is measured on a 500-point scale where a 0-50 rating is considered good, while anywhere between 301-500 is considered dangerous. Here are the categories:0-50: Good –  None to minimal impact51-100: Satisfactory – People prone to health conditions may experience slight difficulty in breathing101-200: Moderate – People with asthma, lung and heart diseases and other health conditions may experience difficulty in breathing. Children and the elderly may also face slight discomfort.201-300: Poor – Can cause breathing difficulties in people if exposed for longer durations. People with asthma, lung and heart diseases and other health conditions are advised to stay indoors as much as possible.301-400: Very poor – Prolonged exposure to these AQI levels can cause respiratory diseases. People with asthma, lung and heart diseases and other health conditions are particularly affected.401-500: Severe – Extremely unhealthy air, can cause breathing difficulty while light physical exertion too. It can cause respiratory diseases in healthy persons as well as people with lung and heart conditions. Best to stay indoors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhis-air-quality-steadily-deteriorating-says-kejriwal-reason-to-worry-101634489067453.html

We had also held two meetings with Shivpal Yadav at his residence. We have told both OP Rajbhar and Shivpal Yadav that we are ready for an alliance with any party except BJP-Congress,” news agency ANI quoted Owaisi as saying.Also read | ‘AIMIM to hold rallies in west UP after Dussehra’He also said that it would be beneficial for the opposition to contest together in the election and criticised the ruling BJP and said that the party has turned out to be a failure. “There is resentment against BJP in the entire UP, we believe that if we want to convert this resentment into BJP's defeat then we will have to face them together. BJP turned out to be a failure on all governance issues. If we contest together, it will be beneficial,” he further said.However, on October 15, Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) chief Om Prakash Rajbhar had said that he might form an alliance with the BJP, a position which Owaisi has clearly stated his party would not accept. “Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha was formed on the basis of various issues in the society. Whichever party accepts those issues, we will go with them,” news agency ANI quoted the SBSP chief as saying. Also, Rajbhar said that he would make a final call regarding the matter and an announcement to that effect would be made on October 27. He is scheduled to hold a rally in Mau district on that day.Earlier in June this year, Owaisi had announced that his party would contest in 100 seats of the total 403 assembly constituencies in UP and also confirmed his alliance with the Morcha. He had also called upon all like minded parties to come together to stop the BJP. The BJP had won a landslide 312 seats in the 2017 assembly elections in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aimim-ready-for-alliance-with-any-party-except-bjp-congress-owaisi-on-plans-for-up-assembly-polls-101634485669646.html

It said all non-locals have to be shifted to police camps. But later it was clarified that no such advisory was ordered.Police later identified those who were killed on Sunday as Raja Reshi Dev and Joginder Reshi Dev, while Chunchun Reshi Dev was left injured.The incident in Kulgam happened a day after a golgappa seller from Bihar’s Banka, Arbind Sah and a non-local labourer Sagir Ahmad were shot dead in Srinagar and Pulwama, respectively. Ahmad belonged to Uttar Pradesh and worked as a carpenter.The recent spate of attacks against non-locals brings the death toll of civilians killed by armed terrorists to nine in just two weeks. In the first week of October, Makhan Lal Bindroo, a well-known pharmacist in Srinagar, who belonged to the Kashmiri Pandit community, was killed by terrorists. That same evening Virendar Paswan, and Mohammad Shafi Lone were killed in two separate incidents in Srinagar and Bandipora. Paswan was a migrant vendor from Bihar. Following this, terrorists carried out an attack at Government Boys Higher Secondary School in Eidgah on October 8, killing principal Supinder Kaur, a Sikh, and a teacher Deepak Chand, a Hindu from Jammu.Terrorists have also shot dead two other Kashmiris Majid Ahmad Gojri and Mohammad Shafi Dar on October 2, claiming they were police informers.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-police-clarify-no-order-issued-to-shift-non-locals-to-security-camps-101634488175161.html

The umbrella union of the farmers had announced mega protest plan if Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni is not removed from his post. The union on Sunday said it will hold a six-hour nationwide rail roko agitation pressing for the demand of the removal of the minister whose son Ashish Mishra has been arrested in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri violence."To press for its demand for Ajay Mishra's dismissal and arrest, so that justice can be secured in Lakhimpur Kheri violence, SKM has announced a nation-wide rail roko program on October 18," the union said in a statement.While the movement of trains is likely to be impacted, the union said that there will be no destruction or damage to any railway property. The rail roko agitation will be held between 10am and 4pm.On October 3, eight people, including four farmers, were killed in Lakhimpur Kheri as violence broke out after the Union minister's car allegedly ran over four farmers. The other four, including a journalist, died in the violence. Minister's son Asish Mishra is the main accused in the case as the FIR said he was inside the car when this happened. He was arrested by the SIT, though he maintained his stance that he was not in the car at the time of the incident. The Congress is also demanding removal of the minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rail-roko-tomorrow-farmers-to-stop-rail-traffic-for-6-hours-over-lakhimpur-kheri-violence-101634486691635.html

Notably, Charanjit Singh Channi met Amit Shah on October 5 to seek his intervention in sealing the international border in the state to prevent illegal trafficking of drugs and weapons.The SAD chief further likened the Centre's BSF move to an “army rule”, saying the security forces can now enter border areas and arrest anyone.“It (extension of BSF’s operational jurisdiction in Punjab) is like an Army rule. Now half of Punjab is under Centre's rule. BSF can enter Darbar Sahib, Valmiki Temple near border areas & arrest anyone. CM is the culprit. He met Union HM & gave nod," news agency ANI quoted Sukhbir Singh Badal as saying.Meanwhile, the Punjab Chief Minister criticised the Centre's over the move, dubbing it as an "attack on federalism". "I strongly condemn the GoI's (government of India) unilateral decision to give additional powers to BSF within the 50 km belt running along the international borders, which is a direct attack on federalism. I urge the Union Home Minister @AmitShah to immediately rollback this irrational decision," Channi tweeted on Wednesday.For the unversed, the central government has amended the BSF Act to authorise the force to undertake search, seizure and arrest within a larger 50 km stretch, instead of the existing 15 km, from the international border in Punjab, West Bengal and Assam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-culprit-sad-chief-targets-charanjit-singh-channi-over-bsf-move-in-punjab-101634479880729.html

Further, Tikait also claimed that the gruesome killing was a “conspiracy” and warned that the government could deteriorate the situation.He said that the Nihangs have told the farmers that the killing was a religious matter. “They (Nihangs) have said it is a religious matter and the government should not link it to farmers' protest. We are talking to them that they are not needed here as of now. Government can deteriorate the situation. The conspiracy was executed by governments,” news agency ANI quoted Tikait as saying.Also read | All three accused in Singhu border killing sent to six-day police custodyThe remarks from the BKU leader came as the three accused in the case -- Narayan Singh, Bhagwant Singh and Govind Preet Singh -- were produced before a Sonipat court earlier in the day and were then sent on a six-day police custody. Meanwhile, another accused named Sarvajeet Singh was arrested by Sonipat police earlier on Friday and was sent to a seven-day police custody.The Nihangs alleged that the victim Lakhbir Singh has desecrated a Sikh holy book for which he was reportedly killed. The killing has stirred up the tensions around the farmers protests as the deceased Lakhbir Singh was a Dalit farm labourer and is survived by his wife and three children. The Nihangs are an order within the Sikhs marked by their blue robes and swords.Meanwhile, the protesting farmer unions have distanced themselves from the incident. The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmers unions spearheading the protests, said that the Nihangs and the deceased were both not related to the union. The BKU too said that more security cameras would be installed at the protest sites. In addition, the volunteers at work on these sites would now be appointed by the SKM, which was earlier done by the local farm unions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-shouldn-t-link-it-to-farmers-protest-rakesh-tikait-on-singhu-border-lynching-101634482810073.html
17-10-2021||India||India to host meeting of NSAs of regional countries to discuss Afghanistan||India is expected to host a meeting of national security advisers (NSAs) of countries in the region, including Pakistan and China, next month to discuss the situation in Afghanistan. This will be the first such meeting to be convened by India since the Taliban marched into Kabul in mid-August, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. There was no official word on the development. Besides China and Pakistan, regional countries such as Iran, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan have also been invited to the meeting, the people said. There are no plans to invite the Taliban to the meeting in line with the Indian side’s decision not to rush into recognising the current dispensation in Kabul. There was no word from the Pakistani or Chinese side regarding participation in the meeting, which is expected to be held during November 10-11.The Indian side earlier had plans to convene a similar meeting in April, with the participation of the former Ashraf Ghani government. However, this was scrapped due to the second wave of Coronavirus infections in India and rapidly evolving situation in Afghanistan at the time. It remains to be seen whether Pakistan’s NSA Moeed Yusuf will agree to join a meeting on Afghanistan at which the Taliban are not present. The Pakistani side, and particularly Yusuf, have been pressing the world community to recognise the Taliban setup. India last week confirmed its participation in the next round of the Moscow Format dialogue to be hosted by Russia on October 20. A joint secretary from the external affairs ministry will represent India at the meeting, which will be attended by a senior Taliban delegation. The Moscow Format also includes China, Pakistan and Iran. The Moscow Format meeting will be preceded by a meeting of the “Extended Troika” – which brings together the special envoys of Russia, the US, China and Pakistan – in Moscow on October 19.India had opened channels of communication with some Taliban factions and leaders last year. Sher Mohammed Abbas Stanekzai, a key player in the group’s political office in Qatar and the current deputy foreign minister, met India’s ambassador to Qatar, Deepak Mittal, at the Indian embassy in Doha on August 31, the first officially acknowledged contact between the two sides. India has stepped up efforts to forge a unified global response to the situation in Afghanistan amid concerns about terrorism spilling over into the region from Afghan soil. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has cautioned the world against rushing to recognise the current setup in Kabul as the change of power was not inclusive and done without negotiations. The Indian side has called for the creation of an inclusive government that delivers on counter-terrorism commitments and protects human rights, including those of women and minorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-host-meeting-of-nsas-of-regional-countries-to-discuss-afghanistan-101634482882030.html
17-10-2021||India||Centre says it's trying to stabilise onion prices by releasing buffer stock||The Central government is trying to stabilise the price of onions by releasing buffer stocks in states where onions are being sold above the all-India average price, and where price has been on the rise from last month, the ministry of food and consumer affairs said on Sunday.The ministry also said that onion stocks are being released on a first-in-first-out basis in the market since the last week of August to ensure prices remain moderate and loss due to storage can be minimised. Thus, the all-India average retail price of onion was at ₹37.06 per kg, while the average wholesale rate was ₹30 per kg on October 14, as a result of releasing onion stocks in a calibrated manner, the ministry added."Till October 12, a total of 67,357 tonnes have been released in major markets such as Delhi, Kolkata, Lucknow, Patna, Ranchi, Guwahati, Bhubaneshwar, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Mumbai, Chandigarh, Kochi and Raipur," the official release stated.Also Read: Food prices edge up, government keeps close watchThe government has also offered to sell states and union territories onion from its buffer stock at an ex-storage rate of ₹21 per kg.Onion, a basic and valuable ingredient in Indian households, is impacted by seasonal changes which can cause prices to increase. Centre built a record reserve of 200,000 tonnes of onions in August to help deal with any major spikes in prices, Hindustan Times had reported.Data collected in the past has shown that September marks the beginning of a three-month lean season as stocks from previous harvests are depleted by now and fresh harvest arrives in winter. Thus, the government maintained a robust buffer stock so they can release onions “as and when needed” from its own reserves to keep rates stable.The ministry also said that similar efforts are being made to soften the prices of potatoes and tomatoes.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/center-says-it-s-trying-to-stabilise-onion-prices-by-releasing-buffer-stock-101634481239805.html

This is the third attack in two days as two non-local labourers were killed in two separate attacks on Saturday. The terrorists fired indiscriminately, J&K police said, though their target was labourers from outside of the state. The attack comes as the Valley is witnessing a spate of attacks on civilians, including people who have come to the Valley from outside.  The pattern of targetting outsiders has spread scare among the non-locals while J&K leaders say this is to malign Kashmiris.Those who were killed on Sunday have been identified as Raja Reshi Dev, Joginder Reshi Dev. Chunchun Reshi Dev is injured. All of them are from Bihar, ANI reported.   #Terrorists fired indiscriminately upon #NonLocal labourers at Wanpoh area of #Kulgam.

The ‘All About Alcohol’ museum has opened in Goa’s Candolim, the tourist destination popular for its locally distilled drink ‘feni’ --made with either coconut or cashews -- and is dedicated to the state’s rich heritage.The one-of-its-kind museum in Candolim displays a wide variety of centuries-old bottles of the alcoholic drink feni dating back to 1950s, glassware, old wooden dispensers and measuring equipment to enlighten tourists about the little known history behind the popular local drinks."The objective behind starting the museum was to make the world aware of Goa’s rich heritage, especially the story of feni, the strong local drink," said Nandan Kudchadkar, the founder of ‘All About Alcohol’ museum, while speaking to news agency ANI. A businessman by profession, Kudchadkar is an avid collector of antiques and also the owner of Club LPK in Candolim.Kudchadkar said that they do not promote the habit of liquor consumption, but the gallery has been set up to showcase the unique and rich legacy of brewing feni in the coastal state.
17-10-2021||India||Sun rays will illuminate Ram Temple's sanctum sanctorum every Ram Navami: Report||Every ram Navami, sun rays will fall inside the sanctum sanctorum of the under-construction Ram Temple in Ayodhya, a member of the Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust told PTI explaining how a model is being planned in consultation with scientists, astronomers and other technical experts to build the Ram Temple in such a way. The design will be inspired by Konark's Sun Temple, the report said. “The Sun temple at Konark in Odisha is an example where the sun rays reach inside the temple. In such a situation, all the technical aspects and state-of-the-art technology are being considered regarding how the rays of the sun reach the sanctum (of Ram temple),” Kameshwar Choupal told PTI. As efforts are on to throw open the main temple for visitors by December 2023, work is going on at a fast pace. The first phase of the foundation has been already completed and the second phase will be over by mid-November. Ram temple in Ayodhya: Bricks donated in 1980s likely to be preserved, displayedA committee consisting of experts from the National Institute of Building Construction, including Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, IIT Mumbai, and IIT Roorkee, has been brainstorming on the technical aspects related to the construction of the temple. The geological, geographical and ecological conditions are being taken into consideration, the report said. “From November 15, the work of construction of the plinth (the base part of the pillar) will also start. The construction of pillars and overhead structure on the plinth is expected to start from April 2022,”  the member said. Instead of two floors planned initially, three floors will be constructed. The member told the news agency that the temple will have a museum, archives room, research centre, auditorium, gaushala, tourist centre, administrative building, yoga centre and other facilities.The earthquake-prone nature of the area and the vicinity of a river are also being kept in mind, while the entire area comes under the Himalayan region.The temple will display the bricks which were donated between 1987 and 1989, during the Ram Mandir movement. “Bricks will not be used in the construction of Ram Mandir as they are not durable. But the shilas (bricks) donated by devotees during the Ram Mandir movement are of immense importance for us. They are likely to be preserved and displayed at Ram Janmabhoomi,” a Trust member said earlier.The structure of the upcoming Ram temple in Ayodhya would have a minimum life of 1,000 years as the Trust is aiming at an engineering marvel.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sun-rays-will-illuminate-ram-temple-s-sanctum-sanctorum-every-ram-navami-report-101634474380461.html
17-10-2021||India||Cloudburst may have led to latest Kerala disaster, say experts||For the last four years Kerala has been witnessing a series of natural disasters. Every year, disasters seem to happen in the state. In August 2018 a major flood, often touted as the flood of the century, claimed 483 lives. In August 2019, 48 people died after a portion of a hill came down in Kavalappara near Nilambur in Malappuram district and in August 2020, 74 people were killed in Pettimudi in Idukki district after a landslide wiped out a settlement of tea plantation workers. In October 2021, two landslides claimed many lives in Idukki and Kottayam districts. But inhabitants of Kootickal and Kokkayar, two affected hamlets, say tragedy visited them for the first time. Weather experts said cloud bursts must have triggered torrential rain at several places in Kottayam and Idukki districts. Cloud burst is a pattern of torrential downpour in a limited area in a short time. “The pattern of the rains shows it is a cloudburst. Some of the areas in Idukki and Kottayam received more than 20 cm downfall in two-three hours,” said Dr M G Manoj, head of the advanced centre for atmospheric radar research with the Cochin University of Science and Technology. “We need long and short term strategies to tackle such tragedies. Usually soil study or soil piping phenomena are not done while constructing houses. Proper geological studies are needed at least for new dwelling units now,” said Dr Manoj adding that in changing times everyone will have to expect the unexpected. “We can reduce the intensity of the disaster by listening to early warnings and disseminating them to targeted audience. We need more studies in hazard reduction areas,” he said adding in India there is no serious study on land use. After the Kavalappara tragedy in 2019 many experts said soil piping is rampant in many areas of the state but no serious study was done. “Soil piping and lateral spread (it occurs when soil starts moving downhill) are more visible in Kerala these days. These two are recipes for major disasters. Like cloud pattern, soil pattern is also undergoing a sea change,” said Dr V Nandakumar of the National Centre for Earth Science Studies. “We cannot control rain. But we can mitigate damage triggered by extreme rainfall. Human intervention plays a key role in multiplying damages at several places,” he said. Recently in Kozhikode (north Kerala) there was a mysterious sound and vibrations in a newly-built house. Later geologists and other experts examined the house and found that soil piping or lateral spread may have triggered them and asked occupants to shift from the area for more investigation. Though natural disasters are largely attributed to climate change many ecologists say human intervention is partly responsible for recurring mishaps. They say many landslides are triggered by unscientific developmental work carried out in ecologically-sensitive areas. They lament such pertinent issues come up for discussion only when a tragedy strikes and is forgotten till the next one occurs. Renowned environmental scientist Dr V S Vijayan, a member of the expert panel on Western Ghats, said Kerala was going through a man-made disaster and the impact would have been limited if the Gadgil Committee recommendations aimed at protecting the ecologically-fragile mountain range of the Western Ghats was implemented in earnest. He said if the situation continued like this, Kerala should get ready for more such disasters. “It is a fact nobody can stop rain or control floods. Due to climate change such tragedies are bound to increase. We have seen heat waves in some western counties. But we can take measures to lower the intensity of such tragedies. Quarrying and unbridled developmental activities are still rampant in many ecologically-sensitive areas of Kerala,” said Vijayan. In 2010, the Union Environment Ministry had set up an expert panel under noted environmental scientist Madhav Gadgil following an uproar that Western Ghats, a UNESCO world heritage site that plays an important role in breaking rain clouds over the subcontinent, was shrinking fast. When all six states falling under the Ghat region (Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra and Gujarat) opposed recommendations of the Gadgil panel another committee was constituted under former ISRO chief Kasturirangan. Later many states also opposed the toned-down Kasturirangan report and both are now lying in government cupboards for many years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cloudburst-may-have-led-to-latest-kerala-disaster-say-experts-101634475501100.html
17-10-2021||India||Finishing off rivals through central agencies new policy: Sanjay Raut attacks Centre||Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Sunday came down heavily on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Centre, alleging the misuse of investigative agencies. This attack came after a few ministers in the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government faced the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Income Tax raids.Raut alleged that Central investigating agencies are working at the behest of the ruling party to finish off political rivals in Maharashtra. "Is there a rule of law or (a rule of) raids in Maharashtra? This is the question which comes to one's mind considering the record-break raids being conducted through Central investigating agencies," news agency PTI quoted Raut as writing in the Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' of which he is the executive editor.Earlier, Delhi rulers used to lie but now (ordering) frequent raids have become a new business without any capital investment, PTI reported him saying further.Finishing off the unwanted political rivals through these agencies seems to have become a new policy, Raut stated."Use people's money, government machinery to remove political opponents. In the past, contract killings were the order of the day in Mumbai (when Underworld was active). Hitmen were hired on contract to kill rivals (by gangs). This is now replaced by 'government killing'. Central investigating agencies are working as contract killers for the party in power in Delhi," Raut was quoted as saying.Speaking over the arrest of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Nawab Malik's son-in-law Sameer Khan by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), Raut said that anti-drug agency could find only herbal tobacco in Khan's possession even though he was arrested under the pretext of his involvement in a drug racket and put in jail for eight months."Now the court has granted him bail. The court said herbal tobacco was found in the possession of Khan and not drugs. Malik should file cases against NCB officials," Raut said in the write-up.The Sena leader then went on to attack the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for raiding homes of former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh instead of finding out the whereabouts of Param Bir Singh, the former commissioner of Mumbai police, who had accused Deshmukh of corruption with the help of some police officers when he was serving as the home minister of the state.Raut also slammed the raids conducted recently by the Income Tax department on the family members of NCP leader and Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar. (With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/finishing-off-rivals-through-central-agencies-new-policy-raut-attacks-centre-101634462141229.html

He said that Vadra, the general secretary of the All India Congress Committee (AICC), was the most popular political figure in the state.Further, he also claimed that a CM candidate not being declared would not affect the party’s chances in the polls as a personality like Vadra would head the charge against the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is currently in power in the state.“So, the people are impressed by her and currently in the entire state, no politician is more popular than Priyanka Gandhi. As far as around whom the campaign will be centred, we are fortunate that Priyanka Gandhi is available for (campaigning) all the time,” Punia said during an interview with news agency PTI.Also read | Congress to elect new president in Aug-SeptHe also ascertained that the election campaign would revolve around her. “People talk about a CM face as votes are sought on that face, for us the biggest face is that of Priyanka Gandhi and the affection that people have for her cannot be matched by any person who is declared a CM face. So for us we have such a personality who will be helpful for us in polls in every way,” he further said.Describing the polls as a direct contest between the BJP and the Congress, he said that the local parties such as the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) have “fallen behind” and “were not in the fight anymore.”Following the recent violence in Lakhimpur Kheri, where eight people, including four farmers, were killed, Vadra visited the families of the farmers and offered them her condolences. She was detained on her way to the district, a move for which she had heavily criticised the Yogi Adityanath government. Lauding her for this, Punia said that she had fought for truth regarding the Lakhimpur violence and other issues such as the Sonbhadra, Unnao or the Hathras incidents.Watch | 'I am a...': Sonia Gandhi slams G23 rebels, praises Rahul amid Punjab Cong dramaPunia, on October 15, was appointed as the chairman of the Congress party’s election campaign committee in UP, according to an order from the party’s interim president Sonia Gandhi.

In the past week, at least nine soldiers have lost their lives, he added.Jammu & Kashmir under BJP rule:- Highest unemployment rate of 21.6 % across all states - At-least 30 civilians, including locals, local minorities & immigrants from other states, have been killed by terrorists this yr- 9 soldiers have lost their lives in the last week (1/2)In a subsequent tweet, Kharge also said that there was a lack of safety and protection in the Union territory due to which there has been a “mass exodus of J&K’s minorities.”- Mass exodus of J&K's minorities for lack of safety and protection.- Inflation at 7.39% making Kashmir one of the costliest places to liveSituation in J&K is grim.

17-10-2021||India||‘NE states accounted for 76% of India’s tree cover loss in past 20 years’: Study||India lost nearly 2 million hectares (Mha) of tree cover between 2001 and 2020, an overall decrease of nearly 5% tree cover since 2000. Seven states in the northeast accounted for three-fourth of that loss, according to a global study. Research by the University of Maryland in the United States, using over a million satellite images, found that in the past two decades, northeastern states accounted for 76.7% of the 1.93 Mha of tree cover lost in that period. “Tree cover loss is not the same as deforestation. Tree cover can refer to trees in plantations as well as natural forests, and tree cover loss is the removal of tree canopy due to human or natural causes, including fire,” the study released by Global Forest Watch, which partners Google, USAID among others, said. Significantly, all seven states in the northeast were among the top 10 states with maximum tree cover loss in the past 20 years. Odisha stood seventh, Kerala came ninth while Chattisgarh was at the tenth spot. According to the results of the study seen by HT, with 14.1%, Assam accounted for the highest share of tree national tree cover loss in the past two decades. From 2001 to 2020, the state lost 269kha of tree cover, equivalent to a 9.8% decrease in the state’s overall tree cover since 2000. The two hill districts of Karbi Anglong (97.4kha) and Dima Hasao (63.2kha) accounted for the majority share (60%) of tree cover loss in Assam. The small state of Mizoram, which lost 247 thousand hectares (kha) of tree cover, contributed 13% of India’s total tree cover loss. The three districts of Champhai (67.6kha), Lunglei (46kha) and Aizawl (42.1kha) accounted for 63% of the loss. Mizoram’s tree cover gain between 2001 and 2012 was 26.3kha, the study said. Nagaland lost 225kha of tree cover, which was 11.9% of India’s total loss during that period. Significantly, the state lost 17% of its total tree cover in those 20 years—the sharpest decline among all states. Mon, Tuensang, Mokokchang and Peren districts accounted for 57% of the state’s total loss. Nagaland witnessed 44kha of tree cover gain from 2001 to 2012. From 2001 to 2020, Arunachal Pradesh, the largest state in the northeast, lost 222kha of tree cover, which was 11.6% of India’s total loss. The state saw a 3.5% decline in its tree cover in that period. The districts of West Siang, Lohit, Changland, Longding and Lower Dibang Valley accounted for 51% of Arunachal’s total loss. The state gained 47.8kha of tree cover from 2001 to 2012. With a loss of 196kha, Manipur was the 5th highest contributor of tree cover loss among all states accounting for 10.3% of the total. There was a 12% decrease in the state’s tree cover in the past 20 years. Charachandpur and Tameglong districts contributed 52% of the total loss. The state gained 33.8kha of tree cover from 2001 to 2012, which was 13% of the country total gain in that period. Meghalaya lost 195kha of tree cover in the past 20 years which was 10.3% of the country’s overall loss. The state lost 12% of its tree cover in that period and the three districts of South Garo Hills, East Khasi Hills and South West Khasi Hills were responsible for 56% of the tree cover loss. Meghalaya gained 19.1kha of tree cover from 2001 to 2012. With 102kha of tree cover loss (or 5.5% of India’s total loss), Tripura was the lowest contributor among northeastern states to the national figure. But from 2001 to 2020, the state lost 15% of its tree cover, the second-highest after Nagaland (17%). Dhalai and South Tripura districts accounted for 53% of the state’s total loss. The state gained just 1.18kha of tree cover from 2001 to 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ne-states-accounted-for-76-of-india-s-tree-cover-loss-in-past-20-years-study-101634468182379.html

The students' association said the skit performance was not meant to hurt anyone's sentiments and the association will ensure that no such activity takes place in future, news agency ANI reported.“Video clip of a Ramleela skit by some students of AIIMS has been circulating on social media. On behalf of the students, we apologise for the conduct of this skit which wasn't meant to hurt anyone’s sentiments. We'll ensure that no such activity takes place in future,” the statement read.The skit gave a modern spin of the Ramayana where, in a viral clip, Shurpanakha was seen singing 'tu cheez badi hai mast mast' to Lakshman. After Lakshmana cut the modern Shupanaka's nose, she is heard saying, ‘Tu janta nahi mera bhai kaun hai (Do you know who my brother is?)’. The speeches are accompanied by peals of laughter, as evident in the videos that are being circulated on social media. The modern take of the Ramayana was chastised by social media users as they said that in its attempt to become humorous, the students have actually insulted the Hindu religion. Reports said the show was hosted by first-year MBBS student Soyeb Aftab and an education app, previously criticised for many questionable moves sponsored the show. Ramayana mocked & insulted by the youth at Delhi AIIMS during #Ramleela. Reportedly the show was Hosted by a 1st-year MBBS student Soyeb Aftab. Education app @unacademy is blatantly supporting all the disrespect and mockery of Sanatan dharma by showing the videos on its platform. pic.twitter.com/EWwebRTPVNMany snippets from the performance were flagged by social media users as problematic while many pointed out the religious identity of the host of the show. 'Many actors performing must be Hindus,' a social media user wrote, making the point that not only the maker, but the actors of the show were equally responsible.  The video was posted by the education app in its vlog. This is not the first time that Aftab Soyeb has done it.He is a repeat offender and has mocked Hindu Gods in past in utterly disgusting way.Good that Unacademy removed the video asap.Strong action against Aftab is needed. #ArrestAIIMSCulpritsBJP spokesperson Suresh Nakhua said this is not the first time that Aftab Soyeb has done it. "He is a repeat offender and has mocked Hindu Gods in past in utterly disgusting way. Good that Unacademy removed the video asap. Strong action against Aftab is needed," he tweeted.
17-10-2021||India||Assam Congress working president writes to UN on Bangladesh violence||Working president of opposition Congress in Assam, Kamalakhya Dey Purkayastha, has written to United Nations about the series of violence that took place in Bangladesh during the Durga Puja festival following a social media post about the alleged desecration of the Quran at a Durga Puja pandal in Comilla district.The MLA from the Karimganj district has written to the Human Rights Council branch office of the UN, asking them to intervene. Dey, who represents North Karimganj, has also written to Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina and requested her to set an example by taking strong actions against the miscreants.In his letter to the UN, Purkayastha wrote, “I am intending to shed some light about the barbaric incidents that happened in Bangladesh. There are wide-scale reports of vandalism at the pandals during Durgapuja and created havoc. The media reports and viral videos are suggesting that miscreants not only demolished the Durga idols but also attacked the devotees. This has resulted in outrage in India. People here are worried about those staying and facing this kind of situation in the neighbouring country. Hence, I request you to immediately intervene in this matter and kindly ensure the safety of the people there.”In his opinion, the attacks on minorities in Bangladesh will provoke other countries to mistreat their religious minorities.Talking to Hindustan Times, Kamalakhya said, “In Bangladesh, Hindus are minorities but there are other countries where Muslims are minorities too. If the majority of Muslims in Bangladesh keep mistreating the minority Hindus, it’ll provoke people in other countries to do the same with Muslims. I think the government of Bangladesh needs to address this issue properly and give a message to the world.”Karimganj shares a large border with Bangladesh and locals are connected to each other socially and culturally. In his letter to Bangladesh PM, he mentioned how people in India are looking at the violence against minorities in Bangladesh.Kamalakhya Dey Purkayastha has been vocal on several issues and is critical of several decisions of the state and the central government. He also wrote to prime minister Narendra Modi, requesting him to intervene.People in Barak Valley have condemned the violence against religious minorities in Bangladesh.Hindu Chatra Sangha from Cachar district has written to the PM of India, PM of Bangladesh, Ministry of External Affairs and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Bangladesh, to ensure the security of the general Hindu populace of the neighbouring nation and compensate those who lost their homes, lives of close ones and got injured in the violent attacks.Subhashis Choudhary from the student organisation said, “During the religious festival, almost every year, we see Hindus getting harassed and sometimes killed in Bangladesh. But being a more powerful country, India keeps watching. The leaders speak about Hindutva during elections but they hardly take a stand against such violence when it is actually required.”Dilbagh Hussain, a resident of Lailapur said, “It is very shameful and unfortunate. I feel ashamed after seeing this. How can a human treat another this way? Those who are involved in this act of violence must be punished so that no one can dare the same in future. We all should respect others’ beliefs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-congress-working-president-writes-to-un-on-bangladesh-violence-101634464281303.html
17-10-2021||India||India looks to host NSA-level meet on Afghanistan next month; China, Pakistan invited: Report||India is likely to host a national security advisor-level meeting on Afghanistan in New Delhi next month, which will be the first-of-its-kind dialogue to be hosted by New Delhi, ANI reported. The tentative dates of the proposed in-person dialogue are November 10-11 and the format will be similar to the regional security conference held in Iran in 2019, the reports said. Pakistan and China are likely to be invited to take part in the meeting, apart from Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.The ANI report said that the invitation has been extended to Pakistan's NSA Moeed Yusuf, though there is no official confirmation.Also Read: India to participate in Moscow Format dialogue on AfghanistanReports said that the conference was on the cards even before the Taliban takeover of the country. New Delhi was planning to hold a conference on Afghanistan before, but the move was derailed during the pandemic and then the Afghanistan government was toppled by the Taliban.If Pakistan agrees to attend the NSA-level conference, it would mark the first visit by incumbent NSA Yusuf to India, the report said. It is, however, contrary to Pakistan's policy to attend a conference on Afghanistan where there will be no representation from the Taliban. The conference will take place after New Delhi and Taliban representatives meet face-to-face in Russia on the Moscow Format, to be held on October 20. There will be no Taliban representative attending New Delhi's conference as reports said that India is wary of hosting the Taliban as the group is yet to address international concerns of inclusivity on the government and human rights by the government.On the question of recognising the Taliban rule in Afghanistan, India has clarified its stance that it will stand by the Afghan people. PM Modi has urged the international community to ensure that Afghan territory does not become a source of radicalisation and terrorism.The first official contact between New Delhi and the Taliban was on August 31 when the ambassador of India to Qatar, Deepak Mittal, met Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai, the head of Taliban's political office in Doha. That meeting took place at the Embassy of India in Doha at the request of the Taliban side.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-looks-to-host-nsa-level-meet-on-afghanistan-next-month-china-pakistan-invited-report-101634461651823.html
17-10-2021||India||Rains subside in Kerala, massive search on for missing people||Heavy downpour, triggered by low pressure in the Arabian Sea, subsided a bit on Sunday but the unseasonal rain has left a trail of destruction in two central Kerala districts claiming 18 lives while many are still missing. Defence forces are helping the district administrations in removing the mound of slush and boulders to locate the missing. Kottayam and Idukki district administrations have confirmed the death of 14 people so far but local people said the death toll is higher than 20 and at least 14 people are still missing from two worst-affected areas in Kottickal in Kottayam and Kokkayar in Idukki district.“I was playing outside the house when I heard a deafening noise. When my father and others came out, we saw gushing water and boulders coming down from the nearby hill. Our house was decimated in no time and we were swept away in seconds. I got hold of a tree branch and later fell into a stream and swam across it,” said 11-year-old Jabin, who had a miraculous escape. He is undergoing treatment in a hospital in Poonjar for a minor fracture. Search is on for his missing father and other relatives. In Kottickal, three generations of a family of six were washed away in surging waters. Bodies of grandmother Claramma Joseph (65), her daughter-in-law and a grandchild were recovered. Survivors in Kottickal said even in the worst flood of 2018 they were least affected and the area has no history of landslides or flash floods. Heavy rains began in Kottickal area on Friday night and a landslide took place around 10 in the morning on Saturday. The whole area was cut off after roads were damaged, local residents said. Water and slush travelled around 12 kms to hit human settlements. Though rains subsided, the threat of landslides and severe waterlogging across multiple districts continues, according to rescue officials. Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in a Facebook post on Sunday said the government will do everything possible to save lives and rescue operation is in full swing. He said 105 relief camps have been set up and asked people in camps to adhere to Covid-19 protocol to ward off the pandemic threat.Weather experts said cloud bursts triggered torrential rains at several places in Kottayam and Idukki districts. Cloud burst is a pattern of torrential downpour in a limited area in a short span.“The pattern of the rains shows it is a cloudburst. Some of the areas in Idukki and Kottayam received more than 20 cms rainfall in two to three hours,” said Dr M G Manoj, Cochin University of Science and Technology. Union Home Minister Amit Shah has assured all help to Kerala. “We are continuously monitoring the situation in parts of Kerala in the wake of heavy rains and flooding. The central government will provide all possible help to the state,” he tweeted on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rains-subside-in-kerala-massive-search-on-for-missing-people-101634460379388.html

He wrote a letter to Sonia Gandhi and shared a copy of the same on Twitter.Further, with an eye on the upcoming assembly polls next year, Sidhu also asked for a personal meeting to present his 13-point agenda which is to be part of the poll manifesto.“I further request you to kindly give me a personal audience to present to you the Punjab Model with a 13-Point Agenda to be part of the Congress Manifesto for the 2022 Assembly Elections, which is separate from this by means of its long-term vision to be implemented over a longer period of time, have crafted it through years of consultations with academics, civil society, party workers and feedback from the People of Punjab,” Sidhu said.pic.twitter.com/IvOO72wjxeSidhu recently resigned as the president of Punjab Congress Committee, however, following the Congress central leadership’s intervention, he was asked to withdraw the resignation and continue with his duties, a decision by which he followed.Starting afresh, Sidhu in his letter wrote, “Punjab for decades was the richest state of the country and today it is the most indebted state of India.

17-10-2021||India||Food prices edge up, government keeps close watch||Vegetable prices, especially of tomato and onion, have risen in urban centres, including the national capital, on the back of higher fuel prices and damage to summer crops due to heavy rains, wholesale and retail trade data showed on Sunday. Edible-oil prices continue to be dearer due to high global prices, prompting the Union government last week to tighten measures such as requiring traders to reveal stocks. On October 13, the Union government wrote to states to ensure prices of edible oils are brought down after cuts in import duty until March 22. The Union government has built a record reserve of 200,000 tonnes of onions to deal with potential spikes in onion prices during the current lean season. Prices of some food items, where seasonality plays a big role, tend to be volatile. Onion is one of them. Its rates often stoke food inflation and knock the monthly budgets of consumers, poor or rich, because the vegetable is a base ingredient of most Indian dishes. Past data shows onion prices usually tend to rise during September because the month marks the beginning of a nearly three-month lean season when stocks from previous crops deplete. Fresh harvests usually arrive in markets in the winter. Tomato prices shot up to ₹60-65 a kg, while onions were selling for ₹50-55 per kg in Delhi, Patna, Kolkata and Mumbai, up from ₹20-25, price data from agricultural produce market committees showed. Rains in Karnataka and Maharashtra have upended supply lines and damaged crops in key growing regions, said Arun Solanki of Nashik-based Solanki India Ltd, a major supplier of vegetables grown in Maharashtra. “There is ₹10-15 increase in prices of these vegetables as supply has slowed. Back-end suppliers say this is because of heavy rains this summer,” SP Gupta of New Delhi’s Ghazipur wholesale vegetable and fruit market said. Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are major onion-producing states, accounting for over 75% of total summer onion output. All of these states witnessed delays or damage to summer onion crops. Price rise is a key determinant of monetary policies. Moderate inflation helps the Reserve Bank to keep interest rates low to spur economic activity, which has been hit by the pandemic. “Onions, a staple in most Indian households, are likely to make consumers cry again with erratic monsoon leading to an eventual delay in harvest,” Crisil Ltd, a rating firm, said in a recent research note. The Crisil Ltd’s “on-ground report” said onion seed transplantation suffered critical lags due to on-off rains during the June-September monsoon period, potentially delaying the time the onion crop takes to mature. Summer onions account for no more than 30% of India’s annual supply but they are critical to price stability because they replenish supplies during the lean September-November period. “The buffer size (of onions) has been enhanced from 5,137MT in 2017-18 to 100,000MT in 2020-21, which has been further enhanced to 200,000MT in 2021-22 to ensure a more effective intervention to control prices,” a government document reviewed by HT said. The official cited above said on condition of anonymity that the government is “monitoring prices of all essential commodities as always”. If prices rise, the government hopes to step in by releasing onions “as and when needed” from its own reserves to keep rates stable, the official added. Market watchers point to a familiar pattern in India’s onion-price spirals every alternate year or so. In the first half of 2017, for instance, wholesale onion prices plunged, leading to widespread protests by farmers in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. Then, in the second half of that year, when the government intervened in the markets to buy out excess stocks, prices began rising. In 2019 and 2020 too, retail rates soared past ₹90 a kg between September and November in many cities. Onion trade in the country suffers from classic price volatility. This is caused mainly by supply-disrupting factors such as extreme weather, losses from inadequate or improper storage or frequently shifting production levels, all of which can cause supplies to go from surplus to scanty in a matter of weeks. Experts hold that longer dry spells followed by short periods of heavy rainfall are tell-tale signs of a changing climate’s impact on the monsoon, which waters 60% of the country’s net-sown area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/food-prices-edge-up-government-keeps-close-watch-101634456961377.html

While speaking at a rally in Burhanpur, the chief minister said, "Rahul Gandhi is not the Congress Party. It is being run by an interim president Sonia Gandhi. But Rahul Gandhi has complete rights to remove a chief minister of a state."Mentioning the Congress party crisis in Punjab and the surprise resignation of Captain Amarinder Singh, he said, “Singh was the chief minister of Punjab and was running a government very smoothly. But he was removed and Charanjit Singh Channi was made the chief minister.”He also charged Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu for resigning as the state party president and putting the party in a spot.Talking about the rift in Congress in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, he said, “Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot are not happy with each other while Bhupesh Baghel and TS Deo Singh are involved in a tug of war over the post of the chief minister.”He also attacked Kamal Nath, the former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh. Chouhan said, “In Madhya Pradesh, if the Congress party wants to appoint then it chooses Kamal Nath, for the leader of opposition position, it again depends on Kamal Nath. For star campaigners, it falls back on Kamal Nath. For the president of Youth wing, the party appoints Nakul Nath, who is the son of Kamal Nath.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-leader-congress-party-has-become-a-circus-says-shivraj-singh-chouhan-101634438973722.html
17-10-2021||India||Cross-LoC infiltration and drone pistol deliveries scale up violence in Valley||Targeting of two non-Kashmiris, including a Muslim, by Takfiri terrorists in the Kashmir Valley on Saturday is part of Pakistani plan to raise the violence levels so that normalcy is disturbed, and the tourist economy is hit in the Union territory. Takfiri is a term used for those Islamic terrorist groups, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed in this context, who have no qualms targeting their Muslim brothers for political objectives. They are termed apostates.According to national security planners and security officials, the recent spate of violence against non-Kashmiris is a result of infiltration from across the Line of Control (LoC) of LeT terrorists in the Poonch-Rajouri sector. The second reason is increased drone delivery of Chinese Star pistols to overground workers (OGW) of LeT in the Valley because of which targeted killing is taking place in Srinagar.In the UT of Jammu and Kashmir, the scene of terror action is in the Krishnaghati sector, where the Indian Army has lost seven personnel while engaging already infiltrated LeT terrorists in the forests on Rajouri-Poonch district borders. This infiltration is said to have taken place towards the end of August 2021. The second theatre is the Valley where the OGWs with recently acquired pistols are targeting non-Kashmiris to spread terror in the region and hit the booming tourist sector economy. According to J-K police officials, many pistol consignments have reached the Valley due to drone flights from across the border with the Indian security forces hampered due to lack of functioning anti-drone systems.Despite Indian security forces deployed in large numbers both on the LoC and the hinterland with sensors and fencing, there is still no foolproof mechanism to prevent Pakistan based terrorist groups from infiltrating the Valley. The weapon and ammunition supplies through drones have added to the concern of security forces as there is no human cost to the terrorist groups based in Pakistan.While the J-K police have neutralised 11 terrorists in the past week after the first round of targeting earlier this month, Union home minister Amit Shah spoke to top security officials on Saturday night from Port Blair with implicit instructions of bringing the guilty to book. The state DGP Dilbagh Singh also held discussions with security agencies for actionable intelligence against the perpetrators of attacks on innocent non-Kashmiris.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crossloc-infiltration-and-drone-pistol-deliveries-scale-up-violence-in-valley-101634436488161.html

The ties also expanded into a “knowledge-based partnership”, with collaboration in innovation and research and boosting the “Make in India” initiative.According to analysts, Jaishankar's latest visit is aimed at cementing the groundwork in bilateral ties laid earlier and an opportunity for New Delhi to take forward further relations with the new dispensation in Israel, which assumed power after months of political turmoil during which the country witnessed as many as five elections in just two years.During his three-day visit to the West Asian country, Jaishankar will hold talks with his Israeli counterpart Lapid and also meet prime minister Bennet, president Isaac Herzog and Knesset speaker Mickey Levy.Jaishankar will also interact with the Indian-origin Jewish community in Israel, Indologists, Indian students in Israeli universities, and business people, including representatives of hi-tech industries. The visit will also be an occasion to pay tribute to Indian soldiers who laid down their lives in the region, especially during World War 1, said the ministry of external affairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-to-start-israel-tour-today-with-an-aim-to-cement-bilateral-ties-101634428192104.html
17-10-2021||India||Centre misusing probe agencies to ‘destabilise’ non-BJP govts: Pawar||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar on Saturday accused the Centre of misusing central probe agencies and trying to “destabilise” non-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) governments.“Investigative agencies like CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation), ED (Enforcement Directorate), I-T (Income Tax department), NCB (Narcotics Control Bureau) are being misused. The Centre is trying to destabilize non-BJP governed states,” the 80-year-old said but added that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government in Maharashtra “will complete its five years term and will come again in power in the next elections”.Addressing a press conference in Pune, Pawar said that Uddhav Thackeray was reluctant to become the Maharashtra chief minister but he convinced him. Pawar’s statement came hours after former Maharashtra CM and senior BJP Devendra Fadnavis said the MVA government was formed through dishonesty and that Thackeray had “ambitions to be CM”.“[Thackeray] was reluctant for the post and had conveyed it to me. A few other names were discussed for the post as well, but I asked him to take up the responsibility. It is not proper to say that Thackeray was eyeing the post,” Pawar said.Pawar also said that he will soon meet Union home minister Amit Shah on the expansion of the Border Security Force’s jurisdiction.The Union government amended the BSF Act to authorise the force to undertake search, seizure and arrest within a larger 50 km stretch, instead of the existing 15 kms, from the international border in Punjab, West Bengal and Assam. The decision triggered protests in Punjab and Bengal, the states with non-BJP governments.“I will be meeting Home Minister Amit Shah to know his thoughts about it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-misusing-probe-agencies-to-destabilise-non-bjp-govts-pawar-101634412245273.html

The Resistance Front, an offshoot of the Lashkar-e-Taiba terror outfit, is said to be behind the attack.Since then, the government has held a series of meetings with various agencies, private firms and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) to install robust anti-drone systems along the western border. Both Srinagar and Jammu Indian Air Force (IAF) stations are categorised as ‘sensitive’ installations.The federal commando force is enhancing its counterterrorism profile and preparing itself to meet emerging security challenges, Ganapathy said on the 37th raising day of the NSG on Saturday. “The NSG has been deployed at the Srinagar and Jammu IAF stations to provide security cover to the facilities against drone attacks, and this system is working successfully.”The deployment will continue till full-fledged counter-drone weapons and gadgets are available at these two bases, the people told HT, requesting anonymity.The NSG has an array of anti-drone equipment, radars, jammers and drone killer guns that maintain perimeter security, Ganapathy said. Soon after the drone attack on the Jammu base, a technical surveillance team of the NSG was sent to the station, which deployed its equipment there, he said.The NSG’s bomb disposal team has also successfully intercepted so-called tiffin bombs sent by drones from across the border, Ganapathy said.Indian agencies have noticed that a large number of drones are being used by Pakistan army and terrorist groups to drop these tiffin bombs in Indian territory, which are then picked up by the sleeper cells or overground workers of the banned outfits. The NIA is probing several tiffin bomb drops in Punjab.Junior home minister Nityanand Rai, present at the raising day as chief guest, lauded the commando force, also known as Black Cats, for its operations. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has brought an independent security policy for the country, the minister said.The NSG was raised as a federal counter-terrorist force in 1984 to undertake commando operations to neutralise terrorist and hijack threats. It also provides armed security cover to at least 13 high-risk VIPs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-iaf-bases-guarded-against-drones-nsg-dg-101634411979382.html
17-10-2021||India||High-level Indian visits bridged trust deficit: Sri Lankan envoy||High-level visits by foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and army chief M M Naravane have helped bridge a trust deficit and prepare the ground for re-energising relations, Sri Lankan high commissioner Milinda Moragoda said on Saturday.It is just a “perception” that China has strengthened its position in Sri Lanka at the cost of India, Moragoda said in an interview. New Delhi and Colombo were close to improving cooperation in areas ranging from trade to defence and energy.Bilateral ties were buffeted in February when Sri Lanka scrapped a trilateral agreement with India and Japan to build a shipping container terminal in Colombo port. Delays in several other projects and lack of movement in efforts to devolve powers to Sri Lanka’s Tamil minority added to issues faced by the two countries. An “integrated country strategy” document prepared by Moragoda before he assumed office in India acknowledged that bilateral ties were dominated by a “transactional approach” because of geopolitical changes that had resulted in a “growing trust deficit”.The recent high-level visits and the presence of leaders in the Indian government who understand Sri Lanka, such as external affairs minister S Jaishankar and petroleum minister Hardeep Puri, have helped address this trust deficit, Moragoda said on Saturday.“The foreign secretary’s visit has helped a lot...The senior officials on the Indian side...understand us warts and all, and that helps,” he said. “We have the basis now to start building through the transactions on to a strategic relationship.”A visit by 100 Buddhist monks and government functionaries led by sports minister Namal Rajapaksa to Kushinagar in Uttar Pradesh on October 20 will boost people-to-people contacts. The delegation will participate in the inauguration of an international airport meant to put Kushinagar, the site of Buddha’s parinirvana, on the Buddhist pilgrimage circuit.Moragoda referred to the integrated country strategy, which has been described as a road map for building relations over the next two years, and said the two countries will have to “evolve from a transactional stage to a strategic and then a special relationship”.“The transactional stage is also a trust-building phase because both sides need to learn to do business with each other.”The scrapping of the agreement on the east container terminal at Colombo port because of pressure from trade unions was part of the “untidiness of democracy”, he said. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had come up with the proposal for developing the west container terminal as an alternative, and the recent deal on this project between state-owned Sri Lanka Ports Authority and Adani Group will be more advantageous for the Indian firm.“From a commercial point of view, the west terminal is a better transaction because the investor has more control over it,” he said. “The west terminal shouldn’t be underestimated as 80% of the cargo in Sri Lankan ports is trans-shipment cargo. Out of this, 70% goes to India. And even from this, 35% goes to Adani Group-linked ports.”Moragoda acknowledged there is a “Chinese investment footprint” in his country but said the feeling that Sri Lanka is moving faster on Chinese investment proposals is just a “perception”. He also pointed out India’s sizeable presence in several sectors such as energy, transportation and railways.Indian Oil controls one-third of petroleum distribution in Sri Lanka, and there are plans for collaborating on an oil tank farm and exploration, while the two nations are in discussions on development of renewable energy. Indian Railways has done “immense work” to develop Sri Lanka’s rail network and there are more than one million Bajaj three-wheelers on the island nation’s roads, he said.“We are also studying whether the Aadhaar Card can be used as a template in Sri Lanka,” he said, adding that Sri Lanka plans to import nano-nitrogen fertiliser from India as part of a move towards organic agriculture.Sri Lanka will have to “work harder” because the bilateral relationship is asymmetrical, Moragoda said. “On the trade and economic side, one of the reasons why we may not be able to make progress as quickly as possible is some of our industries feel maybe sort of overwhelmed by India,” he said.India, he hoped, will be willing to accommodate such an asymmetrical relationship in trade with opportunities for market access without looking for reciprocity. The two countries are also talking about the possibility of a bilateral currency swap and are in advanced discussions on a maritime surveillance system, Moragoda said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/highlevel-visits-by-shringla-and-naravane-helped-bridge-trust-deficit-sri-lankan-high-commissioner-101634410987310.html

For years, attempts were made to downplay many well-known leaders of the independence movement and their contributions. But now the time has come that everyone should find their proper place in history. Those who contributed and sacrificed their lives, should find their proud place in history, and that is why Prime Minister Narendra Modi decided to name this island after Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose,” Amit Shah said in Port Blair during the inauguration of several development projects.He added that “similar injustice” has been done to Sardar Patel. “The Indian republic today would not have been possible if Sardar Patel had not made more than 550 princely states a part of India in less than a year and a half. The British did what they had to do by freeing everyone, but Sardar Patel completed the task of bringing all the princely states within the Indian union and creating a strong India.”“Sardar Saheb also did not receive the same respect as he should have received after independence. But history repeats itself, no matter how much injustice is done to anyone, good work is never hidden and today in Kevadia, the world’s tallest statue of Sardar Saheb has been installed by (PM) Narendra Modi, which people from all over the world come to see,” Shah said.The home minister is on a three-day visit to Andaman and Nicobar Islands. On Saturday, he inaugurated 14 projects worth ₹299 crore and laid foundation stones of 12 projects worth ₹643 crore. He said the government has decided to name a bridge that was inaugurated on Saturday as Azad Hind Fauj Bridge. “Every person passing through this bridge would go from one end to the other paying homage to Netaji’s 35,000km journey, his courage and his valour,” he said.Ross Island, one of the islands in the archipelago of Andaman and Nicobar, was renamed Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Island by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in December 2018.Shah said PM Modi made Subhash Chandra Bose island, where Netaji hoisted the flag of independence for the first time, as a huge tourist destination by placing a large tricolour and also turned it into a centre for the awakening of patriotism. “In the coming days, we are going to develop this island too and will build a grand memorial for Subhash Babu,” Shah said.The government is currently celebrating Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav across the country through which it wants to inculcate the feeling of patriotism among the youth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/injustice-done-to-netaji-sardar-patel-amit-shah-in-port-blair-101634410569121.html

The authorities have been requested to take action against personnel who do not comply.“This is probably for the first time when our department has sought a no-dowry affidavit from government servants in a serious bid to get the provisions of the anti-dowry law enforced in the state,” said Manoj Rai, director, department of women and child welfare.All public servants in India are mandated to furnish a verified statement at the time of joining work, stating that they will not receive dowry when they get married, according to the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.“Now, we have asked employees who got married after 31, 2004, to furnish an affidavit stating that they did not receive any dowry when they were married,” Rai said.The department of women’s welfare will have to submit a report on compliance on the no-dowry statements and on action taken for non-compliance to a Parliament legislative committee that is likely to visit the state soon, people aware of the matter said on condition of anonymity.Uttar Pradesh framed the Dowry Prohibition Rules in 1999 as a follow-up to the federal law. The rules were amended on March 31, 2004, specifically providing in Rule 5 that every government servant will, during his appointment, furnish a self-attested affidavit to the appointing authority, stating he received no dowry in his marriage.“You are, therefore, requested to necessarily obtain an affidavit from all the government servants posted in offices under you by October 18, with the affidavit stating that they received no dowry in their marriage,” the October circular reads. “Please ensure action against employees who do not give an affidavit to this effect.”The social evil of dowry is illegal in India.

The authorities also called up Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s residence late on Friday night after the attack took place. “We also called up the PM’s residence around 8.00 pm on Friday seeking his intervention. The official, who attended the phone, said that the PM would be informed,” said Radharamn Das, vice present of ISKCON, Kolkata. According to ISKON authorities, a 500-strong mob first vandalized a Durga Puja pandal adjacent to the ISKCON temple at Noakhali in Bangladesh around 2 pm on Friday. Later they attacked the devotees in the ISKCON temple. The idol of Srila Prabhupada, founder of ISKCON, was desecrated, books were set on fire and the temple was vandalised. “At least three people were killed including two of our devotees – Jatan Kumar Saha and Partha Das. Around 20 people were injured. Some are critical and fighting for their lives,” said Das. Earlier on Wednesday, Durga Puja pandals and temples at several places in Bangladesh were vandalised by mobs following posts on social media about the alleged desecration of the Quran at a pandal in Cumilla district. The Indian government had said on Thursday that it was in close contact with Bangladeshi authorities over the attacks in the neighbouring country but noted that celebrations were continuing with the support of the government and people. Reacting to the reports of the violence on Wednesday, Trinamool Congress (TMC) West Bengal general secretary and spokesperson Kunal Ghosh had said: “Serious allegations of vandalism of Durga Puja pandals have poured in from Bangladesh.” “This is worrisome. It should be investigated. If it is found to be true, the Bangladesh government should take action,” Ghosh further said. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson in West Bengal, Samik Bhattacharya had accused the Sheikh Hasina government of inaction. “Such incidents of atrocities on Hindus have increased over the past few months. The government remained a mute spectator,” Bhattacharya added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iskcon-authorities-seek-un-chief-pm-s-intervention-after-attack-on-temple-in-bangladesh-101634410027357.html

Later, he was arrested by the Sonepat police. “During interrogation, the accused named the involvement of four more members of the Nihang community in this gruesome murder, besides identifying the faces of others. The number of accused in this case is likely to be more than five. We had sought two weeks remand but the court had granted a week remand of Sarabjeet Singh,” Sonepat deputy superintendent of police, Virender Singh, said.“We will also add the SC/ST section in the case as the victim belongs to the SC community. During the remand period, we have to make some recoveries from the accused, including weapons used in the crime and the clothes he was wearing. We will also take him to Gurdaspur and Chamkaur Sahib for the identification of other accused involved in the crime.”On Saturday, Narain Singh, who heads a Nihang organisation called Misal Shaheedan Baba Baaz Singh Tarna Dal, surrendered before the police in Amritsar. “When I reached the spot, I saw his hand was chopped off by Sarabjeet Singh. Considering his sin, I hit his leg thrice with my sword and cut his foot,” Narain told reporters.Senior superintendent of police (Amritsar-rural), Rakesh Kaushal, however, said Narain was nabbed by the police following a tip-off. “Narain Singh fled from the Singhu border. Today, we got specific input from the senior officials that he might have returned to his village...”.“He announced that he would go to Akal Takht at 4.00 am and surrender before police there. When he found that he could not leave the village, he made an announcement that he would pay obeisance at village gurdwara. As soon as he came out of the gurdwara, we arrested him.”Meanwhile, Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait on Saturday called the murder “unfortunate”, but assured it will not affect the protest against the Centre’s three farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-more-arrested-for-lynching-of-dalit-man-at-site-of-farmers-protest-101634409561972.html
17-10-2021||India||Congress to train leaders in party ideologies and policies||With the recent exit of key members from the party, the Congress on Saturday announced training programmes for “all leaders and party workers at all levels” to aid them in becoming proficient at the outfit’s ideology.The political party said on Saturday it will also launch a grassroots level agitation against the Narendra Modi-led government.Congress general secretary KC Venugopal said: “The party has decided to undertake regular training programme for leaders and workers at all levels. They will be trained in party ideologies, policies, grassroots messaging, election management, failure of current government and countering propaganda.”The decision was announced after a meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on Saturday. There will be “regular and continuous training programs” and also a special orientation camp at Sevagram Wardha Ashram from November 12 to 15, he said.People within the Congress have expressed concern over the exit of leaders such as Jyotiraditya Scindia, Jitin Prasada, Himanta Biswa Sharma, Sushmita Dev and Luizinho Faleiro, those aware of the matter said.“The CWC is deeply distressed to note the multiple challenges that face the country and the all-round failure of the Modi government in dealing with these challenges” and called upon “all democratic parties and forces to join hands to resolutely oppose the Modi government in order to protect the values on which our country was founded and to advance the causes of the people,” the resolution said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-to-train-leaders-in-party-ideologies-and-policies-101634409548678.html
17-10-2021||India||‘Don’t have to speak to me via media’: Sonia hits back at G23||Congress chief Sonia Gandhi on Saturday hit back at the G23, senior leaders calling for a change in how the party is run, censuring them for “talking to her through media”, reminding them that she has been “a full-time and hands-on Congress President” and pointing out that it is the younger Congress leaders (and not they), including Rahul Gandhi, who have taken “leadership roles” in public outreach and protests.Gandhi’s comments, her first in response to issues raised over the past year by 23 leaders who, in August 2020, first wrote to her seeking organisational changes to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party, came during the meeting of the Congress Working Committee on Saturday. Some of the criticism from G23 has been that the Congress does not have a full-time president. Gandhi was named interim president in 2019.At the CWC meeting, Gandhi, party president for the longest term, also launched a sweeping attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government, saying the “shocking incident at Lakhimpur Kheri” shows “how the government perceives the kisan andolan (farmer’s agitation)” and maintained that, with reference to recent targeted killings of civilians in J&K, the “entire responsibility is on the government to bring the perpetrators of these barbaric crimes to justice”.She also criticised the government’s economic policy and asset monetisation plans, terming it “Becho, Becho, Becho” (sell, sell, sell), but much of her ire seemed reserved for the G23, prompted, a close aide said, by some of its members recently demanded an open discussion and questioned the decision-making process in the party.While the Gandhis themselves (Sonia Gandhi, her son and former party president Rahul Gandhi, and her daughter and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra) did not directly respond to their comments, other leaders said they were unwarranted; and some party supporters took matters seemingly into their own hands, protesting outside and indulging in vandalism at the residence of Kapil Sibal, one of the members of the G23 who has been open about his misgivings on how the party is run.“I have always appreciated frankness. There is no need to speak to me through the media. But what should get communicated outside the four walls of this room is the collective decision of the CWC,” she said, and followed it up with “I am, if you will allow me to say so, a full-time and hands-on Congress President”.She also praised younger colleagues for taking responsibilities, indirectly pointing out that while seniors have been asking for change, it is young leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, have hit the road.“In the last two years, a large number of our colleagues, particularly the younger ones have taken on leadership roles in taking party policies and programmes to the people -whether it is the agitation of farmers, provision of relief during the pandemic, highlighting issues of concern to youth and women, atrocities on Dalits, Adivasis and minorities, price rise, and the destruction of the public sector.”“Never have we let issues of public importance and concern go unaddressed...,” she added.While G23 leaders have sought more say in party matters and an overhaul in the organisation, Gandhi reminded them that the revival of the Congress requires “self-control, discipline, unity .” She told them that “the entire organisation wants a revival of the Congress” but “this requires unity and keeping the party’s interests paramount. Above all, it requires self-control and discipline.”Gandhi listed the activities undertaken under her leadership but took at swipe at the senior rebels when she said, “I am acutely conscious of the fact that I have been interim Congress President.”The Congress chief also lashed out at the government over spiralling fuel prices: “Could anyone in the country ever have imagined that petrol prices would be over ₹100 a litre, diesel would be nearing ₹100 a litre mark, a gas cylinder would cost ₹900 and cooking oil would be ₹200 a litre? This is making life unbearable for people across the country.”Noting that farmers have suffered much since their protests started, Gandhi remarked, “The shocking incidents at Lakhimpur-Kheri recently betrays the mindset of the BJP, how it perceives the Kisan Andolan, how it has been dealing with this determined struggle by Kisans to protect their lives and livelihoods.”A G23 leader, however, said they don’t expect any real change. “This arrangement means she will have responsibility while Rahul and Priyanka will have authority. We also fear the election process will lose steam after membership process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-have-to-speak-to-me-via-media-congress-chief-sonia-gandhi-hits-back-at-g23-101634409260396.html
17-10-2021||India||2 more non-local civilians killed by terrorists in J-K||Terrorists on Saturday shot dead a vendor and a carpenter – both non-locals – in two separate attacks in Srinagar and Pulwama districts of Jammu and Kashmir, officials said, taking the number of casualties in the string of targeted civilian killings in the region to nine in recent days.The attacks were carried out within an hour, the officials said.Arvind Kumar Sah, 29, a resident of Banka area in Bihar, was shot at close range by the terrorists in Srinagar’s Eidgah area at around 6.15pm, an official said, asking not to be named. He was rushed to Shri Maharaja Hari Singh Hospital, where doctors declared him dead.An hour later, at around 7.15pm, Sageer Ahmad, a carpenter from Uttar Pradesh, was attacked at Litter in the Pulwama district, anther official confirmed.A police spokesperson said that searches have begun to find the terrorist behind the attacks.“Terrorists fired upon two non-local labourers in Srinagar and Pulwama. Arvind Kumar Sah of Banka Bihar succumbed to injuries in Srinagar and Sagir Ahmad of UP in Pulwama. Areas have been cordoned & searches started,” the police spokesperson said.Saturday’s killings are the latest in a series of attacks on minorities in the Union Territory, which have prompted the government to mount counter-insurgency operations in the region.Nine soldiers have been killed in the operations that began Monday – the highest casualties the army has suffered in a week in the region in recent years.At least 13 terrorists, including a top Lashkar-e-Taiba commander, have also been neutralised in the operations.Earlier in the day, Kashmir inspector general of police Vijay Kumar said that 13 terrorists have been killed in nine encounters since Monday. “We have neutralised 3 out of 5 terrorists of Srinagar City within less than 24 hours,” he said.Political leaders condemned the attacks on Saturday.Calling the murders “reprehensible”, National Conference vice-president and former chief minister Omar Abdullah tweeted: “Strongly condemn the killing of street vendor Arvind Kumar in a terror attack in Srinagar today. This is yet another case of a civilian being targeted like this. All Arvind Kumar did was come to Srinagar in search of earning opportunities & it’s reprehensible that he was murdered.”Peoples Conference chairman Sajjad Lone said the killings were acts of “pure terror”.“This is pure terror. Yet again a non-local vendor shot and killed in Idgah. What a shame. How cowardly can it get,” Lone tweeted.The Bharatiya Janata Party’s general secretary for J&K and Kashmir affairs incharge Sunil Sharma also condemned the killings, and called for strict punishment for the terrorists.“The killing of poor vendor and carpenter who earn their livelihood through hardwork is inhuman and barbaric act,” Sharma said in statement.Party spokesperson Altaf Thakur said the killings were highly condemnable.Srinagar Mayor Junaid Azim Mattu also condemned the attacks. “Strongly condemn the killing of Arvind Kumar - a street-vendor at Eidgah by terrorists. Continued attempts by terrorists to intimidate the people and drive a communal wedge in our society. My heart goes out to his family. Another inconsolable tragedy. A sheer act of terror,” he tweeted.October has witnessed a spate in attacks, with nine civilians, including two school teachers and three non-locals being shot dead by the terrorists.Supinder Kaur, principal of the Government Boys Higher Secondary School in Eidgah, and Deepak Chand, a teacher at the same school, were shot dead inside the school premises on October 7.Days before the attack on the school, three civilians were killed in separate attacks in the Valley on October 5.Makhan Lal Bindroo, a Kashmiri Pandit and a well-known pharmacist in Srinagar; Virender Paswan, a street vendor from Bihar’s Bhagalpur, and Mohammad Shafi Lone, the head of a taxi stand in Bandipora district, were shot dead within minutes on October 5.Two other people were killed on October 2.The Resistance Front (TRF), a front for terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba had claimed responsibility for most of the attack.Security forces have killed at least 120 terrorists in Kashmir this year, including over a dozen top commanders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-more-non-local-civilians-killed-by-terrorists-in-jk-101634408914300.html
17-10-2021||India||Bad air days begin, AQI slips to ‘poor’||People in Delhi will have to wait for the east wind and some likely showers on Sunday to find relief from deteriorating air quality that fell to the “poor” category on Saturday, even as the burning of farm residue in Punjab, Haryana and Pakistan continued to rise.Delhi’s overall air quality index on Saturday was 284, Central Pollution Control board data showed, compared with 198 on Friday, which just about remained in the “moderate” category. The federal pollution watchdog considers a reading of 201-300 as “poor” that leads to breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. A reading of 101-200 is considered “moderate”.Air quality continued to worsen in the national capital as the evening progressed, with 18 out of 36 areas showing readings of “very poor” that could lead to respiratory illness.There could be easterly winds and light to moderate rainfall to wash away the pollutants, the India Meteorological Department predicted on Saturday.Satellite images from NASA’s fire tracker showed a spike in the number of “red dots” that indicate stubble burning on October 16 from three days ago.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who has been posting the city’s air quality recordings over nearly a month to establish how stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana impacts Delhi’s air, tweeted NASA data Saturday.The drop in Saturday’s air quality was due to the increase in farm fires in the neighbouring agrarian states of Punjab, Haryana and parts of Pakistan, weather forecasters said. It was made worse by calm winds, leading to an accumulation of pollutants in the atmosphere.“Till Saturday afternoon, Delhi was receiving winds from the north-west direction, which was carrying with it smoke from the stubble fires in Punjab and Haryana. However, the wind direction will now change to easterly,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change at private forecaster Skymet Weather Services. “When the wind direction is transitioning, thespeeds reduce drastically and this leads to an accumulation of pollutants already present in the air.”The wind will start blowing from the east from Sunday morning, according to VK Soni, head of Met department’s environment and research centre.The respite might be short as pollution levels are likely to rise again from October 19, Soni said.The primary pollutant on Saturday in Delhi was PM 2.5, according to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) run by the ministry of earth science. PM 2.5, or dust particles less than 2.5 micrometres wide, that results primarily from combustion, gets deposited deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, causing severe damage to health. Till last week, the primary pollutant in Delhi’s air was PM 10, or particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres that is mostly dust from local sources.“With 1572 fire counts as per SAFAR harmonised methodology, which includes data of two ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) satellites, the stubble burning contribution in Delhi’s air has suddenly increased to 14%,” SAFAR’s analysis said. “Fire counts are gradually increasing and north-westerly winds at a speed of 900 mb is favourable for transporting stubble smoke into Delhi.” The share of farm fires was 6% on Friday.Experts have warned of the impending air emergency, an annual occurrence in Delhi in autumn, as soon as the winds change back to north-westerly.The stubble burning this season started slow because the southwest monsoon withdrew later than usual from parts of northwest India and because of some policy decisions by the government, said Pawan Gupta, a research scientist at the Goddard Earth Sciences Technology and Research, Universities Space Research Association.“The stubble fires were merely delayed,” Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bad-air-days-begin-aqi-slips-to-poor-101634408946520.html

17-10-2021||India||Congress to elect new president in Aug-Sept||The Congress Working Committee (CWC) on Saturday decided to hold internal polls to elect the party’s next president between August 21 and September 30 next year, and most of its members asked former party president Rahul Gandhi to return to the post at a meeting bereft of any drama over the criticism of the party’s leadership by some senior Congress leaders.Rahul Gandhi, who quit in 2019 following his party’s dismal showing in the Lok Sabha polls -- it won 54 of the 543 seats in the house -- said he needed time to think about this, people present at the meeting said on condition of anonymity.The meeting, which comes soon after the crisis in Punjab, where chief minister and senior Congress leader Amarinder Singh was forced to resign (he subsequently said he would also leave the party), and high-profile defections of senior party leaders to the Trinamool Congress, was expected to discuss some of the issues, but HT learns that Singh’s name was not even mentioned at the meeting.Instead, it was decided that interim party chief Sonia Gandhi would continue in that role till at least next August when the process to conduct organisational elections is expected to begin. That means the Congress will go into the next round of assembly elections, scheduled for early 2022, under the current team. The round includes elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.Elections for the CWC and other bodies will be held during the AICC plenary session in September or October next year, general secretary KC Venugopal announced; polls for these bodies were a key demand of a group of 23 Congress leaders who first wrote to Sonia Gandhi in August 2020 seeking changes in how the party was run.If anyone thought the CWC meeting on Saturday would follow the script of the last few meetings -- muted criticism of the way the party was run by some of the leaders of the so-called G23, drowned by an overwhelming support of the Gandhis by their supporters -- they were wrong.Instead all senior leaders including G23 members Ghulam Nabi Azad and Anand Sharma called upon Rahul Gandhi to lead the party.Former defence minister AK Antony made the first pitch for Rahul Gandhi: “Rahul should take over immediately, otherwise it would be tough for us.” His anointment as party president was required for “the future of the country”, he added.Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot echoed the sentiment, saying there should not be any further delay in electing Rahul Gandhi as party president. Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi argued that the delay in the appointment “is not a small matter as we are losing out every day”.Rahul Gandhi spoke for almost 40 minutes at the CWC meeting. He touched upon various subjects and attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its ideological parent Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). He demanded more ideological commitment from Congress workers in the wake of the recent attrition from the party.He recalled: “Channi cried when I rang him up (to appoint him as Punjab chief minister) and said he was not expecting this to happen. The RSS will never make a Dalit, a minority or a woman as chief minister or give them important positions. But the Congress is doing it.”Rahul Gandhi heard out the views of leaders seeking his return, but said he needed time to take a call. He also spoke of what he saw as the bigger picture. “We are in a big fight against the BJP-RSS ideology. Our party has to be firm on ideology and we have be clear on what we stand for. We should never be afraid of what we stand for. We should not be afraid of (PM Narendra) Modi and RSS.”Azad, who wrote to Sonia last month demanding a CWC meeting to discuss the Punjab and Goa issues (a senior Goa leader, a former CM, defected to the TMC), and the current political scenario, suggested that candidates for the upcoming elections be picked in advance. He also praised Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s intervention in Lakhimpur Kheri where eight people died in a violent incident after a car mowed down protesting farmers on October 3, and the farmers, in return, were accused of lynching some of the occupants.Both Azad and Anand Sharma clarified that they have no issues in Sonia Gandhi’s leadership. Sharma, a key member of the G23 , praised Sonia Gandhi and said the CWC had elected her as interim president and he was thankful for what she has done during these difficult times.While Sharma maintained that the party should talk to leaders and engage them if they are trying to leave the party, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said: “We should continue with our public agitations and protests, and intensify the protests. Those who want to leave will leave, but we should not slacken (our efforts).”Later, Venugopal announced the poll schedule. “Rahul Gandhi is a capable leader to lead the party. But there is no ambiguity about the decision-making process. Every single decision is taken by Sonia Gandhi,” he said.There was no mention about Captain Amarinder Singh, who was removed as Punjab chief minister, party insiders said on condition of anonymity. General secretary Dinesh Gundu Rao complained that Prashant Kishor, an election strategist, is luring away Congress leaders in Goa.As the first step for the organizational election, a membership enrolment drive will begin from November 1 and will continue till March. The membership drive, spread over five months, is significant as the party has lost considerable electoral space to the BJP and other parties in recent years.Venugopal also said at a news briefing that general secretaries of all poll-bound states presented reports on preparations for the state assembly polls.He announced that the election schedule, which includes enrolment of members for organisational polls on payment of ₹5 each, will start from November 1, 2021 and go on till March 31, 2022.District Congress Committees shall publish preliminary list of members together with the list of eligible contestants for participation in the election. This list will be published before April 15, 2022 i.e. between April 1 and April 15.Election of president and executives of primary committees and block committees, and election of block presidents, executive committees and one member of the PCC by block Congress committee will be held between April 16 and May 31, 2022.The election of presidents, vice presidents, treasurers and executive committee of DCC will be held between June 1 and July 20 next year.Venugopal also said that the election of PCC presidents, vice presidents, treasurers, PCC executives and AICC members by PCC general body will be held between July 21 and August 20, 2022.The election of the Congress president will be held between August 21 and September 20, 2022, he said.Venugopal also announced that the election of CWC members and other bodies by AICC members will take place at a plenary session, dates for which will be announced later, preferably in the month of September or October next year.The Bharatiya Janata Party dubbed the CWC meeting as “parivar bachao working committee” and alleged that it offered no answers to the issues of the party’s internal rift and its leadership’s failures, and instead indulged in spreading lies.BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia also criticised the CWC for not reacting to the murder of a Dalit man at the Singhu border, one of the sites for the farmers’ protests, and questioned if the opposition party stood with the “Talibani mindset” behind the killing. Anarchic elements are using farmers for their politics, he said.With inputs from PTI||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-to-elect-new-president-in-augsept-101634408887093.html
17-10-2021||India||New Hyderabad facility to help boost Quad nations’ vaccine supply||There will soon be a new vaccine manufacturing facility in Hyderabad to support the Quad countries’ plan of delivering one billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines. An agreement to the effect will be signed during the upcoming visit to India by the US development bank’s chief. US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) chief operating officer David Marchick will travel to South Africa and India during October 18-26 to take forward investment proposals to boost global health and expand Covid-19 vaccine production across the developing world. Marchick and his delegation will travel to Hyderabad after arriving in India on October 24 to visit Biological E, which has been selected to produce one billion doses of vaccines to be rolled out by the end of 2022 under the vaccine partnership launched by the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad. The US delegation will “participate in a signing ceremony to open a new facility with substantial capacity for vaccine manufacturing”, according to a statement from the DFC. “This work is in support of the historic commitment set out by President [Joe] Biden and his counterparts in the Quad – Australia, India, Japan, and the United States.”In South Africa, the DFC delegation will visit Africa Data Centres, which is developing critical technology infrastructure across Africa, and meet drug makers critical to the Covid-19 response. The vaccine partnership is on track to produce one billion doses in India to boost global supply, Biden had said at the first in-person Quad leaders’ summit in Washington on September 24. Aid from the DFC is aimed at boosting vaccine manufacturing capacity in several regions of the world. This support is projected to facilitate capacity expansion to produce nearly two billion Covid-19 vaccine doses by the end of 2022.  Additional production will come on line in India later this year due to the Quad vaccine partnership’s financing of increased manufacturing capacity at Biological E, a joint statement issued at the conclusion of the Quad leaders’ summit last month had said. These doses will be exported to countries in the Indo-Pacific and other parts of the world to overcome a continuing global supply gap. The Quad will coordinate with multilateral initiatives such as the WHO-backed COVAX Facility to procure safe and quality-assured vaccines for low and middle-income countries. The Quad has also launched a vaccine experts group that is working to align the plans of India, Australia, Japan and the US to support health security and the Covid-19 response across the Indo-Pacific. This includes coordination of efforts to support the production of vaccines and equitable access. Quad members have pledged to donate more than 1.2 billion vaccine doses globally. They have so far delivered nearly 79 million jabs to countries in the Indo-Pacific. The Quad summit had also welcomed India’s announcement on resuming vaccine exports, which had been halted in March after the country was hit by a devastating second wave of infections. Since vaccine exports resumed recently, India has sent one million doses of Covishield to Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar, and 300,000 doses of Covaxin to Iran. Japan will help regional partners purchase vaccines through a Covid-19 crisis response emergency support loan of $3.3 billion, and Australia will provide $212 million in grants to purchase vaccines for Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Australia will also allocate $219 million to support last-mile vaccine rollouts and lead Quad’s last-mile delivery efforts. Besides the Covid-19 response and pandemic preparedness, the Quad is also working on infrastructure, resilient supply chains, clean energy, maritime security, approaches to deploy 5G infrastructure that use open and interoperable network architectures, and emerging technologies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-hyd-facility-to-help-boost-quad-nations-vaccine-supply-101634408287452.html
17-10-2021||India||NCP’s malik again attacks NCB, says using official’s friend as witness||Maharashtra minority welfare minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Nawab Malik on Saturday again raised questions over the Narcotics Control Bureau’s (NCB) operations against the alleged drug peddling pertaining to Bollywood. He claimed that the central agency has used a man named Fletcher Patel, who is a family friend of its zonal director Sameer Wankhede, as a panch or witness in three different cases in the past two years.Malik shared a few documents on Saturday and raised doubts on the agency’s witnesses. By releasing pictures from social media, Malik said Patel was Wankhede’s family friend. He has alleged that Patel had shared a photograph with a woman, calling her ‘lady don’ with hashtag ‘Sister’. The woman is one of Wankhede’s relatives and it needs to be checked if Patel and the woman had any connection with the raids on Bollywood celebrities, the minister said. He also alleged that the woman in the photograph is an advocate and an office-bearer of the film cell of a political party.“An independent panch or witness needs to be an independent citizen in any case registered under any law. Fletcher is a family friend of Wankhede as he has shared a picture with the relative of the officer. Fletcher is also seen with Wankhede in many functions organised to felicitate the officer. Does this not raise questions over the veracity of the cases registered by the agency? Earlier, the courts had rapped the investigating agencies on such dubious witnesses as they weaken the cases,” Malik said.He said as many of the NCB raids were against Bollywood actors, it needs to be checked if there was any nexus involved in it.“How can a family friend be a part of the raids? The agency has been indulging in selective leaks related to the raids to defame the government and the film industry. Many actors were raided and paraded by the agency. It needs to be checked if there was any big game behind all these raids,” he said.Earlier, in two press conferences in two weeks, Malik had alleged that two witnesses in the cruise drug party raids were allowed to handle the accused. He had said one of the witnesses, KC Gosavi, is facing criminal cases, while another, Manish Bhanushali, is a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) officer-bearer. Malik had also alleged that his son-in-law, Sameer Khan, was framed in a drug case.Wankhede refused to comment on Malik’s allegations.Another NCB officer said that Patel is the Mumbai president of Army veterans’ group Sainik Federation and has an Army background. The photograph in which he is seen with Wankhede was an event held at CSMT where the federation had felicitated the NCB zonal director on Kargil Vijay Diwas on July 26. At the event, they pledged to curb the menace and threat of narcotics from the country.The officer further said that Patel is a highly-trustworthy person. “As a panch, we always require people like him who have army background, because such individuals are physically and mentally strong, and especially are of very help in operations against peddlers/suppliers who are strong in physique,” the NCB officer said.Patel said, “I am an ex-serviceman and Mumbai president of Sainik Federation. Yes, Sameer Wankhede’s sister is like an elder sister to me. Even if she is like family to me, that can’t stop me from helping NCB in their drive against drugs. I have been helping NCB as my social responsibility and nobody should question my integrity. “||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncps-malik-again-attacks-ncb-says-using-official-s-friend-as-witness-101634408229411.html
17-10-2021||India||Pragya curses man who shot her viral video playing kabaddi||It was a ‘Ravana’ who shot the viral video clip of Pragya Singh Thakur playing kabaddi near a Durga puja pandal, and he will get his just desserts, the Bharatiya Janata Party parliamentarian who has been seen confined to a wheelchair, said on Friday night. “I went for offering aarti (at a Durga puja pandal) two days back, when some sportsmen playing on a ground requested me to conduct a (kabaddi) raid. A small clip of this was captured and shown in the media. A Ravana among you got irritated like I have taken away his kingdom,” Thakur said. “Ravana can be present anywhere. He is spoiled and I warn him to mend his ways, otherwise his old age and next birth will be spoiled. A person who attacks patriots, revolutionary persons and saints can’t survive, neither did Ravana or Kansa. That ‘adharmi’ or ‘vidharmi’ person will also face the same,” the Lok Sabha MP from Bhopal said. Thakur is confined to a wheelchair for long due to an injury to her lower vertebrae. Facing trial on the 2008 Malegaon blast case that killed several people, she obtained bail on medical grounds. Thakur was criticised when the video clip went viral on social media. “She skipped hearings of the Malegaon blast case at least twice on medical grounds. She went to Parliament in a wheelchair. She claimed that she can’t stand properly because of a permanent injury in her back, but within few months, she started playing volleyball, kabaddi and also garba,” said JP Dhanopia, spokesperson, Madhya Pradesh Congress party. “We just want to know the truth about her health because how is it possible for a person to be in a wheelchair and on a sports ground together?” “Those who follow the ideology of Ravana, see the demon king everywhere,” Madhya Pradesh Congress party spokesman K K Mishra said on Saturday, reacting to Thakur’s outburst. “The Bhopal MP follows the ideology of those who represent the evil.” This is not the first time Thakur has courted controversy. Earlier, she had claimed that the chief of the Anti Terror Squad and 26/11 martyr Hemant Karkare was killed because she cursed him for assaulting her in jail after her arrest in the Malegaon blast case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pragya-curses-man-who-shot-her-viral-video-playing-kabaddi-101634408228290.html
17-10-2021||India||Channi govt also deceiving people, says Sisodia||Delhi’s deputy chief minister and senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Manish Sisodia on Saturday alleged that just like former Punjab CM Amarinder Singh, incumbent Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress government will also deceive people of the state.“The present CM Charanjit Singh Channi led Congress Government in Punjab is again deceiving the people of Punjab with a new scam of ‘5 marla land’ guarantee card, just like the employment card of 2017,” Sisodia said at a press conference in Jalandhar.“The Channi Government is again committing the same fraud against the people of Punjab, just like the Captain did with his employment card. The scheme of 5 marla land was initiated in 1961 but till date neither the Congress government nor any other government of Punjab has implemented it, nor has any person received land under this scheme”.“Even now, the Channi Government is not giving land to the people but is deceiving them by handing a paper with the promise of giving them land, which it has no intention of honouring”, he said.Sisodia further said that three months before the 2017 assembly elections, the Congress Party had distributed employment cards to the youth of Punjab, which was a fraud.“Captain had promised that if the government comes to power, all the employment card holders will get employment otherwise the government will give them an allowance. However, the government, despite being in power for 4.5 years, has neither given employment nor employment allowance to the youth. Congress and Captain forgot all their promises and bluffed the people of Punjab,” he said. Congress is yet to react to Sisodia’s comments.During his Saturday’s trip, Sisodia visited Bhagwan Valmiki Dham Ram Tirath in Amritsar. He left for Delhi the same day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-captain-channi-is-also-cheating-punjabis-sisodia-101634408227270.html

There is only one agenda of this government, which is extortion,” Fadnavis told reporters in Nagpur.During his annual address at the Dussehra rally in Mumbai on Friday, Thackeray had hit out at the BJP and accused the Centre of interfering in the state’s day-to-day affairs. The CM also accused the Centre of misusing “central agencies” and asked Shiv Sena workers if they were ready to face the “attack by BJP leadership” in the same way that West Bengal (under Mamata Banerjee) had faced.Fadnavis said that Thackeray’s speech was a result of “political frustration” and it was time for the CM to stop acting innocent.“We are not interested in toppling the MVA government, but he (Thackeray) would not even come to know if it is toppled. Instead of daring us to topple it, the CM should first govern it properly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/most-corrupt-government-won-t-come-to-know-when-it-is-toppled-fadnavis-101634407747367.html
17-10-2021||India||18 die, Kerala CM Vijayan seeks help of forces||At least 18 people were killed after heavy rains pounded south and central Kerala on Saturday while 22 people were feared missing in landslides in hilly areas of Kottayam and Idukki districts, prompting the state government to seek help of the armed forces for rescue operations.“The situation is really serious in some parts of the state. We will do everything possible to save lives,” chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in a statement after chairing an emergency meeting in the state capital. “We have sought help from the army, navy and air force. Relief camps have been set up in the districts.”The state government was monitoring water levels in all dams, the chief minister said. Three districts — Kottayam, Pathanamthitta and Idukki — were worst affected due to the torrential rains.The authorities have halted pilgrimage to the Sabarimala hill temple in Pathanamthitta district due to the inclement weather. All colleges and higher education centres will remain shut till Wednesday.At least 22 people were feared missing in the landslides that occurred in the hilly areas bordering the Kottayam and Idukki districts. In Idukki, bodies of two persons were retrieved after the car they were travelling in was washed away. They are yet to be identified, police said. Sixteen other rain-related deaths were reported from Pathanamthitta and Kottayam.The India Meteorological Department has sounded red alert in six districts — Kottayam, Pathanamthitta, Thrissur, Ernakulam, Idukki and Palakkad.Most of these districts have witnessed heavy rains since Friday night. Many dams in the vicinity were filled to the brim and sluice gates of some were opened to ease pressure. Some areas in Kottayam received 30 cm rainfall in the past 24 hours, the Met department said. Some areas will witness high winds, it said.At Kootickal in Kottayam, three houses were destroyed in a landslide. There were unconfirmed reports about six bodies being retrieved. The district administration is yet to confirm it. Since the area is marooned after the landslide, the administration has sought help of the army. The toll may rise, given the severity of the landslide, an official said on condition of anonymity.“At least four landslips have been reported in Kottayam and the one is Kootickal is major. Many people are stranded and we have sought the help of Air Force copters to shift them,” said state cooperation minister V N Vasavan, who hails from the district. Earlier in the day, the chief minister said six teams of the National Disaster Response Force were deployed in the affected areas and two teams of the army will be deployed. Air Force teams have been kept on standby, he said.The government was closely monitoring the situation and at least 5,000 families have been shifted to relief camps across the state, Kerala revenue minister K Rajan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-die-cm-vijayan-seeks-help-of-forces-as-rain-lashes-kerala-101634407687267.html
17-10-2021||India||NSCN (IM) alleges Centre of trying to rush Naga peace talks; reaffirms stand||The Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (NSCN-IM), with whom the Government of India signed the Framework Agreement in 2015 to pursue a solution to the decades-old Naga political issue, has accused the latter of trying to rush the peace talks by offering post-solution options.In a fresh statement, the NSCN (IM) said the huge burden of the Naga political issue, which the Government of India is struggling to unload, is not the making of the Naga people rather deeply rooted in “India’s malicious pleasure violating the historical and political rights of the Naga people for more than six decades”.In the present context, the outfit alleged that Centre was planting “made in India collaborators” to confuse the Nagas with high-sounding promises without political commitment to fulfil as was done in the past. The NSCN (IM) is, however, no longer naive enough to be carried away by such outrageous flattery, the statement said. “The checkered history of the Indo-Naga political issue is clear enough before us, with accords and agreements that were never meant to be implemented in letter and spirit. Naturally, the Nagas are still haunted by this flamboyant show of dealing on the Naga issue,” the NSCN (IM) maintained.“NSCN’s stand is loud and clear that it would not follow the forbidden route to the Naga solution that is linked to foregoing the Naga national flag and constitution which is the face of the Naga political struggle and identity,” the NSCN (IM) asserted.Besides the NSCN (IM), which has been in a ceasefire agreement with the Centre since 1997, the Government of India is also in talks with a conglomeration of seven Naga national political groups (NNPGs) with whom it had signed “Agreed Position” in 2017. Although the NSCN (IM) did not take any names, its statement was issued close on the heels of the statement made by the NNPGs working committee convener N Kitovi Zhimomi who said the Naga flag’s unrestrained political usage and Naga integration would be pursued democratically post-solution.People familiar with the matter said that the leaders of the NNPGs, the NSCN (IM) and the Niki Sumi-led Khaplang faction of NSCN (NSCN-K) were all in Delhi recently, holding separate meetings with the Centre’s new emissary for Naga peace talks AK Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nscn-im-alleges-centre-of-trying-to-rush-naga-peace-talks-reaffirms-stand-101634381226879.html

17-10-2021||Editorials||The importance of the Delhi government’s mentoring programme||Last week, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal launched an ambitious programme, Desh Ke Mentors, for students of the Capital’s government-run schools. Under the programme, 0.9 million students of classes 9 to 12 ---- the crucial years when students decide on their future career paths --- will be connected with mentors from various professional and academic backgrounds to help them in their overall growth and personality development by sharing knowledge, skills and expertise. The mentors will engage with their mentees over the phone for 10-15 minutes every day, and interested citizens from across the country can join the effort by registering on the Desh ke Mentors app. During the launch of the programme, Mr Kejriwal said that other than helping the students with their educational needs, the programme could motivate people to start seeing beyond the fault lines of caste, creed, and religion.
17-10-2021||Editorials||The Congress moves half a step||The key outcome of the Congress’s first in-person working committee meeting in 18 months on Saturday was a decision to proceed with internal party elections. Except that these internal elections will take place over the next 11 months, and the new Congress president will be elected only by the end of September 2022. If Rahul Gandhi had not resigned as party president right after the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, and remained president, the end of 2022 is when his five-year term according to the party constitution would have been ending in any case. So, the Congress is almost proceeding as if nothing has changed in the interim — even though, in this period, after it lost a second successive Lok Sabha election, it failed to win back power in Haryana and Assam; got decimated in West Bengal; lost its most important troubleshooter and political manager in Ahmed Patel; has been managing internal crises in Punjab, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, and a part-rebellion in Delhi; lacks a clear leader or road map for the 2024 election; and is facing a challenge from others in the Opposition in multiple states.
