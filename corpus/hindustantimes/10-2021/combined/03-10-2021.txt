The Ayodhya model, that would also include the upcoming Ram temple, foundation stone of which was laid by Modi in 2020, would be the star attraction at the UP pavilion. The pavilion would also showcase the upcoming Jewar international airport in Noida, billed among the country’s biggest, besides several other best practices followed in urban development across the state. However, the highlight would be the centrally placed installation theme of Ayodhya. It would showcase multiple amenities that have been developed on 30 acres of tourism department land near Naya Ghat, known as the Ram Katha Park Parisar. These include a ‘Ram Katha museum, Yatri Niwas, open air theatre, Queen Heo park, tourist facilitation centre and digital museum. The Ayodhya model would also showcase the proposed Greenfield Township aimed at promoting tourism and pilgrim facilities in Ayodhya. “The Greenfield Township is based on the Vedic City planning principles, where the city is oriented in the cardinal directions. The township will also have state of the art transport system and have clean energy. The layout of the Greenfield Township would be integrated with the Maryada Purushottam International Airport, existing by-pass and the railway station. It would also have the Saryu riverside promenade that would be integrated with the ghats,” said state’s urban development minister Ashutosh Tandon ‘Gopal.’ All the buildings shall be certified through Green Building Rating System ‘GRIHA’. “The idea is to create a clean township with waste water recycling,” he added. The senior minister in Yogi Adityanath government said that it was expected that by 2047 Ayodhya would receive more than 100 million visitors annually. “Towards this mission the Modi government at the centre and the Yogi government in UP are in the process of developing numerous infrastructure and other development projects. Apart from the expected 100 million annual visitors, all planning is being done factoring in 25 lakh residents of the Ayodhya Development Authority area,” he added. The Ayodhya model will also project the new-look Ayodhya with its six approach roads widened, development of approach road leading towards the Ram temple and pilgrim-friendly parikrama marg (circumambulation routes). There are plans to host an investors’ summit in Ayodhya in November. Both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath have taken keen interest in the development of Ayodhya, with both leaders regularly monitoring the temple town’s development.

Officials said that cases are likely to increase due to an influx of migratory population over the next few weeks and increased social interactions. Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram, said, “Cases of dengue will continue to increase this year and we are likely to reach the peak by early November. Usually, around this time of the year, many people from different states come to Gurugram for pregnancy deliveries, treatment and routine immunisation. We are keeping a close watch on such population along with focal spray and residual spray in areas along the border.”Officials of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) said they are complying with directions issued by the health department for conducting anti-larval activities.“The entire supervision for anti vector-borne operations, including fogging, is carried out by the health department. Based on their directions, MCG teams are sent to different parts of the city for such activities,” a senior MCG official privy to the matter.The health department has asked the local agencies to ensure that fogging is being done on a regular basis at the hotspots identified, along with rest of the city. So far, Gurugram has reported two cases of malaria. No cases of chikungunya have been reported this year till now. Yadav said that the district task force would be meeting next week to assess the situation and identify more hotspots for increased surveillance. So far, the health department has identified 13 hotspots in the city, from where dengue cases have been reported. According to the health department, almost 50% of the dengue cases this year have been reported from Wazirabad, with Palam Vihar, Basai, Jharsa village and Kanhai Colony, among others, also identified as hotspots.On September 15, the state health department asked all the districts to step up the surveillance by increasing sample collection for dengue and malaria at outpatient departments (OPDs) and flu corners at primary health centres and community health centres and conduct testing on the people daily to avert an outbreak. All multi-purpose health workers have also been instructed to carry out source reduction and anti-larval measures in both, urban and peri-urban areas, especially in districts adjoining the National Capital Region (NCR).Officials of the district health department said they have increased surveillance for dengue and malaria over the past few weeks. The district health department has also started screening in areas located at borders with other states and districts.Yadav also urged people exhibiting symptoms to consult doctors immediately and not self-medicate, which could lead to further complications.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dengue-21-cases-reported-in-a-week-in-gurugram-13-hotspots-identified-101633284905808.html

Barring Yadav, the other candidates had all contested in MCG elections before.Fifty-three voters opted for the None Of The Above (NOTA) option.The total number of eligible voters for the elections was 28,668, and the overall turnout was 30.27%, as per a district administration release.The MCG by-poll was held to fill the Ward 34 seat after the incumbent councillor, RS Rathee, Rama Rathee’s husband, died of Covid-19 on May 30.Before her late husband’s tenure, Rama had served as the councillor of Ward 34 from 2011 to 2016 as an independent candidate.Rama attributed her win to her recent affiliation with the BJP, since the last month.“Residents of Ward 34 have seen me working as a councillor before, and remembered the work I had achieved during my tenure, which was carried forward afterwards by my late husband. The victory is a sign that residents of Ward 34 continue to show faith and believe in my family’s contribution to the area,” Rama said.She said that she will resume work on all the projects and other initiatives that her husband had been working on before his death. She said that among her top priorities are de-silting sewerage lines, installing sewage treatment plants (STPs), and widening the water supply and drainage lines to meet the present as well as future demands of the ward.Areas of DLF Phases 1, 2, sectors 28, 42, Sikanderpur, Chakkarpur, and the Mall Mile fall under Ward 34, which has a population of around 125,000.Voting for the elections started at 8am and continued till 4.30pm, following which the counting of votes started. The results of the elections were declared around 8.30pm by the district administration.There were 12 polling stations for the elections, located at Chakkarpur, Sikanderpur, Sushant Lok-1, Maruti Vihar, DLF Phase-1, DLF Phase-2, Sector 27, and at societies of Essel Towers, Garden Estate, and Heritage City.The turnout at the stations remained scarce throughout the day and there were no instances of rush or queues forming at any of the locations.Residents of the ward expressed relief of getting a representative and said that they will now take up issues of civic amenities in their area with the newly elected councillor.“Two projects in our area have been left midway due to the absence of a councillor who could take up the matter on the residents’ behalf with the MCG for redressal. One of these was completing the construction of a common sewerage line, and a stretch of arterial road that needs to be broken and reconstructed so that it is aligned with the stormwater line passing parallel to it,” said Vijay Bharadwaj, a resident of Maruti Vihar.In DLF Phases 1 and 2, a large number of residents said that they will now ask their councillor to expedite the MCG’s takeover of the townships.“The takeover of our colony was announced way back in February 2016. It is more than five years but the transfer is nowhere in sight. I, hence, voted for a local candidate who is familiar with the matter, with the hope that they will take up the issue on priority,” Gaurav Bansal, a resident of DLF Phase-1, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-ward-34-polls-rama-rathee-is-new-area-councillor-101633284904207.html

03-10-2021||Mumbai||Parents of 60% kids in BMC schools say yes to physical classes in Mumbai||Parents of around 60% of over 67,000 children studying in Class 8 to 10 at 781 civic-run schools of the city have given consent for sending their child to the school starting Monday for offline classes. Starting today, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has given permission to reopen both private and public schools for Class 8 to 12. According to BMC officials, 781 civic-run secondary high schools in Mumbai have 67,361 students in Class 8-10 who are eligible to attend school from Monday. A BMC official from the education department said, “The overall picture is that around 60% of the parents are ready to give their consent in writing to the school that will make their children eligible for offline classes. The written consent is at a different stage and the system is expected to streamline within the next 15 days, considering it is a soft start from Monday.” The BMC official added, “Several parents are not ready to send their children as festivals are coming and maybe they have gone to their native place due to online classes. However, we will continue ensuring maximum students take advantage of offline classes.” The BMC had in its SOP on Thursday told all schools that 100% attendance is not mandatory, and parents’ consent is necessary for students to attend school. The SOP details guidelines across nine parameters, including attendance, safety and Covid-19 hygiene, teaching, seating arrangements in classrooms, for school managements, teachers, students, and parents. The BMC has mandated that school managements should link their schools with the nearest primary health centres before restarting classes, to better deal with health emergencies among students and staff. According to BMC officials, of the total 781 secondary high schools, 21 schools will not be able to operate starting Monday. BMC education officer Raju Tadvi said, “A few of our schools have quarantine facilities and vaccination centres inside their premises. Hence, they will take time to start. These centres will be first shifted out of the schools and later there will be disinfection posts in which we will resume classes in these schools.” Tadvi added, “The estimated number of schools starting from Monday is 760 and the estimated number of teachers and non-teaching staff is 3,600 followed by an estimated number of students to attend is 38,000.” BMC officials are also going to railway authorities to issue passes to students travelling by local train and also have requested the BEST to allow students to travel for free as per the earlier arrangement. Further, as schools restart, a maximum of 15-20 students will be allowed per classroom at a time. If there are more students, the school can conduct classes in two batches, by dividing students in two groups, and calling them on alternative days. Actual classrooms will operate for not more than three-four hours, and there will be no lunch breaks. Air-conditioning will not be operated in classrooms. Meanwhile, schools have also been instructed not to give out certificates or awards for 100% attendance owing to the Covid-19 situation. On campus, masks are mandatory. All teachers attending school for teaching classes 8 to 12 need to be vaccinated with both doses or need to take an RT-PCR test 48 hours prior, and the school management is required to verify such reports with the laboratory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/parents-of-60-kids-in-bmc-schools-say-yes-to-physical-classes-in-mumbai-101633282260357.html

The exam was conducted in two sessions in the online mode across the country and majority students found the paper moderately difficult, with the maths section being the most difficult.“There were tricky questions asked in the Maths section and maximum questions were asked from the Class 9 syllabus,” said Vishesh Rane, a student. This year the JEE-Advanced exam has been conducted by IIT-Kharagpur.Last year, JEE-Mains was held in two sessions in order to give students a chance to better their score. This year, the National Testing Agency (NTA) decided to hold JEE-Mains in four sessions. While the February and March sessions were held as per schedule, the April and May sessions were deferred due to the increasing Covid-19 cases and were finally held in July, August and September. A total of 1,048,000 students had registered for the exams over four sessions and 939,000 appeared for the tests. The top 250,000 students who cleared JEE-Mains were eligible to appear for JEE-Advanced but only 160,000 registered for the same this year.“IIT-Kharagpur has maintained the difficulty level of JEE-Advanced paper. Both Maths and Chemistry sections were difficult this year in both sessions.

At least 23,700 tonne was procured on Day 1. Paddy arrival started from September 20, with formal procurement starting from Sunday. Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi launched paddy procurement operations for the state from the Morinda Grain Market on Sunday. Patiala, Ludhiana, Mohali Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Hoshiarpur and Tarn Taran districts have seen crop arrival. The Centre has allowed 17% moisture in the freshly harvested crop. Punjab food and civil supplies department officials said that the moisture in the crop reaching grain markets was well within permissible norms. “We have made arrangements (for procurement), and the staff of the food department and four procurement agencies have reached mandis,” said a senior officer of the Punjab food and civil supplies department, adding that adequate availability of gunny bags had also been ensured.The Punjab government has set up 3,000 mandis for buying the crop. The state agriculture department estimates that 190 lakh tonne of paddy is expected to reach grain markets for procurement. The Centre is offering the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of ₹1,960 a quintal for A-grade paddy; the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has released a Cash Credit Limit (CCL) of ₹35,700 crore. The state’s four agencies, namely the Pungrain, the Markfed, the Warehousing Corporation and Punsup, besides the Centre’s Food Corporation of India (FCI), will buy the paddy. HITCH BEFORE PROCUREMENT SEASONThe procurement process had to be postponed for 10 days on September 30 this year, a day before it usually starts on October 1. This decision of postponement was based on an FCI report, which stated that due to delayed spell of rain this time, there was high moisture content in the crop, and it might take a week to 10 days to be ready. However, after pressure by farmers, the state government and the opposition parties, including the Shiromani Akali Dal, the Union agriculture ministry reviewed its decision. “In the interest of farmers, it has been decided to start procurement of paddy from October 3,” a communication, released on Saturday evening, from the Centre’s ministry of food and public distribution said. Chief minister Channi had also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, seeking the start of procurement as paddy has started arriving in mandis and any delay could lead to harassment of farmers. FLYING SQUADS FORMED TO CHECK ILLEGAL SALE To stop the illegal practice of mixing or recycling of paddy and rice brought from nearby states at a cheaper rates into freshly procured paddy, Punjab food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu has asked deputy commissioners to constitute flying squads at the market committee level.A spokesperson said the flying squad will comprise a representative each of the DC, the mandi board, the excise and taxation (the GST wing) and the police department. The spokesperson added that committees will submit a daily report to the deputy commissioners on the checking of unauthorised paddy and rice, impounding of trucks, sealing of godowns and seizures of paddy and rice brought from the outside states. In Jalandhar district, 78 purchase centres were set up with 3,610 tonne paddy arriving for procurement. Deputy commissioner Ghanshyam Thori said officials had been asked to ensure timely procurement, lifting and procurement. In Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar, more than 1,500 tonne of paddy arrived, with Kapurthala at 3,200 tonne; of this, government agencies purchased 70% (2,226 tonne).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/paddy-procurement-begins-in-punjab-over-23-000-tonne-purchased-on-day-1-101633281960184.html
03-10-2021||Mumbai||‘Why is Maharashtra govt silent on claim that Marathis are minority in Belgaum?’||Continuing its aggressive stance on the Maharashtra-Karnataka border dispute, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Sunday questioned the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government’s silence over Karnataka governments’ attempt to show that the Marathi-speaking population in Belgaum region has reduced. The Sena Member of Parliament said MVA ministers, who are appointed as coordinators over the dispute, must visit Karnataka and take up the issue. The Sena chief spokesperson said the Karnataka government has shown a decreasing number of Marathi-speaking people in the border areas for their political gains. He said he will speak to chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray over the issue. According to a recent report, the Karnataka government had logged the Marathi population in the border areas, including Belgaum, Karwar, Nipani, at about 15%, which is a lie. “The Maharashtra government must take a stand in this matter. I don’t understand why it has remained silent on this. The state government has appointed two ministers — Eknath Shinde and Chhagan Bhujbal — as coordinators over the border dispute. They must immediately go there (Karnataka) and engage with leaders in the border area. If the Maharashtra government does not feel the need to take any steps in this matter, then it is unfortunate. I will definitely take up this matter with CM,” Raut said. The Shiv Sena has been aggressive with the border dispute as it is in line with its Marathi manoos ideology and helps the party to corner the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state. Raut said that over 65 villages in the border areas had about 60% Marathi natives when the state was carved out in 1960. “Even today, the Marathi population is around the same. The Karnataka government has converted the entire region to Kannada-speaking by making it the second capital and by buying lands belonging to the Marathi people. By doing such things, they have tried to show a lower percentage of Marathi-speaking population in these areas for their political gains... If they are saying that [Marathis] are in minority with 15% [of the population] then this is a lie. This report is completely untrue and there has to be some conspiracy behind it,” he said. The Sena, which had backed the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti in the recently concluded Belgaum municipal elections, said Marathis are in majority in border areas. The Belgaum municipal corporation polls showed that Marathi candidates got more votes than BJP candidates. The Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti candidates got 67,000 votes, while BJP got around 44,000 votes, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/why-is-maharashtra-govt-silent-on-claim-that-marathis-are-minority-in-belgaum-101633281780125.html
03-10-2021||Mumbai||BMC polls: BJP may need to relook at ‘Mission 2022’ to wrest power from Shiv Sena||A year after losing power in Maharashtra to its erstwhile ally Shiv Sena, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2020 had launched an ambitious ‘Mission 2022’, which aimed to oust the Uddhav Thackeray-led party from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The Sena has held power in BMC for several decades (1985-1992 and 1997-present). BJP aims to wrest control of BMC, which has been Sena’s source of clout and resources for three decades, and set the stage for the Thackeray-led Maharashtra government’s defeat in the next elections or even the collapse of the three-party ruling coalition before that. BMC, with its budget of ₹39,038.83 crore last year, is the richest civic body in India, and has played a major role in the growth of the Shiv Sena. However in the past 10 months, BJP leaders feel that there is confusion over the way forward and that they would need a course correction. The local leadership is not effective enough to take the Sena head-on, there is flip-flop on part of the party over the issue of alliance with the Raj Thackeray-led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) and moreover, some controversies created by the party leaders have given the Sena leaders an ammunition to charge up the party workers and even BJP’s loyal support base. The situation is different as compared to the 2017 civic elections when the party had launched a spirited campaign to oust the Sena, though the two parties were running a government in the state together. Many workers pointed out that one of the major factors is the local leadership in Mumbai, which is not effective. Currently, Mumbai BJP is led by senior legislator Mangal Prabhat Lodha. Former chief minister (CM) Devendra Fadnavis, who has taken up the responsibility to deliver BMC to the party, has backed BJP legislator Atul Bhatkhalkar to handle the party affairs for effectively kick-starting the BJP poll machine. A senior Mumbai BJP leader said: “We need to have a proper plan to take on the Sena step-by-step. If there is one [plan], then we have not been told about it yet. We have multiple issues to corner the Shiv Sena but then we need someone to lead us headstrong. As it has shown in [Union minister] Narayan Rane’s case, the Sena will resort to strong arm tactics and we need to match it,” said the leader. A senior BJP corporator, on the condition of anonymity, said, “We have 16 legislators in Mumbai, but most of them are occupied in winning BMC tickets for their kin. Many don’t even want us to win the seats as they are afraid that the winners may later stake claim for Assembly tickets from their areas.” Political analyst Hemant Desai said that the current BJP leadership in the city lacks the aggression to take on the Shiv Sena. “It is difficult for Lodha and Bhatkhalkar to take on the aggressive Sena machinery which has a grassroot-level network in Mumbai through its shakhas (units). In the 2017 elections, the party had spared no efforts to oust the Sena from BMC. That kind of campaign is not visible as of now,” said Desai. “Last time, the BJP government headed by Fadnavis had also played a major role in providing resources to the party campaign, which is absent this time. Today, the Sena heads the state government and will spare no efforts to retain BMC, which has been its citadel for decades,” he added. Analysts said that three incidents have played a major role in bringing the Sena back to the streets and put BJP in the defensive. In June, clashes broke out between Shiv Sena and BJP workers as the latter’s youth wing took out a protest march towards the Sena Bhavan after Sena mouthpiece Saamana made ‘offensive remarks’ on the Ayodhya land deal controversy. Later, BJP leader Prasad Lad’s remarks – that party workers would destroy Sena Bhavan – evoked a strong reaction from the Sena cadre as well as the party’s support base, which is the Marathi-speaking population. Lad retracted his comment, stating that it was taken out of context, however, it galvanised the grassroot Sena workers in Mumbai. The final nail in the coffin was in August when Rane, BJP’s Union minister, sparked off a row with his remark about slapping the CM. Rane had claimed that Thackeray was unaware of the year of India’s Independence. Three first information reports (FIR) were registered and Rane was arrested over his remarks. Though he was granted bail within hours, the incident infused the Sena workers, who took to the streets against the Union minister. There were Sena agitations across Maharashtra, condemning Rane. One of the agitations was held by the Yuva Sena – the youth wing of Shiv Sena – outside Rane’s Juhu residence in Mumbai. Another political analyst, Surendra Jondhale, blamed BJP for invigorating the Sena. “The Sena workers were in limbo from the past one-and-half years, ever since they had a government in the state. But these incidents, especially [the one related to Rane] put life into them and they were back to the streets. This could cost BJP very dearly as now even Thackeray has realised that these workers cannot remain quiet and he is discreetly supporting them. The Sena network is still influential to win BMC polls,” said Jondhale. Meanwhile, Desai pointed out that an “enemy” like Rane campaigning aggressively would charge up the Sena workers. Besides, the Sena’s efforts to mobilise the Marathi vote bank will also have an effect on the polls. In 2017, BJP had contested alone on the plank of bringing transparency in Asia’s richest civic body and “freeing them from the clutches of the Shiv Sena”. The party surprised everyone by bagging 82 seats, which was a whisker away from wresting power from the Shiv Sena, which had bagged just two seats more to regain power. The BJP campaign is being spear-headed by Fadnavis, for whom BJP workers have high regard. However, many of them think that he has given preference to defectors from other parties instead of loyalists. “The loyal workers who have slogged for decades have to make way for defectors from other parties. Today, Lad (who defected from Sena’s current ally in state Nationalist Congress Party) and Pravin Darekar (from MNS) have more influence in city BJP,” a party veteran, who has been currently sidelined, said. “Top leaders such as Vinod Tawde, Raj Purohit and Prakash Mehta, who know the city at the back of their hands and were denied tickets in the last Assembly elections, have been fully sidelined and are hardly contributing to the campaign,” he added. Dismissing these claims, the BJP has called reports of demoralisation of cadres as misleading. “All our workers are ready to face the elections and it is only the Shiv Sena which is afraid and trying to postpone it. We are confident of a landslide victory,” said Bhatkalkar. He also dismissed any factionalism in BJP, saying that the party will win more seats this time from 2017. “The factionalism and leadership issues are a figment of imagination of the media. This time, we are fully prepared to contest all the 227 seats unlike last time, when we were still unsure of having an alliance with the Shiv Sena,” said Bhatkalkar. “People have seen how the Thackeray government has stopped major projects started by the Fadnavis regime and made their lives miserable. They are witness to the corruption in BMC and the ruining of the civic services. Citizens will vote Shiv Sena out of BMC,” said Bhatkalkar. Responding to the issue of new entrants to the party, Bhatkalkar added: “We in BJP assimilate outsiders and they contribute to the growth of our party. There is no dissatisfaction over them.”Former BJP chief Ashish Shelar said Prime Minister Narendra Modi will continue to be a major factor in the upcoming BMC election. “Modiji will play a major factor, considering the manner in which he is handling the whole country and even Fadnavis’ developmental work will influence the whole campaign,” said Shelar. Another factor causing anxiety in the party ranks is the party’s equation with Raj Thackeray’s MNS. The visit of BJP’s Maharashtra president Chandrakant Patil to Raj Thackeray’s house has not gone well with the ranks. “Our leaders need to realise that any truck with MNS will alienate our North Indian votebank. In addition, the Marathi voters will support the Shiv Sena in large numbers as they will see MNS as the spoiler and this will in fact help in consolidating the Sena’s vote bank,” said a North Indian BJP leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-polls-bjp-may-need-to-relook-at-mission-2022-to-wrest-power-from-shiv-sena-101633281660141.html
03-10-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena maintains silence over claims that Ramdas Kadam leaked info against state min||A day after Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) leader Vaibhav Khedekar alleged that information against state transport minister Anil Parab was leaked by Ramdas Kadam – his colleague in the Shiv Sena – through Prasad Karve, the Uddhav Thackeray-led party has maintained silence on the issue. Party insiders said that the issue consists of personal enmity between Kadam and Parab.On Saturday, Khedekar – chairman of Khed nagar panchayat in Ratnagiri – in a press conference with Nationalist Congress Party leader Sanjay Kadam had produced eight audio clips that were purportedly between Shiv Sena leader Ramdas Kadam and a Right to Information (RTI) activist. Khedekar alleged that the information related to the irregularities in a resort and an office on a Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) plot linked to Parab was provided by Kadam. Parab has earlier maintained that he has no links with these two constructions.Party insiders said Kadam’s brother Sadanand is one of Parab’s business partners. The duo have been associates since the time Parab was involved in the cable network wing in Mumbai and parts of the state. Senior functionaries said Kadam did not appreciate that the party overlooked him while forming the government under Thackeray. It is also believed that Kadam was close to Bharatiya Janata Party leaders during the Devendra Fadnavis government. In 2017, when Parab was made the leader of the party in the legislative Council, Kadam had reportedly expressed his unhappiness to the party chief. Kadam’s term in the upper house of the state legislature ends in January 2022.“This issue is not directly related to the party. There has been personal enmity between Ramdas Bhai and Parab for the past 30 years. Kadam’s brother has been Parab’s a long-term associate and has been helping him, which doesn’t go well with him (Kadam),” a senior party functionary said, on the condition of anonymity. Parab was not available for comment.In the audio clips, Kadam is reportedly speaking to Prasad Karve, who had lodged an official complaint over the irregularities of a resort in Dapoli. Kadam is also heard responding “very good” to Karve’s information that the district collector has formed a committee to probe the alleged coastal regulation zone (CRZ) violations. Sadanand Gangaram Kadam, according to the allegations of BJP leader Kirit Somaiya, was reportedly the owner of the plot on which Sai Resort in Dapoli was constructed.Ramdas Kadam, however, dismissed reports of personal enmity between him, his brother and Parab. He maintained that it was an opposition party’s (MNS) campaign to defame him. “I have already spoken enough on this issue on Saturday. This is nothing but a campaign to defame me. I do not pay heed to these things. I am seeking advice from my lawyers over this and will pursue legal action,” Kadam said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-maintains-silence-over-claims-that-ramdas-kadam-leaked-info-against-state-min-101633281600451.html
03-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai colleges start prep to reopen||At a time when schools across the state are all set to welcome students back on campus after nearly 19 months of online classes, city colleges too are starting preparations for a similar move in the near future. They have started to draw up lists of fully vaccinated staff and students, assessing total classrooms available and sanitisation schedule to avoid last-minute decisions. “The state announced reopening of schools last week and ordered all schools to implement the move within a week. We don’t want to be caught unawares, so want to ensure all necessary work is done in advance,” said the vice-principal of a management institute in suburban Mumbai. Last week, state minister for school education Varsha Gaikwad announced that after a 19-month break, schools in the state will reopen starting October 4. In a series of tweets, Gaikwad mentioned that in rural areas, physical classes for Class 5 to 12 will resume, while in urban areas, physical classes for class 8 to 12 will resume. The schools will be reopened in phased manner, she added. While this was not the first time that schools in the state were asked to work towards re-opening physical classes in a phased manner, this has been the first time that the local municipal body has approved the move. In August, Gaikwad announced that offline classes will restart for Classes 5 to 8 in rural areas and Classes 8 to 12 in urban cities, following Covid-19 protocols starting August 17. This decision was not approved by the BMC. Similarly in November last year, the school education department had released a similar circular announcing re-opening of schools for classes 9 to 12 in a phased manner. By January 2021, another circular was released directing students from classes 5 to 8 be brought back to school in groups and maintain Covid-appropriate behaviour on campus. Both these circulars, however, were revoked once Covid cases started to rise and the state called for another complete lockdown starting mid-April. “As per the latest decision, we have to start physical classes for students from Class 11 and 12 and since we are still unsure of how this will work out, we’ve only called Class 12 students as a pilot and then assess the situation. For degree college students, we have already started drawing up lists of vaccinated people, because government officials have hinted at physical classes for all students post Diwali holidays,” said Marie Fernandes, principal of St Andrew’s College, Bandra. Some colleges have also suggested holding a vaccination camp on their premises to ensure staff, both teaching and non-teaching, as well as their respective families are vaccinated soon. “We started calling our staff back to college since August last year on a rotational basis and that has worked for us. We’ve been encouraging staff to get vaccinated and at present all our teachers are fully vaccinated.

The answer sheets cannot be there at the exam centres and it can be leaked only with the involvement of secrecy wing official,” he told reporters here. Meena said it is REET candidates’ demand that the exam should be cancelled and a CBI inquiry should be ordered. After several irregularities and negligence came to light in the conduct of the exam, the state government suspended one RAS officer, two RPS officers, one head constable, two constables and over a dozen personnel of the Education Department. The exam, for which 16.51 lakh candidates had enrolled, was held for the recruitment of over 30,000 teachers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/bjp-mp-reiterates-demand-for-reet-cancellation-alleges-paper-leaked-before-exam-101633277701602.html

Following the nod by RJD chief Lalu Prasad, the party’s state president Jagdanand Singh Sunday announced the names of Arun Shah and Ganesh Bharati from Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan, respectively.The death of lawmakers representing the two seats necessitated the bypolls.Meanwhile, close on the heels of the RJD’s listing of its candidates, the Congress on Sunday said that it was also contemplating fielding its nominees for both the seats.Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) president Madan Mohan Jha said that the party has almost finalised its candidate for the Kusheshwar Asthan assembly seat in Darbhanga reserved for the scheduled caste, while the consultations were underway to decide the candidate for Tarapur constituency in Munger. “However, the final decision on naming the candidates would be taken by the party high command, who has been apprised about the developments, post the RJD’s decision to field its nominees on both the seats,” said Jha. All India Congress Committee (AICC) in charge, Bihar, Bhakta Charan Das, could not be contacted for his comments. Leaders close to him said that Das, who is currently in Manipur, would make the formal announcement about the next course of action upon consultations with AICC chief Sonia Gandhi in a couple of days. Meanwhile, the RJD chief took the Congress by surprise with the announcement of the names of the nominees. “The announcement came as shock to the party, as we were following the coalition dharma and was preparing for the Kusheshwar Asthan seat, which was allocated to the Congress under the seat adjustment among the opposition alliance during the 2020 assembly elections,” said Jha. Former Congress legislature party (CLP) leader Ashok Kumar had contested from Kusheshwar Asthan and lost the elections to the Janata Dal (United) leader Shashi Bhushan Hazari by a margin of little over 7,000 votes in the last assembly polls. RJD’s candidate Divya Prakash was also defeated by the JD(U)’s candidate Mewalal Chaudhary at Tarapur constituency by almost an equal margin. Ashok Kumar said the party has been watching the developments and if required, would contest both the seats going to bypolls. “I have been the claimant, as I have nurtured the seat. It is like humiliating the Congress. Our party vice president Rahul Gandhi’s decision will be final in this regard and we are preparing for both seats,” he said.Senior Congress leader Kishore Kumar Jha also said that the party must assert its position and contest both the seats to give a message among the cadres that it would not compromise on its self-respect. “Ashok Kumar is a popular leader and he lost the polls due to malpractices resorted to by the ruling alliance. The Congress is at the crossroads and it must decide what to do now, as the RJD has stabbed in its back,” said Kishore Jha. A section of the senior party leaders, including a former BPCC chief, said that being a national party with a presence in all villages across the state had no dearth of capable leaders. “But cadres of the party have been lying low owing to its propensity for the alliance politics in Bihar. The party’s tally in the assembly declined, as it was not offered to the seats of its choice and had to contest those areas that were not familiar to the contestants,” said another senior leader. Meanwhile, RJD state president Singh said both the candidates of the party were nominees of the grand alliance, insisting that the party has a strong base in both the seats and would win. “Our objective is to win. The grand alliance is intact, there are no differences of any kind,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-bypolls-rjd-to-contest-both-seats-humiliated-cong-mulls-over-fielding-its-candidates-101633278419913.html

The 10-day festival is set to begin on October 7 and conclude on October 15. The state government has allowed Durga Puja celebration following Covid-19 safety measures under Unlock 7.For keeping visitors safe, local Puja organisers are making arrangements for pandemic-appropriate festival celebrations, which include provisions for thermal screening, sanitisation and vaccination of volunteers involved in puja celebration. Majority of them have also scaled down the size of pandals and idols to prevent huge gathering of devotees.Shri Navyuvak Sangh Puja Committee, which attracts lakhs of devotees near Dak Bungalow, has decided to go for low-key celebration. “There will be traditional puja with Kalash Sthapna. We are not establishing idols of the Goddess or life-size pandals, as handling crowd would be difficult for us,” said Ranjan Kumar, vice-president of the committee.Govind Mitra Road Puja Committee too has decided to erect smaller idols. “Pandal erection has already started. Instead of 14 feet high idols, we have placed order for eight feet high idols. Flower decoration on the pandal will be the centre of attraction”, said Arjun Yadav, president of the committee.Bengali Akhara, known for celebrating Durga Puja with authentic Bengali tradition since 1893, has opted for open-sky pandal theme this year. “We have called craftsmen from West Bengal to craft six feet tall idols. We will also arrange for sanitisers and social distancing inside temple premises. Prasad distribution will be less to avoid gathering,” said secretary of the committee Amit Sinha.Meanwhile, the Dussehra Committee Trust has commenced preparations for Ravan Vadh programme, which will be held at Kalidas Rangalaya on October 14.Kamal Nopani, chairperson of the trust, said, “Artisans have started crafting 15 feet-tall effigies of Ravana along with Kumbhakarna (13 feet) and Meghanada (11 feet). Another 10 feet-tall Covid-19 effigy, red in colour and having spikes, is being prepared. We are likely to complete all preparations by October 12.”A maximum of 300 visitors will be allowed to attend the event in view of Covid-19 guidelines, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/patna-to-see-smaller-idols-this-durga-puja-101633276139715.html

The petitioners, who were deployed as inspectors, sub-inspectors and assistant sub-inspectors across police stations of Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Gurdaspur districts, had filed their application in the apex court on September 21.The apex court’s decision comes a month after the Punjab and Haryana high court had dismissed the retired cops’ plea. On September 2, justice Arvind Singh Sangwan upheld the jurisdiction of CBI Jammu to probe the cases of disappearance of the youths, most of whom were from Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Gurdaspur districts.With this, most of the police officials indicted by the CBI in their charge-sheets, would face trial in the case before the special CBI court in Mohali. One of the cops Bhupinderjeet Singh Virk is serving as senior superintendent of police (SSP) in Bathinda.CASE REGISTERED IN 1997The case against these police officials was registered in 1997 after the direction of the apex court to the CBI. In 1999, the CBI had filed charge-sheets against most of the cops, but the trial could not start, with accused moving the HC and obtaining stay orders.The main plea of the accused was that the CBI didn’t have any territorial jurisdiction to register the case in Jammu, for incidents related to Punjab. The CBI counsel had, however, submitted that the case was registered on the direction of the apex court and, therefore, the jurisdiction of the Jammu branch was extended to probe these cases.Senior advocate RS Bains, who represents families of the victims in the case, said, “With the Supreme Court dismissing the plea, a ray of hope for justice has emerged after 30 years. The accused had been delaying the trial since the CBI had registered the case. Most victims were kidnapped, killed and bodies cremated as unclaimed. The CBI probe had found that these men were killed in fake encounters.”He said many of the cops are retired while some are still serving on higher posts, and some are already in jails in other cases. “On July 22, 1993, my brother Gulshan Kumar along with Jarnail Singh and his brother Karnail Singh of Zira, and Harjinder Singh of Tarn Taran were killed by Tarn Taran police near Palasaur village drain in a fake encounter. Before their encounter, they were brought to Tarn Taran city police station and tortured. Their bodies were cremated unceremoniously in front of my father Chaman Lal, who has also recorded his statement with the CBI,” said Parveen Kumar of Tarn Taran, adding, “Finally, we hope to get justice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/alleged-fake-encounters-sc-dismisses-41-punjab-cops-plea-on-cbi-jurisdiction-to-probe-cases-101633273799426.html

Ongoing schemes of in-situ management will continue. The ex-situ management of paddy stubble means adopting methods in which the stubble is moved from its original place. The most common way is to tie the stubble in bundles and supply it as fuel in biomass-based power generation plants, industrial boilers and in coal based-super critical power generating units. In in-situ, stubble is managing without moving it.The Centre’s Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas’ had asked Pnjab to do this, with experts claiming that ex-situ management involves lower cost. Subsequently, the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has asked the state’s three thermal power plants to use paddy stubble as fuel to the extent of 10% of total annual coal use. Two of these plants are with the state government; together the three consume 70 lakh tonne of coal a year.“Trials have shown that biomass pellets can be used as thermal power plant fuels, as it give matching calorific value. Boilers can also handle this fuel in limited quantity,” said PPCB member Krunesh Garg, adding that a target of using 50,000 tonne stubble has been fixed for these power plants. STATE TOLD TO INVOLVE NATIONAL REMOTE SENSING CENTREA total of 220 lakh tonne of stubble is produced along with the paddy. The biomass power generating plants in the state consume 50 lakh tonne of stubble. Of the remaining 170 lakh tonne, 100 lakh tonne (45% of total) is not managed under any technique and majority of the farmers prefer to burn it. Due to high silica content paddy straw is not used as dry fodder, like wheat straw. During paddy harvest in October-November, stubble burning causes the formation of a smog jacket over the national capital region and adjoining states, posing a serious health hazard. As a special effort, the state government was also told to involve the National Remote Sensing Centre and measure aerosols, the amount of stubble burnt and the release of harmful gases in the ambient air. The state has also been told to involve the Indian Agricultural Research Institute for data analysis. 228 STUBBLE BURNING CASES BY OCT 2By October 2, Punjab had recorded 228 cases of stubble burning with Amritsar topping the list at 157, followed by followed by Tarn Taran (31), Patiala (10) and Faridkot (9). This year, the cases have been recorded since September 15. At least ₹2 lakh fine has been imposed on farmers as environment compensation, and 81 cases registered. In the current paddy harvest, Punjab agriculture department plans to give at least 30,000 machines for in-situ management with a total subsidy of ₹250 crore. To date, 10,000 machines have been delivered, as work started early. The machines are Super SMS, Happy Seeder, Paddy Straw Chopper, Shredder, Mulcher, Hydraulic reversible mould board plough and zero till drill. The number of machines (76,590) given to farmers over the past three years from 2018-20 are insufficient to deal with stubble burning menace, department officials said. The Centre has provided a subsidy of ₹666 crore to Punjab over the past three years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-focuses-on-increasing-use-of-paddy-stubble-in-power-generation-101633273379867.html
03-10-2021||Lucknow||Lucknow: LESA to increase load of consumers overdrawing power||The Lucknow Electricity Supply Administration (LESA) plans to increase the sanctioned load of those power consumers who have been overdrawing electricity for more than three months. The step is likely to affect more than 2.3 lakh power consumers of the state capital.LESA has already sent notices to these power consumers in Lucknow for getting their load increased or the department will do so on its own.LESA chief engineer (cis-Gomti) Madhukar Varma said, “If a consumer has sanctioned load of three kilowatt, but he is using more power than that for three consecutive months then his load has to be increased according to the rules. Such consumers have been sent notices. They can visit the website or Jhatpat portal for increasing the load. Or they can visit the substation nearby. If any consumer is not willing to pay the charges for increasing the load immediately then he can get the amount adjusted in the next bill.”“It’s important for customers to disclose and pay for the correct load so that power infrastructure in Lucknow can be updated. Many transformers get damaged because consumers draw more power. It’s in the interest of consumers and LESA both to get the correct figures of load on each transformer, so that power supply is not hampered,” he said.Uttar Pradesh Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Samiti chairman Avadhesh Kumar Verma said, “LESA will get ₹110 fixed charge from each consumer per month, besides ₹100 processing fee and ₹300 security fee. It’s the duty of LESA to give uninterrupted power supply to its consumers , which is not happening. Those consumers who have used more power than the sanctioned load for more than three months regularly will find this added amount adjusted in the next bill. Ideally, LESA can organise special camps for consumers for increasing the load at the substation level instead of unilaterally increasing the load, it’s always better to take consumers into confidence before increasing the load.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknow-lesa-to-increase-load-of-consumers-overdrawing-power-101633273139738.html

03-10-2021||Mumbai||Raid on cruise ship attempt to divert attention from Mundra port seizure: Cong||The Congress said on Sunday that the previous night’s raid conducted by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on a cruise ship in Mumbai and the ensuing action taken is an attempt to divert attention from the ‘real issue’ seizure of drugs at the Mundra port in Gujarat.The NCB on Saturday night carried out a raid at a Goa-bound cruise ship in Mumbai after drugs were recovered from there. Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan, along with seven other people, was detained by the bureau early on Sunday. Later in the day, the NCB arrested Aryan Khan under Section 8C, 20B, 27 read with 35 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.Also Read| SRK's son Aryan Khan arrested in rave party case: Here's what happenedSpeaking to reporters on Sunday, Congress spokesperson Shama Moham said, “There is news that a Bollywood actor’s son has been arrested. Where did this drug come from? The NCB has come out and all of sudden saying that it has caught drugs from a cruise ship,” according to news agency PTI.Pointing out that the real issue includes the Mundra port drug seizure, drug cartels in India and the drugs being smuggled from Afghanistan, Moham asked, “They (NCB) catch some people here and there so that the media will show that case, (that will) divert the attention. But I want you all to write about Mundra port, why is it not investigated? What is happening there? Why is it ignored?.”Last month, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence had detained two containers that arrived from the Mundra Port from Kandahar, Afghanistan via Bandar Abbas, Iran for examination. Upon examination of the containers, the DRI seized a total of 2,988.21 kilograms of Afghan heroin. As per the agency’s estimate, the consignment was worth ₹21,000 crores.Congress spokesperson Shama Moham also questioned the silence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah on the seizure of drugs at the port, which is situated in their home state of Gujarat. Moham told reporters that Gujarat is becoming a hub of drug smuggling and expressed fears that privatisation of ports will lead to such activities.Also Read| DRI sleuths seize over 3,000kg of heroin at Mundra port; 8 held during raidThe Maharashtra Congress, meanwhile, welcomed the NCB’s raid on the cruise ship in Mumbai but at the same time raised suspicion that whether the raid was done to suppress the drugs seizure at the Mundra Port.“We welcome it. But at the same time, it has to be noted that there has been no action or discussion on the seizure of drugs worth ₹21,000 crore at the Mundra port in Gujarat. There is room for doubt if such raids are being conducted to shift focus from last month’s seizure,” Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe told PTI.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/raid-on-cruise-ship-attempt-to-divert-attention-from-mundra-port-seizure-cong-101633262749440.html
03-10-2021||Pune||Your Space: Covid vaccine drives helped check virus spread in Pune||Pune has reported a fall in Covid cases after Ganeshotsav, unlike last year. Apart from massive Covid vaccination drives and strict monitoring of safety measures, readers cite the areas where the authorities have fared well and what more needs to be done to curb the virus spread... PMC should share Covid statistics daily The well-managed Covid vaccination drives in Pune apart from the safety measures such as restricted timings have effectively reduced the Covid spread in the city. The people understood the gravity of the situation during the second wave and have behaved responsibly as well. One thing that the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) could have done better is reporting daily Covid data with graphs, including daily new cases and deaths on their online web page dedicated to the virus. On multiple occasions we found the need to have statistics on Pune city Covid numbers and those were unavailable. Sometimes, the media reported some snapshots. For corporate citizens like me, we need a better view in order to plan office measures like how many and who should work from office and the reopening plans. Numbers coming from authentic sources like PMC will help better in taking these decisions. Ashutosh Diwanji Residents casual about Covid safety norms It has been observed that residents are now taking the Covid situation casually and many are seen not wearing masks and following safety precautions. People are partying, visiting malls and restaurants without any caution. We are forgetting that kids are not yet vaccinated and this casual approach can be dangerous. It’s a matter of self-discipline to follow the prescribed normal. It has been scientifically proved that humming can increase nitric oxide produced naturally in our nose that could help strengthen our immunity to fight the virus. Anupriya Ingole Admn unlocks markets in cautious manner Fortunately, Covid cases did not spike after Ganeshotsav and we are hoping the same after Navratri, Dusshera and Diwali as well. Apart from vaccination and other safety measures, the administration did very well on unlocking the city cautiously. It seems that everyone learned from the first and second wave and took measures accordingly. The unlocking was done with a lot of planning. Even after a lot of pressure from various sectors, the authorities took a scientific approach in reopening markets to effectively tackle the virus. The administration was leading from the front. While driving, you will come across police wearing masks. And people saw this and followed suit. City’s scientific and gradual approach to tackle and unlock the city helped citizens to witness a fall in Covid cases and, hopefully, it will continue in this direction. Ankit Rungta Strict adherence to safety protocols must Even as the city sees a fall in daily coronavirus infectious, people are neglecting to wear mask and use sanitiser. The main reason behind this casual approach is the massive vaccination drives. But vaccination is not the only option to stop the infection and people should strictly follow the guidelines and be aware about safety. We should stop public gatherings for coming month and hotels should take care of their customers, because these are some “spots” that could trigger the virus spread. Schools are going to reopen from October 4 and more awareness is important to eradicate the deadly virus. Amol Patil Follow preventions measures As compared to last year, the Covid numbers has dropped in the last few months. Vaccination drives have been successfully conducted across Pune and it is a commendable move. However, to curb the virus spread, a few things should be followed: Wearing mask is undoubtedly a priority along with social distancing at all places. Some people face problems in scheduling an appointment for vaccination due to lack of internet or smartphone. To overcome this problem, the procedure should be relaxed to its simplest. Family functions should be conducted online or with bare minimum guests Since the government plans to reopen educational institutes, only those students who have taken two vaccine doses and undergone RT-PCR test should be permitted on campus To uphold the spirit of our city, online awareness programmes should be conducted to help spread information about the virus. Suvarna Deolankar Cops set example in fight against Covid What was impressive about the measures taken to curb the virus spread was the dedication shown by the city’s police personnel. I remember seeing them on roads for hours at a stretch, urging people to wear masks and maintain social distancing. Not reopening schools and colleges has been another thoughtful decision because we all know how vulnerable children and young adults are to getting floundered about basic rules to be followed to curb the spread of the virus. But also, there needs to be stricter regulations on people meeting in cafes and restaurants so that Covid measures are strictly followed. Shagufta Khan Pay attention on contact tracing Apart from the massive vaccination drives and strict monitoring of safety measures, various awareness programmes undertaken by government and non-government organisations have been a major reason for decline in Covid cases. Many companies have continued the “work from home” policy, which has reduced the number of people stepping out. Another reason is the development of herd immunity by the majority of population. However, more attention should be paid to contact tracing. It should be done quickly to prevent the spread of the virus. Furthermore, sanitation of houses of infected people should also be done on a priority basis. Tressa Antony Guidelines helped check virus spread Considering the fact that Ganeshotsav has emotions attached to every Punekar, it was a challenge for civic authorities to manage the festival this time along with the vaccination camps and Covid protocols. With Pune taking the Covid heat for close to two years, Bappa came this year with newfound hope and passion in Pune. Massive vaccination drives before the festival helped in raising awareness among the masses. The government also devised prompt guidelines three months prior to the 11-day festival, in June. The guidelines clearly stated the term and conditions - use only 2-4 feet long idols for the festival and not to immerse shadu idols in rivers but in tanks arranged by the municipal authorities. These prior guidelines had prepared the idol manufacturers beforehand, thus reducing any loss in their business. All public gatherings were monitored duly by the civic officials. Fortunately, the citizens followed the given guidelines. Social distancing norms were followed during the aarti, while sanitisation of hands and thermal screening at mandals was also included.

03-10-2021||Pune||Curtain Call: Fondest memory of theatre experience as an audience||With theatres and cinema halls reopening, I hope that the culture of going to watch something resumes as well. Though it is wishful thinking, I hope the culture is much more disciplined. By that, I don’t mean just following Covid protocols (which should be followed by the way) but following certain practices which are even more basic. Apart from a few venues in India, almost every theatre allows a late entry of audience. Even if it is a disturbance for everyone, especially the live performers. In fact, while directing plays at the commercial level, it is a common practice to not have anything important during the first five minutes of the play and after the interval too because that time is given for the audience to “settle down”! I have always laughed at these suggestions and even tried to restrict entry to latecomers. But so far, it hasn’t worked as the venues don’t follow that policy. I experienced a way around this, and it turned out to be a pleasant surprise! Two weekends earlier, I had written about the experience of performing at a venue in London’s coveted Westend. We were going to be there for nearly eight days and had some technical and managerial work a few days before the actual show. After a few hours of work, the rest of the day used to be free. I had decided to watch as many plays as I can and had kept a schedule of all the running productions and the venues. My wife had accompanied and we watched a comedy together first, titled “The play that goes wrong”. It was a hilarious play and both of us enjoyed a lot. Fortunately, she agreed to watch more plays too. That approval was important because watching plays there is a very expensive affair, especially because of the exchange rate! And we decided to spend most of our money on plays instead of buying things. We made a list of plays and ranked them in order of preference. Some were sold out months back, some were too expensive. But we had decided to watch one play daily, come what may and we thoroughly enjoyed watching new plays like “The curious incident of the dog in the night-time” to all-time classics like “The Lion King”. We had kept the day on which we had our own performance free, of course. Our performance went smoothly. We helped in packing and loading of the set and later, went and had lunch and met with audience members for an informal meet and greet. After all that, we looked at the time and realised that there was a slight possibility that we could watch one more play before coming back to India! I quickly scanned through the nearby theatres and zeroed in on a production of “The comedy about a bank robbery”. It was being performed by the same group that had performed “The play that goes wrong” and we had heard that even this was a superb comedy. The venue was a kilometre away and we only had a few minutes. We rushed through the crowds, almost running at some points and reached the theatre huffing and puffing. Usually, we used to pre-book the tickets, but for this play we had decided to purchase directly at the box-office. When we reached, the person at the box-office informed us that the performance had already begun and we were late by three minutes. We cursed our luck and decided to just roam about when the person noticed our disappointment and offered two tickets. But he told us that we will only be able to enter after the first scene gets over, during the blackout. We agreed, and it seemed fair. To make the experience even sweeter, the person gave us the best seats in the house at half-price! He then gave us brochures of the play which explained what the play is and who the characters are so that we had a fair idea of what must have happened in the first scene. We were assigned an usher who took us to the door. The usher loved plays too and seeing that we were reading our brochures diligently, he took it upon himself to explain what the first scene is! So, at the door, in a very low voice, he narrated the story of the entire first scene, while we could hear the sounds of the dialogues and the audience laughter from inside. It was a wonderful experience and he was very good at it! He then heard some music and audience applauding and immediately opened the door. He knew the venue really well and guided us to our seats in a flash. He ensured we were comfortable and before the stage lights came on, he had disappeared! The second scene started and it felt like we hadn’t missed anything. This remains one of my fondest theatre experiences as an audience member. Usually, I remember plays based on their performance. But this was the first time I remembered it for the experience. The discipline that was followed, along with such care for the art made it really special! Nipun Dharmadhikari is a storyteller and looks forward to telling them on stage, in front of the camera or in person||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/curtain-call-fondest-memory-of-theatre-experience-as-an-audience-101633258438368.html

The state currently has 159 active Covid cases.The chief minister’s instruction to identify tainted police officers comes in the backdrop of the sensational case of alleged murder of a Kanpur businessman in Gorakhpur by a group of policemen. The incident has invited widespread criticism of the state’s police force. In a related development on Saturday, CM Yogi Adityanath sought an explanation from 31 district magistrates (DM) and 24 district police chiefs, who were reportedly found absent in their offices or public hearing programmes, a news agency quoted a senior government official as saying. On the instructions of the chief minister, a reality check was carried out between 10 am and 12 noon on Friday, during which the district magistrates and police chiefs were found absent. The chief minister, who held a review meeting with senior officials on Saturday, warned that strict action will be taken if such a situation recurs in future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-orders-withdrawal-of-all-cases-of-pandemic-act-in-up-101633257537216.html

An underpass will be constructed under the integrated structure for vehicular traffic going towards Signature bridge, said DMRC officials.Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communication, DMRC, said, “In this first-of-its-kind engineering marvel, integrated portals (structure) will be erected on which a flyover as well as a Metro viaduct will be placed. On these portals, the road flyover and the Metro viaduct will rest and run parallel to each other for a length of (approx.) 450 m.”The integrated structure is part of DMRC’s 12km-long under-construction Majlis Park-Maujpur corridor, which is being constructed under Phase-IV expansion plan. The corridor is part of the Pink line--Majlis park-Shiv Vihar corridor. As per the plan, a total of 21 portals--with each portal having two piers-- with average width of 26m and at a height of 10m will be constructed. The Metro viaduct and three-lane flyover will be 10.5m and 10m wide respectively. The flyover will run adjacent to the existing single flyover between Wazirabad to ISBT Kashmere Gate near Soorghat.“Delhi Metro will construct the portals and the Metro viaduct over it and PWD will erect the superstructure for flyover on the already constructed portals in future,” said Dayal.In a bid to provide smooth passage to vehicular traffic coming from north Delhi towards Signature bridge, DMRC has decided to construct the underpass. The underpass will merge with the road on the other side of Najafgarh drain on the Outer Ring Road.The Delhi PWD has been planning to construct another single flyover near the existing one to ease congestion on the Outer Ring Road. The DMRC and Delhi PWD decided to integrate the project to expedite the construction work and also address construction related issues, said a DMRC official.Also Read: Delhi to get ₹18 cr as ‘green’ funds to fight air pollutionThis is not the first time Delhi PWD and DMRC have collaborated on engineering projects.

03-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi to get ₹18 cr as 'green' funds to fight air pollution||The national capital will get over ₹18 crore from the Centre under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) this year to cater to critical gaps in air pollution management, according to officials.This is the first time Delhi will get funds under NCAP, a national-level strategy for a 20 per cent to 30 per cent reduction in PM2.5 and PM10 concentration by 2024, with 2017 as the base year for comparison."Delhi will get ₹18.74 crore under NCAP. This is the first time it will be receiving funds under the programme since it started in 2019," an official told PTI.NCAP covers 132 non-attainment cities, which do not meet the prescribed national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS).These cities have been identified based on the ambient air quality data obtained during the 2011-2015 period under the National Air Monitoring Programme.The acceptable annual standard for PM 10 and PM2.5 is 60 micrograms per cubic metre and 40 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively.In 2017, Delhi's annual PM10 average stood at 240 micrograms per cubic metre. The targeted PM10 concentration by 2024 is 168 micrograms per cubic metre."The national capital did not get any funds under NCAP for two years because it had other resources available -- a green cess levied on diesel vehicles above 2,000 cc -- which is deposited with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and a pollution tax on commercial vehicles entering Delhi," an official in the Union Environment Ministry said.This time, fund availability under NCAP has improved."Fifty cities are already getting a good amount ( ₹4,400 in 2020-21 and ₹2,217 crore in 2021-22) for pollution management from the Finance Commission. Therefore, the availability of funds for the remaining 82 cities under NCAP has improved. So, we decided to give some funds to Delhi, too," the official said.A total of 290 crore is available for these 82 cities this year.The NCAP fund will be utilised to cater to critical gaps -- wherever there is any inadequacy of funds available from other resources. The rest of the funding is to be mobilised through convergence of schemes, the official explained.Funds for bigger projects such as management of construction and demolition waste are allocated under the Swachh Bharat Urban programme and other schemes of the central government.The Delhi government has prepared a "Winter Action Plan" to tackle air pollution in the capital and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is expected to announce it soon.The plan focuses on 10 key issues, including stubble burning, pollution hotspots, working of smog tower and vehicular and dust pollution.The city government has already imposed a complete ban on the sale and bursting of firecrackers till January 1, 2022, and has issued detailed guidelines to control dust pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-to-get-rs-18-cr-as-green-funds-to-fight-air-pollution-101633251169903.html

Sidhu’s objection to Deol and Sahota’s elevation stems from the former’s role as a lawyer of former police chief Sumedh Singh Saini who was the head of the Punjab Police when the sacrilege incidents took place, while the latter was the first chief of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) which probed these incidents.Also Read | ‘Sahota-led SIT never gave clean chit to Ram Rahim in sacrilege case’Deol recently secured bail for Saini from the Punjab and Haryana high court over the Kotkapura firing case, in which police opened fire at protesters agitating against the desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib, in Faridpur, killing two.Also Read | Will ensure justice in 2015 sacrilege cases, says new Punjab CM ChanniIncidents of theft and sacrilege of the Sikh holy book were reported from across Punjab in October 2015 when the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alliance was in power. The coalition was defeated by the Captain Amarinder Singh-led Congress in the 2017 assembly elections in which the desecration was a major poll issue. However, the alleged failure of the Congress government under Singh in ensuring justice for the victims was seen as one of the reasons behind his resignation on September 18.Punjab is likely to vote for its next government in early 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/salt-on-wounds-on-victims-sidhu-again-calls-for-removal-of-new-punjab-ag-dgp-101633248369308.html

Also read: Pak drone drops arms, ammo at Sohanjana in Jammu“We have made all arrangements (for procurement), and the staff of the food department and four (procurement) agencies has reached the mandis to facilitate procurement,” said a senior officer of the Punjab food and civil supplies department. He said that there was adequate availability of gunny bags. The Punjab government has set up 3,000 mandis for buying the crop and according to estimates of the state agriculture department 190 lakh tonnes of paddy is expected to reach the grain markets in the state for procurement. The Centre is offering a minimum support price (MSP) of ₹1,960 a quintal for A-grade paddy and a cash credit limit of ₹35,700 crore was released by the Reserve Bank of India. The state’s four agencies, namely Pungrain, Markfed, warehousing corporation and Punsup, besides the Centre’s Food Corporation of India will buy the paddy. CM, ministers to be in field today According to agriculture department sources, freshly harvested crop started reaching the grain markets on September 20 in Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Gurdaspur, Patiala, Fatehgarh Sahib, Khanna, Ropar and Mohali districts. Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi will formally launch the procurement in Morinda, while food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu will be at the Khanna grain market along with state cabinet minister Gurkirat Singh Kotli. “All ministers and MLAs have been requested to be in the field today to start the procurement operations,” said Ashu. Hitch before buying due to rain The procurement process was postponed for 10 days by the Centre on September 30, a day before it was scheduled to start. The postponement was ordered owing to a report by Food Corporation of India that due to delayed spells of rain this time, there was high moisture content in the crop, and it might take a week to 10 days to be ready. However, after pressure by farmers, the state government and the opposition parties, including the Shiromani Akali Dal, the Union agriculture ministry renewed its decision. “In the interest of farmers, it has been decided to start procurement of paddy from October 3,” read the communication from the Centre’s ministry of food and public distribution on Saturday evening. Chief minister Channi also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, seeking timely start of procurement as paddy has started arriving in mandis and any delay could lead to harassment of farmers.

We have different gods and goddesses, but all these diversities don’t change our unity. The moment we think on the lines insider and outsider, we go wrong,” he said while addressing a gathering here on the last day of his four-day visit to Jammu. Bhagwat talked at length about ancient history of India vis-à-vis European and African cultures. He also talked about socialism, communism, individualism, emergence of new left and how confrontations within the societies and countries kept spiraling. “India has had democracy since ages and the nation believes in sustainable development and eco-friendly lifestyle. The European countries coined these terms now, but they have been here in India since ages. Now, the world looks up to India,” he said. “For 6,000 years, we did farming on our land in India and they are still fertile unlike Africa,” he added. Talking about system of governance within the country, he said, “The system changed, like here (in J&K). Article 370 is not anymore but has it gone away from the heart…why states fight against each other, like Cauvery water issue. The river is drying up, but blood was spilled over its water.” “What good would be done by changing the system? It’s the mentality that has to change,” he said. “We all must work jointly to protect the national interests and for the welfare of society at large,” he added. “The main focus must be to keep ourselves happy and satisfied and we all must work for the internal peace, which is possible only through social service and thinking about others,” Bhagwat said. On Friday, the RSS chief had discussed about expansion of organisational work in new areas and further setting up the network of RSS shakhas in every nook and corner of Jammu and Kashmir to inculcate patriotism among the people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bhagwat-in-jammu-despite-diversities-we-are-united-101633217633992.html

He, however, joined the PDP soon after it was founded in late 90s.Sajjad termed the Bhat’s inclusion into the party fold a remarkable moment. “There is a certain level of emotion in welcoming Bhat back. He was one of the founding members of the People’s Conference. He took a hiatus from the politics and joined journalism. This is how he exited the People’s Conference,” he added. “We at the People’s Conference believe that exiting changelessness is a big challenge and an even bigger challenge is navigating a dignified way out of the web of disempowerment. The people of J&K have been trapped post-August 5, 2019. And the current administration, which we is a selected administration and not an elected one, is indulging in economic persecution of the people of J&K as a sequel to political persecution. We at the People’s Conference reiterate that economic empowerment is essential for political empowerment,” Sajjad said. Bhat said that rejoining the People’s Conference was nothing but a homecoming for him as he had played a crucial role in its formation at the very onset. “And today, based on my decades of experience, I can tell you with utmost certainty that Sajjad Lone is the only political leader who can honestly, sincerely and without any paradoxes lead the people of Jammu and Kashmir.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/former-pdp-leader-joins-people-s-conference-101633217154045.html

The retreat ceremony will be held twice a week by the BSF men on the Indian side on Saturdays and Sundays at 5.15pm, said a senior BSF officer. “It is a historic occasion for all of us,” he said and added that “a structured parade by BSF personnel will be a regular feature and the allied infrastructure will come up in due course of time”. A local resident and a progressive farmer Rohit Choudhary, 30, of Suchetgarh said, “Though it is going to be a one-sided affair in absence of Pakistan Rangers, it is a big development for us in the border area.” Another resident Surjeet Singh, 47, said, “Being farmers, we are now hopeful that tourists coming here to witness retreat ceremony will also take home our basmati rice with them. We also hope to see more restaurants and water parks coming up here.” He added, “However, a lot needs to be done. The road has to be expanded to four lanes. There is no infrastructure at the border post for those who would like to witness the ceremony.” Suchetgarh is about 27km from Jammu and served as a route to Sialkot (now in Pakistan) during the pre-Partition era.

03-10-2021||Chandigarh||J&K saw least Covid deaths in 17 months, maximum vaccination in September||In September, Jammu and Kashmir recorded least Covid-related fatalities in the last 17 months. According to the government’s figures, the month witnessed only 10 deaths due to coronavirus – lowest since the pandemic started in March and April last year wherein eight deaths were reported. In August, 2021 , J&K had logged 30 deaths.In terms of monthly cases, 4,011 people were infected in September, almost equal to August when 3,957 cases were reported. “We are not seeing any major spike. It may be because of two reasons — first, the infectivity rate in the community is already high which the sero-survey has revealed and second, the immunisation rate is also high. Hence, these two factors have made more people immune to the virus,” said Dr Muhammad Salim Khan, head of the community medicine department and Covid in-charge at the Srinagar government medical college.There has, however, been a slight increase in this month’s test positivity rate (TPR) – the percentage of tests turning positive in a particular time period out of the total tests conducted during the period. If it is below 5%, it indicates that the infection is under control in the community.The month of September recorded a TPR of 0.270% against 0.239% which, owing to the equal number of cases, can be attributed to lower tests this month. The data reveals that average 49,374 tests were conducted daily in September as against 53,359 daily tests in August.Overall, the union territory conducted 14.81 lakh tests in September, witnessing a fall of over 10% in comparison to August when 16.54 lakh tests were done. In the second Covid wave which started in March 2021, the month of September again has been the least affected one. The UT saw 37 deaths in March, 289 in April, 1,625 in May, 416 in June, 55 in July, 30 in August and just 10 in September. September, meanwhile, also saw the highest vaccine doses administered in the past six months.About 33.78 lakh doses were given in September, 18.5 lakh in August, 16.76 lakh in July, 12.36 lakh in June and 9.49 lakh in May.The UT has administered total 1.14 crore vaccine doses till September 30 of which, over 29% or 33.78 lakh were in the month of September. Experts say that they don’t expect any major third wave, unless there is the entry of any virulent strain. “Looking at how the first and second wave behaved, this time we feel it is not that serious and the situation is stable,” Khan said.“I hope this continues like this. The high infection in the community and high vaccination rate won’t allow it to go out of control unless there is a new virulent strain,” he said. 124 new Covid cases emerge in UTJammu and Kashmir recorded 124 fresh coronavirus infections while a person died due to the disease on Saturday. Of the total, 92 cases were reported in Kashmir valley and the Jammu division saw 32 infections. The number of patients who were cured in the UT was 168 with active cases reaching 1,294.

03-10-2021||Chandigarh||Third wave: Chandigarh procures 8 essential Covid drugs on Centre’s recommendation||As recommended by the Centre, the UT health department has started stocking up eight essential Covid-19 related drugs keeping in view the possible third wave.The eight essential drugs to be used for the treatment of Covid-19 patients include Enoxaparin, Methylprednisolone, Dexamethasone, Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, Liposomal amphotericin, Posaconazole and intravenous immunoglobulin. These medicines have played a key role in the treatment of Covid and post-Covid complications.For procurement of essential drugs and diagnostics, Centre had sanctioned ₹1.6 crore to UT, under the Emergency Response and Health System Preparedness Package. For ₹45.8 lakh, the UT health department has placed orders of over 11,000 tablets and injections with the pharmaceuticals.The purchase also includes 250 units of Liposomal amphotericin drug, which is used to treat mucormycosis (black fungus) infections, and 40,500 injections of Tocilizumab, which is the main drug available for Covid-19 treatment. “The UT health department already has a stock of around 10,000 Remdesivir doses hence no order has been placed for its procurement. We have placed orders for procuring other essential drugs. These medicines will be the buffer stock so that in case of emergency or another surge, we do not run out of essential drugs. Though Chandigarh had adequate drugs in the first and second wave of the pandemic, making prior arrangements for the third wave are necessary,” said Yashpal Garg, UT health secretary.‘Centre predicts surge after October 15’“As per the Union government, fresh Covid-19 cases can start rising in October. The period between October 15 and November 15, which can be extended till December 15, is very crucial to watch out for and any complacency among the residents can cost us. Since festival season is around the corner, people will visit crowded places and markets which can spread the infection among the community. People must follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and must get vaccinated to avert any surge,” Garg added.Other preparations for possible third waveUnder the IT-hub project, all health and wellness centres (HWCs) will be connected to civil hospitals for tele-consultation, which will further be linked with GMSH-16 and Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32. These two hospitals will be linked to the paediatric department of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER).Meanwhile, a 32-bed dedicated paediatric ICU centre will come up at GMSH-16.

The Prime Minister on Saturday had launched the Rashtriya Jal Jeevan Kosh (RJJK) to facilitate contributions for setting up safe drinking water supply in villages and had urged the people of the nation to conserve water. However, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) staffer did not get the memo and diligently went about performing his duty come rain or shine.Samrala subdivisional magistrate Vikramjeet Singh Panthey noticed the absurd sight on the National Highway (NH-95), while he was heading to Ludhiana on an official visit. “I was surprised to see that the man watering plants on the divider, while it was raining. When I approached the driver of the water tanker, he could not produce a licence or any other document, after which the vehicle was impounded,” said Panthey.On being questioned, the staffer said he was simply following orders as the NH-5 project manager Srikanth and project engineer Abhijeet Singh had asked him to water the plants everyday.“Even during monsoon, I could see the NH-95 staff watering plants. I have written to the Ludhiana deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma about it ,” said Panthey.However, the project engineer said the SDM had misunderstood the situation and that the capricious weather was to be blamed. “The weather, which had been scorching hot when our staffer started watering plants suddenly turned rainy. The official happened to drive by at that time and took notice of it.”“ We are serious about saving water and are doing our best to increase the green cover,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/watering-plants-in-rain-lands-nhai-staffer-in-a-soup-in-ludhiana-101633211624691.html

We sit here in shifts between 9am to 5pm everyday and our talks with the Punjab government have been going well. Recently, the PU V-C told us to shift the protest from the campus to the University Grants Commission. He has no business telling us where to protest and the site doesn’t matter as the protest is symbolic. He himself is drawing his salary as per the 7th Pay Commission while he lets us teachers suffer.”The PU authorities meanwhile have issued a statement saying, “PU authorities are always concerned for the welfare of its faculty. The implementation of the 7th Pay Commission is pending for a want of notification from the Punjab government, but PUTA has set up the protest site on campus as if the varsity has to issue the notification. Such an action can be counterproductive and it fails to put any pressure on the Punjab government. On the contrary the image and perception of PU is getting affected adversely, which in turn may affect PU’s NIRF ranking as well as NAAC grading.”The authorities further added that PUTA should protest outside the Punjab Secretariat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/implementation-of-7th-pay-commission-puta-to-continue-protest-on-pu-campus-101633211202107.html

03-10-2021||Chandigarh||Document forgery for job: HC denies bail to Panchkula ASI hired 22 years ago||The Punjab and Haryana high court has dismissed the bail plea of a Panchkula assistant sub-inspector (ASI) who was booked for allegedly submitting fake certificates during his recruitment 22 years ago.ASI Dharampal was booked in February following a complaint by his own brother. An inquiry had revealed that when appointed as a constable in 1989, Dharampal had submitted that he had passed Class 10 from the Haryana Board of School Education, Bhiwani, whereas during the probe, he switched the board to Delhi Open School. While seeking bail, the ASI had told the court that he had an unblemished record and was presently at the fag end of his career. He claimed that he had been falsely implicated by his brothers due to a property dispute. Denying any forgery, he submitted that he had lost the certificates.Not agreeing with the arguments, the bench of justice GS Gill observed,“This court is not to be influenced solely by the fact as to why the FIR has been lodged, but is expected to examine the allegations levelled therein and as to whether the same prima facie have any semblance of truth or not.” The court added that in case the ASI had actually passed Class 10 from the Haryana Board of School Education, Bhiwani, he would certainly have a supporting document. Even if it is assumed that he had lost the certificate, still, being a cop, he can be expected to be smart enough to get a duplicate certificate issued, the bench said, taking note of the fact that he did not present any such certificate which would compel the court to believe that there is an element of truth in his argument.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/document-forgery-for-job-hc-denies-bail-to-panchkula-asi-hired-22-years-ago-101633208748282.html

Some farmers and around four policemen were injured in the clash. The protesters had gathered near the toll plaza in response to farmer unions’ state-level call to gherao offices of local MLAs to protest delay in procurement of paddy. Soon after the incident, Bharatiya Kisan Union president Gurnam Singh Charuni reached the spot and through a video message asked farmers to reach the Chandimandir toll plaza in large numbers. He said, “The police have resorted to a brutal lathicharge in Panchkula, in which many protesters have suffered injuries. Protesters have also been taken into custody from two to three spots. I urge farmers who are nearby to immediately gather at Chandimandir toll plaza in large numbers.”Asserting that the farmers had been protesting peacefully, the farm leader demanded an inquiry. However, the police said far from protesting peacefully, a few farmers had tried to run over cops with tractors in an attempt to break the barricades, which left a few policemen injured. “To stop them from causing more damage, police used minimal force,” they said in a statement. In the evening, Karam Singh, unit president, BKU (Tikait) announced that the government had agreed to procure rice. The police released the detained farmers soon after, and the protesters, accompanied by Charuni, also vacated the site.Panchkula commissioner of police Saurabh Singh said, “An FIR has been registered under relevant sections against the protesters who broke the barricades with tractors. A few policemen got injured as well. We have visuals of the incident and will take proper action against those involved.”Farmers protest outside Punjab CM’s house in MohaliIn Mohali, protesting farmers held a protest outside Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s house in Kharar and also gheraoed the house of Congress MLA Balbir Singh Sidhu.

03-10-2021||Chandigarh||Unusual September rain spells drive vegetables prices up in Chandigarh||The higher than normal rain in the region this September has pushed the prices of several vegetables up. With the recent fuel rate hike, these may rise further.Satbir Singh, a mandi supervisor with the Punjab Mandi Board, said, “We don’t expect much rain in September. But some heavy rain spells in Punjab in the past few weeks spoiled vegetable crops, causing their prices to spike.” While a month back, tomatoes were available at apni mandis for ₹25 per kg, their rate is now ₹45 per kg and up. Even the wholesale rate has risen to ₹30 per kg.Price of onion, which remained stable over the summer, has also started to climb. Red onion, the cheaper variety, which comes from Rajasthan, is being sold for ₹35 per kg, compared to ₹25 last month. Chandigarh Transport Association general secretary BL Sharma said if transportation cost kept increasing due to more expensive fuel, vegetables will get even more costlier in a month or so. Meanwhile, Singh said vegetable prices might stabilise as large quantities of cauliflower and carrot enter the market after Diwali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/unusual-september-rain-spells-drive-vegetables-prices-up-in-chandigarh-101633208744039.html

The ‘know-your-case’ scheme and reshuffling of police jurisdictions, introduced by former top cop Rakesh Agrawal who served in the city for two years, was discontinued after his successor Naunihal Singh took over. And after Naunihal’s transfer, the Saturday parades and other initiatives started by him have been abandoned. The know-your-case scheme was started with the motive of helping complainants and respondents know the progress of their case. Special camp used to be organised at every police station and other wings on rotation. Agrawal had also started a competition among police stations, in which the buildings were to be judged on cleanliness, beautification and provision of basic facilities for visitors. The SHOs and police post in-charges invested a lot of time and effort in the hope of bagging a prize, but after Agrawal’s transfer on August 20, they haven’t heard a single word about it. Aggarwal’s successor Naunihal Singh took over with the hope of infusing fresh energy into the cadres. Naunihal started weekly parades and 3am meetings. He had also abolished at least 15 police posts to shift its personnel to police stations. But before he could fully implement the plan, he was transferred from the city on September 21, following the change of guard in the state leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amid-frequent-transfers-reforms-brought-in-by-ludhiana-police-chiefs-get-junked-101633207061811.html
03-10-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena leader gave out info on irregularities in Anil Parab’s resort: MNS||The infighting within the Shiv Sena has believably come to the fore following allegations by a Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) leader from Khed, Ratnagiri. MNS general secretary and Khed Nagar panchayat chairman Vaibhav Khedekar has alleged that the information related to the alleged irregularities in a resort owned by Shiv Sena leader and state transport minister Anil Parab was provided by another party leader, Ramdas Kadam. Khedekar, in a press conference with former Nationalist Congress Party legislator Sanjay Kadam in Khed on Saturday, produced eight audio clips to establish his claim. In the audio clips, Kadam is reportedly speaking to his close aide Prasad Karve on the information about Parab’s alleged illegal structure at Dapoli. In some of the clips, Karve is heard speaking to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kirit Somaiya, giving him more information about the construction. Two months ago, Somaiya had lodged complaints with the Union environment ministry against the construction of the resort on the sea shore at Dapoli by Parab. The minister had allegedly violated the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) norms while constructing the resort. Similar complaints were lodged by Somaiya against a construction by another Shiv Sena leader, Milind Narvekar, in the same vicinity. After the complaints, Narvekar had himself pulled down the illegal part of the structure last month. Both, Parab and Narvekar, are considered close confidants of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.Kadam has rubbished the allegations and said that the voice in the audio clips is not his. “I can swear on Goddess Tulaja Bhavani. The allegations are false and I never contacted Somaiya. Both Khedekar and Kadam had worked under me while in Shiv Sena and have ditched the party by defecting to other parties. Kadam is levelling allegations owing to grudges as he was defeated by my son in the last Assembly election. Khedekar is against me as his corruption in the nagar panchayat has been exposed by me. I have filed suits against Khedekar and Kadam in earlier allegations. There is no rift within our party. Parab helps my son a lot,” Kadam said.Khedekar said Karve was a link between Kadam and Somaiya and had obtained the information against Parab under Right to Information Act (RTI). “Karve was acting on behalf of Kadam and had gathered information against Parab and Narvekar. Karve provided all the details and documents to Somaiya. Kadam has said he will move the court against me. We are ready to face it and all the documents will be provided in the court,” he said.Kadam is believably unhappy with the Shiv Sena because he was not inducted in the Thackeray government’s cabinet in 2019. Kadam was the environment minister in the Devendra Fadnavis government till October 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-leader-gave-out-info-on-irregularities-in-anil-parab-s-resort-mns-101633205621607.html
03-10-2021||Mumbai||Sindhudurg airport: Tickets’ sale on for 2022 Ganeshotsav||After Sindhudhurg’s Chipi airport received Aerodrome Licence from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) last month, flights bookings from Mumbai have begun. Air India, via its portal, has opened bookings between the two airports for Ganeshotsav next year even before the airport is operational. Commencing flight operations from Chipi airport is one of the targets highlighted by civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia. Air India’s regional arm, Alliance Air, will operate daily direct air services to the newly-constructed Sindhudurg airport from Mumbai, starting October 9, making it the first domestic carrier to launch operations to the greenfield airport in the Konkan region. A one-way lowest air ticket fare from Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) to Chipi airport for August 18, 2022, costs ₹1,890. The airline, however, has announced an all-inclusive inaugural fare of ₹2,520 for the Mumbai-Sindhudurg flight and ₹2,621 for Sindhudurg-Mumbai services.Mumbai sees a good number of travellers visiting Konkan before or during the 10-day Ganesh Chaturthi festival and it is expected that the route will bloom during this period. Alliance Air flight 9I661 that is said to depart from Mumbai at 11.35am will arrive at Sindhudurg at 1pm and the return flight, 9I662, will depart from Sindhudurg at 1.25pm and arrive in Mumbai at 2.50pm.“Operations from Chipi airport have been delayed for years. Though the government has announced to commence the operations from this month and the airline too has begun advance bookings, it is important to stick to this deadline and begin operations, unlike previous several occasions,” said an industry expert who did not wish to be named. “Taking advance booking for next year’s festive season is a positive sign, however, people might be sceptical about booking tickets for that period this early.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sindhudurg-airport-tickets-sale-on-for-2022-ganeshotsav-101633205448407.html

The blinking and batting of eyelids at the bedecking of marketplaces and mela grounds. The blink-blink at the rolling out of Ravanas and Durga idols by the fabled potters of Kumartuli from Bengal at the Parade Grounds or Pujo pandals.Come the digital age, and one comes to know that the fall festivals are round the corner thanks to the bleep-bleep. The alerts that begin to beep ‘n’ bleat on one’s smartphones and iPhones. At most times, phoney alerts. At most times, annoying alerts. So far so good, until along came the pandemic, and it changed much of that.

03-10-2021||Mumbai||Fuel prices at all-time high in Mumbai; petrol crosses ₹108-mark||Fuel prices were at an all-time high in Mumbai on Saturday with petrol and diesel crossing ₹108 and ₹98, respectively. Fuel prices have been on an increase in the city for the third consecutive day.A litre of petrol was priced at ₹108.19, while diesel was available for ₹98.16 on Saturday after witnessing a surge of 24 and 32 paise, respectively.Thane, too, saw hike in fuel prices with one litre of petrol costing ₹108.33 and diesel being priced at ₹98.29. The price of petrol was the costliest in the state in Parbhani at ₹110.75, while diesel was the most expensive in Amravati at ₹99.70 per litre.Citizens expressed their anger on the rising fuel prices and have asked the government to take immediate steps to control the hike.“The pandemic has already drained us out financially and the government is not even showing basic human courtesy and is going on increasing the fuel prices. People do not have money to spend. The government should immediately lower the prices,” said Mazagaon resident Aadi Jain.“Fuel prices in Mumbai have been on the rise for more than four months. Neither the state government nor the Centre has done anything to cap them. It is really sad that the governments do not think of the common citizens. How will citizens afford even a two-wheeler with the constant rise in fuel prices,” Ghatkopar resident Deepika Singh said. Transporters have stated that the government should consider including fuel under the Goods and Service Tax (GST) and stop the price hike.“Petrol and diesel prices have touched record highs on Saturday. The government is totally callous to the plight of the common citizens and the road transport sector which is always at the receiving end with even small surge in prices. It has been experienced that the government, during election season, puts a freeze on any price hikes and it should redo that now when inflation is at an all-time high, squeezing the household budgets and putting acute pressure on the economic viability of small operators. The government should seriously consider including the [fuel] products under GST,” said Bal Malkit Singh, chairman, All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC). Fuel prices in the city have been on an increase since May 3 and on May 29, petrol crossed the ₹100-mark.On Friday, a litre of petrol was priced at ₹107.95, while one litre of diesel was available at ₹97.84 after witnessing a surge of 24 and 32 paise, respectively.On Thursday, petrol was priced at ₹107.71 per litre while one litre of diesel was available at ₹97.52 in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fuel-prices-at-all-time-high-in-mumbai-petrol-crosses-108mark-101633205261757.html
03-10-2021||Mumbai||Heavy vehicles can’t ply on new flyover between Ghatkopar, Mankhurd for 2 more months||Two months since it was inaugurated by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on August 1, the Ghatkopar-Mankhurd flyover has still not been opened for heavy vehicles. It will take up to two more months before heavy vehicles are allowed to use the flyover, civic authorities from the bridges department said.According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), a high-tension wire runs overhead the bridge, and until it is shifted, height restrictions for vehicles on the bridge cannot be revoked. BMC needs to construct a pier at an alternate location to shift the high-tension wire over the bridge, and will require 225 square metres of land, which falls under the jurisdiction of the collector. Additional municipal commissioner P Velarasu, who is overseeing the project, said, “We need to basically move the pylon that is carrying the wires away from the bridge, which will serve our purpose. We have requested the state government for permission to use the collector-owned land. It will be allotted to BMC and we will have to pay whatever charges are assessed for this.”A senior civic official from the bridges department said, “On Friday, we received a letter from the government. BMC will have to shell out around ₹60 lakh for the land. The process for this transaction will be initiated soon. It may take up to two months for us to complete the shifting of the high-tension wire, and allow heavy vehicles to use the bridge.”The route sees considerable traffic of heavy vehicles, especially garbage trucks carrying waste to Deonar dumping ground.The opposition has raised questions over the delay in opening the bridge for heavy vehicles since its inauguration two months ago. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Prabhakar Shinde said, “How did the administration not realise at the time of issuing the work order to the contractor or during the construction of the bridge that high-tension wires were running overhead which would hamper access to heavy vehicles, that are tall, such as a truck? The bridge was inaugurated by CM, and despite this, BMC did not undertake due diligence during its construction.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/heavy-vehicles-can-t-ply-on-new-flyover-between-ghatkopar-mankhurd-for-2-more-months-101633205148814.html
03-10-2021||Mumbai||Covid may accelerate the loss of kidney function in some patients||A 63-year-old businessman from south Mumbai, who has been suffering from diabetes and kidney disease, had a gradual deterioration in his kidney function over the years. His kidney’s filtration rate, known as the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), had dropped from 60 in 2017 to 50 in 2020. Last August, the businessman contracted Covid-19 and his two-week-long battle with the infection led to his kidney function dropping speedily to 35. He was eventually put on dialysis two months ago.Doctors said kidneys have borne the most impact during the pandemic –patients with chronic kidney diseases suffered as dialysis units shut down at the beginning of the pandemic, patients with existing kidney diseases were at higher risk of getting the Covid-19 infection, and patients like this south Mumbai businessman, who contracted the infection, had kidney functions worsening at a much faster rate.“On an average, kidney patients have 3% to 5% loss of kidney function every year,” said Dr Hemal Shah, a nephrologist from Bhatia Hospital, who has been treating the south Mumbai businessman. “When these patients get Covid-19, their kidney function deteriorates much faster, at a double speed,” he added.Kidneys are two bean-shaped organs that filter the blood in the body by removing waste and extra water to make urine. The filtration function of the kidneys is crucial to remove the toxins and ensure a normal body function. The rate of a kidney’s filtration or eGFR is calculated by measuring the levels of creatinine, which is the waste produced during the normal wear and tear of the body muscles.Patients with kidney diseases are staged according to their eGFR. An eGFR slightly higher than 90 is considered stage 1; eGFR between 89 and 60 is stage 2; 59 to 30 is stage 3; 29 to 15 is stage 4 and an eGFR less than 15 is considered stage 5. When patients reach stage 5, they are put on dialysis and are recommended transplants. Until then, they are managed with a combination of treatment and a restricted diet, which includes a lower quantity of proteins.Medical experts say that any kind of severe infection can have an impact on the kidneys. For instance, if someone has severe pneumonia or typhoid, the body typically activates its immune system to fight the disease and it may lead to inflammation.“In Covid-19, too, as the body attempts to fight the infection, a systemic inflammation may occur,” said nephrologist Dr Bharat Shah from Global Hospital. “Systemic inflammation is a state when the whole body is inflamed. During this, the kidneys are also inflamed and their function gets affected. However, we have seen such reaction only in moderate to severe Covid-19 patients,” he added.How exactly does the virus impact the kidneys? The kidneys are made of lakhs of filtering units called nephrons. Each nephron consists of a filter called the glomerulus and a small tube known as a tubule.According to Dr Shah, any organism enters the human body by binding to a receptor – a molecule that receives signals for a cell. “The Sars-CoV-2 is known to bind with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. These receptors are present on the tubules of the kidney, which perhaps makes it easier for the virus to impact the kidneys in an infected patient,” he said.A study from Brazil, published last month in the peer-reviewed journal Frontiers in Physiology, stated that the “impairment of ACE2’s biological functions can lead to a drop in renal blood flow and a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), altering the capacity of the kidneys to eliminate substances (metabolites) that are toxic in excessive quantities. It can also increase vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) in the kidneys, leading to renal function deterioration.”The researchers highlighted that there is no available information on the impact of Covid-19 on long-term kidney function, but Covid-related acute kidney injury seems to contribute to a faster decline in GFR, higher rate of kidney replacement therapy requirement, and slower complete kidney function recovery. They also highlighted the importance of monitoring kidney function in Covid-19 survivors who presented acute kidney injury or kidney abnormalities.Dr Shah from Bhatia Hospital cited another case of a 43-year-old carpenter who did not have any existing history of kidney disease but was admitted with a very high creatinine level when he contracted Covid-19 last September. At the time of discharge from the hospital, his eGFR had dropped to 20, meaning he was in the stage-3 category of chronic kidney disease. “He somehow pulled off over the past several months, but we had to eventually put him on dialysis last week,” said Dr Shah, adding that the patient is also likely to undergo a kidney transplant soon as one of his close relatives is willing to donate the organ.A senior doctor from a civic-run hospital in Mumbai said that Covid-19 mortality among kidney patients is likely to be higher. “We need quick, large-scale, detailed studies from all institutions to understand the impact of Covid-19 on kidneys and introduce mitigation measures, mainly in the non-urban pockets where medical services are already compromised,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-may-accelerate-the-loss-of-kidney-function-in-some-patients-101633204902956.html

03-10-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column | Making peace with the fragility of life||Death gets a bad reputation. Most people would rather focus on life and the positive things associated with it, knowing well that one must start waiting in the queue as soon as one is born. Growing older is a privilege denied to many but the young and old must march towards death all the same. Life changes like the seasons of the year till it comes to an end. Therefore, it is not possible to talk about life without talking about death as well. After all, life is just the interval between birth and death.Most of us try not to dwell on our mortality, till the angel of death suddenly kisses one of our friends, relatives or acquaintances, giving us a rude jolt. In the last two years, many of us have lost someone dear to us. The sudden shock, which is most painful to the human mind, has made each one of us ponder on the uncertainty and fragility of life. Principal Bhupinder Singh was one such friend who recently left the earthly abode to meet his maker. Having known him myself and after reading about the man who was respected and adored by many, I feel it is important to discuss death more openly and prepare ourselves well in time for the final trip. As the years pass, we learn to bid goodbye to our friends, relatives and other near and dear ones and acceptance sets in the due course of time. However, when it is our turn to say the final goodbye and take the last step into oblivion, acceptance takes relatively more time.Accepting the death of one’s immediate family member is very difficult . It involves overcoming shock, pain, sadness, tears and the misery generated by the loss. Thus, one should make it easier for their family by helping them accept the loss and mourn gracefully.All of us have good, bad and ugly sides and nobody likes to be seen in a bad light even after one is gone. If you do not want your spouse, children and others to know certain aspects of your personality, erase such records from diaries, laptops or mobile phones.One also knows, which of their belongings will be useful to certain family members and should gift these items to the right persons. One should also take a decision about possessions to be donated such as books and clothes. Of course, preparing a will is very important to simplify matters for one’s heirs. Donating one’s body or organs is another important decision, which can only be taken by the person concerned as religious and cultural beliefs are to be considered. While preparing for the end, one should loosen the strings of one’s purse to experience the sheer joy of giving, not to religious institutions and NGOs where it may be misused, but to those who genuinely need it. Perhaps, one should start working on fulfilling the dreams that had to be abandoned earlier due to a variety of reasons such as time and resources. And lastly, this is the time to write about oneself in a journal, as honestly as possible. It may not get printed, but your children, or grandchildren may one day find some useful life lessons in it. colcheema1942@gmail.com(The writer is a Panchkula-based freelance contributor)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-making-peace-with-the-fragility-of-life-101633204542854.html
03-10-2021||Mumbai||BMC spent at least ₹1K-crore on Mumbai roads annually in past 10 years||While there has been uproar over the poor quality of roads in Mumbai with potholes mushrooming across the city, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) spends at least ₹1,000 crore annually on the road department that is involved in the construction, repair and maintenance of the city’s 2,000-km road network, civic body data has revealed. Moreover, the expenditure has doubled in the past 10 years. BMC has spent over ₹15,000 crore on the road department in the past nine financial years or two election terms, according to the data.BMC claims that in the current fiscal, the expenditure on road works will be around ₹2,000 crore. It has maintained that the current works of converting all major roads into cement and concrete is the ultimate solution to have good quality of roads and will result in resolving problems relating to potholes.According to the data, the expenditure on roads has significantly increased from 2012-13. The data stated that BMC’s expenditure rose dramatically in the 2012-2017 election term, as compared to the past two election terms between 2002 and 2012. As per the data, ₹1,002 crore was spent between 2002 and 2007 by BMC on construction and repair-maintenance of roads in the city, which increased to ₹3,992 crore between 2007 and 2012.However, after this, the expenditure has significantly increased. Between 2012 and 2017, BMC spent ₹8,305 crore – double the money spent in the previous five years. Further, between 2017 and January 2021, BMC had spent over ₹7,298 crore on the roads department. This indicates that the expenditure in the ongoing election term that will end in March is expected to be more than that of the previous term of 2012-17. However, BMC’s above data is considering the financial year.This does not include the western and eastern express highways as they are maintained by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA). There are several other agencies, including the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) that maintains several flyovers, Mumbai Port Trust, that maintaining the city roads. In 2015, ₹350-crore road scam was discovered in BMC in which 38 people – 22 site engineers and 16 third-party quality auditors – were held responsible. The civic body ordered a probe into repairs of 34 roads, after then mayor Snehal Ambekar wrote to former municipal commissioner Ajoy Mehta about the inferior quality and corruption. The inquiry found that the contractors had not used the amount of material needed to build or repair the roads, thus reducing its thickness and pocketing the remaining amount.But despite the above expenditure and the road scam resulting in scrutiny, BMC remains at the receiving end over potholes every year during monsoon. Borivli resident Viraj Mamania said, “Every year during monsoon, we have potholes despite crores of rupees being spent by BMC. Since the past two years, several roads in my area, which were earlier smooth, have developed potholes. In the name of Covid-19 duty, there is no quick response to the potholes. We have to do continuous follow-ups to ensure the potholes are fixed.”Mulund resident Nishit Modi, “Everywhere in the city, be it LBS Road, SV Road and Linking Road, there are potholes. The reason for this is the ongoing Metro construction work. But how long can we take this? The Metro work has been going on for over the past three years and will go on for 3 more years. So is BMC expecting citizens to travel on potholes for six years while it continues to spend crores of rupees on road maintenance?”Meanwhile, BMC has said that the quality of roads will undergo a major transformation in the next seven-eight years. Additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu said, “Asphalt and bitumen are not going to help when it comes to road surface in the city. The vehicle load and rainfall pattern both have contributed in degrading road quality, resulting in potholes. Hence, our policy decision to have cement and concrete roads is the ultimate answer to give Mumbai better roads.” Velrasu added, “The current ratio of cement and concrete roads in the city out of total 2,000 km roads under BMC is around 25-30% and we plan to take it up to around 80%. This change will come in around seven-eight years and it will be a major solution to potholes. We can do it faster but we have to ensure our capacity and quality of roads.”Dhawal Ashar, head of Urban Transport and Road Safety at World Resources Institute (WRI), said, “Concrete roads could largely address the problem of potholes in the city. However, it is critical to carefully design each element of our street. Concrete pavements are rigid. Once we make them, it will be hard to turn back. Ultimately, the true experience of a city is in its detail. People-friendly streets are safe, accessible and beautiful. There is undeniable evidence that designing for pedestrians will not just improve safety but also increase traffic efficiency.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-spent-at-least-1k-crore-on-mumbai-roads-annually-in-past-10-years-101633204361765.html
03-10-2021||Mumbai||Fadnavis tours areas hit by floods, Pankaja Munde keeps away||Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday began a tour of the districts affected by floods in Marathwada (central Maharashtra) to meet the affected farmers. The tour also came under focus as senior BJP leader Pankaja Munde kept away, citing health reasons. Eyebrows were raised in the political circles over the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Pankaja Munde’s conspicuous sulking from the scene when leader of opposition in legislative Assembly Fandavis and key party leaders are touring flood-affected central Maharashtra, the political home turf for the former. Munde has tweeted to announce that she is unwell and would not be able to take calls or meet in person for two to four days.After beginning the tour from Washim in Vidarbha, Fadnavis is touring Hingoli and Nanded on Saturday and will visit other districts of central Maharashtra on Sunday.Being a senior party leader from the region, Munde was expected to join the tour of the senior party leaders. She, however, avoided to join the tour reportedly to show her discontent. The leader is reportedly unhappy with the treatment meted out to her and her family over the past few years. More recently, Munde had openly expressed her anger against Fadnavis and Maharashtra unit chief of party Chandrakant Patil. She had indulged in a show of strength after her sister and Beed MP Pritam was not given a ministerial berth during the Modi government expansion in July this year.Pankaja tweeted on Saturday, “Unwell..tonsillitis n blisters in my throat advised strict voice rest for 2 to 4 days ... can’t take calls or meet in person…(sic)”“She believes that party’s state leaders like Fadnavis and Patil have been deliberately cutting her to size. She is under the impression that her defeat in 2019 Assembly polls was engineered by her rivals within the party. Other OBC leaders in the party are being given lift to undermine her importance despite she being the OBC face of the party. Denying the claim of her younger sister, party inducted Bhagwat Karad, another OBC leader from the region, as union minister and it had been like rubbing salt on the wound for Mundes. Karad was brought in politics by Pankaja’s father Gopinathji,” said a leader close to Pankaja.Pankaja had kept away from an OBC rally convened by the party in Mumbai in July. She had led a show of strength and announced a Yatra in central Maharashtra as part of the revolt within the party after her defeat in Assembly poll. When asked about the buzz, Fadnavis said that the issue should not be politicised. “I will speak to her. She is not well and it could happen with anybody. I think nobody should give it a political colour,” he said. Political analyst Hemand Desai said, “Question here is if she was invited or intimated by a party about the tour, asking her to join. Pankaja is keeping away from the party activities of late. As a national secretary Pankaja is co-incharge of Madhya Pradesh for party activities, but she is hardly seen on national canvas”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fadnavis-tours-areas-hit-by-floods-pankaja-munde-keeps-away-101633204122254.html

03-10-2021||Pune||Fuel retailer to offer sports training to Yerawada jail inmates in Pune||PUNE: The prison departments from multiple states in the country inaugurated a sports training initiative with the government oil distributor Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) for inmates on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti on Saturday. Yerawada Central Jail, the only prison that participated in the initial phase of the initiative from Maharashtra, announced 60 players who will train with three coaches of IOCL next month. The three sports include chess, carrom and volleyball with 20 players each. Carrom coach will be Yogesh Pardeshi (46), a three-time world champion, and chess coach will be Eesha Karavade (33), the 2005 woman grandmaster. The initiative, however, has not been introduced in the women’s prison of Yerawada. West Bengal’s Alipore Women’s Correctional Home was one of the few jails which launched the initiative for women. “As per the Bombay High Court directive, men - even coaches - cannot be allowed inside the women’s prison. We have asked for female coaches. Once we get them, the coaching will begin there as well,” said Atulchandra Kulkarni, additional director general of police (ADGP) for Maharashtra Prisons. “We will provide the equipment, instalation and coaching. We had proposed a three-month programme. So far, we have received information for one month. The schedule will be provided by the jail administration as per the security protocol,” said Rajesh Jadhav, general manager, human resource, IOCL. The coaches that work with IOCL are players who represented the country. IOCL holds annual training for children in Konkan, Maharashtra which provides a hands-on experience in coaching for the players. “There are three levels - beginner, mid-level, and professional. The beginner and mid-level coaching is done by others whom I train. I train the professional level players. These players are generally under 14 or under 18 as these trainings are held with students of either schools or junior colleges that approach IOCL,” said Pardeshi. When asked about the difference between the training strategy for training children and jail inmates, the coaches had varied strategies. “I have been teaching with IOCL for 17-18 years. From experience, now I know who has the aptitude for it when I see them play. We have now been given a name of the 20 players, I hope they turn into players,” said Pardeshi. “I have not coached much. But looking at it from an outside perspective, they are adults and with very little distraction inside the jail. There are multiple distractions and commitments from outside. So, I think that maybe it will be easier to concentrate and learn,” said Karavade. Shrikant Madhav Vaidya, chairman, IOCL and ADGP of various states’ prison departments, including ADGP Kulkarni of Maharashtra and Anirban Ghosh of IOCL attended the inaugural event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/fuel-retailer-to-offer-sports-training-to-yerawada-jail-inmates-in-pune-101633203462400.html
03-10-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column | Mahatma Gandhi: A leader for the ages||As an Indian on foreign soil, I would inevitably be asked, “Have you heard of Gandhi? Do you know of him?” It didn’t matter where I was - Brazil, Colombia or Ecuador - everybody was in awe of him. Sure, as an Indian, I was well-versed with Mahatma Gandhi’s role in India’s freedom struggle. However, I was amazed to see his fan following in distant countries, especially after Richard Attenborough’s Academy Award-winning film Gandhi. The film, which won eight Oscars took Gandhi to the far corners of the world. However, I was tickled by the fact that a Britisher had made a film on the man who had dedicated his life to fighting his countrymen. Gandhi is revered all over the world as the messiah of non-violence. His message of non-violence is as relevant today, as it was in the 1930s and 1940s, when he led India’s fight against colonial rule. To Gandhi, the means were as important as the ends, to Gandhi. While advocating for swaraj (self-rule), Gandhi had requested all freedom fighters to peacefully resist the colonial forces, and never resort to violence against the police. In fact, he would call off large-scale satyagraha (civil disobedience) movements, in case violence was perpetrated by the protesters. An appeal to the conscience Every human life was precious for the Mahatma, even the lives of those who opposed India’s quest for freedom. Those who respect human life, never indulge in violence. By following a policy of non-violence, Gandhi appealed to the conscience of his opponents. As the great physicist Albert Einstein succinctly put it, “Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth.” Gandhi’s teachings have influenced numerous global leaders. Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela were both followers of the Mahatma’s non-violence philosophy and imbibed his teachings in their own struggles. Gandhi’s vision for India was that of a country where people of all religions lived harmoniously. He would often proclaim that he was not just a Hindu. He was a Hindu, Muslim, Christian and Jew, all rolled into one. Gandhi practiced, what he preached. In his ashrams, all residents were responsible for cleaning the toilets, a role traditionally consigned to a group of people who were considered “untouchables.” He was against all discrimination and respected all forms of work. So, at his ashrams people cleaned toilets by rotation as Gandhi believed that one must be the change they wanted to see in the world. He also prescribed being truthful in both relationships and politics, proclaiming, “Truth is as old as the hills.” Role model for the youth Gandhi’s autobiography My Experiments With Truth, has been written with candour and in elementary English, which can be understood by everybody. It should be made mandatory reading for the youth. It is important to expose youngsters to leaders, who ushered significant changes in our world, without any violence or firing a single shot. Younger generations would also benefit by reading American author Louis Fischer’s The Life of Mahatma Gandhi. The book was my Bible in my younger days. Fischer spent seven days with Gandhi at the Sevagram Ashram in Wardha. The author was surprised to see that the Mahatma only kept a black and white photograph of Jesus Christ, in his bare room. While the world has paid homage to Mahatma Gandhi through statues and postage stamps, his message of non-violence has been largely ignored. The world is overflowing with armed struggles as seen in Afghanistan, Palestine, Syria, and Lebanon. Armed militancy movements such as the Al Qaeda, and ISIS in the Middle East and rebel groups in Colombia and Peru have caused the death of thousands of people in the name of ideological struggles. Many of the embattled people may not even have heard the name of Mahatma Gandhi. Should they choose to struggle nonviolently, perhaps it would draw more global attention to their cause. The world needs to subordinate religion to economics. We need to provide more money, food and medicines to about 36% of the global population, which lives below the poverty line. We need to rediscover Mahatma Gandhi. Feeding, clothing and housing the destitute of the world, is the highest religious duty, we can perform. As Martin Luther King wrote, Mahatma Gandhi “belonged to the ages.” rkaneja@anejamanagement.com (The author is a Mumbai-based management consultant)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mahatma-gandhi-a-leader-for-the-ages-101633202921697.html

Six police teams have been set up to arrest the unidentified assailants and though some suspects are being interrogated, the main culprits were still at large. Police admitted that the postmortem report established death caused due to injury on forehead and strangulation. Villagers told the police that women had to bear with lewd remarks passed at them by hooligans and said many girl students had even stopped going to school because of such things. “Teams were working on all angles and hopefully perpetrators of crime would soon be arrested,” said senior superintendent of police (SSP), Bulandshahr, SK Singh while confirming the postmortem report. Singh said police with the help of locals, had picked up a suspect who was being interrogated. “This and other suspects would help us nab the assailants”, Singh said. Police said the student had left her home to attend her tuition classes in a neighbouring village on Thursday evening. However, when she didn’t return her family and locals started looking for her and later her body was found in the outskirts of Kirra village, police said. After the postmortem examination, the victim’s body was brought to her village on Friday where villagers refused to perform the last rites until the police and local administration agreed to their demand of providing a safe and secure atmosphere for women. They also demanded financial aid to the vicim’s family and setting up of an inter college in the village named after the victim. They also sought prompt arrest of the assailants. The last rites of the victim were later performed after the police agreed to the demands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dalit-girl-s-killers-still-at-large-in-up-s-bulandshahr-101633202742503.html
03-10-2021||Pune||Four booked in currency exchange fraud in Pune||PUNE: The Pune police have booked four men in the third known case of cheating by giving soap bars disguised as UAE Dirhams by luring people into rates lower than foreign exchange rates. The theft and cheating happened on September 8 around 2:45pm near Upper bus depot in Bibwewadi. A complaint was lodged by Vinod Pandit (40) of Kondhwa Budrukh. The four men had approached Pandit with an offer to sell Dirham at a cheaper rate in exchange of cash. As pre-decided, Pandit arrived at the spot with ₹60,000 cash and one of the accused arrived with what looked like a wad of Dirhams but were soap bars wrapped in newspaper and cloth layers. The man then thrusted the package in Pandit’s hand and forcefully grabbed the plastic bag with Indian currency in it. The man then allegedly pushed Pandit on the ground and fled from the spot. A case under Sections 406 (criminal breach of peace), 420 (cheating), 392 (robbery) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code was registered at Bibwewadi police station. The same modus operandi has been used in one case in Kondhwa and the second was registered at Lonikand police station in the past one month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/four-booked-in-currency-exchange-fraud-in-pune-101633202741455.html

Due to adoption of traditional farming, where groundwater went down considerably in some places, thousands of acres became saline, while the water level came up farmers’ production stopped on such land. The economic condition of the farmers was also disturbed due to non-fertility of the land.Keeping in view the condition of farmers, the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana was implemented to promote the Blue Revolution, Dalal said.Farmers of Sirsa took up this scheme and it is proving to be effective in strengthening the economic base of farmers, the minister said.District fisheries officer Jagdish Chandra said there is immense potential for fish farming in saline water and saline land. Under the scheme, there is a provision of grant of maximum 40% of the unit cost by the government for the general category and 60% of the unit cost for the SC/ST/women category, he said.At present, the scheme of the department of fisheries is proving to be beneficial for fish farmers. Farmers interested in fisheries can apply for grants to buy vehicles (motorcycles, cycles and three-wheelers) for making ponds on land, fish farming in salt water, shrimp farming and selling fish, he said.He said white prawn rearing is also being done on about 400 acre in district.Of these, 35 acre is in Chormar Kheda village, 32 acre in Gudiya Kheda, 16 acre in Mithdi including Bhangu, Jhordwali, Phoolo, Odhan, Darba Kalan, Manak Dewan, Asha Kheda, Karmshana, Chautala village, etc.Buyers from Telangana and West Bengal are coming in to buy white shrimp being produced in Sirsa. From here, the fish is exported to various countries, including China.Dalal reviewed the fish farming business in a state-level meeting, in which he has given a target of 600 acre of fisheries business. He said soon, Sirsa will emerge as a pilot project in fisheries across country.Meanwhile, farmers have demanded the state government to set up a water testing laboratory in Sirsa to support the business.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmers-turning-to-fish-farming-using-barren-saline-land-in-haryana-s-sirsa-101633202145810.html

Police said the murder was over a dispute about construction of a building on the temple trust premises. Lucknow’s deputy commissioner of police (DCP), north, GK Chowdhary said the body of the private contractor Nirmal Agnihorti was found lying in bushes by the roadside, little distance from Mahavir ji temple in Gosaiganj town area on Friday. He said the postmortem report revealed multiple injuries on the contractor’s body that apparently caused his death.

The priests were opposing the construction. The DCP said the contractor was carrying out the construction on behalf of one Lala Ganesh Prasad. Another police official explained that there were two groups among the temple trust members, one of which allowed Lala Ganesh Prasad to construct the complex and to rent it to a bank to raise the temple trust’s income. The other group was opposing this. The DCP said the contractor’s son Prateek got a named FIR against four priests: Chanderpal alias Bablu, Om Prakash alias Sattu, Bheesma alis Pintu and Pappu. Named FIR was also made against two of their aides Ravindra Kumar and Dharam Raj. Prateek, in his complaint, has accused them of attacking his father and beating him to death.

However, even as the administration has enough doses with them, the shortage of syringes has emerged as a new worry for the administration. The state government has been supplying Covid vaccine doses but has stopped giving syringes as the Centre has stopped the supply of syringes, said deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar during a press meet on Friday. Pune zilla parishad chief executive officer Ayush Prasad said, “The shortage of syringes is primarily because of corporate donors who gave us only vaccines and no syringes. While Bajaj group donated both syringes and vaccine doses, we had to use up our syringes to continue the drives. This caused a temporary shortage. We are planning to start the 75 hours marathon vaccination drive at a selected larger location where there would be a continuous flow of beneficiaries and we will have at least nine nurses to provide service.” On Saturday, the state provided syringes to the district but they would only suffice for the next few days. PMC is also facing a similar problem. Dr Suryakant Deokar, PMC immunisation officer said, “We have received over 41,000 syringes on Saturday and for the 75-hour marathon vaccination drive we would plan for the same on Monday and most likely the drive would begin on Tuesday and will continue till Friday. Regarding shortage of syringes if required we would buy more at our end.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/syringe-shortage-may-hit-pmc-rural-pune-plan-of-75-hour-marathon-vaccination-drive-101633201962855.html
03-10-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: Residents protest against demolition drives, officials defend move||Around 1,000 residents of New Palam Vihar and its adjoining areas, under the aegis of Jan Adhikar Sangathan, congregated at Shaheed Major Vinod Rana park on Saturday to protest against the demolition drive being carried out by the civic agencies. While locals said that the civic authorities are not providing amenities despite them paying property tax and development charges, officials of the town and country planning department said demolitions are being carried out in illegal colonies and against constructions which are not part of the approved building plans. Bir Singh, former sarpanch of Bajghera, who is spearheading the Sangathan , said demolition drives are being carried out arbitrarily and without any reason. “The demolition drives were stopped in New Palam Vihar in 2005. After that, no such action was taken. It is surprising that suddenly, such actions are being carried out despite the fact that the local MLA Rakesh Daulatabad is from this area,” said Singh. Rakesh Rana, president of Sai Kunj RWA, said the government agencies have failed in bringing development and were engaged in seeking taxes only. A spokesperson for Rakesh Daulatabad, the Badshahpur MLA, said the issue of demolitions is being given a political colour by people, who have political interests and ambitions. “These are baseless allegations being levelled against the MLA, who has played key role in the development of colonies and is dedicated to work for the betterment of people of Badshahpur and Gurugram,” he said. R S Bhath, district town planner said that demolitions are being carried out only if illegal constructions have been made. “New construction without permission is not allowed. We will take action against illegal colonies and buildings according to rules. We also appeal to people to avoid buying properties in illegal colonies,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-residents-protest-against-demolition-drives-officials-defend-move-101633201961638.html
03-10-2021||Chandigarh||Amid farmers’ protests in Haryana, govt agrees to start paddy procurement from today||Amid state-wide protests by farmers on Saturday, the Union government has now agreed to start procurement of paddy in Haryana from October 3.Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar made this announcement after a meeting with Union minister of state for food and public distribution, Ashwani Kumar Choubey, in Delhi.Khattar meets Union minister Ashwani Kumar Choubey“We raised the issue with the Union minister and requested him to resolve the matter and it was decided that procurement of paddy will start from October 3 instead of October 11,” Khattar told the media after the meeting in New Delhi.He said paddy arrival in mandis and the concerns of farmers are valid, thus, it was decided that procurement will begin from Sunday. Khattar said, “We hope farmers who held protests demanding that procurement be started immediately will stop their protest.”The decision has come as a major relief for thousands of farmers, arhtiyas and mandi labourers as huge stocks of unprocured paddy is lying in the mandis for past couple of days. Directions have been issued to district-level officials to start procurement from Sunday.Earlier, procurement in around 200 mandis and purchase centres of Haryana was to start from September 25 and later it was delayed to October 1. But late on September 30, the Union government had directed the procurement agencies of Punjab and Haryana to defer the procurement to October 11 citing higher moisture content in paddy and delay in harvest due to recent rains.The move had evoked severe criticism from farm unions and they had threatened to gherao residences of all MLAs and MPs and start indefinite protests if government fails to start procurement immediately.Day of protests across stateOn Saturday, as per directions of senior farm leaders including Gurnam Singh Charuni, farmers associated with different farm unions held meetings, took out protest marches, broke barricades and managed to reach the residences of leaders of the ruling parties.In Karnal, the administration had made elaborate security arrangements around the CM’s residence in Prem Nagar but the agitators broke the barricades with a tractor-trailer and reached the residence to start an indefinite protest.The farmers also installed a flag of farm union on a wall of the CM’s residence. Farmers even pitched a tent outside the CM house for a long haul if procurement is not started soon.In Kaithal, farmers also got support of anganwadi workers and helpers’ union. They breached the barricades and reached the residence of minister of state Kamlesh Dhanda.Similar protests were reported from Kurukshetra’s Shahbad as farmers carrying trolleys laden with paddy reached the residence of sports minister Sandeep Kumar and JJP MLA Ram Karan Kala.Farmers protested outside the houses of deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, deputy speaker Ranbir Gangwa, minister of state Anoop Dhanak and BJP MLA Kamal Gupta in Hisar to register their protest.They also laid siege outside the residences of Sirsa MP Sunita Duggal, Sonepat MP Ramresh Kaushik, Bhiwani-Mahendergarh MP Dharambir Singh and state agriculture minister JP Dalal’s residence in Bhiwani.The farmers burnt plants of bajra, cotton and paddy outside the ruling party leaders’ houses and raised slogans against them.Farmers vacate protest sites in Ambala, YamunanagarHours after the government announced to re-schedule paddy procurement in the state, farmers in Ambala and Yamunanagar vacated the protest sites outside the residences of MLAs on Saturday.Earlier, the farm activists, under the banner of Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), had pushed barricades in both districts to stage a sit-in outside the residence of state education minister Kanwar Pal and Ambala city MLA Aseem Goel.Despite multiple face-offs, the protests remained peaceful in both places. A farmer received minor injuries in Ambala after a barricade fell on him. He was taken to civil hospital for treatment.In Yamunanagar, BKU (Charuni) district director Mandeep Ror Chhappar had a run-in with BJP state president of OBC Morcha and former minister Karandev Kamboj, for calling names to the farming community.‘Victory of farmers’Reacting to the government’s decision to start procurement from October 3, farm leader Jagdeep Singh Aulakh said, “It is a victory of farmers. They have forced the government to start paddy procurement from Sunday.”Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala has also termed it a resounding victory of the farmers. “Farmers have forced the Modi government to withdraw its decision of postponing the procurement to October 11. The government will also have to repeal the Centre’s three farm laws.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amid-farmers-protests-in-haryana-govt-agrees-to-start-paddy-procurement-from-today-101633201664367.html

03-10-2021||Pune||Reopening of Pune schools: Staff in a fix over mandatory RT-PCR||Pune: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has given its nod to reopening of schools from October 4 and the educational institutes have to follow Covid protocols to ensure safety of students. Teachers from across the city expressed unhappiness over the last moment order. Schools will reopen at Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and Pune rural from Monday (October 4). Many schools and teachers were enthusiastic about reopening of offline classes after almost one and a half years. However, the enthusiasm was short-lived. The official order by PMC clearly states that all teaching and non-teaching staff have to get an RT-PCR test done before the reopening of schools. Speaking about the order, Harishchandra Gaikwad, president of the Pune District Principals’ Association, questioned how the staff can get the RT-PCR result in less than a day. “The order clearly states that RT-PCR has to be done before reopening of schools. Majority staff are vaccinated. Moreover, this order is issued on Saturday and schools are expected to start from Monday. In such a short notice, how can all the staff be tested and results be submitted at the respective schools?” said Gaikwad. He said that because of the announcement, many schools may not reopen on Monday as all staff may not get their RT-PCR results by then. “Schools, teachers and students were very enthusiastic about reopening of schools. However, it is likely that all schools may reopen by mid-week as results of all staff members would be made available by them. PMC should have informed us at least a few days prior,” said Gaikwad. He said that all Covid protocols are important to ensure the safety of students, however, local authorities should have issued the official statement earlier this week. In September last week, the state government announced that all schools in urban areas are to be reopened from October 4 for classes 8 to 12 and from classes 5 onwards in rural parts. However, PMC waited until the very last moment on Saturday to issue a formal order on the same. Speaking about the order, Dnyaneshwar Molak, PMC joint municipal commissioner, said that testing centres near the schools are allocated for special testing of teaching and non-teaching staff. “Most staff are vaccinated with both doses. RT-PCR are an additional measure to ensure safety of the student. Teachers and non-teaching staff are giving priority while testing and their results will be made readily available,” said Molak. Safety measures The Covid safety protocol that should be followed by schools:Thermal scanning, thermometer, pulse oximeter should be used at school premises School transport should be sanitised Compulsory RT-PCR test should be done by teaching and non-teaching staff within 48 hours before reopening of schools. The test result should be submitted at the schools. Every 15 days, the staff should be tested again Teachers should be completely vaccinated before reopening of schools Physical distance should be maintained in classrooms and staff rooms Markings should be made to ensure students are standing at least six feet apart. Covid protocols signboards and notices should be put up across the campus Written consent by parents School premises should be sanitised at least twice a day. School transport should also be sanitised at least twice a day||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/reopening-of-pune-schools-staff-in-a-fix-over-mandatory-rtpcr-101633201361536.html

This puts the entire examination process under suspicion. It seems fairness and transparency has been given a go by the Commission,” Surjewala said.“It has been eight days since the examination took place and the Commission is yet to issue the answer key for the test. This is because the Commission has to deal with three sets of papers and is clueless about releasing the answer key,” Surjewala said.Also, the questions asked in the three sets of papers were completely different in terms of the scope of the subject and did not provide level playing field to the candidates, he said.Questioning the availability of large number of OMR sheets at examination centres in Gurugram and Rewari, the Congress leader said this raises suspicion about malpractice in the examination process.“Many questions asked in the examination about BJP leaders were quite out of place. It seems that the HSSC was not taking an exam to select police sub-inspectors but BJP workers,” Surjewala said.The Congress leader said the Commission on Friday ordered a re-examination in three centres only despite the fact that anomalies have been reported from other exam centres also.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hssc-exam-for-selecting-cops-under-cloud-needs-to-be-probed-says-surjewala-101633201181350.html

The strike has been declared statewide by the respective organisation’s chapter in different districts in the state which will likely affect the non-emergency services at Sassoon General hospital, Pune city’s largest government hospital which also includes the planned surgeries and the daily OPD services at the hospital. Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) that covers doctors studying postgraduate course at BJ Medical College is protesting against fees collection by the medical education department for their courses as the students state that the academics at the colleges were completely affected last year due to Covid and that the students participated in Covid duties at all government hospitals during both the peaks. On Friday, over 427 residents went on a strike which affected the non-emergency services at the Sassoon General hospital like daily OPDs, routine laboratory work, routine department work and also planned surgeries. Only emergency work, covid wards and non-covid ICU continued to function with limited staff. Dr Vijay Yadav, president, Pune MARD at BJ Medical College said, “It has been two days but despite our discussions there has been no positive response from the medical education minister. It feels like we are being ignored and so the central MARD has decided to further intensify the strike till we get a positive dialogue from the government. The first year batch is yet to join but there are more than 400 resident doctors in second and third year who have worked for more than a year in Covid wards and we hardly had any academics in that year and so we are requesting the government to waive off the college fees.” Medical College Medical Officers Association (MCMOA) has declared to go on an indefinite strike if there is no positive response for their demands. MCMOA had reached out to the medical education minister Amit Deshmukh. Resident medical officer Dr Bharti Gajanan said, “We have received a positive response from the minister on Saturday who has promised to take a decision in favour of our demands and so we have called off the strike as of now for 15 days. The organisation has demanded permanent jobs for those who have worked in government hospitals for more than two years and also to ensure salaries for the medical officers who are also gazetted officers as per the seventh pay commission instead of a fixed amount. No work was affected at the hospital on Saturday and now for another 15 days we continue to wait for the government’s positive response.” With both the organisations planning to go on strike at the same time, the hospital is running at a limited staff which is affecting the routine services at the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sassoon-as-doctors-body-goes-on-strike-non-emergency-services-hit-101633200521475.html

Though she didn’t specify which of her four tenures she was referring to, her party leaders said majorly the BSP chief would be hinting at her five-year tenure, as in her previous tenures she shared power with the Samajwadi Party and later with the BJP. “During BSP government, houses for the poor were built all over UP, including Agra. This had elicited widespread praise. But due to regime change, several such welfare schemes that remained unfinished were not completed by the Samajwadi Party government . Now, the BJP government too has carried on with the same partial approach,” Mayawati tweeted. “The state and the country have witnessed how due to hugely narrow political gains, the SP and the BJP governments not only changed the names of various schemes that were launched by the BSP government but also closed them,” she alleged. “This act of these governments would remain etched as a dark chatper in history,” she tweeted. Mayawati didn’t name those schemes that she felt were renamed and stopped by the SP and BJP governments. Accused by the Samajwadi and the Congress of being ‘BJP’s B team’, Mayawati has of late been targeting the BJP government. On Friday, Mayawati had accused the BJP government over the poor condition of roads across the state as well as the state capital. On Thursday, she had hit out at the BJP government over the controversial death of a Kanpur-based realtor, claiming that he died due to police torture after he had checked in at a Gorakhpur hotel. The UP government has since recommended a CBI probe into the realtor’s death and ordered stern action, including dismissal of policemen found guilty of highhandedness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mayawati-accuses-sp-bjp-of-renaming-closing-schemes-of-her-government-101633199561286.html
03-10-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad admin allows Ramlila and Durga Puja celebrations with restrictions||The Ghaziabad administration has decided to allow Ramlila and Durga Puja celebrations this year in public places, but with a set of restrictions. Officials said that any such event can be organised only after permission is granted by the district administration, and no stalls and kiosks will be allowed at the event.The Durga Puja celebrations have remained curtailed due to the Covid-19 pandemic since 2020.  “All the Covid-19 protocols should be put in place at an event site once the permission is granted. In case, the permission is for enclosed space, there should be a gathering of not more than 100 people at a single point of time while in open areas the permission would be for not more than 50% capacity of the ground,” said Vipin Kumar, additional district magistrate (city). “During an event, Covid help desk should be put up at the entrance and no visitor would be allowed without face mask. Besides, people should be following social distancing norms. For the permission, organisers will have to fill up a form and submit the same to the office of district magistrate. They will also have to get other required approvals like the one from department of electrical safety,” the ADM added. Organisers said that they are happy with the relaxations given by the UP government. “This year the UP government has given relaxations. We were asked to follow the guidelines during a joint meeting of district officials with various organisers,” said Abhijit Roy, founder member of Prantic Cultural Society, Indirapuram. “We have planned puja celebrations in a banquet hall. Our theme this year will be ‘Jeevan Utsav -- Let’s celebrate life’, which signifies that people are coming out and celebrating life after the issues they faced during the pandemic. This year, we will bring in artistes from West Bengal,” he added. The staging of Ramlila was held regularly at Raj Nagar, but it could not be held in 2020 due to the Covid situation. “This year too, Ramlila will not be held in our area. The guidelines issued with regard to the event will not suffice holding of Ramlila at a grand scale,” said Rajendra Tyagi, councillor from Raj Nagar. The district administration officials said that the guidelines have been issued in accordance with the September 19 directions issued by the state government. In the directions, the government increased the capacity for events in open and closed areas from previous 50 persons to 100 persons at a single point of time while observing all Covid-19 protocols. “There was another order in which relaxation was given for gathering in open spaces. So, we have decided that it should not be more than 50% of the capacity of the ground. We also held meetings with different organisers on Friday and briefed them about the guidelines,” the ADM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-admin-allows-ramlila-and-durga-puja-celebrations-with-restrictions-101633199501717.html

He did not give any figures to support the claim.“We are conducting a survey to identify street children and so far we have zeroed in on 59 hot spots where children are either used as a front to sell random items on the streets or are forced into it by their families or are abandoned. Those who are abandoned will be sent to children’s homes, while those who are being used as a front for criminal or illegal activities will be rescued by our teams. Those who are pushed into it by their families will be counselled and monitored,” he said.Among the 59 “child-begging hot spots” identified include ITO, below IIT flyover, GTB Nagar, Majnu Ka Tila, Zakir Nagar and Rajouri Garden.Kundu said that as part of the drive, they have carried out eight rescue operations in the hot spots in which 56 children were rescued.Kundu also hailed the Delhi high court order on October 1, closing 1,108 cases of petty crimes allegedly committed by juveniles and ordering their immediate release as the enquiry in the cases were pending for over a year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-child-rights-body-identifies-59-begging-hot-spots-starts-rescue-drive-101633192482699.html

03-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: To avert gang war, inmates being relocated in city jails||Prisons officers at Delhi’s three jail complexes- -Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli – have begun the process of transferring inmates within the jails, and are working to ensuring more surveillance on specific prisoners to prevent a gang war in the backdrop of last week’s court shootout in which top gangster Jitender Maan alias Gogi was killed.At least two prisoners -- Rahul Kala and Sunil Rathi – known to be trouble makers in the Mandoli prison, according to jail officers – have been transferred. The jail officers did not share the places where they were transferred within the jail, citing security reasons.Since the afternoon of September 24, when Gogi was murdered by two gunmen of the gang of his arch-rival Tiilu Tajpuriya inside the Rohini court, jail officers have been asked to maintain a high alert within the prisons.Until his arrest in March 2020, Gogi, a resident of Alipur in outer Delhi, was the most wanted gangster in Delhi. He had at least 19 cases of murder, robbery, extortion and Arms act.The two transferred prisoners Rahul Kala and Sunil Rathi are both known for their allegiance to the Tillu gang.Kala, known to be the “hot-headed” one in the gang, is also the brother of top gangster Naveen Bali(also in jail). Bali and Neeraj Bawana, another top gangster of Delhi, work together. Rathi, on the other hand, was a top Uttar Pradesh(UP) gangster. He had allegedly shot dead another UP gangster Munna Bajrangi inside the Baghpat jail on July 9, 2018. Bajrangi was shot at least 10 time in his head inside the jail.Police suspect that all these people coordinated virtually, between Tihar, Mandoli and the Baghpat jail and arranged the contract killers to help Tillu finish his rivalry with Gogi.Across the three jail complexes, there are at least 20-25 alleged members of Gogi gang, and about 15-20 of the Tillu gang. Delhi Police have said that Sunil Maan alias Tillu Tajpuriya is their prime suspect. A Delhi police team on Thursday visited Mandoli jail, where Tillu was lodged and took him to the crime branch office in Rohini to interrogate him.Over the last one week, prison officers conducted an audit and checked the affiliation of all gangsters, who are lodged behind bars.“We coordinate with the police and also interview the prisoners to check for their affiliation. Though members of same gangs are not lodged together, we still conducted an audit and are now in the process of transferring them. Some will be transferred to high security, where they will be guarded round-the-clock and be under surveillance of the CCTV cameras,” a prison officer, who asked not to be named, said.In the last ten years, over two dozen people have died in the gang war between the Gogi and Tillu gangs. The arrested members of the two gangs are involved in cases of extortion, robbery, car jackings, and contract killings, according to the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rohini-court-shootout-to-avert-gang-war-inmates-being-relocated-in-city-jails-101633191762347.html

03-10-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz | How birds figure out things||The imperative of finding daily food and catering to the demands of raucous chicks leads birds to adapt fast and figure out things. Hawks in the US have learnt to zero in on garden bird feeders as they realise their prey, small birds, are bound to make regular forays. Nesting Black ibises in Udaipur not only made an improvised nest on an electricity tower. Faced with a paucity of their traditional wetland foods, the ibises started stealing pigeon chicks from nearby houses for their own chicks, a food source not known to be associated with the ibis. The ibis parents even discovered a nearby point where the Jains fed pigeons. Very innocently, the ibises would park themselves there and make off with adult pigeons. In a similar adaptation, Dusky eagle owls observed a nesting colony of Woolly-necked storks. Once the storks were done with breeding, the owls promptly occupied the empty stork nests and hatched their chicks as the nests suited them. The clever owls had obviated the need to make their own nests. Closer home at the Mote Majra pond near Banur, an Indian Pond heron speedily self-corrected its faulty “catch practises”. Perched on a lotus leaf in the water, the heron was trying to snap up Red-veined Darter dragonflies buzzing over it by thrusting upwards. The dragonflies were too fast and the heron incurred a dozen failed hunts. “However, the cravings of an empty stomach forced the heron to observe the dragonfly flight more carefully and modify tactics. Having observed that there were brief interludes in the dragonfly’s swift flights in which the insect either slowed down or hovered, the heron seized upon those particular moments as the widow of opportunity. The heron finally caught one during a slowed-down flight and then snapped up three more in quick succession by keeping a sharp eye on speed variations,” Chandigarh-based photographer, Vikas Salil Sharma, told this writer. Creepy to cryptic beautyThe Sukhna Lake Nature Trail that darts off delightfully opposite Nagar Van is frequented by a host of notables and humble folk. Chief justices, diplomats, editors, advisers, officers, lovers, politicians, and even the once-regular Aroosa Alam, Pakistani “friend” of then Punjab CM Amarinder Singh, have been spotted walking on this trail which meanders through scrubland forest. Sambars, peacocks, wild boars and umpteen birds are frequently encountered here. However, one creature has spooked all species of walkers, especially during humid months when they spawn in the hundreds. These are caterpillars hanging down on thin white threads from the invasive, alien species of Prosopis juliflora trees/shrubs flanking the trail. Caterpillars get attached to the clothes of unsuspecting walkers. Upon reaching home, these walkers find the creepy-crawlies all over them, leading to shrieks from awaiting kin and threats to disinfect and outcast them. However, back at the trail, the caterpillars that did not “go home” eventually metamorphosed into enigmatic Geometridae moths.During the day, these moths remain as still as mannequins and cling to tree barks in cryptic camouflage to avoid predator birds. Moths shed their stillness when the sun has safely slipped between the night’s sheets. They are like nightjar birds that perch perfectly still during the day, feathers merging with tree foliage or ground cover. Walkers certainly cannot miss the spectacle of caterpillars and larvae dangling over them like a veritable minefield. However, there is every chance of them missing out on the caterpillars’ subsequent manifestation: as moths right there, besides the trail, within an arm’s length, on the trees...and strictly non-sticky. vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-figuring-out-things-101633172739550.html

03-10-2021||World||‘Afghanistan’s situation only getting worse; need people on ground’: EU official||More than a month after the Islamist militant group Taliban recaptured Afghanistan, European Union’s (EU) foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Sunday that the situation in the country is only getting worse. “Afghanistan is experiencing a serious humanitarian crisis and a socio-economic collapse is looming, which would be dangerous for Afghans, the region and international security,” he wrote in a blog post.He stated that one of the early signs of a downfall is the interim government announced by the Taliban last month, which comprises no female member, and is “neither inclusive nor representative.” “And we have reports that women and girls are excluded from schools and universities, which goes against initial assurances from the Taliban,” Borrell added in the post.Ever since the Taliban took control of the country following the withdrawal of US-led forces after 20 years, old rules under the group that the Afghans, especially the girls and women have dreaded, were reported to be making a comeback. Girls are yet to continue education in the country, and women employees of the Kabul city government have been asked to “stay home.”In a latest report by AFP, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said that the group is “finalising things” and schools for girls will soon reopen. Furthermore, the women’s ministry in the previous Afghan cabinet has also been shut down, and replaced with “Ministries of Prayer and Guidance and the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice,” which the AFP report noted, earned notoriety for implementing strict religious doctrines under the Taliban’s previous reign."These positions are considered important for the functioning of the Emirate," Mujahid said, according to AFP. Also Read | Afghanistan on brink of collapse, Taliban fighters surviving on donation: ReportBorrell has urged the international community to keep people on ground in Afghanistan as well as focus on humanitarian workers. He added that the question is no longer which member EU states agree to a “minimal EU presence” in the war-torn nation, but “when and how.” “We are working on possible options, taking into account the security situation,” he wrote in the blog post. The EU has so far beefed up the humanitarian aid from 57 million euros to 200 million euros since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan, and along with other member states, it has pledged 677 million euros to assist the Afghans living in the country. (With inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistans-situation-only-getting-worse-need-people-on-ground-eu-official-101633284192127.html
03-10-2021||World||70% of media outlets in Afghanistan stopped working since Taliban's takeover||At least 70 per cent of media outlets have stopped working in Afghanistan since the Taliban took control over the country due to financial problems, National Association of Journalists s.The national association of journalists in a press conference in Kabul on Sunday, said that they found the statistics after conducting an online survey in 28 provinces of Afghanistan, Khamma Press reported.They said that 1,500 Afghan journalists had taken part in the survey.As per the statistics of the organization, 67 per cent of the Afghan journalists have lost their jobs and 33 per cent of them are busy working under acute pressure and in tough situations.The Head of the national association of journalists said Masroor Lutfi said that most of the Afghan media that are active are confronting dire economic and financial situations."40 per cent of the Afghan journalists are worried about their safety in Afghanistan and rest of them are living a difficult life as they have lost their jobs." Said Lutfi.The re-emergence of the Taliban in Afghanistan raised the concerns among many that journalists in the country would be targeted to silence dissent.Recently, two Afghan journalists were beaten in police custody after covering a protest by women in Kabul.At the first Taliban news conference on August 17 after the group took Kabul, their spokesperson, Zabiullah Mujahid, said that media will remain "free and independent," provided they work according to "Islamic principles," and are fair and serve "national interests."The Human Rights Watch said that Taliban authorities in Afghanistan have imposed wide-ranging restrictions on media and free speech that are already stifling criticism and dissent.Taliban security forces have also arbitrarily detained journalists and beaten several. The head of a journalists' advocacy group told Human Rights Watch that the Taliban have taken at least 32 journalists into custody since they took power in Kabul on August 15, the Human Rights Watch said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/70-of-media-outlets-in-afghanistan-stopped-working-since-taliban-s-takeover-101633281707939.html
03-10-2021||World||‘Tolerate your differences’: Angela Merkel, nearly in tears, calls to end east-west divide||Angela Merkel urged Germans on Sunday to forge a common future that draws on their diverse backgrounds, harking back to the 2015 decision to admit 1 million refugees that was a defining moment of her long chancellorship.Merkel appeared close to tears during an address to mark the 31st anniversary of reunification that may be the last before she steps down, although talks to build a new ruling coalition following last month's election could take months.She said the freedoms that came with German reunification 31 years ago had brought "so many new opportunities" for people from the former Communist East, where she grew up, but that many of them suddenly "found themselves in a dead end".With a voice that betrayed her emotion, she recalled how a journalist had written last year she "wasn't a true born German" after she told reporters in 2015 that "if we have to start apologising" for showing a friendly face during the refugee crisis, "then this is not my country"."Are there two kinds of Germans and Europeans - the original and the acquired, who have to prove their affiliation every day anew and can fail the exam with a sentence like the one in the press conference?" she asked.The 2015 refugee crisis, when Merkel opened Germany's doors to some 1 million migrants fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, was the most controversial act of her time in power and fuelled the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).Asking, "what is my country?", Merkel said "each and every individual must be able to feel heard and belong."She called for a Germany "in which we shape the future together", adding: "Be open to encounters, be curious about one another, tell each other your stories, and tolerate your differences. This is the lesson from 31 years of German unity."Merkel described her decision last year, on the 30th anniversary of Germany's reunification, to restrict civil liberties to curb the spread of the coronavirus as "one of the most difficult experiences" of her time as chancellor.Merkel took power in 2005 - when George W. Bush was U.S. president, Jacques Chirac in the Elysee Palace in Paris and Tony Blair British prime minister. She plans to step down once a new government is formed following last Sunday's elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tolerate-your-differences-angela-merkel-nearly-in-tears-calls-to-end-east-west-divide-101633278967504.html

Flights have already been stopped across Oman, which is located on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula.According to the weather forecast by India Meteorological Department (IMD), the cyclone would make landfall in Oman from the Arabian Sea around Sunday night. Along with it, the cyclone would pack wind gusts up to 110 kph (68 mph) on approaching Muscat, the sultanate’s capital.A public holiday was declared in Oman on Sunday and Monday, while the UAE went on high alert.Authorities have ordered people in the coastal areas to evacuate their homes. More than 2,700 people were put up in emergency shelters. Neighbouring United Arab Emirates (UAE) has also alerted residents on its eastern reaches to be prepared for the storm.“Authorities are on high alert to deal with the upcoming situation, and take all proactive and preventive measures to mitigate its impact,” a spokesperson was quoted as saying by Bloomberg at a media briefing.However, the storm is expected to weaken sharply after landfall.Flights to and from the capital city of Muscat have been delayed or cancelled ahead of the landfall, which is expected to bring very high winds and heavy rainfall. Roads would remain open only to emergency vehicles and those on humanitarian journeys until the storm dies down, authorities said.Meanwhile, Oman’s national emergency committee said the power supply would be cut in al-Qurm, located east of Muscat, to avoid untoward incidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/child-killed-as-cyclone-shaheen-approaches-oman-flights-rescheduled-101633256757215.html

He was travelling with his relatives in a sedan along a road in Police district 5 of Jalalabad city on Saturday evening when gunmen, who were in a rickshaw, opened fire on them.The source said that Saadat’s son and the driver of the sedan were injured in the shootout.No group has claimed responsibility for Saturday’s killings till now and the Taliban are probing the case, the source also told Xinhua.The incident comes weeks after a series of explosions that targeted Taliban vehicles in the Nangarhar province, killed three people and injured 20 others.Since the takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban last month, violence against journalists has been on the rise in the war-ravaged country. In recent days, press freedom organisations raised concerns over the ferocity against media professionals.Last month, the Taliban on September 7 had briefly detained some journalists in the capital city of Kabul during the anti-Pakistan protests. Some media reports claimed that the equipment of the journalists was also confiscated by the Islamic Emirate.And on the very next day, two journalists- Nematullah Naqdi and Taqi Daryabi, who work for the Etilaat Roz (Information Daily), were picked by Taliban enforces on September 8 as they were covering a women’s protest in Kabul.The journalists said that they were accused of organising the protest and were then beaten with batons, whops and electrical cables. “One of the Taliban put his foot on my head, crushed my face against the concrete.

The country still offered conditional talks with South Korea, in what some experts call an attempt to pressure Seoul to persuade Washington to relax crippling economic sanctions on it.Under multiple UN Security Council resolutions, North Korea is banned from engaging in any ballistic missile activities as the country aims to mount nuclear weapons on its ballistic missiles. North Korea has argued its nuclear program is meant to cope with US military threats, though Washington has said it has no hostile intent toward Pyongyang.Despite its recent launches, North Korea maintains a 2018 self-imposed moratorium on a long-range missile directly threatening the American homeland, a sign that it still wants to keep alive chances for future diplomacy with the US.US officials have urged North Korea to return to talks without preconditions, but the North has argued it won’t do so unless the Americans drop their "hostile policy,” in an apparent reference to the sanctions and regular military drills between Washington and Seoul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-threatens-top-un-body-against-crticising-its-missile-program-101633252576566.html
03-10-2021||World||Over thousand people show up at victory rally outside Kabul to back Taliban rule||More than 1,500 Taliban supporters attended a rally on Sunday in a vast field to the north of Kabul, in a show of strength as they consolidate their rule of Afghanistan.The crowd, exclusively men and boys, heard speeches by leading Taliban officials and commanders at Kohdaman township in the hilly outskirts of the capital.The rally was the first of its kind in the capital since the Islamist group seized control of the country seven weeks ago following a lightning offensive.Flanked by white and black Taliban standards and fighters in combat gear carrying assault rifles, the speakers addressed an audience sat in rows of chairs under awnings.As the event went on, more and more supporters arrived, leaving several hundred sitting to watch from chairs in the midday sun.Mawlawi Muslim Haqqani, the deputy minister of Hajj and Religious Affairs, hailed the Islamist hardliners' takeover, saying Christians and Westerners had been defeated.A string of men also railed against the United States, and one told the crowd to "respect elders" because they were the "mujahids who fought against the Soviets" in the 1980s.A speaker introduced as Rahmatullah, from nearby Mir Bacha Kot, said the Taliban's victory was "the result of those youths who stood in queues to register for suicide attacks".To kick off proceedings, a procession of fighters carrying flags and weapons -- including rocket launchers -- paraded around the crowd.Some of the mainly unarmed supporters waved homemade posters, while others sported red or white Taliban headbands.Tribal elders watched on cross-legged from the side of the stage.As people arrived, music honouring the Taliban's victories echoed around the site as dozens of heavily armed fighters in military combat fatigues stood guard."America is defeated, impossible, impossible -- but possible!" one song said.Some chanted pro-Taliban slogans as they drove down the dusty road on pick-up trucks to the site, as others shouted "Allahu Akbar" (God is greatest) when they walked into the shaded area in front of the stage.Women's protestsAt the turn-off towards the township, about 10 armed fighters lined the road beneath a large banner honouring a deceased Taliban commander and professing the "support of the people of Kohdaman for the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in the action of liberating the country".Last Thursday, the Taliban had violently cracked down on a small women's rights demonstration in eastern Kabul, firing shots into the air to disperse protesters.Then, gunmen pushed back the women protesters as they tried to continue with the demonstration, while a foreign journalist was hit with a rifle and blocked from filming.A Taliban fighter released a brief burst of gunfire into the air with his automatic weapon, AFP journalists saw.Isolated anti-Taliban rallies -- with women at the forefront -- were staged in cities around the country after the group seized power, including in the western city of Herat where two people were shot dead.But protests have dwindled since the government issued an order banning demonstrations that did not have prior authorisation, warning of "severe legal action" for violators.The handful that have gone ahead have been criticised as carefully orchestrated publicity stunts, including a rally at a Kabul university where hundreds of fully veiled women professed support for the new regime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-thousand-people-show-up-at-victory-rally-outside-kabul-to-back-taliban-rule-101633250772868.html

According to the NK News site, Kim Jong Un appeared at events of the Korean People’s Army from July 24 to July 27 and was also seen in footage of a war veterans conference and related programmes from July 27 to July 29.The images from these events show Kim Jong Un without the bandage about the size of a few postage stamps and in some a dark greenish spot or bruise on his head could be seen, NK News site reported. "The cause or nature of the large, dark green spot or bruise on the rear right side of his head, which was covered with a bandage in some footage, is still unknown and is difficult to diagnose using only images," it said.Also read | Propaganda value, optics behind thinner Kim Jong Un, say analystsNK News also said that the mark on Kim Jong Un's head was not seen at a politburo meeting on June 29 as it reported that photos of the 37-year-old leader released from an appearance with musicians on July 11 did not show the back of his head.The Yonhap News Agency reported on Tuesday that South Korea’s National Intelligence Service believes there have been no unusual signs regarding Kim Jong Un’s health. It cited lawmakers briefed by the spy agency, which added the patch was removed after a few days and there was no scar.This is not the first time that Kim Jong Un's injuries or health issues, which have been carefully controlled by state media outlets, have come out in the public. The latest photos come after a state media outlet in June cited a citizen as saying that North Koreans broke down in tears after seeing a dramatically thinner Kim after being absent for most of the previous month.In July, South Korean lawmaker Kim Byung-kee briefed by the National Intelligence Service said that Kim Jong Un lost between 10 and 20 kilogrammes but has no major health issues affecting his rule. “If there is an abnormality in his health, there should be signs that drugs are being imported to the clinic that’s in charge of Kim’s health, but that was not detected, adding that Kim Jong Un still hosts hours-long meetings and there’s nothing unusual about how he walks," the lawmaker said.Also read | Explained: Why Kim Jong Un’s weight issue is a talking point across the worldKim was absent from the public eye for six weeks in 2014 and reappeared walking with a cane, raising speculation he could be suffering from gout.A bandage was seen around his left wrist in November 2015 and a bandage around his finger in June 2019. During a May Day 2020 event at a fertiliser factory, Kim was seen with marks on his wrists fuelling speculation he may have undergone a medical procedure.

Women who have courageously come forward have felt betrayed.”The Canadian Press reported recently that the calls for his ouster from the ministry will be very difficult for Trudeau to ignore.The controversy started this year as then Chief of Defence Staff Jonathan Vance resigned in January amid allegations of impropriety of a sexual nature. Sajjan has come under severe criticism in this matter after the military ombudsman of the time revealed that the Defence Minister was informed about Vance’s alleged “improper conduct” with a subordinate in 2018. In May, an advisor to Trudeau testified before the House of Commons Defence Committee that she was aware of the allegations. There were accusations that Sajjan did not act against Vance due to their long relationship, as they had both served together in Afghanistan. Vance’s successor Admiral Art McDonald stepped aside less than a month-and-a-half into his term as he also faces an investigation by the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service. More such incidents have come to light since.Also Read: US charges Canadian jihadist who narrated Islamic State videosSajjan was censured by the House of Commons in a vote in June this year. He defended himself, saying, “We take all allegations very seriously, as I did and brought the immediate information to the appropriate officials.” Trudeau also supported him at the time saying Sajjan enjoyed his confidence.Sajjan was re-elected from Vancouver South with 49.4 per cent of the vote and a 10,000 margin over his closest opponent. Responding to media after his victory, he had said that he will serve in whatever role is assigned to him by Trudeau.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-harjit-sajjan-may-not-be-retained-as-canada-s-defence-minister-101633251177373.html

03-10-2021||World||50 days after occupation, no recognition for brutal Taliban regime in Kabul||Fifty days after the Sunni Pashtun terrorist force militarily occupied Kabul, there are no international takers for the Taliban with India putting the onus on the secrecy of Doha deal makers to take the first step towards recognition of the medieval Islamic regime. The so-called Doha Peace Process was between US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, now Taliban deputy prime minister Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, Qatari national security advisor Mohammed bin Ahmed Al Mesned, UK chief of defence staff Nick Carter and Pakistani army chief Qamar Jawed Bajwa. The details of the Doha process have not been shared with any other country. Behind the scenes, Russian presidential envoy to Afghanistan Zamir Kabulov and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi supported the Taliban takeover of Kabul.Since Pakistani ISI backed Sirajuddin Haqqani captured Kabul on August 15, the Taliban have formed an exclusive government with no space for neither the minorities nor women. Women have been pushed back to the medieval ages with Sharia law in force and large scale atrocities have been mounted on anyone perceived to be an enemy of the Taliban. Even the motto of the Afghan National Army has been changed and now resembles that of the Pakistan army.According to a Kabul watcher, no country wants to take lead in recognising the Taliban regime after all the commitments made and publicly voiced by Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar to the Doha process have been thrown out of the window. To add to this, the international community is now blaming the Doha deal makers for human rights abuses in Afghanistan as it was none other than UK CDS Carter who promoted the Taliban by calling them “country boys” and wanted the global community to give them space as the majority of the Taliban boys were born after the 9/11 attacks. “It may be that this Taliban is different Taliban from the one that people remember from the 1990s.”The tremendous miscalculation made by the Doha deal makers is evident from the fact that now even General Mark Milley, US chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, has changed his tune by calling the Taliban a terrorist group in bed with al Qaeda. The Taliban regime with ISI as mid-wife remain as medieval as in the past and have no qualms about undoing all that was done by the US-led coalition forces in the past 20 years. There is infighting within the Kabul regime with Taliban headed by Mullah Yaqoob on one side and Sirajuddin Haqqani on the other with Baradar having nowhere to go.While Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan praised the Taliban for breaking the shackles of (US) slavery on August 15, Islamabad is no longer happy with the situation with no country wanting to recognise the regime and the UN passing a stringent 2593 resolution on Afghanistan under the presidentship of India on August 30. Even Islamabad’s hope that the Taliban regime would force the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan to come to the table has failed as the latter terror group is simply not interested and has started to engage Rawalpindi again. To add to Islamabad’s misery is the fact that India heads the 1267 committee, responsible for designating and revoking terrorist labels and ensuing sanctions, in the UN by end of 2022.“It is for countries that are privy to the Doha accord which should recognize the Taliban regime first as no one is aware of the details of the agreement. After what has Taliban done to Afghanistan, these Doha countries have no right to question any other country on human rights abuses,” said a former foreign secretary.With no governance in Kabul, food and fuel supplies running short in Afghanistan, the Taliban terror regime is rapidly taking the already failed country to disaster. And the Doha peacemakers must share this burden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/50-days-after-occupation-no-recognition-for-brutal-taliban-regime-in-kabul-101633248103232.html

The site features hundreds of pavilions and other facilities on a showground twice the size of Monaco.French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, who visited Expo on Saturday, said France was "not part of" the European Parliament's resolution."Our relation with the UAE is a strategic one, it's very close, and we can say things in all transparency and if we need to say something to the UAE government, well we do so but behind closed doors," he told reporters.The event has drawn widespread criticism from human rights activists over poor treatment of the low-paid migrant laborers from Africa, Asia and the Middle East who keep the UAE's economy booming.(with inputs from AFP, AP)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-dead-70-injured-at-dubai-s-expo-2020-construction-site-report-101633238351319.html

Before that, the health pass was already required in museums, theatres, movies and all public events attended by over fifty people.Starting August 9, the pass became mandatory in restaurants, bars, shopping centres, airplanes and long-distance trains.The move caused widespread discontent among the French, and protests against the measure have been held every weekend since.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heres-why-thousands-are-protesting-across-france-101633234200921.html
03-10-2021||World||Philippines' Duterte says daughter will run for president in 2022 elections: Report||Philippine President Rodrigo's daughter would run for president in next year's election and her father's long-time aide, who filed his vice presidential candidacy, would be her running mate, broadcasting firm ABS-CBN news reported late on Saturday.Sara Duterte-Carpio is currently mayor of Davao, the Philippines' third-largest city, and filed on Saturday to run for mayor again. She has previously said she would not run for national office next year.ABS-CBN news based its report on an interview that Duterte had with a broadcast journalist right after he announced that he was retiring from politics while accompanying his closest loyalist, Senator Christopher "Bong" Go, who filed his vice presidential candidacy.He was asked: "So is it clear, Sara-Go?""It is Sara-Go," Duterte said in response.Duterte-Carpio, her spokesperson and Go did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.ABS-CBN news said it obtained permission from the broadcast journalist to use the video https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/10/02/21/duterte-sara-to-run-for-president-with-go-as-her-vp showing Duterte outside a hotel in Manila where the registration of candidates was taking place, and that a transcript was also provided.In the same clip, Duterte was asked when his daughter would file her candidacy for president, he said: "I really do not know. I do not have any idea at all".Asked if he had given his daughter permission to run for president, he said: "Ah, no, actually we don't talk about politics, ever since we never talk about politics. I would say that it is for the better," Duterte was quoted as saying.ABS-CBN said Duterte-Carpio's spokesperson, Mayor Christina Garcia Frasco responded "no comment" when asked about Duterte said.Duterte, 76, said on Saturday he was retiring from politics , a surprise move that fuelled speculation he was clearing the way for a presidential run by his daughter.He had been expected to run for the No. 2 job, a plan most Filipinos oppose as violating the spirit of the constitution which sets a one-term limit for the president to stop power being abused.Duterte-Carpio's mayorial re-election filing, did little to douse speculation she has her eye on the presidency.Political analysts were sceptical, noting that last-minute changes were still possible, as in 2015 when Duterte entered the presidential election race at the eleventh hour and won by a huge margin, and Duterte-Carpio, they said, could do the same.Candidates have until Oct. 8 to register, but withdrawals and substitutions are allowed until Nov. 15, leaving scope for last-minute changes of heart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-duterte-says-daughter-will-run-for-president-in-2022-elections-report-101633224125539.html

This year, it is being observed on October 4 across the world. The day is recognised by the United Nations and observed to reflect on the state or condition of towns and cities and promote the basic right to adequate shelter or housing for all.According to the UN, cities are responsible for around 70 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions with transport, buildings, energy and waste management accounting for the large bulk of urban greenhouse gas emissions. This day will amplify the global race to zero campaign and UN-Habitat’s ClimateAction4Cities and motivate local governments to develop actionable zero-carbon plans in the run-up to the international climate change summit COP26 in November this year.History of World Habitat DayIt was in 1985 that the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) decided to observe World Habitat Day as an annual event and designated the first Monday of October to be celebrated as World Habitat Day every year. World Habitat Day was first observed in 1986 with its theme as ‘Shelter is my right’. It was hosted by Nairobi, Kenya that year.Significance of World Habitat DayAccording to the United Nations, around 1.8 billion people were already living in slums and informal settlements, inadequate housing or in homelessness in cities across the world before the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. Amid the pandemic, the need of having a home has grown remarkably in order to make a safe environment for living, working and learning.World Habitat Day is observed in many nations across the globe to address the problems of rapid urbanisation and its impact on the environment and human poverty. The day also intends to remind the world of its collective responsibility for the future of the human habitat.Theme of World Habitat DayThe theme of this year’s World Habitat Day is accelerating urban action for a carbon-free world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-habitat-day-2021-know-its-history-significance-and-theme-101633218203291.html
03-10-2021||World||US charges Canadian jihadist who narrated Islamic State videos||A Canadian jihadist who fought for the Islamic State group and narrated violent propaganda videos has been taken into custody by the United States and charged, the Justice Department said Saturday.Mohammed Khalifa, who was born in Saudi Arabia, was captured during a firefight in January 2019 by Kurdish-dominated Syrian forces allied with the United States.The 38-year-old was handed over "recently" to US authorities and charged in Virginia with conspiring to provide material support to IS resulting in death, says a Justice Department statement.Khalifa left Canada in 2013 to join the Islamic State group in Syria, and by the next year had become a key member of its propaganda team because of his fluent English and Arabic, according to the statement.He allegedly served as a lead translator in Islamic State propaganda production and as the English-speaking narrator on two violent recruitment videos.The cell was behind videos showing the beheadings of foreigners including the US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, who died in 2014.He faces a possible life sentence in the United States. Canada additionally hopes to charge him, according to media there.The Canadian government said it was in contact with local authorities on the matter and that its federal police were aware "that he will be facing charges" in the United States.In an exchange of emails cited in the charge sheet, Khalifa defended the IS killings he was associated with."Mohammed Khalifa not only fought for ISIS on the battlefield in Syria, but he was also the voice behind the violence," said Acting US Attorney Raj Parekh for the Eastern District of Virginia, using another acronym for the Islamic State group.According to the indictment, Khalifa's "primary focus" was "enticing ISIS supporters to travel to ISIS-controlled areas to join ISIS or to conduct attacks in the West, including in the United States."The jihadist group, classified as a terrorist organization by US authorities, is responsible for a wave of deadly attacks in Western countries.Its emergence prompted intervention by a US-led international military coalition, which succeeded in defeating the self-proclaimed "caliphate" even though IS is still present in many additional countries, particularly in Africa and Asia, and continues to pose a threat according to US and European intelligence services.- 'Glorified' murders, cruelty -In a 2019 interview with Canada's CBC from his Syrian prison, Khalifa showed no regret for his actions. He said he wanted to return to Canada with his wife and their three children, but on the condition that he would not be tried there."Through his alleged leading role in translating, narrating, and advancing ISIS's online propaganda, Khalifa promoted the terrorist group, furthered its worldwide recruitment efforts, and expanded the reach of videos that glorified the horrific murders and indiscriminate cruelty of ISIS," Parekh said.This is the first known indictment of a foreign IS fighter in America since President Joe Biden took power in January.Two members of the notorious Islamic State kidnapping cell dubbed the "Beatles," Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, are currently in the hands of US authorities after being transferred to the United States from Iraq nearly a year ago.The pair are accused of involvement in the murders of Foley and Sotloff, as well as those of relief workers Peter Kassig and Kayla Mueller.Kotey, a former British national who was stripped of his citizenship, pleaded guilty in early September to charges of conspiring to murder the four American hostages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-charges-canadian-jihadist-who-narrated-islamic-state-videos-101633217837480.html
03-10-2021||World||Thousands in Brazil protest against President Bolsonaro, seek his impeachment||With Brazil’s presidential election one year away, tens of thousands of demonstrators marched Saturday in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and dozens of other cities around the country to protest President Jair Bolsonaro and call for his impeachment over his government’s handling of the pandemic.The protests, smaller than those in support of Bolsonaro last Sept. 7, were promoted by leftist parties and some union movements linked to the former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s Worker´s Party. Da Silva is widely expected to run against Bolsonaro in Brazil's Oct. 2, 2022 presidential election.Saturday’s protest targeted the president for his mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Bolsonaro, who is not vaccinated and doesn’t usually wear a mask, has underestimated the severity of the virus and promoted crowds during the pandemic. Some 597,000 have died of Covid-19 in Brazil, a country of 212 million people. Demonstrators also protested surging inflation in mainstays like food and electricity.“It is very painful to see that health and education are being destroyed, and there are many starving people in the country,” Marilena Magnano, a 75-year-old retiree, told The Associated Press. “We need Bolsonaro out of the government, his time has passed”.The president’s approval ratings have steadily declined throughout the year, but he remains far more popular than prior presidents who were impeached - most recently Dilma Rousseff of the Workers Party in 2016.Over 130 impeachment requests have been filed since the start of Bolsonaro’s administration, but the lower house’s speaker, Arthur Lira, and his predecessor have declined to open proceedings. Division among the opposition is the key reason analysts consider it unlikely there will be enough pressure on Lira to open impeachment process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-in-brazil-protest-against-president-bolsonaro-seek-his-impeachment-101633215185060.html

03-10-2021||India||Over 150 years later, Guwahati’s British-era DC Bungalow is now a heritage centre||Nearly 150 years after it was constructed to serve as the residence of the British deputy commissioner of Kamrup, the iconic DC Bungalow of Guwahati, was on Sunday opened to the public as a heritage centre. Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu, who is in Assam as part of a three-day tour to the northeast, inaugurated the Mahabahu Brahmaputra River Heritage Centre in the presence of Governor Jagdish Mukhi and Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. The Vice President called for a national campaign to rejuvenate the country’s rivers and suggested that “we save our rivers with a sense of immediacy”. “In the past, our villages and cities used to be dotted with several water bodies. In the quest for modernization, man, driven by greed, has destroyed natural ecosystems and at several places, the water bodies have virtually disappeared or have been encroached upon,” he said. In a detailed Facebook post later, Naidu praised the effort to covert the bungalow into a heritage property and commented on its beauty. “This is where the great warrior Lachit Barphukan made a decisive attack on the Mughals and forced them to return….Transforming this bungalow into Brahmaputra River Heritage Centre is a mark of respect for this vast river that nourished the civilisation here for centuries,” he wrote. Located atop Barphukanar Tilla, a small hillock named after the most famous Ahom general Lachit Barphukan, it is the site from where the Ahom forces planned and launched attacks on the Mughal army during the Battle of Saraighat in 1671, which the latter lost. “After the British annexed Assam in 1826 (after the Treaty of Yandaboo), the post of DC was created for Guwahati in 1839. But the city had no appropriate house at that time to accommodate Captain James Matthie, the first DC,” said a state government release. “Several sites were surveyed before Barphukanar Tilla on the banks of the Brahmaputra, where cannons used in the Battle of Saraighat lay scattered, was chosen. Post-independence, it continued to be the DC’s bungalow until 2011,” the release added. Though the exact date of when the bungalow was completed is not known, it is believed to be sometime in the 1850s. A project to convert it into a heritage museum was later taken up under the Brahmaputra Riverfront Development plan. The heritage centre has on display the heritage of boats, an amphitheatre, an exhibition space, a cafeteria etc. The other attractions include a collection of traditional fishing equipment, photographs and artifacts related to the history of Guwahati and river transport. The bungalow has installations depicting the textile designs, ethnic motifs and indigenous musical instruments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-150-years-later-guwahati-s-british-era-dc-bungalow-is-now-a-heritage-centre-101633281421630.html

He was delivering his farewell address to the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Council. The Premier was cheered as he made the announcement. He said he was giving these directives to his successor Government who would introduce appropriate constitutional amendments in the next session of the State Legislature. He also favoured the integration of the Kashmir National Conference with the Indian National Congress and characterized his becoming a Congress member as a first step in this direction. He was relinquishing office to work in a larger field as a Congressman. Accession final Outlining his achievements during his 10-year rule as Premier, Bakshi said the State had been brought much nearer to the Union as a result of extension of the jurisdiction of the Election Commission, the Supreme Court and the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India to Kashmir, abolition of customs barriers as well as permit system, regulating the entry of persons into the State and integration of State services with all-India services. Kashmir’s accession to India ratified by the State Constituent Assembly on Feb. 6, 1954, was now irrevocable and nobody on earth could bring about any change in this relationship, he asserted. He said a decision had also been taken providing for direct election of Kashmir’s representatives to Parliament “as soon as the emergency was over.” Enumerating the measures introduced to make the State internally strong, Bakshi said landlordism had been abolished, rural indebtedness scaled down by 51 per cent, compulsory levy on landowners done away with, rehabilitation of lakhs of people from Pak-occupied Kashmir had almost been completed and a high power anti-corruption commission had been set up in the State. Earlier, replying to the debate on industrial policy, Bakshi conceded that failure of public sector industries had been mainly due to running them “Just like other Government departments instead of on commercial lines.” He declared that Kashmir would be guided by the industrial policy resolution of the Union Government.Industrial policy He assured equal treatment to public, private and co-operative sectors of industry. He said he was stepping down as Premier with his head high and a sense of confidence that what he promised to people on assuming office in August, 1953, he had been able to fulfil. The Premier said he would not be able to sit in the House any more but would be watching their activities with unabated interest. He felt his successor-whom he did not name-and his colleagues had the capacity and the calibre to “carry forward this small State full of numerous, complicated problems.” Mr Sheo Narayan Fotedar, Chairman of the Council, felicitated the Premier on his “glorious achievements.” He said he had never seen any Kashmir Premier, except the late Mr Gopalaswamy Ayyangar, to lay down the office at the peak of his glory in such calm, cool and complacent manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-october-4-1963-governor-cm-for-kashmir-bakshi-ghulam-mohammed-envisages-greater-unity-101633281420370.html

Initially, there were some concerns with 'Delta ', but later on we have found this is the part of the lineage which we call as AY (there are 1 to 13). Though new sub lineages coming up but none of them have been found to be either more infection or more virulent bit they are under constant watch," Dr Arora told ANI.However, the Delta variant of Covid-19 continuing to remain as the main VOC in India.The current status of VOC/VOI is found to be distributed in 459 districts across all 36 States and Union Territories of the country. The SARS-CoV-2 VOC/VOls detected in community samples are Delta- 25,164, AY series- 4143, Kappa and B.1.617.3 is 5364, Alpha-3,655, Beta- 102 and Gamma-1.The cumulative number of samples with pangolin lineage till the month of September is 60,043.A further categorisation shows that 54,865 community samples were taken and 5,178 samples were of travellers. The total VOC/VOI is 39,283 with amounts to 65.4 in proportion.Dr Arora added, "In addition, the country is constantly picking up samples from all over the country and there is a constant vigil to see that if anything of concern arises, prompt action will be taken. These days whenever there is a virus sample is picked up within three/ four weeks we know the status. Time-lapse between picking up the sample and the complete process has been shortened. We have sufficient capacity and have also prepared ourselves."Significantly along with government labs, private labs could also do sampling, he noted."In addition, to the current labs capacity if required we can get the sample done from private sectors as vendors as there is a huge private sector capacity also," said Dr Arora.In the month of December, 10 genome sequencing labs were made under a consortium, INSACOG. This has recently been expanded in the last three months to 28 labs with a monthly capacity of 80,000 samples that can be sequenced.There has also been no change as far Delta variant is concerned from a global perspective also which includes B.1.617.2 (AY) and AY.x sublineages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-new-covid-19-variant-of-concern-in-india-dr-nk-arora-101633277752953.html
03-10-2021||India||Farm-income growth slowing in food-bowl Punjab, indicates data||Farm incomes in food-bowl Punjab are growing at a much slower pace than some traditionally poorer states, as new data suggest agriculture in the state has hit an immutable law of economics: diminishing returns. Punjab propelled India’s Green Revolution five decades ago, rescuing millions from hunger. But the gains are fast eroding. Experts say the income slowdown is linked to an overdependence on big cereals, such as wheat and rice. A slower pace of farm income growth in Punjab is borne out by the Situation Assessment of Agricultural Households 2018-19 (SAS), a national survey of farm incomes released recently. Although Punjab’s farmers lead the country in terms of absolute levels of monthly income, farm income not adjusted for inflation in the state annually grew 6.73% in a span of six years between 2013-14 and 2018-19, the survey shows. In contrast, farm incomes in states such as Bihar and Uttarakhand grew much faster at 13.3% and 19.3% in the corresponding period, albeit over a low base. Cheap fertilisers, assured minimum support price (MSP) for cereals, free electricity for drawing water and high-yielding seeds have, over the decades, spurred a trend of ‘mono-cropping’, or the practice of growing mainly rice in summer and wheat in winter. This has robbed Punjab’s farmers potential income that could have come from growing a more diverse set of crops, research shows. MSP or minimum support price is a floor price set by the government. The government ‘procures’ or buys paddy and wheat at MSP to build stockpiles for redistribution to the poor. This has increased farmers’ dependence on cereals. A widespread farmers agitation since last year against the Modi government’s three new farm laws and demand by the protesting cultivators for a legal guarantee for MSP has only prompted authorities to step up procurement of cereals even more. The government bought a record 60.06 million tonne of rice grown in the summer-sown kharif season in 2020, the highest quantity ever. This procurement policy, which incentivises big cereals, has caused Punjab’s rich landscape of corn, barley, gram, lentils and nutritious coarser cereals to disappear within a decade of big cereals entering the state in the late-1960s. The number of crops grown by Punjab’s farmers has declined from 21 in the 1960s to just about nine, according to data cited by Prof. Surinder S. Jodhka of Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, in a recent paper (https://bit.ly/3ov38XI). “The Green Revolution was actually a brown revolution. It was limited to rice and wheat,” said Uma Kapila, an economist who formerly taught at Delhi’s Miranda House. Punjab’s average farm gross domestic product has plateaued around 2%, while it could have been grown over 5% annually if only farmers had not given up cultivating a more diverse set of crops, according to a research by economists Ashok Gulati and Siraj Hussain of the think-tank ICRIER. The state’s agricultural GDP, a broad measure of farm income, grew only 1.61% annually, less than half the all-India average of 3.5% between 2005-06 and 2014-15, Gulati’s research shows. The paddy boom is partly responsible for a severe winter smog across much of northern India, as farmers set fire to paddy-crop residue, known as stubble, to clear fields. Punjab takes about 5,500 litres of water to grow one kg of rice, five times as much China uses, pointing to the state’s low water productivity. Northern and central districts are severely water depleted, while south-western districts face water logging and soil salinity or alkalinity. Districts such as Muktsar, Fazilka, Bathinda and Faridkot are notoriously degraded. The Central Ground Water Board put out a dire warning in May last year: at the current rate of water extraction, Punjab would be a desert within the next quarter century. The state has never been able to implement an agenda of crop diversification first chalked out by the so-called S.S. Johl committee in 1986,” said KS Mani, a former faculty at the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. Paddy has meant a groundwater extraction rate of 165%, a jump of 16 percentage points since 2013. “I have moved from shallow tubewells to six deep tubewells on my 12 acres. My expenses are going up because I have to dig deeper and deeper every year,” says Ravinder Uppal, a paddy grower in Sangrur. Big cereals have stoked an insidious rise in costs, annually growing by 5-6% and pushing farmers into debt, says Balwinder Singh Sandhu, the state’s agricultural commissioner. The increase in paddy MSP has barely kept pace with rising costs, if a measure of cultivation known as “C2 cost” is factored in, which includes the imputed rental value of land, depreciation and interests on capital. Increasing the share of capital, such as mechanised harvesters and investment, is necessary for growth. But pumping more and more capital without technological advancements can lead to what Nobel winning economist Robert Solow demonstrated to be a “steady economic state”, where all new investment goes into replacing exhausted capital without productivity gains. The economy stalls as a result. Punjab’s agriculture is right in the middle of such a stagnation, as the Green Revolution has run its course. “Why else are 1.5 lakh people migrating abroad every year?” asks Sandhu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmincome-growth-slowing-in-food-bowl-punjab-indicates-data-101633276859919.html

03-10-2021||India||Eight killed in violence during protest against ministers in UP’s Lakhimpur Kheri: Police||Eight people including four farmers died in violence that broke out in Lakhimpur Kheri district of Uttar Pradesh on Sunday after a protest to block UP deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya’s visit to Banbirpur village, a senior police officer at police headquarters in Lucknow said.Violence and arson broke out after eight people were feared dead when a jeep allegedly ran over protesting farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri district of Uttar Pradesh on Sunday afternoon, police officials said.In a tweet, Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait claimed that the farmers were attacked when they were returning after staging a protest against the Centre’s new farm laws. He also alleged that people in the convoy opened fire.He further claimed that some people died and many were injured in the incident. Tikait said that he was going to Lakhimpur Kheri and would be likely to reach by midnight.Taking serious cognisance of the incident, UP police’s additional director general (ADG) (Law and Order) Prashant Kumar, along with other senior officials, have been rushed to the spot to control the situation.Kumar, who was on the way to the spot, said he could confirm the deaths and the exact situation only after reaching the site. He said heavy police deployment had already been done in the Tikonia area to avert any further trouble.Tikonia is nearly 70 kilometres from the Lakhimpur Kheri district headquarters and very close to the India-Nepal border.A local police official said the violence broke out minutes ahead of UP deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya’s visit to Banbirpur village under Tikonia police station limits. He said the incident took place on Tikonia-Banbirpur road when the farmers, who were agitating against the new farm laws and had blocked the road to oppose the deputy CM’s visit, got infuriated after two SUVs reportedly belonging to BJP workers hit them, leaving a number of farmers seriously injured.He said the farmers in retaliation overturned and set on fire two SUVs, besides thrashing people in the convoy.The deputy CM had to cancel his visit to Banbirpur village, where he was to inaugurate an annual wrestling competition, which is organised by Kheri MP and Union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni in memory of his father late Ambika Prasad Mishra.Following the incident, Congress general secretary and UP in-charge Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, in a tweet, said: “How much hatred BJP harbours against farmers in the country? Don’t they have a right to live? If they raise their voices, then you will open fire on them? Run them over by vehicles? Enough is enough...This is the country of farmers, and not a fiefdom of BJP ideology...Farmers’ satyagrah will get stronger, farmers’ voice will get louder.”The Samajwadi Party will send a delegation of party leaders to Lakhimpur Kheri to probe the incident.Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav in a tweet in Hindi said running over farmers who were peacefully protesting the farm law (three new central farm laws) by the son of a Union minister of state was inhuman and cruel...UP will not tolerate atrocities by arrogant BJP members...and if this state of affairs continue then in UP BJP members will not be able to travel in vehicles or get out of them.In another tweet Akhilesh said that he could speak a bit to the seriously hurt farmer leader Tejender Singh Virk...the government should give him best of medical treatment...and there’s only one demand--- that the chief minister should resign.Internet services too have been partially banned in Lakhimpur Kheri district after the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eight-dead-in-up-s-lakhimpur-kheri-after-jeep-runs-over-protesting-farmers-101633273679900.html
03-10-2021||India||West Bengal by-poll: 'Gracefully accept the outcome,' says BJP after Mamata-led TMC sweeps all 3 constituencies||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday said it "gracefully accepts" the outcome of the three assembly by-polls in West Bengal, adding that the results are "not in line with the expectations" of the party. The statement comes as Mamata Banerjee-Trinamool Congress (TMC) secured a landslide victory in the Bhabanipur constituency, while in Jangipur and Samserganj too, TMC emerged as the winner.According to the Election Commission of India, Mamata Banerjee secured 85,263 votes. Banerjee's main rival candidate, Priyanka Tibrewal of BJP, got 26,428 votes. At third was CPI (M) candidate Srijib Biswas, who secured 4,226 votes."After being demolished in Nandigram, Mamata Banerjee may have survived in Bhabanipur for now, but it has never happened that a losing candidate chose to thrust herself as the chief minister, in violation of all democratic norms and proprietary," the statement read.It also alleged that the by-elections were declared "at the behest of Mamata Banerjee's government" amidst the prevailing Covid-19 situation and the post-poll violence. "The elections were held under an overbearing state administration, with the dark shadow of fear, intimidation and gloom of the post-poll violence hanging over the electorate," the BJP said in the statement.BJP also alleged partiality by the state administration during the elections campaign and claimed that the BJP candidate was stopped at various places in the poll-going constituency, "disregarding the basic right of an election candidate to reach out to one's electorate".It said the "polls, particularly in Bhabanipur, were marred by rampant fake voting". "BJP candidates even apprehended such voters, but were allowed to escape under supervision of Kolkata police under political pressure from the TMC," BJP claimed.The by-poll at Bhabanipur was necessitated after Sovandeb Chattopadhyay, who originally won the seat in the assembly elections held this year, vacated the seat to facilitate Banerjee's continuity in the CM post following her defeat in Nandigram.Banerjee lost to her former aide Suvendu Adhikari by a close margin of 1,956 votes from the Nandigram constituency in the assembly elections. As the TMC came back with a thumping majority, Banerjee was sworn in as the chief minister for the third time. However, as per the Constitution, Mamata had to win on any seat in the state to have the chance of becoming a member of the state assembly. In fact, she had to win before November 5 to remain the chief minister’s position.The BJP also said that it will "continue to fight the regressive politics of TMC". "The resilient BJP party workers will continue to fight tooth and nail against such democratic irregularities and won't stop till rule of law is restored in West Bengal," it stated.In the statement, the BJP also quoted Swami Vivekananda, and said, "Arise, awake and stop not till the goal is reached."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-by-poll-gracefully-accept-the-outcome-says-bjp-after-mamata-led-tmc-sweeps-all-3-constituencies-101633273306109.html

The winning margin in the bypoll was higher than the 2019 assembly poll.Biswokeshan Harichandan Mohapatra of Congress forfeited his security deposit as he could not poll the mandatory 1/6th of the total votes polled fuelling demands of resignation of PCC chief Niranjan Patnaik.An elated Rudra Pratap Maharathy said after the demise of his father, the people of Delang-Pipili were waiting for an MLA for around one year. “The voters are my malik (Lord) and I am their sevak (servant). I am not here for celebration; rather I will focus on work. My priority will be to complete the pending work initiated by my late father and will reach out to common people to address their issues,” said Maharathy.Odisha education minister Samir Ranjan Dash said the victory has now proved that the charisma of people’s CM Naveen Patnaik is still intact among the masses due to his pro-people policies.Bypolls to the picturesque assembly constituency was required after its sitting BJD MLA Pradip Maharathy succumbed to Covid-19 in October 2020. The bypoll scheduled on April 17 had to be postponed after the demise of Congress candidate Ajit Mangaraj just three days before the election was due to happen. The bypoll was again rescheduled to May 16 after Congress fielded Bishwokeshan Harichandan Mohapatra as their candidate. However, on May 4, the Election Commission deferred the bypolls as the state went into Covid-19 lockdown amid rising cases till last month, when the EC decided to hold the election on September 30.BJD had fielded deceased MLA Pradip Maharathy’s son Rudra Pratap Maharathy, an administrative officer in a city-based management institute while BJP had fielded Asrit Pattanayak who contested unsuccessfully against Pradip Maharathy in the 2019 assembly polls. Congress nominated Biswokeshan Harichandan Mohapatra, an advocate and former district president of Congress Seval Dal.The Pipili bypoll victory is significant for BJD as this was the first major election in which the party candidate won despite Naveen Patnaik not campaigning. It is also the last major polls ahead of the panchayat polls scheduled in February next year and urban body polls due to be held soon after. Last year, the BJD had won the bye-election to two assembly constituencies of Balasore Sadar and Tirtol following the death of the sitting MLAs there.BJD had stationed at least a dozen ministers and two dozen MLAs in the constituency at the panchayat level to woo the voters. The BJP campaign was led by Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan and party spokesperson Sambit Patra.

His remark came a month after he held an important meeting with the governments of these states regarding the action plan to reduce air pollution caused due to stubble burning.Speaking to reporters, Yadav said that talks were held in September over the implementation of action plans by Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to reduce pollution due to stubble burning and other factors including vehicular pollution, dust, construction and demolition waste. The environment minister added that with regard to the machinery needed to deal with stubble burning, the Union agriculture ministry allocated nearly ₹7,000 crores to these states.Farmers from Haryana and Punjab and some other states set their farmlands on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue left after harvesting and before cultivating crops such as wheat and potato.While farmers in Delhi burn only 1% of stubble, the smoke from stubble burning in Haryana and Punjab contributes majorly to the air pollution in the national Capital and the NCR region during winters. In Delhi, the government has come up with solutions such as the odd-even system for private vehicles on roads and issuing restrictions on construction activities to ensure the air quality doesn’t degrade.Bhupendra Yadav told reporters on Sunday that with the availability of technology, there is the economic viability of stubble at present. He said the NTPC previously floated a tender to purchase farm stubble for use as fuel at power plants. Some private organisations too came up with experiments by which stubble or crop residue can be turned into manure, Yadav also said.Last week, the Delhi government developed a bio-decomposer solution in association with the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, to combat stubble burning in the national capital. Once sprayed into the farmlands, the solution decomposes the stubble into compost in 15-20 days.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on September 24 that the solution costs less than ₹1,000 per acre and it will be entirely borne by the government. He also urged neighbouring Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab to support their farmers by providing them with the bio-decomposer solution.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stubble-burning-bhupendra-yadav-says-states-cooperating-constructively-101633271617573.html

India recognises the urgency of strong climate action to stay within the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement,” Yadav was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. “India has taken many steps on clean energy, energy efficiency and biodiversity. We have set an ambitious renewable energy target of 450 gigawatts by 2030,” Yadav stressed while speaking on India’s climate action plan ahead of the United Nations climate change conference (COP26) scheduled in Glasgow, Scotland in November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/got-positive-help-from-punjab-haryana-on-stubble-burning-environment-minister-101633268657940.html

Ahmed, who was arrested by Panbazar police in Guwahati from the MLA’s hostel under Sections 153 and 153A of IPC for promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc., was remanded to police custody by the court of chief judicial magistrate. “The police had sought 10 days custody of the MLA, but following our arguments, the court decided to send him for two days of police remand,” a lawyer representing Ahmed told journalists outside the court. Last week, the Congress MLA from Baghbar had justified the killing of 8 people in Darrang district, near the same place where the recent eviction drive took place, around four decades back at the height of the state-wide agitation against illegal infiltrators. Those killed are regarded as martyrs in Assam. On Sunday, the Assam Congress legislature party (CLP) recommended disciplinary action against Ahmed for “repeatedly violating party discipline”. The party had earlier issued a show cause notice to the MLA for “damaging the party’s image” ahead of by-polls in the state and also for “giving communally sensitive comments with the intent to destroy social harmony”. “I have received the recommendations of the CLP seeking disciplinary action against Ahmed. We will be meeting on Sunday evening to take a decision on that. In the meantime, we are also waiting for his reply to the show cause notice,” Assam Pradesh Congress Committee president Bhupen Kumar Borah said. Two people had died and nearly 20 others including 11 policemen were injured in the eviction drive carried out on September 23 at Dholpur-3 village in Darrang district. The district administration have evicted around 1200 families in the area who were residing on government land for decades in order to implement an ambitious agriculture project in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-mla-held-in-assam-for-provocative-comments-remanded-to-police-custody-101633268519912.html

RSS workers are trying to mislead our MLAs. They targeted the Madhya Pradesh government, which led to its collapse. In Punjab, they did the same. They've adapted the divide and rule policy,” the Congress leader from Chhattisgarh was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The attack comes at a time when several Congress MLAs from Chhattisgarh are joining their colleagues in the national capital. More than 35 party MLAs are currently stationed in Delhi after visiting Rajghat and Vijay Ghat on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti.Although chief minister Bhagel said there was no political movement involved, reports of infighting in Chhattisgarh Congress have attested to the possibility that the grand old party in the state is split between two camps -- one led by the chief minister and the other by state health minister TS Singh Deo -- something we have already witnessed in Punjab.“Earlier, RSS workers tried to destabilize the Chhattisgarh government. Now they are provoking TS Singh Deo. But he is an intelligent and sensible leader, he will not fall for BJP's conspiracy,” said Brihaspat Singh.However, Bhupesh Baghel seems to have secured the post of Chhattisgarh Chief Minister at least for now with his appointment as the All India Congress Committee (AICC) senior observer for the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/desi-angrez-chhattisgarh-mla-slams-bjp-rss-for-destabilising-congress-101633264406272.html

In a media statement, Nath, who is 12-years older than Chouhan, said, "there is a lot of debate over my health. Shivraj ji is saying that Kamal Nath ji is sick and old. Shivraj ji, I throw a challenge to you, come let us have a race."Nath's challenge comes as 62-year-old Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader repeatedly made remarks about his health and claimed that he is resting in Delhi.Further clarifying on the same, Nath also said that he was in Delhi for work and not because he is unwell. "I have many responsibilities (of the Congress) to discharge. This does not mean I was in Delhi because I was unwell and resting," news agency PTI quoted him as saying."I did go for my post-Covid check-up because I had pneumonia - which anyone can have," Nath also said, adding, "I got all the tests done. All reports came out good."Both Chouhan and Nath have contracted the viral Covid-19 in the past and recovered successfully. Chouhan was infected by the virus last year, was discharged from a private hospital after being hospitalised for 11 days.Meanwhile, reacting to the challenge, Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta in Madhya Pradesh, said it is an "apt reply to chief minister Chouhan." He "was repeatedly needling Nathji that he had grown old, sick and resting in Delhi. Chouhan should keep in mind that he has been defeated in the 2018 MP Assembly poll race by Nathji," PTI quoted Gupta as saying.The BJP's senior leader Deepak Vijayavargiya also reacted to the challenge and took a swipe at Congress, saying, "The BJP runs races for the development and well being of people." He also said Congress sits in "drawing rooms and runs races on Twitter and falls."Nath is currently in Bhopal. He will leave for the national capital on Sunday along with the list of candidates for the October 30 by-polls to three Assembly seats and one Lok Sabha constituency in Madhya Pradesh.Nath became the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh in December 2018, however, his government lasted for only 15 months after it collapsed in March 2020 with the resignation of 22 MLAs of the then ruling Congress.

Unconfirmed reports say that the male tiger said to be over 12-years-of age has killed four people in a week while forest officials confirm two such human deaths. Since the region has three more tigers, the forest team has identified eccentric stripes on the tiger for identification. Some of the forest department staffers were perched on treetops for at least six hours. “We put up a bait under the tree to lure the tiger towards us to tranquilize him but it was sighted only once in the morning and now he is inside the forest patch in Masinagudi,” said an officer of the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, not wishing to be named. “Except for his age, nothing will slow his movement and IQ down. The tiger is moving nicely and smartly so that he’s not sighted.” The search operations were suspended at 6 pm at the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, home to 103 tigers.“More than 75 of us are on the ground. The aim is to capture the tiger alive without harming him by using tranquilizer darts,” said another forest official. There are elaborate measures on the ground to capture the tiger. Five cages have been placed in vital locations. Special teams including forest veterinarians have been formed under the supervision of the conservator of forests and the field director of the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve. “Highly trained forest personnel including officers from Kerala’s forest division in Wayanad district have been brought in,” said the officer. Drones and sniffer dogs are also part of the search operations. The tiger has not been declared as a man-eater but as “problematic” and as an animal that has “become very dangerous to human life in the area”. These declarations require field evidence according to the standard operating procedures for dealing with emergency arising due to straying of tigers in human dominated landscapes laid out by the National Tiger Conservation Authority in January 2013. Also Read: VTR can accommodate 60-65 tigers, says chiefTamil Nadu chief wildlife warden Shekar Kumar Niraj issued an order on Friday to hunt the tiger under Section 11 (1) (a) of Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. The tiger is present in the human habitation of Gudalur and has been preying on livestock too since July 2021. Since then, various teams have tried to capture the tiger but haven’t succeeded and the tiger has been elusive. “The presence of thick tea bushes, inclement weather, challenging terrain and disturbances by the local public had rendered the capture operation very difficult,” Niraj said.Forest officials said that people in the area have been protesting demanding either the capture or killing of the tiger. On Friday, as per the reports from conservator of forests and field director, Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, it was confirmed that the tiger killed one person in the Masinagudi area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plan-to-catch-mudhumalai-tiger-alive-even-as-it-evades-traps-101633260898293.html

The south Kolkata constituency with 2,06,389 voters, however, saw a low voter turnout of 53.32% during the bypolls.At the end of the 21st round of counting of votes polled for the Bhabanipur byelection, Mamata Banerjee secured 85,263 votes while Priyanka Tibrewal clinched 26,428 votes, including the postal ballots. CPM's Shrijeeb Biswas managed to bag only 4,226 votes to come a distant third.According to the Election Commission, Mamata has secured 71.9% of the votes polled in the Bhabanipur assembly constituency while Priyanka Tibrewal managed only 22.29%.Supporters of Trinamool Congress broke into celebrations outside the residence of Mamata Banerjee as early trends showed their leader inching towards a clear victory.Expressing her gratitude towards the people of her constituency, Mamata Banerjee asked her party workers to help the flood-affected people in districts in the form of celebration."I thank the people of Bhawanipore and people of this state and the country who had been waiting for this election result. Our victory inspires me to work more for people. If our workers want to celebrate, they should do so by helping the flood-affected people in the districts. That will be the real celebration," Mamata Banerjee said during an impromptu meeting with the supporters and the media outside her house.Early trends throughout the day as well as roundwise data by the Election Commission showed Mamata Banerjee leading with a comfortable margin from the beginning.As many as 1,453 — or 1.23 % of the total votes polled — went to NOTA which was more than the votes secured by the nine other candidates in the fray. While six of them are independent candidates, three represent the Bahujan Maha Party, Bharatiya Nyay Adhikar Raksha Party and the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular).Mamata Banerjee said the electorate of Bhowanipore has voted for her despite 46% of the people of the constituency being non-Bengalis.“The people of Bhabanipur gave a befitting reply to the conspiracy that was hatched in Nandigram," the Trinamool Congress chief said.Mamata Banerjee also broke her previous records of winning margin. The Trinamool Congress leader had won the Bhabanipur assembly bypoll in 2011 by 52,213 votes and by 25,301 votes in the 2016 elections.BJP's Priyanka Tibrewal conceded defeat and said she has congratulated the chief minister."I gracefully accept the defeat. I congratulate Didi. I have sent my message to her," the youth leader of the party said.She, however, called herself the “man of the match” for contesting the election in Mamata Banerjee's stronghold and securing more than 25,000 votes."If people were allowed to vote then the result would have been different. Even I got hold of fake voters on the polling day. In several booths, polls were rigged. But I will admit that our organisation was weak in Bhabanipur. We have to improve this," Priyanka Tibrewal told the media after her defeat.ALSO READ | Bhabanipur bypoll: EC rejects BJP claim of booth rigging, cites mock poll delayBhabanipur assembly constituency has always been a strong fort for the Trinamool Congress, and the party has been winning it consecutively since the 2011 assembly elections.Trinamool's Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay won the assembly polls from the Bhabanipur constituency by 28,719 votes earlier this year. But, Mamata Banerjee has crossed that margin as she was leading by 45,738 votes in the 17th round of counting.The bypoll to Bhabanipur assembly constituency was necessitated after Trinamool Congress MLA Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay vacated the seat after the assembly elections earlier this year, to pave the way for party supremo Mamata Banerjee to contest the bypoll to retain her chief ministerial post.Even though Trinamool Congress came back to power in West Bengal for the third consecutive time following a landslide victory in the assembly elections, Mamata Banerjee faced defeat in the Nandigram assembly constituency against her former protégé Suvendu Adhikari by a thin margin of 1,956 votes. A former state minister and a close aide of Mamata Banerjee, Adhikari switched to BJP ahead of the West Bengal assembly elections.Mamata Banerjee was required to win on any seat in the state to have the chance of becoming a member of the state assembly, and retain the chief minister's post, before November 5.Along with Bhabanipur, bypolls were also held in two other assembly constituencies in West Bengal, including Jangipur and Samserganj assembly constituencies on September 30. The Trinamool Congress was leading in all three seats, the latest data from the Election Commission show.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhabanipur-bypoll-result-mamata-banerjee-victory-trinamool-congress-west-bengal-101633251609911.html

If Trinamool supporters want to celebrate the victory, they should support the people of the flood-affected districts of the state, Banerjee said. "I will not show V because I am not winning alone. We are contesting from three seats. So I will show three fingers," Banerjee, who gets to retain her chief minister post after the resounding victory from the Bhabanipur assembly seat said."I have won the Bhabanipur Assembly bypolls with a margin of 58,832 votes and have registered the victory in every ward of the constituency," the chief minister said. According to the latest information, Mamata has won by 58,835 votes including the postal ballots.I gracefully accept defeat, says BJP's Priyanka Tibrewal as Didi sets recordThe Election Commission asked the government to make sure that there is no victory celebration anywhere in the state following BJP candidate Priyanka Tibrewal's letter to the Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court, expressing apprehension over possible violence after the results are declared."... no victory celebrations/ procession during/after the counting shall be allowed in the ongoing elections in West Bengal, for which counting is being taken place on October 3, 2021," EC secretary Rakesh Kumar said in a letter to the West Bengal government.Mamata said Bhabanipur residents are not all Bengalis. In fact, 46% of people in Bhabanipur are non-Bengalis. "They all have voted for me. People of West Bengal are watching Bhabanipur, which inspired me," she said adding that the victory is a befitting reply to the conspiracy that was hatched in Nandigram. Bhabanipur was a prestige issue for the Trinamool and the chief minister as she had to win this seat to continue in the CM post,  because of her defeat in the Nandigram seat, while her party recorded a landslide victory in the state assembly election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamatas-1st-message-to-supporters-after-record-win-if-you-want-to-celebrate-101633254115916.html
03-10-2021||India||NDA aims to improve tally in bye-elections to 10 assembly seats||The Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies in the northeast are aiming to increase their strength by winning big in the bye-election to 10 assembly seats in four northeastern states including Assam(5), Meghalaya(3) and one each in Nagaland and Mizorams, scheduled on October 30. BJP and its allies are in government in Assam and Meghalaya. In Mizoram, the Mizo National Front (MNF), which is part of the National Democratic Alliance, is in power, however, the BJP is not part of the government in the state. With half of the 10 seats heading to bypolls being in Assam, the focus is on the performance the BJP-led ruling coalition that includes Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and United Peoples Party Liberal (UPPL) will put up against an Opposition in disarray. Tamulpur and Gossaigaon assembly seats fell vacant due to deaths of Bodoland Peoples’ Front (BPF) and UPPL legislators. The other 3 seats fell vacant after two Congress MLAs, from Mariani and Thowra, and an All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) MLA from Bhabanipur resigned and joined the BJP. Congress, AIUDF and eight other parties, which were part of an opposition grand alliance for this year’s assembly polls, have decided to fight the bye-elections independently or in tie-ups with new allies. On the other hand, the BJP and its allies are contesting the bypolls as a team. At present all the major parties are engaged in meetings and names of candidates are expected to be announced within the next 2-3 days. “We are confident of winning all five seats. BJP would be contesting at least 3 of the 5 seats while our ally UPPL will field candidates in the rest. No decision has been taken either on division of seats or on the candidates yet,” BJP Assam state president Bhabesh Kalita said. At present the ruling BJP has 59 MLAs, UPPL 5 and AGP 9, while opposition Congress has 27, AIUDF 15, BPF-3, CPM 1 and the newly floated Raijor Das has 1 MLA in the 126-member lower house. Bye-election to the Majuli seat, which fell vacant after Union minister Sarbananda Sonowal resigned last week, will take place later. “We will contest from 3 or 4 of the 5 seats and names of candidates will be announced soon. I appeal to voters to defeat those who got elected on the Congress symbol and ditched the party and joined the BJP within a few months,” Assam Congress president Bhupen Kumar Borah said. AIUDF organising secretary Mohammad Aminul Islam said his party would field candidates in two seats and could offer support to “like-minded parties” in the other three seats in order to defeat the BJP’s “communal and divisive agenda”. In Meghalaya, three seats had fallen vacant after deaths of sitting MLAs. While two of these seats including Mawryngkneng and Rajabala were earlier with the Congress, the party in Opposition , the Mawphlang seat was represented by SK Sunn, an independent legislator. According to leaders in the Congress, who didn’t wish to be named, the party has finalised candidates for the two seats and will take a call on the third in a few days. A final decision on the candidates will be taken by the party high command in Delhi. The Congress, which has 15 members in the lower house at present, is struggling to keep its camp in order following reports that former chief minister and current leader of opposition Mukul Sangma mayl quit the party and join the Trinamool Congress with nearly a dozen MLAs. Sangma has denied these as ‘rumours’. The National People’s Party (NPP) which heads the ruling Meghalaya Democratic Alliance has 21 seats in the 60-member house while the BJP, which is part of the government, has 2 seats. The alliance is yet to finalise a list of candidates or a seat sharing deal. In Nagaland, the ruling Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP) is expected to win the Shamtorr-Chessore seat comfortably. The seat had fallen vacant following the death of the sitting NDPP legislator. BJP is part of the ruling coalition in the state and last month Naga Peoples’ Front (NPF) also joined the government making the state ‘opposition-less’. In Mizoram, except the BJP all other major parties have decided on their candidates for the Tuirial constituency which fell vacant in August following the death of Opposition Zoram Peoples’ Movement (ZPM) MLA. While ruling Mizo National Front (MNF) will field K Laldawngliana from the seat, Congress and ZPM have decided on the names of Chalrosanga Ralte and Laltlanmawia respectively. MNF has 27 MLAs in the 40-member house while the Congress has 5, ZPM-6 and the BJP has 1. Filing of nominations for the bye-elections will end on October 8 and counting of votes will be on November 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nda-aims-to-improve-tally-in-bye-elections-to-10-assembly-seats-101633254237555.html

03-10-2021||India||Mumbai cruise rave party: All you need to know about NDPS Act||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Saturday busted a rave party being held on a cruise in Mumbai. Among prominent names, Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan has been detained and is being questioned by the Narcotics Control Bureau.Aryan Khan and at least seven others are being quizzed at the NCB's Ballard Estate office in south Mumbai. The party was being attended by several high-profile guests and the cruise was headed towards Goa. The NCB, during the raid which went on past midnight, found several drugs like cocaine, MDMA, Mephedrone and charas from those who were detained after the raid.Here’s more on the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act under which eight persons have been arrested so far and several detained in connection with the raid.The NDPS Act was enacted in 1985 with an aim to comply with the guidelines of international conventions relating to drugs and their abuse. The act prohibits “the manufacture, production, trade, use, etc. of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances", except for medical and scientific purposes. Just a year after the enactment of the act, the Narcotics Control Bureau was set up under the Union home ministry.The Act lists down stringent provisions on manufacturing, sale, purchase, possession, consumption, abuse and trafficking of drugs.As prescribed under the NDPS Act, the punishment depends on the quantity of drugs seized. Going by the Section 31A of the act, the maximum punishment that can be granted under this anti-drug law is death penalty. The stringent punishment under the act is applicable if a person is found guilty of being involved with commercial quantities of drugs.On the other hand, the act empowers courts to grant immunity to an addict if they are found involved in a case dealing with trace amounts of the drug. But, this can be done on a condition that the accused agrees to take a medical treatment for de-addiction as mandated under Section 64A.Bail can be granted in cases where someone has only consumed banned drugs or narcotics but has not been found to be involved in trading. However, for this, the accused will need to sign a bond.The law, which came into effect in 1985, was amended thrice- in 1989, 2001 and 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-cruise-rave-party-all-you-need-to-know-about-ndps-act-101633249940726.html

The comment was widely interpreted to be aimed at Tej Pratap’s younger brother and leader of Opposition in the Bihar Assembly, Tejashwi Yadav .Tejashwi responded by saying that living like a hostage was out of character for the 74 year old former railway minister.“Laluji has been the chief minister of Bihar for a long time and also a Central minister. He was instrumental in the election of two former Prime Ministers . He had also ordered the arrest of BJP patriarch Lal Krishna Advani. So, such allegations do not fit in with the personality of the RJD chief,” Tejashwi said, while talking to reporters at Patna airport soon after returning from New Delhi.When prodded further if Tej Pratap was venting his frustration, Tejashwi evaded a direct reply and repeated that the RJD chief cannot be kept under any influence .On Saturday, Tej Pratap had blurted out against the top party leadership and taken oblique potshots at his younger brother during an event of his newly formed Chhatra Janshakti Parishad in Patna.“ Laluji is not being allowed to come to Patna and those dreaming of becoming the party’s president are keeping him hostage in New Delhi. The RJD chief is not being allowed to come to Patna despite having spent several months in the national capital after being released from jail in April. I do not want to take names as everybody knows them,” Tej Paratp said.The RJD chief has been recuperating at the New Delhi residence of elder daughter Misa Bharti. In a recent interaction, he had said he would soon come to Patna and tour every district in the state.For the last few months, Tej Pratap has been at loggerheads with his younger brother and party’s state president Jagdanand Singh apparently over his diminishing clout in the party. A month back, he had called the state president Singh authoritarian and accused him of acting in an arbitrary manner. Reports said Singh, hurt by the barbs, had offered to resign but was persuaded to stay on by the RJD chief . It is said that Tej Pratap is also angry with Tejashwi and RJD state president’s decision to remove the president of the party’s youth wing, Akash Yadav , who was considered close to him.“ The way the party is functioning, it will not help in strengthening its organisation but only weaken it,” Tej Pratap said yesterday.Meanwhile, the state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Nikhil Anand said the allegation that the RJD chief was ‘hostage’ in New Delhi was of serious nature. “ Though it is an internal matter of Lalu’s family, our concern about the RJD chief’s health and well being is natural. We feel, Tejashwi should give a clarification so that we can be assured of Lalu Prasad’s well being,” Anand said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tej-pratap-alleges-father-being-kept-hostage-tejashwi-rubbishes-it-101633247697050.html

However, scores of farmers have arrived at the mandis with their produce without any invitation and are pressuring the administration to accommodate them out of turn“I had brought my produce of 4 acres on September 19 as the government had earlier announced to start the procurement from September 25 but later it was delayed, now it should procure our produce on priority as we were waiting here for more than a week, ”farmer Jasmer Singh of Ladwa of Kurukshetra district said.Scheduled procurement is a pre-condition for direct payment of the minimum support price (MSP) to paddy farmers.Vinay Yadav, chief administrator of Haryana State Agriculture Marketing Board said fresh directions have been issued that the farmers who have already brought their produce to the mandis out of schedule will have to obtain an invite or schedule on the e-kharid portal. In the interim, to avoid long queues outside mandis. temporary gate passes were being issued to farmers but procurement will only take place as per the schedule, he added.The officials providing temporary gate passes to farmers said they didn’t know when their produce will be procured. Thousands of quintals of paddy has already arrived in the mandis but the government said it will give priority to farmers who had received message inviting them to Mandis for procurement. District authorities had been told to start the procurement of Parmal varieties from Sunday morning.Gurdeep Singh of Bansa village of Karnal district alleged that the government was harassing in the name of schedule and gate pass. “I had come with my produce of three acres at 4 am after waiting for around 4 hours in the queue I got a temporary gate pass to bring my produce inside the mandi,” he added.Gagandeep Singh, zonal administrator of Haryana State Agriculture Marketing Board said, “We are fully prepared and the procurement has started in all the grain markets in Karnal as per the schedule issued to the farmers and if a farmer missed his scheduled procurement slot then alternate arrangements will be made as per the government’s directions.”Also Read: Ambala: 17 protesting farmers booked for rioting, unlawful assemblyThe state government has set a target of procuring around 60 lakh MT of paddy from around 200 purchase centres this year. But officials associated with the agencies say that procurement may exceed the target following an increase in the area under cultivation of parmal varieties. As per official data, over 40% of area under paddy cultivation, that is 584,000 hectares, is growing the Parmal varieties.According to the commission agents the delay in procurement and lifting may create a glut in the mandis. Haryana BKU president Gurnam Singh Charuni has demanded that the order for scheduled procurement in all the Mandis is withdrawn.In a videos message, Charuni also asked farmers to break the gates of the mandis if the officials do not allow them to enter the grain markets in the name of schedule or gate passes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-gather-outside-haryana-mandis-demand-out-of-turn-paddy-procurement-t-101633245057047.html

The Trinamool Congress supremo was in the fray from the Bhabanipur assembly seat with BJP's Priyanka Tibrewal and CPM's Shrijeeb Biswas.According to the latest data by the Election Commission, Mamata Banerjee got 84,709 votes against Priyanka Tibrewal's 26,320 votes while Shrijeeb Biswas got 4,201 votes at the end of the 21st round of counting for the Bhabanipur assembly bypolls.The Trinamool Congress workers and supporters broke into celebrations outside the chief minister's residence as the margin by which Mamata Banerjee led grew with each round of counting.Based on the votes counted so far, Mamata has secured 71.9% of the votes polled in the Bhabanipur assembly constituency while Priyanka Tibrewal managed only 22.29%.However, state transport minister Firhad Hakim said Mamata Banerjee instructed party leaders not to allow any victory procession or rally in Kolkata and the districts. The message from the chief minister comes close on the heels of the Election Commission writing to the West Bengal government, asking it to ensure that no victory celebration or procession is carried out during or after the counting of votes for bypolls.The bypoll to Bhabanipur assembly constituency was necessitated after Trinamool Congress MLA Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay vacated the seat after the assembly elections earlier this year, to pave the way for party supremo Mamata Banerjee to contest the bypoll to retain her chief ministerial post.Even though Trinamool Congress came back to power in West Bengal for the third consecutive time following a landslide victory in the assembly elections, Mamata Banerjee faced defeat in the Nandigram assembly constituency against her former protégé Suvendu Adhikari by a thin margin of 1,956 votes. A former state minister and a close aide of Mamata Banerjee, Adhikari switched to BJP ahead of the West Bengal assembly elections.Mamata Banerjee has to win on any seat in the state to have the chance of becoming a member of the state assembly, and retain the chief minister's post, before November 5.ALSO READ | At 53.32%, Bhabanipur bypoll sees low voter turnoutThe BJP fielded Priyanka Tibrewal, the vice-president of the party's state youth wing, against the chief minister in the Trinamool Congress bastion. Tibrewal played a key role in the BJP’s battle in the Calcutta high court on alleged post-poll violence, which led a five-judge bench to order for a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation. Tibrewal had contested from Entally seat in the assembly elections but lost to Trinamool's Swarna Kamal Saha by more than 58,000 votes.Meanwhile, Priyanka Tibrewal wrote to the Calcutta high court ahead of the counting, casting aspersions over “post-poll violence”, and seeking preventive measures. A clash reportedly broke out between the supporters of the Trinamool Congress and the BJP on the day of polling.Bhabanipur assembly constituency has always been a strong fort for the Trinamool Congress, and the party has been winning it consecutively since 2011 assembly elections.Trinamool's Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay won the assembly polls from the Bhabanipur constituency by 28,719 votes earlier this year. But, Mamata Banerjee has crossed that margin as she was leading by 58,389 votes in the final round of counting.Mamata had won the Bhabanipur assembly bypoll in 2011 by 52,213 votes and by 25,301 votes in 2016 elections.ALSO READ | Bhabanipur bypoll: EC rejects BJP claim of booth rigging, cites mock poll delayAlong with Bhabanipur, bypolls were also held in two other assembly constituencies in West Bengal, including Jangipur and Samserganj assembly constituencies on September 30. The Trinamool Congress was leading in all three seats, the latest data from the Election Commission show.The counting for the bypolls began at 8am on Sunday amid tight security. Twenty four companies of central forces have been deployed at the counting centres, and the entire area has been put under CCTV surveillance. Poll officials were allowed inside the counting centre with only pen and paper and only the returning officer and observer are allowed to use phones.Bhabanipur constituency will see 21 rounds of counting, while votes polled in Samserganj will be counted in 26 rounds and 24 rounds for the Jangipur constituency at Sakhawat Memorial School in Kolkata.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhabanipur-bypolls-mamata-banerjee-trinamool-congress-bjp-west-bengal-assembly-elections-results-101633236265518.html

The jab has been prepared by Zydus Cadila, located in Ahmedabad.Though a countrywide inoculation drive for children is yet to be announced, fears over a potential third wave of infections have triggered calls in this regard.

Doctors at the Tokyo University Hospital diagnosed him with “restless anal syndrome.”According to Business Insider, which reported the case citing BMC Infectious Diseases, doctors noted that the symptoms shown by the man were consistent with those shown by patients with restless leg syndrome (RLS). Additionally, in yet another feature common with RLS, he was able to get some relief via exercise, the report noted.Tests, however, concluded that except a few haemorrhoids, the senior citizen was absolutely fine. There were no issues such as brain abnormalities, bladder disturbances etc. Restless feeling, anxiety and insomnia were the only health issues that he faced after recovering from Covid-19, the Business Insider report said.The “anal discomfort” was resolved through a course of Clonazepam, a drug used to treat seizures, it further stated.Earlier, the man was hospitalised with mild Covid-19 that included sore throat, cough and fever. He received treatment for mild pneumonia after developing low-grade fever for 10 days. He was discharged after his respiratory functions improved to normal 21 days after hospitalisation.Restless leg syndrome:BMC describes restless leg syndrome as a “common neurological, sensorimotor” disorder, caused by the dysfunction of the central nervous system. An urge to move is perhaps the most common symptom of this disorder. The symptoms worsen if the body is at rest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-japan-man-diagnosed-with-restless-anal-syndrome-after-recovery-from-covid19-101633227802552.html

03-10-2021||India||TMC predicts big victory for Mamata Banerjee despite lower voter turnout||Three days after low turnout of voters troubled election managers of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at south Kolkata’s Bhabanipur, leaders of the ruling party said hours before counting of votes on Sunday that Mamata Banerjee will win the bypoll by a higher margin than Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, who won the seat in the March-April assembly elections.Only 57.09 % of Bhabanipur’s 2,06,389 voters turned up during the September 30 bypoll, whereas on April 26, when Chattopadhyay contested, the figure stood at 61.79 %. He won by a margin of 28,719 votes. TMC leaders claimed on Saturday night that the chief minister was going to win by more than 50,000 votes.Though TMC bagged 213 of Bengal’s 294 seats and stopped the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) tally at 77, Banerjee was defeated at East Midnapore district’s Nandigram by her protégé-turned-adversary, BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari.As the setback left TMC leaders stunned, Chattopadhyay vacated the Bhabanipur seat so that Banerjee could contest again from her old constituency and continue as chief minister.The bypoll was held alongside elections in Murshidabad district’s Samserganj and Jangipur, where polls could not be held in April due to the death of two candidates.Despite intermittent rain in Murshidabad - the district with Bengal’s highest Muslim population of 66.28% - the final turnout at Samserganj was 79.92 % while in Jangipur, the figure touched 77.63 %.In sharp contrast, at Bhabanipur, where the weather was clear till around 3 pm, only 57.09 % voters reached polling booths despite the hype and intense campaigning by both sides.Also Read: Will Mamata retain her CM chair? Counting of votes to Bhabanipur by-poll todayIn the April 26 polls, the BJP came second, securing 35.16 % votes. Its candidate, actor Rudranil Ghosh, who made his debut in electoral politics, was defeated by 28,719 votes.“Mamata Banerjee will win by a margin of anything between 50,000 to 75,000 votes,” transport minister Firhad Hakim, who took the lead in campaigning for the chief minister, said on Saturday night.TMC leaders claimed before the polls that Banerjee would win by at least 0.1 million votes.“We will definitely do well. Our candidate Priyanka Tibrewal worked hard during the campaign,” said BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar.Bhabanipur’s cosmopolitan character has always posed a challenge for election managers.The constituency has 2,06,389 voters. According to TMC and BJP leaders, more than 20% residents are Muslims while Sikhs and non-Bengali Hindus comprise around 34% of the local population. The Congress did not contest the seat this year as its electoral ally, the CPI(M), fielded Srijeeb Biswas.“Whenever turnout was high in the past, the BJP did well in Bhabanipur. The low turnout on September 30 should worry the TMC more,” said Shishir Bajoria, a member of the BJP’s election committee.Even the chief minister apprehended a low turnout while addressing her first campaign meeting on September 22 as the weather office had predicted the arrival of Cyclone Gulab which later moved towards southern India.“Cast your vote even if it rains. I will suffer if I don’t get even one vote. Don’t be complacent and assume that my victory is ensured. If I do not win, someone else (from the TMC) will become chief minister since we are in the majority,” Banerjee said at the meeting in Ekbalpore, an area with a sizeable Muslim population.Though there was no violence during the bypoll, the TMC was repeatedly accused by the BJP of bringing in fake voters at some booths. The Election Commission received around 60 allegations but all were found to be baseless, officials said.Tibrewal, a lawyer who lost the March-April polls from Entally in central Kolkata, wrote a letter to the Calcutta high court’s acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal on Saturday, requesting him to direct law enforcement agencies to ensure that there is no violence after the election results are declared.Tibrewal is representing many of the petitioners who moved the high court alleging post-poll violence that the Central Bureau of Investigation is now probing on the court’s order.With 2,55,998 voters, Jangipur did not witness an election on April 26 as Pradip Kumar Nandi, the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) candidate, died of Covid-19. Jakir Hossain, the former deputy labour minister who bagged the seat in 2016, contested against the BJP’s Sujit Das and the RSP’s Jane Alam Mian. The Congress left the seat for the Left parties as part of the poll alliance.“We will surely win,” Hossain said after polling was over.Samserganj, which has 2,37,750 voters, could not go to the polls with the rest of the state earlier this year because Rezaul Haque, the Congress candidate, died of Covid-19 in early April. TMC fielded Amirul Islam who won the seat in 2016.The local Congress unit ignored the alliance by fielding Jaidur Rahaman, brother of the TMC’s Jangipur Lok Sabha MP Khalilur Rahaman, against the CPI(M)’s Md Modassar Hossain. The BJP fielded Milan Ghosh, a debutant. The TMC is confident of winning the Murshidabad seats||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-predicts-big-victory-for-mamata-banerjee-despite-lower-voter-turnout-101633227775399.html

03-10-2021||India||CJI seeks government’s cooperation on picks made by collegium||Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana on Saturday asked the Union government to lend its “support and cooperation” in clearing appointments of judges quickly to facilitate “access to justice and to strengthen democracy,” as around 100 names await the Centre’s nod.Justice Ramana was speaking at the launch of Pan India Legal Awareness and Outreach Campaign of National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) in the capital, when he highlighted the staggering pendency of cases amid “large vacancies” across all courts, and the need to hasten appointments in the high courts.Delivering his address in the presence of President Ram Nath Kovind, law minister Kiren Rijiju and several other SC judges, the CJI underlined that the apex court collegium, which comprises the CJI and the four most senior judges, has recommended the appointment of 106 judges and nine new chief justices to various high courts since May.“The government has cleared seven names out of the 106 judges and one out of the nine chief justices, so far. I expect that the government will clear the rest of the names very soon. These appointments will take care of pendency to some extent. I seek the cooperation and support of the government to enable access to justice and to strengthen democracy,” said justice Ramana.During his speech, the CJI said that he spoke to Rijiju about the pending names. “The law minister has informed me that rest of it (names) are going to come in one- or two-days’ time. I thank the central government for clearing these vacancies and (ensuring) quick access to justice,” he said.The sanctioned strength of judges in 25 high courts in India is 1,098. Of these, 465 posts (more than 42% of total strength) were vacant as on September 1.The collegium, which includes justices Uday U Lalit, AM Khanwilkar, Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and L Nageswara Rao, recently cleared the appointment of regular chief justices in eight high courts to make administration of constitutional courts more efficient. At present, eight out of 25 high courts are working without regular chief justices.The collegium also set in motion a major shake-up by recommending the transfer of five chief justices, besides reshuffling more than two dozen other judges of the high courts. Most of these recommendations are yet to be approved by the Centre, prompting the CJI to comment on it on Saturday.Laying emphasis on the pivotal role played by the judiciary in ensuring access to justice to vitalise democracy, the CJI said that socio-economic justice would be impossible to achieve without providing equal access to justice, which essentially entails creating legal awareness.The constitutional guarantee of equal justice will be rendered meaningless if vulnerable sections cannot enforce their rights, said justice Ramana, pointing out that equality and access to justice complement each other, especially in a country like India where socio-economic gaps and inequities remain widespread.This is why today all the three organs of the state – the executive, the legislature and the judiciary – have come together to strive for a future based on inclusion, equality and fairness, said the chief justice, who is also patron-in-chief of NALSA.Justice Ramana announced that NALSA is embarking on an ambitious six-week programme beginning Saturday to “carry the flag of justice to the remotest corner and to the weakest person in this country”, to enable people to realise the goals of true freedom and independence.Justice Ramana thanked President Kovind for his constant support to legal reforms and for supporting having more women judges in the constitutional courts. “It is his (Kovind’s) strong belief in gender justice that was instrumental in the recent appointment of judges to the Supreme Court. With him at the helm, the positivity will spread across all the high courts.”Out of the sanctioned strength of 34 judges, the Supreme Court currently has four women judges — justices Indira Banerjee, Hima Kohli, BV Nagarathna and Bela M Trivedi — which is the highest ever number in its history.At the event, justice Uday U Lalit, executive chairman of NALSA, implored senior lawyers to take up at least three cases pro bono (free of cost for the public good) every year. “If well-established and senior lawyers think that it is time to give back to the system and take up pro bono cases, then people will develop this confidence in the free legal aid... Please, do pro bono work on your own. This is my request to all the senior lawyers.”The judge also favoured including paralegal work in the curriculum of the law schools. “If internships are compulsory in medical colleges, why cannot such a system be made compulsory also in the law colleges?...”At the event, justices Chandrachud and Sanjay Kishan Kaul underscored the need to improve the quality of legal aid, lamenting it was a collective failing of the legal fraternity. They appealed prominent lawyers to come forward to provide free legal aid to the needy.President Kovind calls for women-led developmentIndia must graduate from women’s development to women-led development, President Ram Nath Kovind said on Saturday, raising the pitch for increasing the number of women in National Legal Service institutions.“As a country, our aim is to graduate from ‘women development’ to ‘women-led development’. Therefore, increasing the number of women in National Legal Services institutions is as important as reaching out to the largest possible number of women beneficiaries,” Kovind said at the NALSA event.Of the 47,000 panel lawyers working at district legal services authorities, nearly 11,000 are women, he said. There are close to 44,000 para-legal volunteers associated with the 3,000-odd legal services institutions in the country, of which about 17,000 are women volunteers.Laying stress of spreading legal awareness, the President also took note of the dearth of best legal talent for the poor and marginalised, who cannot afford the services of senior advocates.With inputs from Abraham Thomas||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cji-seeks-government-s-cooperation-on-picks-made-by-collegium-101633212174325.html
03-10-2021||India||Revival of Mahatma Gandhi’s commune Tolstoy Farm in South Africa continues||The revival of Tolstoy Farm, the commune started by Mahatma Gandhi during his tenure in Johannesburg a century ago, received a further boost with contributions from the Indian government on his 152nd birthday on Saturday.High Commissioner for India Jaideep Sarkar and Consul General Anju Ranjan were the chief guests at an event at the once-thriving self-sufficient establishment, which had been vandalised over several decades, with only the foundation of Gandhi’s original house remaining.Efforts by the Mahatma Gandhi Remembrance organisation (MGRO), started by Gandhian follower Mohan Hira, have led to gradual steps to revive the venue as a tourist attraction, with funding from mainly the Indian government and the expatriate Indian community.The greening of the area for the past few years continued on Saturday with almond, pecan nut and olive trees being planted in the first phase of restoring the orchard that once supplied the people on Tolstoy Farm and neighbouring areas.The Indian missions also donated a generator to provide power, while the India Club is providing monthly contributions towards security and maintenance.Pledging continued support from the Indian government, Sarkar called for Tolstoy Farm to be turned into a major tourist attraction that would attract visitors from all over the world.“It was here at Tolstoy Farm that some of the methods and techniques used so successfully in our freedom struggle were conceived, developed and refined.  It was also the place where some of the values that would later inspire, motivate and inform independent India was developed by Gandhiji,” Sarkar said.“So, Tolstoy Farm can be called one of the cradles of India’s freedom struggle and nation-building. “We must make this a place of pilgrimage. We should not only come here once a year,” Sarkar added.Ranjan commended MGRO for having put in place a master plan to develop a replica of Gandhi’s original house, museum and library on Tolstoy Farm. She also made a plea to the South African Indian community to support these efforts.“Let us recreate Tolstoy Farm to the full glory that Bapu wanted to see. That will be a real tribute to Bapu,” Ranjan said.Ranjan announced a week-long programme put together by the High Commission and Consulates in Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town to celebrate India’s 75th anniversary with a Gandhi Trail tour by 75 people that will start at Tolstoy Farm on Sunday and end at the Phoenix Settlement that Gandhi started near Durban.The tour will also take in important Gandhian sites in a number of towns and cities along the route.Among the historic sites is the train station at Pietermaritzburg where young lawyer Gandhi was thrown off a train, which started his path of fighting discrimination and oppression through peaceful resistance in both South Africa and India.The prison where Gandhi’s wife Kasturba was held and the court in Dundee where Gandhi was sentenced to nine months in prison with hard labour are among the other sites to be visited.After returning to Johannesburg, the Consulate will host a musical evening on Wednesday with Gandhiji’s favourite bhajans rendered by singers from the Indian diaspora.The programme will conclude on Thursday with a special screening of the film ‘The Making of the Mahatma’ by Shyam Benegal. The movie is based on a book by renowned South African activist, the late Professor Fatima Meer.

But after he took over, the figure has crossed 12,000 km,” the NCP chief said.The former Union agriculture minister advised farmers in the region that the use of sugarcane will not remain limited only to sugar production and they should think of it as the raw material for ethanol too.In his speech, Gadkari said while executing road projects in Buldhana district of Maharashtra, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) also de-silted local rivers and streams.“I suggest (Maharashtra Rural Development Minister) Hasan Mushrif to think of focusing on water conservation in Ahmednagar district,” he said.Mushrif, an NCP leader who is also the guardian minister of this parched district, was present at the function.Increasing the depth of streams and ponds helps increase the groundwater level, Gadkari said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitin-gadkari-has-shown-how-power-can-be-used-says-ncp-chief-sharad-pawar-101633205982089.html

I don’t know how many countries would say that Covishield is acceptable or not, but a large portion of the countries have got Covishield,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-900-million-covid-vaccine-doses-administered-in-india-health-minister-mansukh-mandaviya-101633205681687.html
03-10-2021||India||Bihar bypolls: EC freezes LJP name, symbol amid dispute between Chirag Paswan & Pashupati Paras||New Delhi: The Election Commission of India on Saturday barred Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) factions led by Chirag Paswan and Pashupati Kumar Paras from using the party name and symbol until the dispute between the rival groups to control the political entity is resolved. “Neither of the two groups led by Pashupati Kumar Paras and [the] other led by Chirag Paswan shall be permitted to use the name of the party Lok Janshakti Party and neither of the two groups shall also be permitted to use the symbol bungalow,” the Commission said in its order. The decision comes a day after the Paswan faction announced that they will be contesting the upcoming two assembly bypolls in Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan in Bihar. The seats were earlier represented by the ruling Janata Dal (United), which will also be contesting the constituencies. “We will abide by the EC order and submit papers by Monday,” Ashraf Ansari, the spokesperson of the Paswan-led group said. The LJP has been in a crisis since June, when a faction headed by Hajipur MP Pashupati Kumar Paras removed his estranged nephew Chirag Paswan as party chief, prompting Paswan’s loyalists to respond by stripping five rebel parliamentarians of the party’s primary membership. The party, which has six MPs but no MLAs, split after the five lawmakers rebelled against Paswan’s leadership and chose Paras as the new leader of the parliamentary party. The MPs consequently met Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla, and the Lok Sabha secretariat recognised Paras as the parliamentary party chief hours later. Paswan has already shown his willingness to take up a legal battle to regain control of the party. The Commission said that it had taken into account the letters sent by both the factions and expedited its decision in view of the upcoming by polls in Bihar, which are scheduled to be held on October 30. Both factions had claimed the exclusive use of the party name LJP and the symbol bungalow. “The Commission takes note of the urgency involved with regard to use of party symbol and party name due to the schedule of the by-elections announced. Accordingly, in order to place both the rival groups on even keel and to protect their rights and interests, and going by the past precedence, the Commission hereby makes the Interim Order, to cover the purpose of the current by-elections, including 78-Kusheshwar Asthan (SC) and 164-Tarapur Assembly Constituencies in Bihar, and to continue till the final determination of the dispute in the matter,” the Commission said in its order. The warring groups have been asked to submit alternative names and three symbols in order of preference by October 4. The Commission’s decision to bar both factions of LJP from using the party name and symbol until the dispute is finally resolved has been taken at the behest of ruling alliance, said Mritunjay Tiwary, spokesperson of opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal. “The decision has been taken as the JD (U) is going to face defeat in the assembly bypolls,” Tiwary said. The decision is obvious given the political and personal dispute within LJP, said Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Nikhil Anand. “There are two factions in the LJP party and the party’s symbol were being claimed by both the leaders. So, ECI has freezed the symbol till the final judgement is announced,” Anand said. JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said the decision was within EC’s jurisdiction. Two days ago, LJP (Chirag faction) had announced it would contest from the two assembly constituencies – Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan -- going for bypolls on October 30, much to the discomfort of the JD (U), which is contesting both the seats. The LJP during the 2020 assembly polls (it was a united party then) had damaged JD (U)’s prospect in at least 30-35seats. “To ensure no such damage is done this time, NDA (National Democratic Alliance) leaders from all alliance parties assembled to declare candidates for the two seats and even announced that the Pashupati Paras faction would campaign for the NDA candidates,” said a senior NDA functionary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-bypolls-ec-freezes-ljp-name-symbol-amid-dispute-between-chirag-paswan-pashupati-paras-101633204781596.html
03-10-2021||India||Isro scientists scramble to meet Gaganyaan deadline||Scientists at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) are hard at work to get all the systems in place, including a human-rated launch vehicle, crew and service modules, a crew escape system, and the environment control and life support systems (ECLSS), to meet the launch timeline of the Gaganyaan mission slated for late 2022 or early 2023, according to people familiar with the matter at the space station.The Gaganyaan mission — India’s first manned space flight — aims to carry three crew members to an orbit about 400km above the earth for five to seven days, and get them back safely. Here is the tech being developed specifically for the mission, according to Isro annual report and a webinar.Launch VehicleThe mission plans to use the newly operationalized GSLV MkIII launch vehicle that carried Chandrayaan-2. However, it will need to be “human rated”, or get enough systems and redundancies built in so that it becomes safe to carry humans, rather than just satellites.To do this, the vehicle itself has undergone a redesign, including changes in the shape of its solid motor nozzles and use of a more aerodynamic 4m ogive (bullet-shaped) payload fairing where the crew module will be housed. The vehicle’s digital and intelligence systems are also being enhanced for better integrated monitoring of the vehicle’s health. “It’s not that the rockets are going to be new, but it has to be extra reliable. We have to build in high levels of redundancy and also high levels of intelligence into it. The GSLV MKIII is being re-engineered and most of the work is in electronics and algorithms and in building higher levels of reliability in the mechanical and propulsion systems,” said director of Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, S Somnath, in a webinar on launch vehicles last month.“The system will be such that it will decide when the rocket has to be destroyed by itself. So far, this intelligence was not given to any of the rockets and it was decided by someone on ground. The vehicle health management system will run a model internally, compare the actual flight with the model flight on the on-board computer, and see whether there is perturbation. Depending on the extent of perturbation, decision will be taken to abort the emission and go for crew escape,” he added.The space agency has completed testing two of the three stages of the human-rated launch vehicle, with only the testing and qualification of the upper cryogenic stage remaining, according to the agency.Test Vehicle ProjectA key element to making the launch vehicle safe for travel of humans is to create a crew escape system (escape from the crew module in case of emergency) pad abort system (to stop the flight on the launch pad in case of an emergency).The design of the escape system has been finalised with five “quick-acting” solid fuel motors with a high burn rate propulsion system, and fins to maintain stability. The crew escape system will separate from the crew module by firing explosive nuts.To test these escape systems, Isro has designed a new rocket called the Test Vehicle, which will take the crew module up in space and then switch off to see how the escape system functions. “We can’t put the crew module in an actual rocket and then make it fail to see what happens. So we have made a rocket that will take the module in space and then terminate the vehicle to demonstrate the crew escape system. This is a fully autonomous rocket. This is almost completed and the first flight vehicle is undergoing integration...,” Somnath explained at the webinar. He said the vehicle design will be used to develop future reusable launch vehicles.Crew and service moduleThe crew module will be a conical structure with a height of 3m and a diameter of 3.5m. It will house three crewmembers, their seats, electronics for aviation, and ECLSS meant to maintain the pressure, temperature, humidity, and composition of gasses. The space agency has finalised the configuration of a human metabolic simulator that will mimic the crew’s heat release, breathing, and sweating to check the working of the ECLSS systems.The space agency has created a life-size mock-up of the module to test integration with other systems. The layout for ECLSS, electronics, and other subsystems have been finalised. The crew module and a hexagonal service module are together called the orbital module, which will remain in space during the mission. The number of solar panels, wings, power requirements, antennae, and sensors have been finalised, and the space agency has started fabrication of the module for the first unmanned mission; it will carry out two unmanned missions before sending men to space.Supporting technologiesIn addition to the main modules of the mission, scientist are also developing parachutes to slow down the crew module during its return, shields to protect the modules from space debris, and a crew health monitoring system, space food, and emergency survival kits. Isro, along with the Indian Navy, is also planning for multiple scenarios for quick and efficient recovery for the crew once they return to earth.“...The mission will solve several critical challenges that come with putting humans in a launch vehicle, chief among them is designing a crew module that can absorb the vibrations created during lift-off and keep the crew members safe,” said Dr SM Ahmed, head of central instruments laboratory at University of Hyderabad and former scientist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-scientists-scramble-to-meet-gaganyaan-deadline-101633203581692.html
03-10-2021||India||UAE to invest $75bn in India, partner on clean energy: Piyush Goyal at Dubai expo||The UAE government has committed to invest $75 billion sovereign funds in India and the two partners have shared vision for clean energy as they are working together to start manufacturing of equipment for solar power, commerce minister Piyush Goyal said in Dubai on Saturday.Addressing a news briefing on the second day at Expo 2020 Dubai, Goyal said his engagements with UAE businessmen and investors on Friday were “truly fabulous”.“There is a commitment from the rulers of the UAE to invest $75 billion from their sovereign funds in India. This is over and above what other businesspersons in the UAE may want to invest,” he said. HT reported on May 25 that over 15 sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) and pension funds have sought tax benefits for investing in Indian infrastructure projects – the ₹111 lakh crore National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP).Later in the day, at the ninth meeting of a joint task force on investments, the two nations discussed exploring mutually beneficial methods and incentives to facilitate further investment from UAE sovereign investment entities in key priority sectors in India, a commerce ministry statement said.The meeting was co-chaired by Goyal and Sheikh Hamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, member of the executive council of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. “The positive steps made by the Indian government in this context were noted and both sides agreed to continue to focus on ways of providing tax incentives to certain UAE sovereign investment entities,” the statement added.Goyal said the UAE is an important partner of India. “Given the strong growth prospects of the Indian economy, we look forward to increased investment from the UAE in diverse sectors of India. We are sure that the world will continue to witness greater achievements in the India-UAE partnership in the future.”At the briefing earlier, Goyal said that besides SWF, other investors from the UAE want to participate in India’s infrastructure development initiatives, invest in the asset monetisation programme, and are extremely keen to partner with India on promoting tourism.Speaking about the potential for cooperation in environment protection, Goyal said India and the UAE support each other’s vision for clean energy, and the two partners are working together to start manufacturing of equipment for solar power.Citing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of “one world, one grid”, he said that renewable energy can flow across the world 24 hours through a worldwide grid that will continuously harness solar energy as the sun always shines in one or the other part of the planet. “It will have a transformation impact on climate,” he said.Replying a question on India’s commitment for environment protection and achieving the net zero target, Goyal said: “The developed countries who are asking us to make a ‘net zero’ commitment on a particular... up to any date are not recognising that the work India has done is far more than what we had committed in Paris and the COP 21.” In fact, India has exceeded its commitments, he added.However, the developed world has actually let the developing world down, he said. They made commitments of providing technology, or providing climate finance – concessional, grant-based funds to enable the developing world to promote renewable energy at affordable prices, he added. “Sadly, they’ve let the world down.”“I don’t think, anybody, who meets us off and on, has anything but praise for the efforts of India led by PM Modi. They are certainly asking us to make a commitment on net zero. But it should be linked to what the rest of the world will do. It cannot be in isolation,” he said.They must find technological solutions at scale, he said, adding that “PM Modi and India are never going to make false commitments. When we make a commitment, we mean it.”Speaking about the trade relations with the UAE, Goyal said that there are many areas of interest for Indian businesses such as textiles, leather accessories, footwear, pharmaceuticals and health care. “India and the UAE share a lot of complementarities. We are not in competition with each other. We actually can collaborate to serve large parts of the world,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uae-to-invest-75bn-in-india-partner-on-clean-energy-piyush-goyal-at-dubai-expo-101633202924039.html

It is my firm belief that if we tread on his philosophy, we have a great future,” Bommai said after paying tributes to Mahatma Gandhi and former Prime Minister Late Lal Bahadur Shastri.The CM said Mahatma Gandhi brought freedom to India with the weapon of truth and non-violence, which the world is aware of and respects him for it. On Gandhi’s vision of village development, the chief minister said India needs to vouch for materialising Gandhi’s dream of ‘Gram Rajya, Ram Rajya’.Noting that Gandhi’s simple and unblemished personal and public life was the guiding force of India, Bommai pointed out that Gandhi’s idea of nationalism was humane, which needs to be strengthened across the nation. He added that Gandhi and Shastri had many similarities as the former believed in truth while the latter walked on it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/job-creation-mantra-of-mahatma-still-relevant-in-21st-century-karnataka-cm-bommai-101633200823736.html

It’s learnt that the vigilance wing has sought legal advice to probe against Sudhakaran as he is a member of Parliament. The preliminary investigation was conducted by Kozhikode vigilance SP on a complaint filed by Sudhakaran’s former driver Prasanth Babu.Meanwhile, Sudhakaran said he was ready to face any probe by any agency as he was not a tainted politician.“I am not a tainted politician. I am ready to face any probe. Let any investigation agency probe the case. Even I want somebody to probe the matter so that I can prove to the people that I have not done any wrong,” Sudhakaran told the media.He said Babu, his former driver, was employed for a few days and as a temporary appointment. Leader of Opposition in the State Assembly V D Satheesan came out in support of Sudhakaran and said if the vigilance department was being used as a political tool, then Congress will deal with the matter politically.“Let them probe. We will cooperate. But if they are using vigilance as a political tool against us, we will fight it,” Satheesan said.Babu on Saturday alleged that Sudhakaran had indulged in corruption of ₹2 crore.As per his complaint, Sudhakaran collected ₹32 crore fund even from abroad for the K Karunakaran Trust but misused ₹18 crore for personal purposes. Babu raised fresh allegations that when Sudhakaran was the Forest minister during 2001 to 2004, he went to examine the seizure of sandalwood oil and took away oil worth crores of rupees.Sudhakaran, who took over as the party chief recently, has been facing multiple allegations from various quarters including his party. Many senior leaders in Congress have allegedly expressed displeasure over his working style.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-pcc-chief-sudhakaran-under-scanner-over-disproportionate-assets-case-101633200821412.html
03-10-2021||India||Centuries old festival of dolls remains integral to Dasara in Karnataka||Mysuru/Bengaluru Nazarbad is a quaint locality, about two kilometres from the famed Mysuru Palace lit up in its glory, with most of its residents seated on the roads, no wider than 10 feet, chatting away with the neighbours. Amid a power outage in the area, one building stands out in the darkness: Bombe Mane or the dollhouse.Every Dasara, a festival organised in the state since the times of Maharajas to celebrate Goddess Durga’s victory against the demons, the unique art of dolls representing the rich heritage of Indian culture comes to life. Customers take their time in this shop, bedazzled by the vivid colour and collection of craftsmanship on display. “The culture of dolls began during the Vijayanagar Empire and came into Mysore (now Mysuru) after Raja Wodeyar took to the throne in 1610,” RG Singh, the secretary of Ramsons Kala Pratishtana that runs the Bombe Mane told Hindustan Times. A Rajput by origin, Singh’s forefathers were brought to Mysuru by 18th-century ruler Tipu Sultan. He is part of several small yet significant groups that represent Karnataka’s rich cultural heritage.Dasara dolls or Bombe is a common sight in most households in Karnataka, especially during the ten days of Dasara. The main dolls of the festival are a pair depicting a husband and wife and figurines of various deities. This festive display of dolls is known as Golu. Each family or individual choose a theme or ensemble to display with a mix of deities, persons in different occupations and a doll from one of the various mythologies. Singh said that different festivals support a different kinds of occupations like the buying of agricultural produce during Sankranti. He said that the Bombe Habba (doll festival) supports artisans and pot makers involved in making them. “During my grandmother’s time, we didn’t have the kind of readymade collapsible ‘steps’ you get in the market today. So I remember my mother and grandmother made use of anything available at home to build the steps – which always had to be in odd numbers – like bricks, books, planks, etc. They would then start by keeping the kalasam (metal pot) first, followed by the marapaachi bommais (rosewood dolls), and then arrange the other dolls, of which the dasavatharam set and the old Chettiyar couple was a must,” said Nithyashri Govind, retired school teacher, who religiously celebrates this festival. She added that there was a culture to sow mustard seeds either on the floor on top of a sheet or a tray and watch as the seeds sprung into the grass during that time. “Once the ‘grassland’ was ready, we’d add sand and make a small pond and add animal figurines to it. After I got married, my sister-in-law started keeping a more elaborate set-up and would even pick particular scenes from the Ramayana etc as the theme of that year’s Golu,” she added. “These toys represent the culture of the people, which they worship, including occupations, deities and recreations of historical events,” NV Narasimaiah, a Bengaluru-based historian said. There is also a culture of buying a pair of dolls of the king and consort, as a way of keeping in touch with the royalty and prosperous past in their homes and to pass the heritage on to the next generation. However, over the years, different styles of doll making and models have seeped into the culture, allowing the traditional industry and its practitioners to sustain their way of life. Singh said that there was a factory where their store stands today since they were forced to move their manufacturing operations from a residential area. History has it that Tipu Sultan had moved his palace when he took over as the ruler of Mysuru and set up a Mint in this locality, which came to be known as “Nazarbad”, which means gold in Persian. Historians attribute the introduction of various doll making styles to Tipu Sultan, who had brought in these from Persia. However, there is no documented evidence to show the connection. These included the famed Channapatna toys, which has a market globally now. Professor Narasimhaiah said that though there is a varied version of Tipu’s contribution to this form of art, it is clear that the 18th-century ruler of Mysore “did not destroy the worship of dolls.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centuries-old-festival-of-dolls-remains-integral-to-dasara-in-karnataka-101633200761604.html

On Friday, Channi had asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to resolve the matter of farmers’ protest and resume dialogue with the agitating farmers. “I asked the PM to resolve the matter of farmers’ protest and resume dialogue with the protesting farmers. I demanded that the three laws should be withdrawn,” he told reporters here after the meeting. The farmers from all across the country, mainly from the states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have been protesting against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act passed by Parliament last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cm-channi-seeks-withdrawal-of-railways-cases-against-farmers-101633200161773.html

Baghel’s supporters say the appointment reflects the party high command’s faith in him, while Singh Deo’s supporters are hoping for a change in the state government. “Baghel’s ji appointment is positive indication amid the current political scenario of the state… Secondly, the move also puts a halt on any type of speculation about change of guard (in Chhattisgarh),” a leader close to Baghel said.People close to Singh Deo said the appointment should not be seen as a relief for Baghel. “It is still not clear from today’s appointment whether it is some kind of package deal or a promotion of Baghel ji,” a Congress leader close to Singh Deo said on condition of anonymity.More than 25 MLAs close to Baghel are camping in Delhi to express solidarity.Meanwhile, Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Saturday appointed additional office-bearers in the party’s Chhattisgarh unit, replacing four vice-presidents as well as three general secretaries. Arun Singhania, P R Khunte, Ambika Markam and Vani Rao were appointed vice-presidents in the Congress’ state unit, replacing Girish Devangan, Atal Srivastava, Bhanu Pratap Singh and Padma Manhar, according to a party statement.Earlier in the day, Baghel asserted that his state can never become Punjab, and said the two states bear only one similarity - that of having numbers in their names. “Chhattisgarh will always remain Chhattisgarh. It cannot become Punjab. The two states have only one similarity that both have numbers in their names,” Baghel told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-appoints-chhattisgarh-chief-minister-bhupesh-baghel-as-uttar-pradesh-poll-observer-101633198841323.html
03-10-2021||India||‘Opposition practising intellectual dishonesty’: PM Modi||The Opposition in India is practising “intellectual dishonesty”, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in an interview to Open magazine, in the context of opposition parties campaigning against the three farm laws enacted by the Centre last year.“There are political parties which will grandiosely make promises before elections, even put them in their manifestos,” Modi said. “When the time comes to deliver on the same promises, these same parties and people do a complete U-turn.’’“If you look at those who are opposing the pro-farmer reforms today, you will see the real meaning of intellectual dishonesty and rajneetik dhokhadhadi (political deceit),” he said.The PM also discussed a range of issues, including the criticism of his policies, the trade-off between pro-business and pro-poor measures, and his government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic.The interview comes soon after the Bharat Bandh on Monday by farmers’ collective Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) that marked the first anniversary of the enactment of the farm laws that the group opposes. Several political parties, including the Congress, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Samajwadi Party (SP) and others, had voiced support for the nationwide strike.“These were the same people who wrote letters to chief ministers, asking them to do the exact same thing that our government has done,” Modi said. “Yet, just because some other political party is enacting the same reforms, they have made a complete U-turn, and in a brazen display of intellectual dishonesty, completely disregard what will benefit the farmers and only seek what they think will benefit them politically.”“You can see the same rajneetik dhokhadhadi when it comes to Aadhaar, GST, farm laws and even crucial matters such as arming our security forces. Promise something and make arguments for it but oppose the same thing later without any moral fibre,” he said.The Prime Minister also discussed his view of the criticism that he and his policies have received over the course of his leadership. “I attach a big importance to criticism. I, with an honest mind, respect critics a lot. But, unfortunately, the number of critics is very few. Mostly, people only level allegations…”He also dismissed the perceived trade-off between pro-poor and pro-business policies. “According to me, policymaking should be pro-people. By creating these artificial categories, you are missing out on interdependence in society. Business and people are not working with opposing objectives.”While criticising the Congress governments before him, Modi said, “All governments formed in our country were fundamentally formed under the leadership of a person from Congress gotra. And that is why, for each of them, there was no difference between their political thought process and economic thought process...”On India’s fight against Covid-19 pandemic, Modi said, “The biggest lesson from the Covid-19 fight is that India has an unparalleled ability to unite and a tremendous capacity to deliver.”“In this scenario, India has done better than its peers and many developed countries, notwithstanding such negative campaigns. I have trust in our people and they have set an example for the world."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-practising-intellectual-dishonesty-says-prime-minister-narendra-modi-101633198605902.html
03-10-2021||India||Paddy procurement in Haryana, Punjab from today after stir||The Centre on Saturday issued an order to begin paddy procurement in Punjab and Haryana from October 3 after farmers, protesting against the delay in the procurement, clashed with police personnel in parts of the states.The decision was taken “in the interest of farmers”, the food ministry said in its order, days after it postponed the procurement of kharif paddy in Punjab and Haryana to October 11.The decision came hours after protesting farmers broke police barricades and faced water cannons, including near Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s house in Karnal, as they laid siege to residences of legislators and ministers in Punjab and Haryana.“I am directed to inform that, in the interest of the farmers, it has been decided to start procurement of paddy from October 3, 2021, in the state of Haryana and Punjab for 2021-22 kharif marketing season,” said a letter written by a Union food ministry official to the governments of Punjab and Haryana.Paddy should be procured as per the FAQ (fair and average quality) norms prescribed for the 2021-22 kharif marketing season, the letter said.In its earlier order on Thursday, the government said the procurement, which usually begins on October 1, will be postponed as the crop maturity is delayed and moisture content in fresh arrival is beyond permissible limits owing to heavy rainfall.The government “believes that the decision to start the procurement of paddy under MSP (minimum support price ) from October 3 in Punjab and Haryana is in the overall interest of farmers and consumers as well so as to accept paddy stock as per FAQ specifications to ensure quality procurement for millions of consumers under PDS of National Food Security Programme”, the food ministry said in a separate statement.The procurement operation is undertaken by the central government’s nodal agency Food Corporation of India (FCI) along with state agencies.The decision to revoke the earlier order was taken at a meeting of Union minister of state Ashwini Kumar Choubey and, Khattar and Haryana agriculture minister JP Dalal in Delhi. “The procurement (of kharif crops) will start from tomorrow in Haryana as well as Punjab,” Choubey told reporters after the meeting.In Karnal, the Haryana Police used water cannons to disperse protesting farmers as they tried to gherao Khattar’s residence, while in Shahabad and Panchkula, the agitators used tractors to break police barricades to reach houses of Bharatiya Janata Party leaders, including Haryana minister Sandeep Singh, officials said.The situation became tense in a few places in Haryana and Punjab after clashes broke out between farmers and the police.In several places in these states, farmers after reaching residences of ministers, legislators and MPs, parked their food grain-laden trolleys in front of their houses.In Punjab, farmers gathered outside the residences of several Congress legislators, including state assembly speaker Rana KP Singh in Rupnagar and MLA Harjot Kamal in Moga.While the BJP, in alliance with the Jannayak Janata Party, is in power in Haryana, the Congress is the ruling party in Punjab, and both state governments have urged the Centre to ensure farmers do not face any problem in paddy procurement.Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ask government agencies to begin paddy procurement.The police said that there was no report of any “major” untoward incident from the two states. Police personnel were deployed in strength to maintain law and order, the officials said.Saturday’s protests have come on the back of a months-long stir by hundreds of thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, against the Centre’s three farm laws. Several rounds of discussions between the farm unions and the government have failed to resolve the impasse.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmer unions which is also spearheading the agitation against the farm laws, gave a call on Friday for holding protests outside the residences of legislators in Punjab and Haryana to register their protest.After the Centre issued fresh orders, SKM called off that protest. “This is a victory of farmers’ united struggle,” the farmers’ body said in a statement.Haryana minister Anil Vij targeted the farmers, and said: “Farmers’ agitation is getting violent day by day. Violent movement in the country of Mahatma Gandhi cannot be allowed…”Paddy crop, though in small quantity, started arriving in mandis (markets) especially in border areas of Punjab, farmers said later in the day.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paddy-procurement-in-haryana-punjab-from-today-after-stir-101633198181279.html

It shouldn’t be that people have to travel long distances if they want to vote.”The delimitation commission -- set up by the government in March 2020 -- met representatives of all major political parties in Srinagar in July, except the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which boycotted the process.The panel is headed by former Supreme Court judge Ranjana Prakash Desai and includes chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra.The commission will be redrawing assembly segments based on the 2011 census, and has nearly nine months left to do so. It will also carve out reserved constituencies for the first time in the region, and add seven new constituencies. The panel met several stakeholders in the union territory earlier this year to assess the needs of constituents.The commission has sought feedback regarding discrepancies in demarcating areas of present constituencies. “In Dodha and Kishtwar, the commission felt that the areas were not depicted properly in the present map. To be able to carve new constituencies will require that the areas are properly marked on the map,” said the person cited above.The district officials are expected to get back to the commission with details of whether or not new constituencies are required in their area, the infrastructure problems, including issues of accessible roads, and other difficulties faced by the electors.“The visit to J&K to interact with the people, officials and political stakeholders has greatly benefited the commission,” the person said. “The commission has also sought feedback regarding each representation it has received to evaluate their implementation.”The commission will for the first time circulate its final proposal for public feedback once it is drawn up.The unfreezing of constituencies is beyond the “ambit of the commission’s mandate”, the person said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delimitation-panel-seeks-feedback-of-top-jkofficials-101633197823226.html

We are one. We may have different systems as per regions, religions and beliefs. We have several regions and states in the country. We have different rituals and beliefs. We also have different gods and goddesses but all these diversities don’t change our unity,” he said while addressing a gathering of intellectuals in Jammu on the penultimate day of his four-day visit to the region.Bhagwat also alluded to the revocation of Article 370 and said that mentality has to change before any change is made in the system.“The system changed, like here (in J&K). Article 370 is not anymore but has it gone away from the heart?…why states fight against each other, like Kaveri river water issue. What good would be done by changing the system…mentality has to change,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-are-united-despite-our-diversity-rss-chief-bhagwat-in-jammu-101633197462583.html
03-10-2021||India||Paris rulebook, finance goal to top agenda: Bhupender Yadav||India will focus on pushing for a new collective long-term climate finance goal and finalisation of the Paris rulebook at the upcoming United Nations Climate Change negotiations in November in Glasgow (COP 26), Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav said in a statement on Saturday.More than 195 countries had evolved and adopted the Paris rulebook – a set of guidelines for implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement at COP 24 in Katowice, Poland in 2018. But all issues related to the rulebook were not finalised in Poland. “India will engage constructively at COP 26 and evaluate bridging proposals to conclude the Paris rulebook, which can be done by delivering on the climate finance promises of the developed countries,” Yadav said, following his presentation at a pre-COP meeting underway in Milan.“It is high time that we conclude years of protracted discussions on the Paris rulebook so that countries can get on with the business of implementing the Agreement and holding each other accountable for their pledges. Also, once these rules are decided, there can be carbon trading between countries and a share of the proceeds can go to fund adaptation and resilience to climate hazards,” said Ulka Kelkar, director of the climate programme at the think tank World Resources Institute in India.One of the unresolved issues of the Paris rulebook is the carbon trading mechanism. “The Paris Agreement allows countries to transfer emissions reductions among themselves. The rulebook needs to specify the rules for how countries will do so – such as by selling credits for their emissions reductions to another country –0 but also ensure that these reductions are not counted twice,” added Kelkar.“India emphasised on strong climate action in this decade to ensure that the world is on track to stay within the temperature goal of the Paris agreement, as well as to adapt to its impacts, and minimise loss and damage. Hence, the COP 26 outcome must emphasise the need to plug the ambition gap by delivering the means of implementation support that will allow developing countries to enhance their climate actions,” a statement from the environment ministry said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paris-rulebook-finance-goal-to-top-agenda-at-cop-26-bhupender-yadav-101633197461394.html

The app is expected to boost awareness and increase transparency and accountability of the government’s water and sanitation schemes.“This (Jal Jeevan Mission) is a village-driven, women-driven movement. Its main base is a mass movement and public participation,” Modi said. “It has been my constant effort that this thinking of gram swaraj (village republic) should move forward towards accomplishment.”From India’s Independence in 1947 to 2019, only 30 million households had access to tap water, he said. “Since the launch of Jal Jeevan Mission in 2019, 5 crore households have been connected with water connections,” Modi said. “Today, water is reaching every household in about 1.25 lakh villages in about 80 districts of the country. In the aspirational districts, the number of tap connections have increased from 31 lakh to 1.16 crore.”Modi also launched the Rashtriya Jal Jeevan Kosh, a government charitable trust. “Any individual, institution, corporation, or philanthropist, be it in India or abroad, can contribute to help provide tap water connection in every rural household, school, anganwadi (day care) centre, ashram shala, and other public institutions,” the government said in a statement.The Prime Minister spoke with members of village councils and water committees from across the country to assess the issues they face to make clean water available.Girijakant Tiwari of Umaree village in Banda district of Uttar Pradesh said safe and clean water is now available in his village, which has improved the lives of women.Sudha from Vellery in Tamil Nadu told Modi that all houses in her area have received a piped water connection. The availability of water improved their lives, giving them time for other productive activities, including construction of check dams and ponds, she told the Prime Minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jal-jeevan-mission-a-women-driven-movement-says-pm-modi-101633183660666.html
