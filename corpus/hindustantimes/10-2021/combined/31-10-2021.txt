But then, exceptions are usual in Katarniyaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, located on the Indo-Nepal border.Unmindful of the risk to his life, Laxman, a daily wage employee in Katraniyaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, jumped into the deep water of the Gairuwa river to save the floating eggs of ghariyals. He retrieved them and placed them back at the breeding pads near the Ghariyal Centre set up at the KWS so that baby ghariyals may be hatched out. On being asked, Laxman said that a sandbar where ghariyals laid their eggs was cut down by the flow of the Gairuwa. He said he saw two ghariyal eggs floating in the river and jumped in without even thinking. There are only two rivers, Chambal and Gairuwa, in the world where ghariyals’ (Gavialis Gengeticus) natural breeding takes place in a concentrated manner. The reptile has been declared one of the most critically endangered species in the world. It is 20 times more endangered than the tiger in the Red Data Book published recently by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). It may be noted that the Gairuwa , which originates in Nepal, enters the sanctuary through eight channels. Owing to fresh and uncontaminated water of Gairuwa, several endangered species like Gangetic dolphins and ghariyals are growing well here.Divisional forest officer (DFO) Akash Deep Badhawan praised Laxman for his outstanding and courageous task. He said people did not even dare to go on a boat in these waters where ghariyals were present in good number. The DFO said last week a boy’s leg had to be amputated due to crocodile attack.Recalling another forester’s courageous work, Badhawan said one Pawan Shukla was attacked and injured twice in leopard attack in 2006 and 2020. But even after two attacks, Pawan goes to the forest for patrolling with full dedication. The DFO said the work of foresters was not less than that of a soldier deployed on the border. But their work was not being recognized like police men and soldiers. Inspector general of forests Ramesh Kumar Pandey also shared Laxman’s picture on his Twitter handle as an unsung hero.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/daily-wager-jumps-into-crocodile-infested-river-to-save-ghariyal-eggs-101635704784709.html

The gang members duped several businessmen, realtors and professors in these cities by providing them high quality fake currency notes, claiming that these were of four times the face value of original currency, they added.UP police additional director general (ADG), Law and Order, Prashant Kumar said, “The arrested gang member has been identified as Michael Yadav alias Monty, a resident of Varanasi. Monty was arrested on Sunday in connection with a FIR of fraud and loot registered at Gomti Nagar police station in the matter.” The gang was busted after arrest of two persons Abhishek Pratap Singh of Pratapgarh and Saurabh Yadav of Maharashtra, on Friday. ATS officials said that the gang members used to convince the victims that the fake notes were of such high quality that these would easily be circulated, and could not be detected by law enforcement agencies and banks. However, to dupe the victims they used to show a few real Indian currency notes and claim these were fake notes of superior quality, they added. The officials said the gang had duped and robbed at least 20 people using the same modus operandi in the past two years and the victims never complained fearing police action against them. As per the ATS press release, the officials said the gang was busted after arrest of two people Abhishek Pratap Singh of Pratapgarh and Saurabh Yadav of Maharashtra on Friday. The ATS had recovered around ₹ 44.77 lakh from their possession that they had robbed from a Prayagraj realtor in a Noida hotel on October 27. The total ₹90 lakh was robbed from the realtor. Sharing further details, the ADG said that the gang members used to call their prey at some secluded place with money after convincing them on phone and fled with their money after robbing or duping them. “Monty revealed that he has been associated with the gang since March, 2019, after meeting the two leaders of the gang Sachin and Avinendra Mishra in a Mumbai hotel,” he said. “As per Monty’s revelation, the gang has duped ₹5 lakh from an agricultural university professor in Prayagraj, ₹ 80 lakh from a professor of another university in Lucknow, robbed ₹30 lakh from a Jaipur businessman in Delhi, a Prayagraj relator in Noida and a businessman in Varanasi. Besides, the gang had duped and robbed several other people in different cities and states,” he stated. The official said, three members of the gang have been arrested while the involvement of five more have surfaced during the investigation and further efforts are been done for their arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-ats-arrests-one-more-member-of-inter-state-fake-currency-gang-101635704486751.html
31-10-2021||Mumbai||CBI makes first arrest in corruption case against ex-Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh||The CBI took into custody one Santosh Jagtap on Sunday in connection with a case of alleged corruption against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, making it the first arrest in the high-profile case, officials said.The agency arrested Jagtap, an alleged middleman, from Maharashtra's Thane in the morning, they said, adding that the accused was evading the probe even after the issuance of non-bailable warrants against him last month.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had raided the premises of Jagtap in August and seized ₹9 lakh in cash, the officials said.The agency has booked Deshmukh and other unidentified accused under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) section related to criminal conspiracy and provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act for an "attempt to obtain undue advantage for improper and dishonest performance of public duty".After he was removed from the Mumbai police commissioner's post, Param Bir Singh had alleged in a letter to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray that Deshmukh had asked Waze to extort over ₹100 crore a month from the bars and restaurants in the city."The Preliminary Enquiry prima facie revealed that a cognizable offence is made out in the matter, wherein the then home minister of Maharashtra, Anil Deshmukh, and unknown others attempted to obtain undue advantage for improper and dishonest performance of their public duty," the CBI FIR alleges.According to the CBI manual, a Preliminary Enquiry (PE) is initiated to assess if there is enough prima facie material in the allegations to proceed with a regular case for a full-fledged probe, the officials said.The CBI enquiry found that Waze, Assistant Police Inspector, Mumbai Police, was reinstated into the force after being out of police service for more than 15 years.He was entrusted with most of the sensational and important cases of Mumbai City Police and Deshmukh, the then home minister, knew about it, the FIR alleges.It also alleges that Deshmukh "and others" exercised undue influence over the transfer and posting of officials, thereby exercising undue influence over the performance of their official duties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cbi-makes-first-arrest-in-corruption-case-against-anil-deshmukh-101635702915762.html
31-10-2021||Noida||Air quality in Noida, Ghaziabad worsens||The air quality in Noida worsened on Sunday, but remained in the ‘poor’ category. The air quality is, however, likely to improve over the next two days due to the change in the wind direction from northwesterly -- which carries smoke from stubble burning -- to the cleaner southerly, according to the air pollution monitoring agencies.“The festival rush or increase in traffic movement, and dropping temperatures or wind speed, are the reasons behind the spike in the pollution levels over the past 24 hours,” said Shambhavi Shukla, deputy programme manager (air pollution), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) reading, on a scale of zero to 500, for Noida on Sunday was at 292 against 260 a day earlier. The AQI in Ghaziabad was at 342 against 273 on Saturday, and 292 in Greater Noida against 273 a day earlier.An AQI reading between 101 and 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and above 400 ‘severe’.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the fire count has reduced slightly over the past 24 hours, and the air quality is likely to improve in the coming days.“The air quality is likely to improve to the upper end of the ‘poor’ category in the next two days due to an expected change in the wind direction to westerly or southwesterly, reducing the transport of emissions from stubble burning. Isolated rainfall is likely in the upwind region which would improve the air quality. Share of crop residue burning emissions in PM2.5 is about 8% at present. Prevailing shallow mixing layer height reduces dispersion of pollutants,” according to a statement by the SAFAR on Sunday.According to the Safar, the effective fire count (stubble burning) on Sunday was recorded at 1,734 against 1,826 a day earlier.Meanwhile, the daytime temperatures recorded a slight drop in Noida. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the maximum and minimum temperatures in Noida on Sunday were recorded at 29.2 degrees Celsius and 17.1 degrees Celsius, respectively, against 29.2 degrees Celsius and 14.8 degrees Celsius, respectively, a day earlier.“Maximum and minimum temperatures will hover around 30 degrees Celsius and 17 degrees Celsius on Monday,” said an IMD official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/air-quality-in-noida-ghaziabad-worsens-101635704066288.html
31-10-2021||Noida||Noida admin launches month-long drive to revise electoral rolls||The Gautam Budh Nagar administration will launch a month-long campaign from November 1 to revise the electoral rolls ahead of the upcoming assembly elections, with an aim to enrol new voters and also weed out people who have shifted out. Vandita Srivastava, additional district magistrate (finance and revenue), and deputy district election officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the special summary revision of electoral rolls will take place from Monday. “The booth level officers (BLOs) will visit door-to-door for this exercise. We will also organise four special camps on November 7, 13, 21, and 27 – which fall on Saturdays and Sundays – where people can submit forms for enrolment or corrections,” Srivastava said. “There are 1,754 booths in the district, with one BLO at each booth. We have provided the required training to the BLOs to conduct the revision exercise. They have been asked to ensure 100% compliance to corrections of electoral rolls in their respective areas,” she said. The district administration on Saturday held a meeting with the BLOs, and also conducted the first level checking of the electronic voting machines. “The revision forms can be submitted either online or offline. People can submit their forms to the BLOs and also at their tehsils. In online process, they can use www.nvsp.in or voters helpline app – VHA,” said the deputy district election officer. People who complete 18 years on January 1, 2022, are eligible for enrolment as voters. People can also call the election control room number – 1950 – for any query or clarification, the officials said.Srivastava said that the district election office also conducted the Systematic Voters’ Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP) programme in different colleges in Greater Noida in the past few weeks to enrol young voters. As of October 31, 2021, Gautam Budh Nagar has 1,567,617 registered voters in three assembly constituencies – Noida (having 664,837 voters), Dadri (565,682) and Jewar (337,098). Uttar Pradesh may go to polls in May next year, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-admin-launches-month-long-drive-to-revise-electoral-rolls-101635704064969.html
31-10-2021||Noida||Noida’s first anti-smog tower likely to be operational on Tuesday||The first anti-smog tower in the city, along the Delhi-Noida-Direct (DND) road near the Film City in Noida, may be operational on Tuesday to mitigate air pollution in the area, said officials of the Noida authority on Sunday.The 20-metre-tall anti-smog tower will cover a space of 400 square metres, and mitigate air pollution during the winter season.“We have completed installation of the anti-smog tower and aim to make it operational on Tuesday, if everything goes well. We have completed all the installation work properly, and the operations will commence to keep the air clean,” said SC Mishra, senior project engineer of the Noida authority.During the trial, if the authority finds out that the tower is capable of reducing the pollution levels, then, it will install multiple anti-smog towers at different locations.“In a trial for at least 15 days, we will plan installation of anti-smog towers at other locations too,” Mishra added.According to the authority officials, it has built the tower under the corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds which were arranged from the central government’s public sector undertakings (PSUs). A budget of ₹2.5 crore was allocated for the project. The work on the ground started on September 25 this year after the approval in its board meeting on September 24.The tower will clean the air with polluting particles around it and release purified air, said the officials. Equipped with intake and exhaust fans, the tower will initially run with the help of electricity. The authority, however, plans to run the tower with the help of solar energy later.“We will require ₹3 lakh per month to run this tower properly. As of now, we will use electricity to run it, and will install solar panels later,” said an official of the Noida authority, requesting anonymity.He also said that the maintenance cost of the tower, excluding electricity charges, includes changing of filters which will clean pollutants in the air. “We will have to change the filters every 15 days.”Covering an area of 1,000-metre radius around it, the tower will benefit the residents in Noida sectors 15, 15A, 16, 16A (Film City), 17 and 19 among others. Nearly 1 lakh commuters travel along the DND and the Delhi-Noida Expressway link road, and the installation of the tower will be beneficial for them too, said the authority officials.A machine fixed inside the tower will remove nearly 80% of the particulate matter i.e. PM2.5 and PM10 in the air, and help bring down the pollution levels in the area.In November 2019, the Supreme Court had asked the central and Delhi governments to come up with a road map for installing smog towers in the national capital region (NCR) to combat air pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noidas-first-anti-smog-tower-likely-to-be-operational-on-tuesday-101635703944741.html

31-10-2021||Lucknow||#FLOWERPOWER: Diwali lifts spirits, all eyes now on ‘sahalag’!||The hustle bustle at the flower market in Chowk is bringing smiles on the faces of farmers, wholesellers and retailers. It’s 7 am and the buyers and sellers are busy trading the large variety of flowers that are brought from nearby places including cities like Bangalore, Bhopal, Mumbai, Pune as well as abroad. With Dhanteras just a day away, followed by Diwali festivities and marriage season ahead, everyone is upbeat about the coming months. They have faced huge losses due to ongoing pandemic which resulted in small weddings, slim gatherings and low-key events. “Peechle saal se hi dhandha bahut manda hai! Last Diwali was passive and marriages were also low key with cap on large gathering. Is Diwali se umeed hai sab accha hoga aur agey bhi jabardast sahalag hai,” says whole seller Mohd Aleem Rehman who houses decorative flowers which includes gerbera, daisy, star, gladiolus, different variants of rose, lilly, carnation and orchids. The market is however dominated by marigold and nearly 75 per cent of the business is of this yellow flower followed by rose and other variants. Mohd Naeem, who comes from Khadra every day, says, “Currently, the price of genda phool ki ladi is between ₹8-10 per meter which on Diwali can go to ₹20 or even 50 per meter depending on demand and supply ratio. Diwali pe koi daam nahi hota hai. Retailers who buy from us at ₹20 a meter sell at ₹50-60 in plush areas.” Spread across the large expanse, on the majestic backdrop of Bada Imambara and Asifi Mosque, are huge piles of marigold flowers and both men and women making strings that are sold in length — both per meter and in kilos. A woman seller on anonymity says, “Jyadatar ladkiyan woh hai jo school ke lije nikalti hai aur 4-5 ghante mala banati hai. Har din ₹50-100 ke beech tak inka ban jata hai. Diwali wale din ₹1000-3000 sab kama lete as they double up as traders and make their own garland and sell directly.”Besides flowers there is a good range of leaves as well that are mixed with flowers to make decorative bunch and bouquet which includes manokamna leaves, China patti, golden, morpankhi, ferns and many more. “The main reason for these sellers making good money on Diwali is that common retailers too come to pick up fresh stuff. So, even if we charge little extra to them it’s still very economical for buyers from their respective area,” says Talib Mansoori. Young Pinku with his aunt Pooja comes from Sindhauli (50 kms) every day. “We have own farming and buy from market as well. For Diwali we lend money on interest but make good money also. Suppose if we daily earn ₹200-300 profit and in two-days of Diwali we can make ₹10,000 or even more,” says Pooja. Muneshwar Prashad a farmer from Mahilabad brings 50-60 kgs of marigold every day. “Navratri se acchi bazaar chali rahi hai. Ab December main sahalag tak bahut accha dhanda hoga.”Many have started preparing for the Diwali rush as people start decoratinfrom the festival of Dhanteras. “We make strips and keep in cold storage as marigold had good shelf life. But, for puja we don’t sell kept stuff as for prayers we need fresh flowers,” says Abbas, a whole seller and adds if someone smells flower, we throw it away as it can’t be offered in prayers then!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/flowerpower-diwali-lifts-spirits-all-eyes-now-on-sahalag-101635703526055.html

However, some Gurjar leaders, who were earlier leading the campaign, were absent at the programme on Sunday.The president of Akhil Bhartiya Veer Gurjar Mahasabha, Gautam Budh Nagar, Shyam Singh Bhati -- who was booked for allegedly smearing black paint on CM Adityanath’s name on the Mihir Bhoj’s plaque on September 28 this year -- said that he did not attend the programme.A row started after some people allegedly removed the word ‘Gurjar’ from the plaque.

31-10-2021||Noida||DMRC report suggests 7 Metro stations on route linking Greater Noida with Jewar airport||The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has in its ‘inception report’ suggested seven stations on a new Metro corridor that will connect Pari Chowk at Greater Noida with the Noida International Airport at Jewar. The DMRC has suggested ‘fewer’ stations so that the travel time can be reduced between the two destinations, said officials. The DMRC has also suggested that the airport at Jewar be connected with Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International airport via New Delhi Metro station instead of Delhi’s Shivaji Stadium, said officials. On September 3 this year, the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) signed a memorandum of understanding with the DMRC, asking the latter to prepare a feasibility report of a Metro corridor that will provide direct connectivity between Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport and the upcoming Noida International Airport at Jewar, and another corridor connecting Greater Noida to Jewar, said officials aware of the matter. “In its inception report, the DMRC has suggested that there will be only seven Metro stations between Jewar and Greater Noida so that the travel time is less. The DMRC informed us the lines on which they are chalking out the detailed project report that will be completed and submitted in the next three months,” said Arun Vir Singh, CEO of YEIDA.According to the inception report, the first Metro station in the corridor linking Greater Noida with Jewar will be Pari Chowk, followed by Sector Tech Zone, Sector 22-D, Sector 18, Sector 20, Sector 28, the last station being the Noida airport at Jewar. The corridor will be 35.6km long and will run parallel to the Yamuna expressway. According to initial estimates, at least 17,000 passengers can use the Metro facility if the corridor comes up by 2024, around the same time when the Noida airport is also expected to begin operations. The Yeida has given its green signal to the DMRC for changing the alignment of the Metro corridor that will connect Greater Noida with Delhi airport. “In its previous plan, the DMRC suggested that Jewar airport can be connected to IGI airport via Greater Noida and Shivaji Stadium. But now, they want to connect it via New Delhi Metro station and we have approved this plan,” said Singh.“The new Metro corridor from Pari Chowk towards Yamuna bank will be at an elevation and run parallel to the Noida-Greater Noida expressway. The DMRC has suggested an underground corridor for connecting Yamuna Bank to New Delhi Metro station but nothing is final as of now. The New Delhi Metro station is connected with the Express Line that goes till the IGI airport. We will work further on this project only once the feasibility report is submitted,” said Singh.The Yamuna International Airport Private Limited--a special purpose vehicle set up to undertake the Noida International Airport at Jewar--has already started work on the boundary wall and levelling work at the airport that is expected to be ready by 2024. Yeida officials said they are trying to ensure if the Metro link and the Jewar airport can be readied at the same time. They said the financial modalities will be finalised once the project report is ready.The estimated cost of the Noida International Airport is said to be around ₹20,000 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/dmrc-report-suggests-7-metro-stations-on-route-linking-greater-noida-with-jewar-airport-101635703225049.html

The service was suspended as a measure to contain the spread of the pandemic.A few people also reached out to the railway officials in Ludhiana complaining about the hiatus on catering services imposed by the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC).“The passengers travelling in luxury trains including Amritsar-Delhi Shatabdi contended that when the trains have resumed, and everything is back on track, the railway should also start serving food included in the cost of the fare,” said a senior railway official here.A Twitter handle, Anand Hindu, criticized the Northern Railways for not serving meals, soup, and snacks in the trains. He ironically suggested the Railways to not spend much on the pantries in the trains as no food is served to the passengers.Naming an airline, he further tweeted that even airlines have started the hot veg meals for domestic economy class passengers, and thus railways should follow the same.Find packed food expensiveFor now, the rail commuters are getting packed food which according to them, is quite expensive.“I don’t see any problem in serving normal hot food in the trains now. The packed food which is not even included in the fare is so expensive. I bought packed vegetarian biryani for ₹155 during my trip from Ludhiana to Delhi in Vande Bharat. The taste and the quantity disappointed me. Railways should resume serving fresh hot meals in the trains now,” said Akshay Salwan, a resident of Nehru Nagar. Tarun Kumar, station director, Ludhiana, said the packed food is served to keep the commuters safe and prevent the spread of Covid-19.“In case the person who is cooking the food in bulk gets Covid, the infection will be transmitted to all the passengers. Thus, packed food is the safest option,” said Kumar.A senior railway official said that the railway minister is soon going to hold a meeting in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-covid-hiatus-passengers-want-hot-cooked-meals-in-trains-again-101635702564552.html
31-10-2021||Delhi||Rain helps Delhi see best air quality in 4 years, even as few areas show concern||Owing to record rainfall in Delhi in October, the national capital has witnessed its best air quality in a single month in four years, news agency PTI reported on Sunday.As reported by Hindustan Times earlier in the day, the city is yet to record a “very poor” air quality index this month. However, forecasters from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) cautioned against the air quality worsening and likely entering the “very poor” category from Sunday onwards. According to data available on the CPCB website, more than four stations of the government agency in the national capital are already experiencing “very poor” air quality. The AQI in Anand Vihar at 9pm on Sunday was 360, in Chandni Chowk at 340, in Jahangirpuri at 377, and in NSIT Dwarka at 338, among other stations.“Wind speeds might slow down from Sunday and this would adversely impact the city’s air quality,” a senior IMD official said.Delhi recorded 87.9mm of rainfall between October 17 and 18 – the fourth highest in a day ever in October, and the highest since 1956, when the national capital received 111mm rain, as per IMD data.The PTI report also mentioned that stubble burning and its share in Delhi’s PM 2.5 pollution remained low owing to heavy rainfall. Typically, air quality in the city starting November commences to deteriorate supremely, systematically reaching to “severe” category every year, due to stubble burning in neighbouring states of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.Also Read | Capital just 30mm rainfall away from eclipsing all-time recordIn October, Delhi has recorded three “satisfactory” AQI days as against none in 2020, four in 2019, and none again in 2018. Moreover, the city witnessed as many as 19 “moderate” AQI days as opposed to six each in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Also, the eight “poor” AQI days the national capital saw this month was the lowest in October in three years.Notably, an AQI from zero and 50 is termed as “good”, 51 and 100 as “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 as “moderate”, 201 and 300 as “poor”, 301 and 400 as “very poor”, and 401 and 500 as “severe”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rain-helps-delhi-see-best-air-quality-in-4-years-even-as-few-areas-show-concern-101635701989831.html
31-10-2021||Gurugram||Two-kilometre link between Artemis Road, Brig Osman Chowk to be revamped by December||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) will start reconstructing a key two-kilometre-long internal road linking Artemis Road and Brigadier Osman Chowk (at the sector 56/57 traffic light) from December, officials said on Sunday, a day after the civic body floated a ₹1.88-crore tender for the project.The unnamed stretch is one of the most important arterial roads of the city as it is accessed by thousands of commuters daily, to bypass the busy Golf Course Extension (GCER).The road helps residents of sectors 49, 50, 51 and 52 bypass the traffic on GCER and Vikas Marg, and head directly towards Huda City Centre, Golf Course Road and the Gurgaon-Faridabad Road. Similarly, residents of sectors 42, 43, 53, 54, 55 and 56 (located along the Golf Course Road) use it to head directly towards Artemis Road, Nirvana Country and Vikas Marg, by bypassing the heavily congested GCER.Despite its importance, the road is in a heavily degraded condition and riddled with potholes.“The project essentially involves recarpeting the entire stretch. The bids for the tender will be opened on November 15 and subsequently, a contractor will be selected within 10 days. We are aiming to start and finish the work within December,” Sunder Sheoran, the executive engineer of MCG, who floated the tender on behalf of the civic body, said.Sheoran said that once the project commences on the ground, it will take the contractor around three weeks to complete the work. In the tender, the MCG has given the contractor a maximum period of six months to complete the project from the date of allotment.According to residents, the stretch has degraded further during the recent monsoon season.“The stretch is in dire need of repairs as it is heavily potholed, which results in traffic congestion. Despite its condition, thousands of daily commuters continue to access the stretch as it helps them avoid travelling through busy stretches, such as GCER, and save around 10 minutes of travelling time. If the road is in an optimal condition, it will help commuters save another five minutes of travel time,” Saurabh Vikas, a resident of Sector 57, said.Last week, MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja set a deadline of November 15 for the civic body officials to fix all roads in the city. Last month, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar also issued a similar directive to Gurugram’s public agencies, to fix all road stretches damaged during monsoon by November 30.“The MCG aimed to complete the reconstruction project before the November 15 deadline. However, due to technical issues in the original tender, there was a delay and the tender had to be prepared afresh,” a senior MCG official, who did not wish to be named, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/twokilometre-link-between-artemis-road-brig-osman-chowk-to-be-revamped-by-december-101635702208603.html

The bikers didn’t have much free space to practice. This will also help make people more aware about this sport.”Another participant, Harpreet Dhiman of Chandigarh, said that it is a dangerous and expensive sport and thus needs proper training.“It is an opportunity for the Ludhiana bikers to avail the benefits and improve their skills,” said Dhiman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-malakpur-dirt-track-a-first-in-punjab-101635702145741.html

Singh, who represented Gauriganj (Amethi) in the assembly, alleged that he was not able to address public issues and keep promises made to the people because of the non-cooperation of the state’s BJP government. The resignation did not come as a surprise as he had threatened to quit at a press conference on Saturday. After his resignation on Sunday, he sat on fast at the Mahatma Gandhi statue in Lucknow’s Hazratganj area. “Today, I met speaker of UP legislative assembly Hriday Narayan Dikshit and gave my resignation,” he said to reporters at the dharna spot. Accusing the BJP government of peddling lies, he said that he had raised some public issues with the government which had assured him of fulfilling them but did not actually do so. “I am finding myself incapable of fulfilling my public responsibilities under the present government. Thus, there is no point in my being a member of the present Vidhan Sabha,” he wrote in the one-page resignation letter. Singh also said: “The government is telling lies. Hence, there is no point in sitting in the House. Officials are weakening the democratic system and do not follow the directions of the elected government.” Mentioning the repair of two damaged roads in his constituency, Singh said, “On February 25, the government had assured the House that the damaged roads will be repaired within three months, but the work has not started till now.” “On October 2, I submitted a memorandum to the district magistrate of Amethi that if the repair of the two roads does not start, I will resign from the membership of the UP Legislative Assembly and sit on a fast. Despite this, the work did not start,” he added. Speaker Dikshit told PTI, “MLA Rakesh Pratap Singh met me today and submitted his resignation letter. The matter will be examined as per rules and a decision will be taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/sp-mla-quits-uttar-pradesh-assembly-blames-bjp-government-for-noncooperation-101635702144517.html

He said a team of the state wildlife officials was trained in August this year as master trainers by professionals from Karnataka, but things did not proceed further.“A person with some basic understanding of details, including the scientific names of flora and fauna, can deliver to visiting birdwatchers. The department is ready for capacity building, but no youth in or around Harike has been found suitable for the job,” Yadav addedSpread over 4,100 hectare on the Ferozepur-Tarn Taran border, Harike is a rare biodiversity hot-spot in Punjab that attracts thousands of birds from abroad and other Indian states. The wetland is located where Sutlej and Beas rivers merge, with the sanctuary at the spot where Majha, Malwa and Doaba regions of Punjab meet.Sources said as it attracts birdwatchers every year, an organised group of well-trained guides might help in improving the economics of the local area and ensure better protection of the area.“Harike has immense scope for ecotourism, but it lacks promotion plans. In June 2018, then tourism minister Sidhu (now Punjab Congress president) had drawn up a blueprint to tap tourism potential at the underdeveloped site. It was proposed that Harike would be taken as a link between the adjoining major religious site of Amritsar with the international border and historic spots in Ferozepur. The proposal, however, did not see coordinated efforts to make it work,” an official with the forest department said. Official sources said the wetland is facing problems, including encroachments, drainage of untreated and toxic industrial effluents of cities into it. Besides being home to thousands of migratory and local migratory populations of avians, it is also a natural habitat for several species of turtles, snakes and fish.Congress MLA from Ferozepur City Parminder Singh Pinky said efforts were on to attract visitors to Ferozepur disitrict that houses a memorial, where legendary freedom fighters Shaheed Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were cremated.“Infrastructure is being created in Ferozepur for convenience of tourists to the historic gurdwara built in the memory of 21 Sikh soldiers of the Saragarhi battle fought during the British period in 1897. Retreat ceremony by soldiers at India-Pakistan border at Hussaniwala is also being promoted as a tourist must-do,” said Pinky, who has been instrumental refurbishing these projects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/plan-to-create-local-guides-for-harike-fails-to-take-off-101635702024621.html

'Baba mukhyamantri' is an amazing chief minister who has not inaugurated any work done by his government," he said, referring to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.All sections of people have made up their minds to elect an SP government in the assembly elections, following which Uttar Pradesh will get back on the path to growth and prosperity, he added."The BJP is remembering the Iron Man of India, Sardar Vallabhai Patel, today. But if it walks on the path shown by Sardar Patel, then the three farm laws, which it has enacted, should be withdrawn. This will be a true tribute to Patel," the SP chief said.Yadav said Patel fought for farmers and hence, is known as 'Sardar' and 'Iron Man'."The BJP claims that it is walking on the path shown by Sardar Patel, but today the farmers are the saddest," he said.Farmers' income has dipped, there is price rise and the way this government is functioning, every section of society is feeling insulted, he alleged.People across the country paid tributes to Patel on his 146th birth anniversary on Sunday.

The commuters using the road have been complaining of traffic congestion between Kulesra and Sector Ecotech 3 due to the waterlogging at these two points. The 30-km DSC road, also known as Dadri road, begins from Noida-Delhi border at Sector 14A and ends at Dadri after passing through Greater Noida.

31-10-2021||Mumbai||Coastal Road: BMC yet to pay forest department ₹74 crore for marine conservation||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has not fully complied with the terms of coastal regulatory zone (CRZ) clearance granted to its coastal road project, as it is yet to deposit at least ₹74 crore with the state forest department for “conservation of coastal and marine biodiversity”. As per a special condition laid down by the union environment ministry’s CRZ expert appraisal committee in 2017, the BMC is required to pay the Mangrove Foundation of Maharashtra 2% of the project cost to offset the Coastal Road’s environment impact.Officials in the BMC’s coastal roads department, including the chief engineer, deputy chief engineer and executive engineer, did not respond to calls seeking comment on Sunday.Officials in the state forest department’s mangrove cell, however, confirmed that the BMC is yet to pay this amount in entirety. They also said that the BMC has not officially conveyed to the forest department their total cost of the project as on date, making it difficult to exact the payable amount as per updated project costs.“We have asked the BMC to deposit ₹254 crore with us, which is two percent of the total project cost of about ₹12,700 crore, based on newspaper reports. I do not know how much the total project cost is because the BMC has never intimated us about the same,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forests (APCCF), mangrove cell. Of the ₹254 crore, the BMC has so far deposited only ₹150 crore, despite it being mandatory for the entire amount to be paid “on or before commencement of construction”.In 2017, when the project cost was estimated to ₹5,303 crore, the forest department had written to the BMC in June that year asking the latter to deposit a sum of ₹106.6 crore as per the conditions of the CRZ clearance. Of this, the BMC deposited an initial tranche of ₹25 crore on June 12, 2019. Due to escalation of the project cost, the amount to be paid toward coastal and marine conservation has also increased. In October 2020, Tiwari wrote to the environment department with the subject “Non-compliance of... CRZ clearance awarded to MCGM for Mumbai Coastal Road project”.Soon after the MCZMA allowed the additional land to be reclaimed (on December 2) in a post-facto approval, the BMC deposited another tranche of ₹150 crore with the Mangrove Foundation on December 11, 2020, leaving an outstanding of ₹74 crore. The entire amount is to be added to the corpus fund of the Mangrove Foundation, which generates a certain amount of interest every year that is used in running the organisation (which is an autonomous society under the state forest department). “This is a clear violation of the terms of the CRZ clearance, which clearly said that the amount should have been deposited before commencement of construction. The BMC has had to be reminded on multiple occasions, in June 2017 and then February 2019, to deposit the money. The BMC did not show any intention of paying the amount until they needed permission to reclaim additional land,” said Devendra Tandel, president of the Akhil Maharashtra Machimaar Kruti Samiti (AMMKS), who obtained these details via RTI last week.This alleged violation is the third in a string of non-compliances that fisherfolk and experts have highlighted in recent weeks, amid protests by Worli fisherfolk against the project. Over 100 boats from Worli Koliwada have been parked in the alignment of the Coastal Road-Sea Link interchange since early Saturday, disrupting construction work. Fishers have alleged that the project will cut them off from their customary fishing grounds and will force them to shut down Cleveland Bunder, an artisanal fishing port in Worli Koliwada which is at least a 100 years old and houses between 40 to 60 boats. They also say that movement of barges and tugboats in their customary waters has damaged over 60 fishing nets, each costing between ₹70,000 to 1,00,000, and disrupted their activities.In a letter to authorities including the chief minister on October 25, Koli community leaders from the Worli Koliwada Nakhwa Vyavsay Sahakari Society (WKNVSS) wrote, “One of the specific conditions of the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) clearance dated January 4, 2017, was as follows: ‘BMC to ensure that no fishing activity is hampered during construction and operation phase of the project’. Thereafter the final CRZ clearance dated May 11, 2017, was granted by the MoEFCC (Union environment ministry), subject to the following specific condition: ‘Bridges with navigable spans will be provided by the project proponent as committed, so that there are no obstructions to fishing boats’.”In an earlier development, the Akhil Maharashtra Machimaar Kruti Samiti (AMMKS), a state-wide fishworkers’ collective, which has pledged their support to Worli Koliwada’s fisherfolk, also took up this issue with the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC). The latter had in March 2017 provided a no objection certificate (NOC) for the coastal road project to BMC, which is subject to compliance with 14 statutory conditions. “In the 14th condition, MSRDC clearly wrote that if fisherfolk are obstructed from doing their business, and if fisherfolk recorded any objections, it will be considered as violating the terms of the NOC,” said Devendra Tandel, president, AMMKS.The BMC has also been accused of violating the NOC given to the Coastal Road project by the fisheries department, which contains a similar clause. “Despite all these clearances, which assured fisherfolk that our livelihoods will not be impacted, what has transpired in reality is the complete opposite. We will continue our protest and not allow construction work to continue until our demands for a redesign of the coastal road-sea link interchange is met,” said Nitesh Patil, president, WKNVSS.A senior official in the fisheries department, however, said they are aware of the NOC violation by the BMC and will be deliberating on the matter in the next few days. “If there is a violation, an appropriate resolution will be found for the fishermen,” the official said, seeking anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/coastal-road-bmc-yet-to-pay-forest-department-74-crore-for-marine-conservation-101635699805783.html

In Gujarat, 1,084.48ha of the required 1,396ha has been acquired. In Dadra and Nagar Haveli, the acquisition is about 97%, with 933.52ha of the required 955ha been acquired for the corridor.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had earlier questioned if the bullet train project was of any benefit to the state. The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) had appeared “non-committal” on the project after coming to power in 2019.“Land acquisition is going on in Maharashtra and we are expecting to speed up the process and acquire more land in the coming months for the project,” said a senior NHSRCL official.By September, NHSRCL – the authority that will soon undertake the construction of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project – had acquired 30% of land in the state.To push the acquisition process, Union minister of state for railways, Raosaheb Danve, had visited Mumbai last month and interacted with senior officials from NHSRCL, Western Railway, collectors of Palghar, Raigad and Thane districts as well as state government officials. He had also directed the officials to work on increasing the pace of acquisition of the land.The construction work of the bullet train corridor project has started in Gujarat and the first phase between Surat and Bilimora is expected to open by 2026. Of the total 508.17km route of the bullet train, 155.76km is in Maharashtra, 384.04km is in Gujarat and 4.3 km is in Dadra and Nagar Haveli.The estimated cost of the project is ₹1.10 lakh crore, of which ₹88,000 crore will be funded by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/33-land-for-bullet-train-project-acquired-in-maharashtra-101635699804437.html

He also expressed “concern” that men would be “without jobs” and could get involved in “destructive” activities. The governor was addressing vice-chancellors and senior professors at the convocation ceremony of Dr Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth last week, where he also added that there needs to be a “balance” in the society.“Earlier, we saw that girls were behind and we had to bring them ahead, so we made efforts. Even today, we say educate the girl [through programmes such as] ‘Beti Padhao, Beti Bachao’. In reality, we can see that girls are doing a good job today. It’s my prediction, and I have shared it with many people, that in the next 20-30 years, 50% of IAS [officers] will be women due to their sincerity. It shouldn’t be so that our young boys are without jobs, [they] shouldn’t get into destructive things. A balance must remain [in the society], and we must think on these lines,” the governor said, while addressing the convocation ceremony last week.The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and Raj Bhavan have been at loggerheads over several issues in the past two years. The ruling MVA is likely to use Koshyari’s statement to trouble him. Maharashtra State Commission for Women (MSCW) chairperson Rupali Chakankar said that the body would study the statement made by the governor and decide if any action is required.“The progress of women and girls is a matter of pride and needs to be encouraged. I think the state women commission will minutely study the statement made by the governor. We will then think if any action is required,” she said. Chakankar added that the governor’s statement was “disappointing”. “We in public life try to change the opinion of society on such issues. If such a statement came from the governor, then it’s disappointing. Don’t understand why women are repeatedly regarded as secondary citizens through such statements,” she told a regional news channel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/50-of-ias-to-be-women-men-should-not-be-without-jobs-maharashtra-governor-101635698424279.html

31-10-2021||Other||Punjab must review meagre relief for cotton growers: Sukhbir||Mohali Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Sunday asked chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi to review the meagre compensation offered to cotton growers, whose entire crop had been destroyed by Pink Bollworm attack. “Farmers have been demanding a compensation of ₹50,000 per acre, but the Congress government is offering a measly compensation of only ₹2,000 for up to 35% crop damage and ₹5,400 for up to 75% crop damage. The officials also want to ensure they put maximum farmers in this category. This effectively means that even a meagre compensation of ₹12,000 per acre for 100% crop damage will not be available to farmers,” Sukhbir, in town for a road show, from the Siswan T-point to the Marble Market in Mullanpur along with party candidate from Kharar Ranjit Singh Gill. Prem Singh Chandumajra accompanied him. Sukhbir also criticised Channi for failing to even register a protest against the appointment of 1984 genocide perpetrator Jagdish Tytler to a top Congress panel. Asserting that the Congress government had not only back-stabbed cotton farmers, Sukhbir alleged that even farm labourers had been cheated. “The government has defrauded farm labourers by offering them 10% of the total compensation award. No frame work has been made for distribution of this award. We reject this injustice with farm labourers and demand that they be given flat compensation of ₹15,000 per acre.”The SAD president also asked the CM to leave photo-ops and start working for the welfare of the people. “You have only two months at your disposal. You should use them to mitigate the suffering of the people and implement the promises made by your party. Instead of doing this, you are solely indulging in publicity gimmicks.” Interacting with a cross-section of people in Kharar, Sukhbir said it was astonishing that in spite of proximity to Chandigarh, the town did not have all modern amenities. In Nayagaon, he announced that it would be developed on the pattern of New Chandigarh by making it a part of the new township, if the SAD-BSP alliance came to power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-must-review-meagre-relief-for-cotton-growers-sukhbir-101635697465579.html
31-10-2021||Lucknow||Priyanka Gandhi attacks BJP government over Lakhimpur Kheri, Gorakhpur incidents||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Sunday reiterated a series of poll promises and lashed out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Uttar Pradesh over the Lakhimpur Kheri violence that claimed eight lives on October 3. She also raked up the Kanpur realtor murder case in Gorakhpur in September and the alleged shortage of fertilizers in Lalitpur.The Congress leader was addressing her party’s pratigya rally in Gorakhpur on the 37th anniversary of the assassination of her grandmother and former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.“You may have seen (it) time and again. In Lucknow, Vivek Tiwari was shot dead by police. In Gorakhpur, Kanpur businessman Manish Gupta was brutally murdered by police. Neither criminals nor policemen are under control here in UP,” she said.(Apple executive Vivek Tiwari was allegedly shot by constable Prashant Chaudhary near Maqdoompur police outpost, under Gomti Nagar police station limits, in Lucknow on the intervening night of September 28-29 in 2018 when he was in an SUV with an ex-colleague. On September 27, 2021, Kanpur-based realtor Manish Gupta died after a police raid on a Gorakhpur hotel. Six policemen were booked for murder after the Gorakhpur incident.)Priyanka, who greeted the crowd in Bhojpuri, also said, “Things have happened against the ‘vaani’ (teachings) of Guru Gorakhnath.”Guru Gorakhnath is worshipped at the Gorakhnath temple of which Yogi Adityanath is the chief priest.She alleged there was harassment of all sections of the society, including dalits and backwards under the BJP government. Inflation has made survival difficult for people and farmers are debt ridden, she alleged.She also criticised the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) over charges that the Congress was in league with the BJP.Priyanka questioned the “silence” of both the parties and their absence from the ground. The Congress alone was fighting for the poor and the oppressed, she said.“I will die but I won’t ever tie up with the BJP,” she said.She also attacked Union home minister Amit Shah for his recent remark that law and order under the Yogi government has improved to an extent that now binoculars are needed to search criminals. “When Shah was saying this who was standing by him on stage? It was (Union minister of state for home) Ajay Mishra whose son unleashed brutality on farmers in Lakhimapur Kheri. So, he doesn’t need binoculars but the right spectacles,” she said. Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra, the main accused in the Lakhimpur Kheri case, was arrested on October 9.Reaching out to the Nishad community, she announced that a university would be set up in Gorakhpur named after Guru Machhendra Nath and fisheries will be given the status of agriculture if the Congress is voted to power.She reiterated the Congress would give 40% of the party tickets to women in the UP assembly polls. The party has pledged to provide jobs to 20 lakh (0.2 million) youths, free smart phones to class 12 pass girls and free scooties to graduate girls, besides promising to waive farmers’ loans.“The entire loans of the farmers will be waived. Wheat and paddy will be purchased at ₹2,500 per quintal, while sugarcane will be purchased at ₹400 per quintal. The problem of stray cattle will be resolved on the lines of Chhattisgarh, and a complete solution will be evolved,” she said.The Congress general secretary added that government jobs will be given to 20 lakh youths, while contractual workers will be regularised.The anganwadi workers will get an honorarium of ₹10,000, and women will get three free cylinders in a year, she promised.“Apart from this, if voted to power, our government will bear the cost of treatment of any illness up to ₹10 lakh,” she said. She also said that ₹25,000 will be given to families who have lost their livelihood due to Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/priyanka-gandhi-attacks-bjp-government-over-lakhimpur-kheri-gorakhpur-incidents-101635697464309.html

31-10-2021||Lucknow||6 more Zika virus cases in Kanpur, CM asks for strict surveillance||Six more people tested positive for the Zika virus in Kanpur on Sunday taking the tally to 10 in the district. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has asked the health department to ensure strict surveillance to check the spread of the disease, officials said.Instructing officials to increase the focus on controlling infectious diseases, the chief minister said frequent and extensive door-to-door sanitisation and fogging drives should be undertaken to stop the breeding of mosquitoes. “People should be made aware of the preventive measures and must be encouraged to maintain cleanliness,” Yogi Adityanath instructed during a high-level meeting with senior officials in Lucknow on Sunday.The tally has increased to 10 patients in Kanpur, confirmed Kanpur’s chief medical officer Nepal Singh.All of the fresh cases are among the civilians, unlike earlier when three of the four patients were Indian Air Force (IAF) personnel. One of the new patients is a pregnant woman, who has been put under round-the-clock observation.The Kanpur chief medical officer said the area within a three kilometre-radius of a fever patient’s location would be screened. The patient would be monitored for 14 days.“We have increased the sampling and the area to a radius of three km from the earlier two for our operations,” he said.The Uttar Pradesh government will further intensify comprehensive surveillance and implement stringent containment curbs on the breeding of mosquitoes, said a state government press statement.“Since the confirmation of the state’s first Zika virus case on October 22, the testing of samples at a large scale is being carried out to remove the risk of any further spread. So far, a total of 645 samples have been sent to KGMU. Of them, 253 samples have been collected from people with symptoms of fever, 103 samples are of pregnant women,” the statement said.“Out of 507 samples tested, only nine people have tested positive for Zika virus while one patient tested positive from the samples that were sent to NIV Pune. A total of 10 patients have been found infected with the Zika virus so far in Kanpur district of the state,” the statement added.The health department teams have found Zika breeding larva in a park just across the street from one of the patients in Shyam Nagar, Kanpur. He tested positive on Saturday along with two IAF personnel. This patient is in the decoration business and has travelled several times since he started complaining of fever, said the health officials.Additional director (health) GK Mishra said all necessary steps were being taken to contain the spread. Apart from the IAF station, Pokharpur, Pardevanpurwa, Shyam Nagar, Tiwaripur, Om Purwa, Adarsh Nagar, Jagai Purwa localities and parts of Jajmau in Kanpur were being rigorously screened, he said.“We have pointed out 117 mosquito breeding points in these localities and they all have been destroyed. Fifty Malaria control teams are constantly looking out for such points for source reduction,” said Singh.But the anti-larva spray wasn’t effective on the mosquitoes, said a member of the malaria control team.The health teams have found 70 people suffering from fever in Tiwaripur and nearby localities. All of them have been isolated in their houses, said the officials.The people were being advised strongly to use mosquito nets and look for mosquitoes and the places where they could breed. Teams of specialists camping in Kanpur have asked for strict observation of people suffering from fever and special care of pregnant women. At present, 70 teams are visiting 8,000 households with a checklist being used for screening.“People need to protect themselves from the mosquitoes and destroy the source of their breeding in their houses,” the CMO said.Zika is a mosquito-borne virus that spreads through the bite of an infected Aedes species of mosquito named Aedes aegypti. According to the World Health Organisation, Aedes mosquitoes usually bite during the day, peaking during early morning and late afternoon or evening.Meanwhile, in view of the Zika virus cases in Kanpur, health department teams have sent 84 more mosquitoes to National Malaria Research Institute (NMRI), New Delhi by the Shatabdi Express in special boxes. The scientists would genetically analyse these mosquitoes to learn the presence of the Zika virus in them and its lethality. Earlier, the genetic report of 34 mosquitoes caught in Pardevanpurwa and Pokharpur came out negative. These mosquitoes were netted inside the IAF station where the malaria control teams suspect the mosquitoes bred in the storage facility between two hangars. Chief medical officer, Nepal Singh, confirmed sending the mosquitoes to NMRI Delhi for a genetic study, which he said, was crucial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/6-more-zika-virus-cases-in-kanpur-cm-asks-for-strict-surveillance-101635696625784.html

31-10-2021||Patna||Firm to contest LS polls alone, Bihar Congress to launch mega membership drive from today||Firm on contesting the next Lok Sabha elections on its own, the Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) will launch a mega membership drive from Monday to reclaim its support base in the state, party leaders said.The party will strive to induct more than five million members during the drive that will continue till March next year, Congress legislature party (CLP) leader Ajit Sharma said on Sunday.“As declared by the All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge for Bihar Bhakta Charan Das, the party will contest the 2024 LS on its own. We are now focused on rejuvenating our direct rapport with the people and garner their support on the issues of price rise, growing corruption and joblessness,” Sharma said.A senior party leader said the party managed to get more than 1.6 million members during the drive carried out in 2016, when Ashok Choudhary was the BPCC chief. “In 2020, the party launched a digital membership drive just before the assembly elections. However, it did not yield an encouraging result owing to technical glitches. This time, we have again resorted to manual operations to induct fresh members,” BPCC chief spokesman Rajesh Rathore said.A section of the party leaders, however, contended that the results of Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur bypolls would determine the fate of the party, which chose to contest the elections without a tie-up with the RJD. The alliance between the two parties broke up after the RJD unilaterally decided to field its candidates on both the seats, without consulting the Congress.The counting of votes for bypolls will be held on November 2.Former BPCC chief Anil Sharma said the Congress should carry out a vigorous drive to expand its bases, which got eroded over the years due to its excessive reliance on the RJD-led coalition. “It may take some time and require unrelenting efforts of the party workers to win over the people’s confidence, as it was for the fifth time when the RJD broke out of the coalition. Congress was first left to fend for itself by the RJD in 2000, then in February 2005. In 2009 LS polls, the RJD-Congress pact withered away again. The Congress had to contest 2010 assembly polls on its own, as RJD sidelined us again,” Sharma added.AICC member Kishore Kumar Jha argued that RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s lies about his talks with AICC chief Sonia Gandhi sowed the seed of confusion among the masses ahead of the voting. “The way the Congress’s interest was taken for granted by the RJD, people are now seldom taking the grand old party seriously. People still believe that the Congress will join hands with the RJD. This doubt must be cleared and the party workers need to work tirelessly to apprise them about the achievements of the Congress. One can’t turn the wave overnight,” added Jha.In-charge of the membership drive Brajesh Kumar Munnan said block and booth committees would be formed in April while the state committee is likely to be reconstituted by mid-July after the conclusion of the drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/firm-to-contest-ls-polls-alone-bihar-congress-to-launch-mega-membership-drive-from-today-101635695544299.html

Instead, it will harm them. The BSP should maintain a distance from such rainy season frogs.”“Not only the defectors but like rainy season frogs, the names of many such political parties are also being heard whose names were not seen and heard till now. People understand such a game for power. It is not going to have any effect on them. The change is permanent,” she added.On Saturday, six BSP rebel MLAs namely Aslam Raini (representing Bhinga in Shravasti), Mujtaba Siddiqui (Pratapur, Prayagraj), Aslam Ali Chaudhary (Dhalauna, Hapur), Hakim Lal Bind (Handia, Prayagraj), Sushma Patel (Mungra Badshapur, Jaunpur), and Hargovind Bhargava (Sidhauli, Sitapur) joined the Samajwadi Party.Earlier, former BSP state unit president RS Kushwaha and senior party leader Vir Singh had joined the SP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/turncoats-will-only-harm-others-maya-101635695123997.html
31-10-2021||Lucknow||Yogi offers Kabul river water at Ram temple foundation||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath offered water from the Kabul river in Afghanistan at the Ram temple foundation in Ayodhya on Sunday. “A girl from Kabul in Afghanistan had sent water of the Kabul river to Prime Minister Narendra Modi with a request to dedicate it to the Ram temple,” said the chief minister. Adityanath reached Ayodhya along with the water, which was sealed in a small plastic bottle. After reaching Ram Janmabhoomi, the chief minister mixed the water from the Kabul river with Ganga jal (water from the Ganga) and sprinkled it on the Ram temple’s foundation with full Vedic rituals. Two priests were also present on the occasion. “On PM Modi’s instructions, I am here (Ayodhya) to dedicate the water from Kabul river, which has been mixed with Ganga Jal, to the Ram temple,” he added. Before leaving for Ayodhya, the CM told the media in Lucknow that the girl’s gesture (of sending Kabul river water) becomes all the more important because, with the Taliban coming to power in Afghanistan, the freedom of women has been curtailed there.“In such a situation, the girl’s gesture of sending the water of the Kabul river for offering at the Ram temple is highly praiseworthy,” he said. The Ram temple has an international appeal and people from different faiths have expressed their sentiments in different countries in its favour, he said.Adityanath has already said that 12 lakh diyas (earthen lamps) collected from all the 75 districts of Uttar Pradesh will be lit in Ayodhya as part of the Deepotsav celebrations in the pilgrim town on November 3. Adityanath also presided over the concluding ceremony of the Ramayan Conclave at Ram Katha Park. President Ram Nath Kovind had inaugurated the event during his Ayodhya visit on August 29. On the occasion, the CM felicitated the saints of Ayodhya, including Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, chairman of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, who were present at the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-offers-kabul-river-water-at-ram-temple-foundation-101635694644197.html
31-10-2021||Lucknow||Yogi Adityanath: Will those responsible for Ayodhya firing apologise to the nation?||Playing up the issue of the firing on kar sevaks in Ayodhya during the Samajwadi Party (SP) rule 31 years ago on October 30, 1990, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday asked if those responsible for ordering the firing would apologise to the nation. Adityanath was speaking at a social representative meet of the Other Backward Class (OBC) community in Lucknow.“Would those who killed innocent kar sevaks in Ayodhya muster up the courage to apologise to the nation now?” he asked.Adityanath had also made a mention of the Ayodhya firing on the 31st anniversary of the anniversary on Saturday, while the BJP shared a video of the police firing on its official @BJP4UP twitter handle. Earlier on Friday, Union home minister Amit Shah had set the tone for the 2022 UP poll campaign, referring to the Ayodhya firing. He had stated that while the kar sevaks were killed during the SP rule, the dream of a grand Ram temple at Ayodhya was set to be fulfilled under the BJP. Adityanath said the courts, too, ratified the BJP stance on the Ram temple and that is why the temple construction has started in Ayodhya. “A grand Ram temple is being built under the BJP rule. The previous governments, instead of engaging in constructive politics and good governance, focused on firing on Ram bhakts,” Adityanath said. Yogi also claimed credit for establishing the rule of law and said mafia and anti-social elements are behind bars and the supremacy of the rule of law has been established. “This is the time to make all the people aware that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the country has been marching from strength to strength. This is India’s golden era and the country’s global stock is at an all-time high. The Taliban has tormented both Pakistan and Afghanistan, but Talibanis know that if they dare march towards India, air strikes would follow,” Adityanath said. The Samajwadi Party (SP) refused to comment on Adityanath’s query, with party leaders claiming that the BJP, aware of a certain defeat, was busy playing divisive politics. “The BJP would be driven out of UP. The Samajwadi Party organisation is strong. The BJP lost in Bengal and it will lose in UP, too,” said Samajwadi Party vice-president Kiranmoy Nanda. Apart from the one that Adityanath addressed, BJP held two more caste meets on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-adityanath-will-those-responsible-for-ayodhya-firing-apologise-to-the-nation-101635694526488.html
31-10-2021||Lucknow||Two arrested in Uttar Pradesh over pro-Pakistan actions||Two men were arrested in separate instances in Uttar Pradesh for taking allegedly pro-Pakistan actions.In the first case, one man was arrested on the sedition charge for hoisting the Pakistan flag atop his shop in a Varanasi village. The other man was taken into custody in Aligarh for posting pro-Pakistan slogans on social media after the Pakistan cricket team’s victory over the Indian side in a T20 World Cup match on October 24, police officials said.In Varanasi, a 22-year-old tailor was arrested on Saturday after he hoisted the Pakistan national flag on the roof of his shop at Bhavanipur village in the Rajatalab area on Friday, the police said on Sunday.A senior police officer said the locals alleged that Taj Mohammad had put the Pakistan flag on his shop and when some villagers asked him to remove it, he hurled abuses at them and shouted a pro-Pakistan slogan. Following tension in the village, a police team reached the spot and had the Pakistani flag removed, the officer said. Taj fled his house before the police team reached the village, he added.In a statement, the police said the police registered a case against him under Indian Penal Code sections 124 (A) (sedition), 505 (2) (making statement with intent to cause public fear) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke the breach of peace) for shouting the pro-Pakistan slogan and hoisting the Pakistan flag.A police team led by sub-inspector Pankaj Singh arrested him from the Bhavanipur area on Saturday.Ram Ashish, the station officer of the Rajatalab police station, confirmed the accused was arrested.An officer said that during interrogation, the accused claimed that some locals provoked him for his action. The matter is being investigated. In Aligarh, the police arrested Mohd Farukh on Saturday for posting pro-Pakistan slogans on the social media after Pakistan’s victory. The arrest was made after a case was registered at the Akrabad police station of Aligarh.Suman Kanojia, the circle officer for Barla police circle in Aligarh, said, “The complainant had named Mohd. Farukh for allegedly posting objectionable material on social media after India faced defeat in T20 World Cup opening match on October 24. The complaint was verified and the case was registered at the Akrabad police station of Aligarh on Friday.”“The case has been registered at Akrabad police station under section 153A (promoting enmity and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), 295-A (deliberate and malicious act intended to outrage religious feelings), 298 (deliberate intention of wounding religious feelings), 505(1)(b) (inducing to commit an offence against the State or against the public tranquility) of the Indian Penal Code, besides Section 66F (Cyber Terrorism) of the Information Technology (Amended) Act 2008,” the circle officer said. “The complainant had named Mohd Farukh who was arrested on Saturday and a search for his unidentified associate in the case is on,” she added.Another complaint has been lodged against a student for posting pro-Pakistan chats on a WhatsApp group after the match. Police personnel privy to the matter at the Civil Lines police station of Aligarh said the police were verifying the authenticity of the complaint and were yet to register a case.

31-10-2021||Mumbai||Need to revise the discipline lesson, say teachers as schools reopened after 19 months||Getting back to school after around 19 months was a joyous moment for both students and teachers as they missed meeting friends in the classroom, running around in the playground and face-to-face interaction with others owing to virtual classes.The flipside of this happy picture, however, has been the fight to bring discipline back into a classroom. Several teachers are finding it more and more difficult to maintain discipline during offline classes, and at the same time, manage conducting online classes for students sitting at homes for the same subject.“Basic rules of being seated while in class and not interrupting a class while the teacher talks suddenly seem like a task for students. We [teachers] are noticing more and more students with shorter attention span, which is becoming a problem during offline classes,” said Melina Matthews, a secondary school teacher from a state board school in Vashi. She added that many teachers have been facing similar problems.“The first few days we thought that the sudden change in the routine was affecting students, and we gave everyone time to adjust. But increasingly, more and more teachers are finding it difficult to control the classroom. We feel helpless because while we understand that the students are going through a lot, there’s not much we can do to bring things back to normalcy,” said another teacher on condition of anonymity.In August, state minister of school education Varsha Gaikwad announced that offline classes will restart on August 17 for class 5 to class 8 in rural areas and class 8 to class 12 in urban cities by following Covid-19 protocols. This decision was, however, not approved by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation. In the last week of September, Gaikwad announced that after a 19-month break, schools in the state will reopen, starting October 4. In a series of tweets, Gaikwad mentioned that in rural areas, schools will reopen for class 5 to class 12 will resume, while in urban areas schools will reopen from classes 8 to 12. An approval from the local municipality followed and a government resolution (GR), too, was released soon.This was not the first time that the state government had called for reopening of schools. Last November, the school education department had released a similar circular, announcing re-opening of schools for classes 9 to 12 in a phased manner. By January, another circular was released, directing that students from classes 5 to 8 be brought back to school in groups and maintain Covid-appropriate behaviour on campus. Both these circulars, however, were revoked after Covid-19 cases started rising again, and the state government called for another complete lockdown starting mid-April.“Until September, children would sit at home with a phone or in front of a computer screen during the class, and by keeping their video off they were free to roam around during the class as well. Many would respond to questions asked by teachers by quickly searching for information online. Suddenly, coming back to school has left many children feeling bound and frustrated,” said Arundhati Chavan, president of Parent-Teachers Association United Forum. She added that coming back to school has not only shaken students out of their routine but created problems for teachers as well. “Instead of suddenly asking schools to reopen, the government should have waited for schools to conduct some workshops and only then bring back staff and students in a phased manner,” she added.Many schools are also observing that students from the older classes are showing “aggression” in classrooms by constantly back-answering or defying the teachers’ orders. Keeping this in mind, more and more schools are working with counsellors and are conducting workshops for staff as well as students to help them transition into a classroom better.“We knew this process of coming back to school will be difficult for students as well as teachers. So we got our team of school counsellors together to train our teachers first in how to handle students in such a situation. Our teachers have been reaching out to students individually, and sometimes even their families, in order to ensure every student, is easing into the physical classroom set up with as little hassle as possible,” said Kavita Aggarwal, chairperson of Mumbai International Schools’ Association (MISA) and director of DG Khetan School, Malad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/need-to-revise-the-discipline-lesson-say-teachers-as-schools-reopened-after-19-months-101635694464074.html

The complainant, who is an artist and also works for a production company in Andheri told the police that she had been staying in the society for the past eight months along with her female colleagues. In her complaint, the woman claimed that since July 2021, the three accused had been passing comments on the women whenever they entered or exited the society gate.On October 21, a women resident said that when she was entering the building, one of the accused stopped her and asked her to enter her name on the register, at the gate. When the woman replied that she had been staying in the building for eight months, the watchman abused her and passed lewd comments. Irked with the behaviour of the watchman, the woman then contacted her boss who suggested she register a first information report (FIR) against the accused.“Based on the complaint of the woman, we have arrested the three men under sections 354(d) and 506 for molestation and criminal intimidation and are recording the statements of other residents of the society to find out how many more women have been harassed by the accused,” said Sanjay Bandale, senior police inspector of Oshiwara police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/2-watchmen-one-other-arrested-for-molesting-residents-in-oshiwara-101635694224241.html

31-10-2021||Mumbai||Sleep deprivation major cause of accidents on Maharashtra highways: IIT-B Study||Drivers who do not sleep adequately or sleep less than five hours are at a higher risk of causing accidents, revealed a study conducted by Dr Kirti Mahajan and Prof Nagendra Velaga of the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B). The study also states that there is a physiological decline in alertness during the post-lunch hours between 2pm to 4pm and between 1am to 5am. It suggests that drivers should be more cautious while driving in these periods by adopting slower speeds or maintaining larger gaps with other vehicles on the road.The study is pertinent considering the Royal Society for the Prevention of Crashes, 2017, in the United Kingdom, attributed 20% of crashes to driver’s drowsiness. And the World Health Organisation (WHO) states that India contributes to 11% of the 1.35 million deaths and injuries caused by road crashes worldwide.The main objective of the study was to model the response time and total braking time of drivers under partial sleep deprivation compared with no sleep deprivation using a driving simulator. The initial response time and total braking time were analysed in two emergencies where the first condition was of pedestrians crossing a road and the second of vehicles merging into the driver’s direction of a roadway. Parametric accelerated failure time models with Weibull distribution and clustered heterogeneity were used previously to model the time to such events along with controlling for the effects of covariates.Twenty professional taxi drivers and thirty regular drivers drove the driving simulator in a 4-lane divided rural highway representing national highways near Mumbai with monotonous driving conditions i.e., lack of changes in the roadside environment, low traffic density, wider and divided roads, states the study.According to the study, the drivers were required to stop the vehicle as soon as they detected the pedestrians to avoid any accident. In the second event, a truck and a car started merging into the road but did not occupy both lanes. Therefore, the drivers were required to reduce their speed to allow a safe manoeuvre instead of full braking.Changing lanes was not an option to respond as drivers were asked to keep in the left lane at all times unless indicated otherwise. Also, to maintain uniformity in the approach of the ‘parked vehicle crossing event’ for all the drivers, this event was preceded by a ‘single lane changing task’ (placed 3kms before this event in all the driving sessions). This preceding task assured that each driver would follow the ‘right-sided lane’ during this event. This event was followed by another ‘single lane changing task’ to ensure that all the drivers would resume the left-sided lane before approaching any other event in the scenarios.The study is significant considering statistics from Maharashtra Highway Police reports 2,754 fatal accidents between 2019 to June 2021 on four national highways – Mumbai-Goa, Mumbai-Kolhapur, Mumbai-Surat and Mumbai-Agra – in which 3,012 people lost their lives. The data also revealed that from 2019 to June 30, 2021, a total of 12,850 accidents took place on the four major highways connecting Mumbai to other cities.Police officers said even though travel curbs were in place across the country, the fatal accidents have not declined. In 2019, the four major highways reported 2,696 accidents, including 1,084 fatal ones in which 1,166 people lost their lives. In 2020, the figures did not show any vast decline despite the lockdown as 2,158 accidents took place, including 1,114 fatal accidents in which 1,215 people died. This year till June 30, the four national highways have witnessed 1,196 accidents, wherein 621 people have lost their lives.Highway police officers said that 90% of these accidents occurred due to human error on part of heavy vehicle drivers. The most number of accidents however were reported on the Mumbai-Agra and Mumbai-Kolhapur highways, making them the most dangerous road stretches.Researchers from IIT Bombay found that sleep loss resulted in delayed response time of drivers to take evasive action such as applying brakes, removing feet from an accelerator, or decelerating the vehicle. For example, on the sudden appearance of pedestrians on the road, the reaction time of drivers increased by 10% after one night of partial sleep deprivation. “Drivers tried to compensate for such delays with sudden aggressive braking which further increases their crash risk,” states the study.In another emergency event where a truck started merging into the driver’s lane, drivers took 44% higher time than baseline to take any evasive action to avoid colliding into the truck, the study found.The drivers also tried to compensate for their low alertness by adopting slower speeds when driving under sleep loss. However, the number of crashes observed during the sleep loss conditions was significantly higher than the baseline.The study also found that drivers maintained a time gap of 0.65 to 1.08 times smaller from the leading car when driving partially sleep deprived when they were asked to follow another leading car over a stretch of 3 kilometres, and it also found that such drivers made frequent acceleration and decelerations to adjust their speed to avoid collision with the leading vehicle. The study states that there is an increase in the speed variations by 1.28 to 1.34 times during sleep-deprived sessions which increased the risk of a crash.“The researchers observed that drivers were aware of the decline in their alertness and loss of driving controls due to sleep loss condition as they self-reported these decrements during the driving tests. Therefore, the drivers shall take constant rest breaks, caffeine, and water during long journeys on noticing any such symptoms of sleepiness or loss of alertness. Few studies suggest taking a short nap as an effective way to avoid sleepiness or regain alertness,” states the study.The government is also improving the roadside infrastructure by building layover areas and rest stops for drivers. In another study conducted by Dr Kirti Mahajan and Prof Nagendra Velaga from IIT-B with the University of Nottingham, UK, the researchers observed that while driving in monotonous conditions, the drivers can use their in-car infotainment systems or digital voice assistants such as Google, Siri or Alexa to keep them alert.“One of my best friend’s father was driving back to Himachal at late night with his wife after attending a wedding in Punjab. The entire trip was planned to be covered in a day because they took only one holiday to attend the wedding. Uncle had an experience of more than 25 years of driving but unfortunately, he was tired and fell asleep behind the wheel falling off from a bridge. They had a severe injury with his wife witnessing the entire accident and undergoing major surgery. The effects of sleep deprivation can be detrimental to drivers irrespective of their age, experience or a habitual schedule of adequate sleep. Currently, as far as we know there is no such regulation to curb work-rest schedule among car and taxi operators for example Maggie’s law in the State of New Jersey. Therefore, given the high accident statistics and prevalence of taxi operators and hired cabs in India it is even more necessary to take measures to curb the accident rate,” said Dr Mahajan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sleep-deprivation-major-cause-of-accidents-on-maharashtra-highways-iit-b-study-101635691584007.html

According to the corporation, actual work on the riverfront development project has not yet started and only a tender for the Sangamwadi to Bundgarden stretch has been floated as of now. Also, the corporation has taken help from the Central Water and Power Research Station (CWPRS) to design the project.On October 28, the chief engineer of the water resources department of the Pune division wrote a letter to the PMC with reference to civic activist Sarang Yadwadkar’s allegations that the corporation is dumping debris on both sides of the Mula-Mutha river under the guise of the riverfront development project and that this in turn has obstructed the natural flow of the river apart from violating the state government’s orders dated September 29, 1989 and May 3, 2018.The water resources department also warned the PMC against obstructing the natural flow of the river, changing its cross-section, and reducing its carrying capacity. Else, the chief engineer of the water resources department of the Pune division will take action against the PMC. The civic body is solely responsible for construction in the prohibitive and restrictive zone of the river as well as human and financial losses due to flooding.However, environment officer of the PMC, Mangesh Dighe, responded to the letter written by the chief engineer of the water resources department of the Pune division saying, “The PMC has not yet started any physical work on the Mula-Mutha riverfront development project. It is at the tender level. We just floated the first tender of the project.”While Yuvraj Deshmukh, superintendent engineer of the building permission and control department who is also a part of the project, said, “The corporation has consulted with the CWPRS. We have approved the design and incorporated the suggestions in the project. CWPRS gave us a hydrological report. Since 2016, we are discussing every detail and giving presentations to the concerned stakeholders about this project.”According to civic officials, the Mula-Mutha river flows through the PMC, Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), Khadki and Pune Cantonment areas for 44 km. There is 650 hectare land available for development of the green belt of the river which will be given for development to private players to get funds for the project. Out of the 650 hectare, only 75 hectare belongs to the government and the remaining is private. Hence, the PMC will get money in development charges from development of land along the river. The total estimated cost of the project is ₹4,727 crore. In the first three years, the corporation will spend ₹800 crore and the remaining project will be implemented on the public private partnership (PPP) model.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-denies-claims-of-debris-dumping-on-mula-mutha-riverbed-101635690743984.html

This despite the shopping rush at markets pre-Diwali and the reopening of commercial establishments and colleges. The city has reported a marked drop in the number of active Covid-19 cases, as only 731 patients are reported to be undergoing treatment for Covid-19, of which 112 are critical.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, Covid-19 advisor to the state said, “It could be said that the spread has come under control as the number of recoveries supercede the number of new cases. Therefore, the active cases are also going down. We did not see any spike in numbers post Ganpati or Dussehra, when we saw a similar crowd on the streets as we see now. The number of vaccinated people has also gone up, which secures them from the infection. However, we must keep in mind that senior citizens who have got the vaccine could still be vulnerable, so wearing a mask at all times in public places should remain mandatory till there are no active cases in the city.” On Sunday, the number of new Covid-19 cases reported is 57 on Friday, while it was 59 on Saturday and 71 on Sunday. As of now Pune city has 731 active patients of which 112 are critical patients out whom 104 are on oxygen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/no-covid-deaths-in-pmc-for-third-consecutive-day-101635690503945.html

31-10-2021||Mumbai||Centre passed burden of free Covid vax, Central Vista project on people: Sanjay Raut||Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut took on the Centre over the rising fuel prices and inflation in the country, stating that the government is putting the burden of inflation to build the Central Vista project and for the free Covid-19 vaccine drives. Referring to the Union minister of state for petroleum and natural gas Rameswar Teli’s statement, Raut, in his weekly column ‘RokhThok’, said that the Centre is making “fun” of the inflation and soaring prices of fuel and other commodities.Last week, the minister, in a response to a question on rising fuel prices, had said that the prices are increasing because the government provided free Covid-19 vaccines.“Ministers in the [Narendra] Modi government are making fun of inflation. Teli said that the prices of petrol and diesel have increased because of the free Covid-19 vaccines.This means that the burden of the doses of the free vaccine is ultimately put on the common man. Then why are advertisements on free vaccination done, and on whose money? Everyone is stuck on the cruise drugs party [raids]. Everybody is quiet on petrol crossing the ₹100-mark... Raut stated in the column, published on Sunday in Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’.The column added that the Centre showed ₹67,113 crore incurred to provide free vaccines. But the Modi government has earned ₹25 lakh crore through the “taxes” on fuel, it added.The Sena parliamentarian also attacked the Centre saying that the construction of the Central Vista project, costing ₹20 lakh crore, is a burden on the people as it is being done out of “stubbornness”. “In Delhi, the Central Vista project worth ₹20 lakh crore is being implemented out of stubbornness... If the new Parliament, new offices, prime minister’s residence and other things are being built through the burden of inflation on the common citizens, then what use are they of?” he questioned.As a policy, the Maharashtra Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) does not respond to criticism or remarks in Saamana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/centre-passed-burden-of-free-covid-vax-central-vista-project-on-people-sanjay-raut-101635685463506.html

31-10-2021||Pune||Your Space: Implement road safety measures, become responsible drivers||In November 2020, after a major accident on the new Katraj tunnel-Navale bridge chowk road, the Pune city traffic police had conducted a survey of the area along with the officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), and decided to come up with structural and enforcement solutions to the traffic issues on the accident-prone patch. We have submitted a list of 20 corrective measures to NHAI, including installation of signages, reflectors, restructuring of exit and entry points to the road, maintenance of the service roads and repairing of potholes and median damages. The mishap figures so far this year are high partly on account of the merger of the Lonikand and Loni Kalbhor police stations with the city police limits. A majority of the road accidents occurred on the Pune-Solapur and Pune-Ahmednagar highways and the Katraj-Dehu Road bypass. Pune city in the past eight months witnessed at least 140 accidents claiming 145 motorists. Some accidents have claimed multiple deaths. A majority of the casualties is two-wheeler riders — 90 people riding two-wheelers died in eight months. In the corresponding period last year, 95 persons were reported dead in accidents on the city roads. When it comes to the busy Katraj-Dehu road bypass and the two major highway stretches, speeding is an issue and thus the number of fatalities on these stretches is higher. Lonikand has reported 19 fatalities on the Pune-Ahmednagar highway, while Loni Kalbhor reported 16 fatalities on the Pune-Solapur highway. Human error is the main reason behind the accidents at Katraj tunnel and Navale bridge. Rahul Srirame Potholes are hazardous to road safety There are a number of potholes on the stretch of Katraj-Dehu road bypass between Chandani chowk and Warje posing risk to vehicle users. Gaping potholes have developed on the bypass in the past two months and remain unattended. There is a constant fear of accidents on this stretch, as motorists tend to apply sudden brakes on spotting potholes, while heavy vehicles are slow to do so. Not only are the potholes an invitation for an accident, but also cause massive traffic jams on this stretch. Regular commuters dread the prospect of driving on this stretch daily. They have become a cause of worry for people who use the bypass regularly to reach Katraj via Navale bridge. Motorists drive on the bypass under a constant fear of accidents — heavy vehicles do not slow down on the pothole-ridden stretch, while small vehicles apply sudden brakes. Sachin Bhosale Black spots need immediate attention The black spots are where regular accidents are happening. In this case, since 2014, a total of 56 people has lost their lives on this stretch. There are some black spots identified near the turn at Dari Pul bridge, the Swami Narayan temple chowk, the Narhe selfie point and the Navale bridge chowk. Last week, three accidents at different points on this stretch left three people dead and several injured. Many drivers of heavy vehicles, to save fuel, switch off the engine and slide down the slope in neutral gear, where the vehicle control then becomes difficult. These spots need immediate attention to check accidents. Manjusha Joshi Road safety not priority for authorities The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has said that it will conduct a survey of the bridges and flyovers where accidents have been occurring frequently with special focus on Navale bridge area. The decision was taken after elected members of PMC, across party lines, raised the issue at the general body meeting. A survey of these spots would be conducted and report of these accident-prone spots would be drafted in two days and a copy would be sent to the Union government as well as the state government authorities. The blind spots and other problems here would be resolved at the earliest. We believe that this is just another eyewash as Navale bridge has become an epicentre of accidents. As many as 68 people have lost their lives in accidents near this bridge, since it was constructed a few years ago and I do not think there is any room for future repairs.

31-10-2021||Pune||Curtain Call: To watch or not to watch, that is the question||Just two days ago, a live show “Irshaad” of two prominent poets – Vaibhav Joshi and Sandeep Khare – came under fire on social media. It was organised by a leading media house as one of the events in their roster for Diwali. But some people expressed their displeasure over the name. What unfolded over the next day was confusing to say the least. The next day, an artwork of their programme was posted on social media and shared widely. Only this time, the name of the show had changed to something “safer”. There were multiple reactions to this. Some were happy that this happened and felt that it was a victory. Others were vocal about how the artists had given in easily and were spineless. While this was happening parallelly, Vaibhav and Sandeep issued a joint statement. They mentioned that they have been performing this show (under the same name) for nearly five years and that the organisers had hired them to present this particular show. They felt that changing their show just for this occasion will not be right and eventually the show was cancelled. They have decided to continue doing these shows in the future. Sometime in 2006, we had been invited to perform our play named “Lose Control” for a programme organised by a group who were not much older than we were. Just to clarify, this wasn’t a Diwali event. “Lose Control” was a hilarious take on a taboo subject back then and it was pretty popular amongst the youngsters. It was bold, but I can say confidently that it was not vulgar. I was also an actor in this particular play. We started performing and could sense that the nearly 500 strong audience was with us from the very beginning. They were responding at the correct places and their laughter was encouraging our performance too. Nearly 15 minutes into the play we heard some kind of commotion in the wings. We have been trained to concentrate on our performance in any kind of disturbance and continued our acts. But the volume of the voices in the wings started increasing. I could see my co-actors getting distracted too. But we kept performing. It reached a point when one of our backstage members called out to me during the middle of my dialogue! Now there was no option but to stop performing. This was a first for me too. I went backstage, my two co-actors following me. I was informed that there were some people in the audience who had not liked the nature of the play at all and had asked for it to be stopped. I was extremely unhappy about this, but this was after all a private show. We had to do whatever the organiser asked us to. But it did not feel right to leave the audience hanging out there without a clue. So, the entire team went back on stage and with folded hands I apologised to the audience, stating that we had been asked to stop. While we were about to go inside, there was an instant collective reaction from the audience. Many of them wanted the show to go on! The voices kept increasing. Again, this was not my decision to make and I looked at the organiser. He clearly seemed confused and did not understand how to handle this situation. The audience provided the answer. They shouted saying that whoever did not want to watch the show could leave it and those who wished to stay could enjoy the rest of the show. Voices grew in support and the organiser agreed to it too. Immediately there was an applause from the audience. In the faint light, we could see the silhouettes of around seven people leaving from the first row. It seemed like it was the chief guest and his family or friends. The remaining people were still there. We started performing again and it turned out to be one of our most memorable shows! Now that I look back, I realise that the audience had provided such a simple, yet elegant solution. But what struck me the most was that it was organic! Those who wished to watch it stayed back and those who did not went away. We were lucky that night that most in the audience wanted to watch it. I wish the organisers had shown some more restraint in this current situation too. I am not here to play judge and pass a verdict on who is right and who is wrong. But should not every individual be allowed to decide for herself/ himself? Cancelling the show robs the audience of this choice. It has provided a temporary solution, but it cannot be sustained in the long run. .

31-10-2021||Chandigarh||Sunil Jakhar has a 'Capt Saab' twist to Channi govt's no ad on Indira Gandhi's death anniversary||Veteran Punjab Congress leader Sunil Jakhar on Sunday hit out at the Charanjit Singh Channi-led government for not publishing any advertisements in remembrance of late Prime Miinister Indira Gandhi on her death anniversary.Tagging an advertisement of the government released last year under the Amarinder Singh-led Congress government on the occasion, Jakhar wrote, “I can understand BJP trying to erase 'Iron Lady of India' from history but don't we still have a Congress Government in Punjab… I know Capt Saab (as Singh is known) won’t mind my using this PB Govt’s ad from last year, as none appeared today.”I can understand BJP trying to erase 'Iron Lady of India' from history but don’t we still have a Congress Government in Punjab. PS. I know Capt Saab won’t mind my using this PB Govt’s ad from last year, as none appeared today pic.twitter.com/yJSMIYQuPgIn another post on the microblogging site, Jakhar apparently drew a connection with the appointment of Jagdish Tytler as a permanent invitee to the Delhi Congress' new executive committee and wondered if the government’s move to not issue any ad to remember Indira had anything to do with it.“Or is it a case of 'once burned twice shy' - in light of certain appointment two days ago?” Jakhar posted.Tytler was one of the main accused in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in Delhi. Gandhi was assassinated on October 31, 1984, by two of her own security guards.Opposition parties, including BJP and SAD, in Punjab have targeted the Channi led government over Tytler's appointment.On Saturday, BJP leader Tarun Chugh asked Channi and Congress' state unit chief Navjot Singh Sidhu to clarify if they endorsed Tytler’s appointment as a permanent invitee to the committee."Tytler has been named as one of the key Congress leaders in Delhi, but he, Kamal Nath and Sajjan Kumar continue to be the blue-eyed boys of the party in spite of the fact that their role in riots against Sikhs has been always highlighted by many witnesses,” Chugh said.SAD leader Daljit Singh Cheema wanted Channi to tell Punjabis why he gave his “consent” for the appointment of Tytler to a "prestigious" Congress panel.Jakhar had made a cryptic comment three day ago when Channi visited the national capital and AAP leader and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal visited Punjab.“Punjab CM in Delhi, Delhi CM in Punjab, yet again! Must say, at least one of them has got his timing right,” Jakhar had tweeted. Kejriwal had responded with a smile iconBefore the Congress propped up Channi for the top post, Jakhar was among the top contenders after Singh resigned from the post over months-long tussle with Sidhu over power-sharing issues.Earlier this week,  Singh said he was forming a new political party, the name and symbol of which will be shared once cleared by the Election Commission.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jakhar-has-capt-saab-twist-to-channi-govt-s-no-ad-on-indira-gandhi-s-death-anniv-101635673455881.html
31-10-2021||Chandigarh||Finding my breathing space amid information explosion||As I reach for the newspaper this morning, I can’t help wondering if my saturated brain needs more stimulation! The 1,200g vital organ, the seat of intelligence and the real crowning glory, is an endless library with overflowing shelves. Looking back at life, it does seem like my mind has consumed more information than what could be digested, leading to the queer problem of ‘infobesity’. As if the long years of student life when it endured the sheer volume of content wasn’t enough, I chose varied subjects in my teaching years, too. Along with business studies and economics that I was qualified to teach, during the interview itself, I gleefully requested for history and political science, the two most content-heavy subjects. Thereafter, I dived so deep into these subjects while teaching that names, such as Robert Mugabe and Kwame Nkrumah, sounded more familiar than those of the neighbours. Since my childhood, the brain has been busy storing names, places, lyrics, books and authors, important dates, kitchen hacks, basic medical knowledge, home remedies and all information necessary to keep up with our lives, our children and parents, friends, and TV shows. Along with facts, the mind has also been assaulted with pseudo facts, jibber-jabber and rumours, too. After half a lifetime of grabbing every bit of knowledge floating about, the data smog in my head seems just as smothering as the smog that is expected to engulf our state at this time of the year. Plus, my brain is paying the price for having a photographic memory. Though, it is fun to recount to friends the bittersweet but trivial memories associated with them, (“….then you said this and you were wearing that”), I now wonder how many gigabytes of space such memories must be occupying in my brain. What if it runs out of space like a hard drive? Where will I store fresh memories that are stacking up? On top of it, the Swiss army knife of all gadgets that my phone is, subjects me to more new information in a day than a person in the middle ages in his entire life. This information overload (or perhaps filter-failure) has scattered my thoughts and is taking me off my game. Just a couple of months ago, I was able to dissect the Israel-Palestine conflict. And wasn’t that me who was recently elucidating to a class why Kodak and Nokia failed! I could fill up pages to describe the Belgian model of power sharing. All this knowledge seems to have slipped through a sieve. What is the point in storing information if I cannot retrieve it when needed, like while indulging in a heated online debate. I should readjust my focus and reduce the things to the manageable minimum. Just as a good farmer leaves a piece of land fallow to retain its fertility, I would do well to shut my mind to more onslaught of information for a while. For the timebeing, I am no longer interested to know whether the coffee beans at my favourite restaurant come from Columbia or Brazil or whether my face cream has red algae extracts. I will try to be zen-like and let go of the need to know everything.

31-10-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz | A big thank you from Mr Leopard||A stud specimen of a young male leopard with long whiskers flaring upwards, canines curling downwards like glittering crescent moons and measuring an estimated eight feet from nose to tail tip has much to thank for in life. It is now wandering freely in the Dhar forest block of Pathankot due to an extraordinary joint rescue effort undertaken by teams of the Pathankot and Phillaur wildlife divisions on October 24. This was the third such lucky leopard rescued from a conflict situation in Punjab since 2017 and released into the wilderness rather than being packed off to serve life imprisonment in the Chhatbir Zoo. Prior to the visionary policy change introduced in 2017 by the then Punjab chief wildlife warden (CWW) Kuldip Kumar, the fate of Punjab’s rescued leopards was that they were packed off to the zoo where they were stuffed like sardines to satiate the boredom of ogling visitors.Another fine male leopard rescued in a dramatic fashion from Chandigarh’s tony Sector 5 during the Covid lockdown in April 2020 also met with similar positivity from the UT wildlife department. The Sector-5 leopard was bestowed a fresh lease of freedom as it was released in a remote area of the Morni Hills, Haryana. Leopards roaming freely are apex predators of the region’s jungles. By removing them and imprisoning them in zoos under political and public pressure, not only is the jungle’s food chain disrupted but it creates a vacuum, which stray dogs fill to wantonly slaughter wild species. A free, roving leopard exerts a sway of terror in jungles and naturally keeps domesticated hounds at bay. “Our wildlife team undertook a very difficult operation to rescue the leopard in Pathankot and put their life and limb at risk. I asked DFO Pathankot Rajesh Mahajan to have the rescued leopard examined by veterinarians to see whether it was injured. When it was found free of injuries, I directed that it be rehabilitated in the wilderness. Why should we place healthy leopards in captivity?” Punjab CWW RK Mishra told this writer. The Pathankot rescue and release took 13.5 hours and was conducted in adverse hilly terrain, amid unseasonal, inclement weather. The leopard, which was trapped in a clutch-wire contraption used for poaching and guarding crops from wild animals by agriculturists, was concealed in dense bush 500m uphill of village Dorang Koti in Dhar Kalan block. “Our personnel volunteered to climb a tree next to the leopard to get a clear aim for the tranquillising gun. That was risky as we did not know to what extent the leopard had been immobilised by the trap. It was emitting blood-curdling snarls. However, once the tranquilliser took effect, the leopard slid down the ravine that was so steep that its angle was nearly 80 degrees. Two of our staff members then donned ropes around their waist and were lowered down like mountaineers to drag the partially unconscious leopard back to safety as it could have plunged down the ravine to its death,” Mahajan told this writer. “Due to foul weather, we had to use flashlights during the late afternoon as visibility was low due to a sun blackout. After the tranquillised leopard was safely in the cage, all hell broke loose with cold rain and a hailstorm rendering our movement very difficult. The cold made the iron bars of the cage so icy that we found it difficult to grip the cage and carry it back to the waiting transport vehicle below. We were finally able to find shelter after a torturous drive through hail on broken hilly roads and examine the leopard. We released the leopard in the dead of night at 12.30am even as adverse weather pounded our tired bodies. In the adrenaline-packed operation, we had neither eaten nor taken water, we were soaked to the skin with cold rain. We did not have even a moment to spare to relieve our bursting bladders! But the effort was well worth it when we saw the leopard bounding away to freedom,” added Mahajan, for whom it was the seventh leopard rescue in his career.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-a-big-thank-you-from-mr-leopard-101635629882793.html

31-10-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column | A promise unkept but dharma upheld||The war had just ended and the Pakistan army was preparing to surrender. Tasked with a reconnoiter of the venue of the surrender ceremony at Khulna, he was driving to the brigade headquarters when a Pakistani second lieutenant signalled them to stop. Defeated and battle fatigued, the soldier requested to be escorted to his platoon. It was unsafe for him to travel in the land that had overnight become independent and an enemy territory. “My parents had migrated from Hoshiarpur in 1947,” the youngster spoke in chaste Punjabi in order to establish an emotional connect. It was conveyed to the subaltern that irrespective of his ‘Punjab connection’, he would be helped. “Be kind on the enemy, for all you know, their fathers may have fought alongside me in the Great War with the Germans.” He remembered the parting words of his veteran father when he had left for the imminent war. I made my radio operator stand on the open Willys Jeep, hoping that our olive green uniforms, along with my turban, would dissuade the local militia from firing at us. The excitement in his voice was palpable. However, by the time they reached, the Pakistani platoon had been surrounded by a mob armed with swords and sticks giving surly stares. Judging the mood of the moment and sensing trouble, he had to think and act fast. “Joi (Jai) Bangla;” he shouted the greeting of ‘Mukti Bahini’ freedom fighters. The return greetings from the other side came as a great relief in those anxious moments. “We will take these dogs to the river and chop their heads off,” said the mob leader as he narrated the stories of Pakistan army’s alleged atrocities. Being outnumbered, any attempt to dissuade them from doing so could invite trouble, but then leaving the hapless khaki clad soldiers to be butchered was not an option. “Before beheading, wouldn’t it be better to humiliate them and let the entire world see how the ‘rascals’ lay down their arms and beg for mercy in front of TV cameras?” he suggested. The pause and murmur in the mob that followed gave a glimmer of hope. The mob leader deliberated upon the proposal for some time which felt like eons. After a while came a nod of approval, much to the relief of Pakistanis who stood there like plagued sinners unsure of their fate. The platoon “marched off” with weapons to the surrender venue, guarded by Indian troops. The gamble had paid off as his diplomatic skills saved many a life. “I quickly vanished among the milling troops thereby depriving the locals the thrill of the picture I had painted,” he spoke in a flat monotone.“My disappearing was an “un-soldierly” act and I had broken my promise as well,” he said, taking a deep breath. “Do not regret your decision. You may not have kept your word but you certainly upheld a soldier’s dharma,” I said, holding his hand and reassuring him. With every anecdote of life he narrates, I am awe struck of this gentleman, Brigadier Harwant Singh, who in addition to being a role model, is also my father. harrypal71@yahoo.co.in(The writer is a Mohali-based freelance contributor)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-a-promise-unkept-but-dharma-upheld-101635629522829.html

The police arrested the accused, Rajesh Prajapati, from Rafiganj railway station in Aurangabad of Bihar as soon as he alighted from a train. The police have recovered ₹15 lakh from his possession.Daresi station house officer Davinder Singh said they were in process of questioning the accused to recover the remaining money, but he claimed that there was only ₹15 lakh in the bag. The accused, who was working in a hosiery factory in Sundar Nagar, had on October 24 stolen the bag containing cash and fled. A case under Section 381 of the IPC was registered against him. He was in contact with his wife over the phone after the incident, through which the police traced him. Assistant commissioner of police (north) Dharmpal said they had formed several teams to nab the accused. “One of the teams was dispatched to Bihar. The team on Friday arrested the accused from Rafiganj railway station before he could reach his home,” he added. The accused told the police that he had seen his employer keeping cash in a drawer. “Rajesh said he had never seen such a huge amount of money, so he decided to steal it,” the ACP said. The hosiery unit owner has around 150 employees and he has not got police verification of any of the workers done.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hosiery-worker-accused-of-stealing-26-lakh-from-ludhiana-held-in-bihar-101635629041563.html
31-10-2021||Chandigarh||Salubrious Sunday | A reader, but not necessarily a finisher||I was recently interviewing a senior professional on Zoom. Seeing a dense book board behind me, he asked, “So what are you reading currently?” “Three books, actually. Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott. Languages of Truth by Salman Rushdie. And Love, Life, and Elephants by Daphne Sheldrick.” Pop came the question. “So when will you finish them?” Silence. I had no answer. While the interview progressed, I parked the question for my introspection later. When would I ‘finish’ reading a book or even the many books I was reading simultaneously? It was a pretty plain question, right? But I could not get myself to give even a vaguely ambiguous answer, such as in a month or so or over the next two weeks. Any attempt to do that put me in extreme discomfort. And that discomfort got me thinking. The only certain and honest response I could come up with was “I don’t know.” Why? Because I have never looked at books as objects that needed to be finished. Rather, I have always seen books as a companion. A companion with my chai. A companion that I meet during my work breaks. A companion that sits on my lap when I settle down on the rug around sunset. A companion that I hold with both hands at my favourite bench in the garden on Sunday. A companion that I spend time with, every night, under the soft glow of my bed lamp. A companion that sits in my backpack. A companion I turn to whenever I need to find my centre. And while I’m in these periods of companionship, varying between 5 minutes to a few hours, I’m in an alternate world, like many readers, time travelling, dramatising, dreaming. I wonder what the author must think when she or he wrote what they wrote. I imagine the characters saying what they say and occasionally import myself in the story and wonder what I’d say to them in that scene. If my phone rings during that time, I put it away as I am already conversing with my companion. I smell the paper, jump pages, come back to the earlier pages, read the last chapter, and again go back to reading from where I dropped off, read and re-read, following eccentric patterns in a no-rules companionship. And while I am doing all that, the last thing on my mind is, ‘When will this be over!’ ‘By which date will I reach the final page?’ The timeline is something that is a practical reality. The book will finish at some point in time. For some books it may be a day for others it may be months. And for some, it may be never. But that would be a natural fallout and not a guiding factor when I open the first page. Probably, that’s the reason I have never been able to get myself to participate in a 100-books-a-year challenge and so on. I’m not a fast reader who devours one book after another at a speed that is celebrated. But I am not a slow reader too as my reading speed is pretty decent. So, if I had to describe the kind of reader I am, I guess the best-case scenario is, “I’m a reader. A person who reads regularly.” And that’s that. A reader who enjoys the companionship of a book undefined by when it starts and when it ends. A companionship that thrives on reading for the sheer joy of reading. No boundaries, no milestones, no metrics, no race. A companionship that allows one to be a finisher and a non-finisher. anushasingh3@gmail.com ( The writer is a Mumbai-based corporate communications consultant)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/salubrious-sunday-a-reader-but-not-necessarily-a-finisher-101635628982833.html

But soon after Dr Suman Singh took charge as director, the NHM employees were told to either opt for revised working conditions for a hike or work at the same salary with the same working conditions. When they protested, the UT health department terminated the services of 178 employees. “The health department took just two hours to terminate our services. We were not even allowed to enter the hospital. Before retiring, Dr Kang should have clarified the conditions or should have ensured our salary hike in reality instead of just on paper. Our festivals have been ruined despite our services,” said a former NHM employee, requesting anonymity. Chandigarh BJP councillors pin down senior MC official It was a scene straight out of a Bollywood court drama. The “cross-examining” of a senior Chandigarh Municipal Corporation official by angry BJP councillors left everybody stunned at the general house meeting last week. Like an accused facing a team of prosecution lawyers in a “katgarha (witness box)”, the MC official was standing in the well of the House, while the councillors questioned him over the delay in floating tenders for sanitation work in the southern sectors. With no support coming either from his colleagues or Congress councillors, the official cut a sorry figure. He had recently suffered a heart attack and was reduced to tears. During lunch, he was seen being consoled by a few councillors and the MC commissioner. When thieves didn’t even spare soft toys! Thieves struck at the Government Primary School at Naraingarh Jungian in Mohali district on October 28 and took away two LCDs, a sound system with pen drive, a gas stove, drawing material and even soft toys for students. The staff was shocked to see the lock of the door broken when they arrived the next morning. A police complaint has been lodged but there’s no trace of the desperate thieves. Hoax bomb call puts Chandigarh cops to test Chandigarh Police have been conducting mock drills to stay alert but their quick response was put to the test with a bomb call last week. Though the call turned out to be a hoax, it revealed their reaction. During the mock drill, all senior officials are prompt to reach the spot, but when the call of a bomb at a bank in Sector 40 was received, it only brought the station house officer and his team to the spot. The delayed response was attributed to a mock drill at a mall in Industrial Area! When director, schools, relieved her school days Sacred Heart Senior Secondary School, Sector 26, Chandigarh, had put up an eco-friendly exhibition on Friday for which director, school education, Palika Arora was the chief guest.

They did recce of the branch as well to ascertain the number of employees, cash and jewellery kept in the strong room.The police also established a link between the robbers and the perpetrators of a similar robbery bid at Muthoot Finance’s Dugri Road branch on October 16, 2020. All six robbers involved in the crime were from Bihar and had come to Ludhiana to execute robbery, the police said. After entering the branch, the accused told the staff that they wanted to meet the manager who wore glasses, which showed that they had details of the staffers, the police said. They assumed that they would overpower the staff, one manager, three women employees and a security guard, easily, but their plan was foiled after the security guard shot one of them dead. According to the sources, the robbers were fully prepared for a gunfight as they were carrying arms and ammunition with them. The police have found a loaded pistol from the possession of the dead robber along with a magazine and bullets in his pockets. In the last year’s robbery attempt at Muthoot Finance’s Dugri Road office, the police had arrested three accused – Roshan Kumar alias Tatiya, 23; Saurav Kumar, 19, and Kamlesh Kumar, 25, all from Bihar.

It would also help reduce garbage dump load on the civic body, officials said. At a workshop organised at the Panchayat Bhawan under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban) on Thursday, 180 representatives of various schools, officers of the education department and NGOs learnt methods of garbage disposal and segregation. At the kick-off event, teachers and principals were sensitised about the role of institutes in waste management and others by Naresh Bhardwaj from the Green Earth NGO and MC commissioner Dhirendra Khadgata. He said schools have been asked to add proper garbage disposal and segregation as an extra-curricular activity and organise competitions on the topic. Jarnail Singh, executive officer, said a sample set of dustbins would be kept at Baldev Nagar government schools for boys and girls with separate disposal of waste pen-like material and plastic multilayer waste. “The schools will be asked to visit the sample school to understand the process and replicate at their premises with their own funds. We might provide economic help in unique cases,” he said. From November 1, sanitation branch officials will also visit schools to provide training to teachers on segregation and compositing. “Later, teachers will teach students about the cleaning activities and students in return will submit a weekly report to their parents on how they used separate dustbins for their waste disposal. We’ll award best students every quarter through the schools,” Khadgata said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/develop-green-waste-compost-plants-ambala-mc-tells-schools-101635628441828.html

The former sarpanch is also the state public information officer (SPIO) in the case. The commissioner, during a hearing held on October 14, has also ordered issuing a notice to gram sachiv (secretary), Netarpal Singh asking him to explain why disciplinary action should not be initiated against him for not dealing with the application. He has been asked to submit his reply by December 14. The next hearing has been fixed for January 10, 2022. As per the commission’s order made available on Friday, the secretary, who is also the assistant state public information officer (ASPIO), has been asked to furnish the information free of cost to the applicant, Vinod Kumar, within two weeks of receipt of this order. The area BDPO has been asked to ensure compliance with the directions. Kumar said through his application, he had asked for the usage of development funds in his village from 2016 to 2020. However, during the recent hearing, he asked for action against the SPIO and ASPIO for not furnishing the information despite the commission’s order to do so earlier this year. The order reads, “The commission observed that the gram sachiv has given in written on February 5 that the information will be provided within 14 days, which indicates that the information is available in the record, but the same has not been provided by the SPIO intentionally.” It said that a show-cause notice sent to the SPIO, now withdrawn, was also received back undelivered with the remarks of postal authorities ‘refused’ as on October 5. “This again shows that he is deliberately avoiding and not providing the information which violates the provisions of the RTI Act, 2005. Therefore, he has rendered himself for penal action,” it reads. Meanwhile, Chauhan said he was not aware of any such order or fine imposed against him as the panchayat was dissolved on February 27, pending elections. “I had given all information asked twice last year. The applicant has done illegal encroachments in the village due to which he and his family members are trying to intimidate me through such methods,” he said. On being asked about any action on the said encroachment, he said he had filed a complaint with the BDPO for necessary action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mullana-former-sarpanch-fined-rs-25k-for-not-furnishing-information-under-rti-101635628381677.html

Members of the association alleged that an oil base/chemical oil/industrial grade product was being sold illegally through mobile vans in the market in the name of biodiesel.Association president Sandeep Sehgal said, “Due to the availability of this form of fuel at less price than diesel, most of the vehicles have shifted to biodiesel. Oil marketing companies (OMCs) have also registered a massive cut in the sale of high-speed diesel. Motor speed and high-speed diesel vehicles have also shifted to the BS-6 category despite huge government investment. Due to the negligence of the government, low-grade oil is being sold illegally in the market to meet the demand of the market, which needs to be curbed, otherwise, the loss of government revenue will continue.”Sehgal added that the service of delivering fuel door-to-door had been started for those heavy machines or vehicles which could not reach the petrol pump. “But it is seen that government and OMC orders are being flouted openly and their access is being extended to motorable, passenger and agricultural vehicles, which is directly causing loss to the petrol pump owners,” he said and added that action must be taken against those indulging in this.The association also expressed concern over the higher VAT rate in Punjab as compared to Chandigarh. Association’s general secretary Rajesh Kumar said about 1,000 petrol pumps of Punjab adjoining Chandigarh and other states were on the verge of closure. Fuel prices have been increasing for the past four days and Mohali continues to have the most expensive petrol and diesel in the Tricity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/check-sale-of-fake-biodiesel-punjab-petroleum-dealers-urge-govt-101635628323973.html
31-10-2021||Chandigarh||Sunset boulevard| Slacking in golden years may dull the silver||Gather ye rose-buds while ye may, Old Time is still a-flying; And this same flower that smiles today Tomorrow will be dying. Over the centuries, bards have immortalised several songs on youth and age. Typically, these songs extol the bounties, exuberance, vitality, ephemeralness and infinite opportunities associated with youth. However, in this century, those in the ripe years of their lives cannot be written off, thanks to the increase in life expectancy and longevity driven by better diagnostic and medical facilities. Nowadays, seniors, all across the world, are looking at and exploring opportunities hitherto unheard of. In Tier-2 cities such as Chandigarh, the elderly are members of senior citizen clubs. Round the year competitions and talent shows are held out to highlight their singing, dancing and modelling abilities, while the adventurous dare devils also try their hand at activities such as skydiving and scuba diving. In short, life has come a full circle for many. In the midst of celebrating youth and old age, the middle age has somewhat become an age of indifference, and is unequivocally the most neglected stage of life. This period that ranges from the mid-thirties to the late fifties is the great epoch of responsibilities– setting career goals, charting the progress graph, settling down and shouldering domestic responsibilities.By the time, all of one’s personal and professional aspirations are achieved, it is time to monitor the personal and professional targets of one’s children and assist them in realising those dreams and desires. In the humdrum of this existence, we tend to overlook the fact that middle age happens to be the foundation of old age. To enjoy a healthy and comfortable life in the twilight zone, here are a few stepping stones that must be laid in the ‘afternoon of life’– a phrase given by Carl Jung who believed that, “The afternoon of life is just as full of meaning as the morning; only, its meaning and purpose are different.” 1. Stay healthy and fit: I recently read somewhere, “your health is an investment, not an expense.” Remember, investing in monetary assets alone, does not guarantee a happy and comfortable old age. Dig out your walking shoes from the closet now and don them for a better tomorrow. An exercise regimen of 30 minutes a day can do wonders to your body. Generally, people tend to neglect their health or take it for granted in the middle years, what with all the hustle and bustle of life. It is during this period that we tend to acquire lifestyle diseases along with extra layers of fat. Go for a swim once a week, cycling, aerobics, yoga or walking– anything to stay healthy! 2. Take out some ‘me’ time: The world around you – the society, your family and your loved ones – unquestionably needs you and you must answer to their call, but once in a while follow your heart and the golden rule: ‘Be you, the world will adjust’. The heavens will not collapse, should you choose to carve out some time to love and pamper yourself. Once a while, take out some ‘me’ time and do what your heart desires. 3. Develop a Hobby:  It is never too late to develop a hobby, but its best done sooner than later. You are mistaken if you think that one fine day when you are sixty and retired, you will jump out of your bed and declare, “Oh! This is my hobby and I shall now pursue it.” If you do not wish to die of boredom in your ripe age, middle age is the right time to start a hobby. If you already have one, keep the flame burning. Take up cycling, trekking, reading, singing, playing an instrument or anything that interests you. Gardening is an excellent hobby that not only keeps you on your toes but also in close proximity with nature. 4. Take short breaks: ‘What is this life, if full of care, We have no time to stand and stare’. Wordsworth could foresee the life of future generations and therefore recommended taking break once in a while. Spend quality time with your friends and family. Not only does it break the monotony of a busy life but also acts as future investment in the bank of relationships. 5. Go for regular checkups:  Do not ignore your body’s call. During middle age, your body sends you definite signals of forthcoming maladies. Ignore these signals now to regret in the later years. If you do not wish to spend your precious post-retirement years on life-support mechanism, go for a regular full body checkup every six months or at least once a year. 6. Give back to society : A friend once said, “Ever since I got my first salary, I decided to give 5% of it back to society.” You may not be able to contribute financially but you can definitely give something back in the form of voluntary service. sonrok15@gmail.com(The writer is an associate professor at SD College, Ambala Cantt)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sunset-boulevard-slacking-in-golden-years-may-dull-the-silver-101635628202063.html

31-10-2021||Mumbai||Deglur bypoll sees 63% turnout; result on November 2||The Deglur bypoll, which is a fight for prestige between the three ruling parties and the opposition, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), saw a turnout of 63.33%. Congress’s Jitesh Antapurkar, who has been fielded as Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) candidate, is facing BJP’s Subhash Sabne and Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi’s Uttam Ingole. The counting will be held on November 2. The constituency saw good response since morning and had registered 60.95% turnout till 5pm and 48.47% till 3pm. A few voters had complained of disappearance of their names from the rolls in morning. The election machinery had to replace 11 electronic voting machines after they developed glitches. There were 298,353 registered voters, while the election machinery had set up 412 polling booths. “The voting will go on till 7pm. We are expecting the turnout to touch 66% to 67%. There are no major complaints of missing names. Amid the Covid-19 protocol, we had increased the number of polling booths by bringing the number of voters per booth down to 1,000 from 1,500. This may have resulted in the shifting of some names to other booths. We have rigorously implemented the drive for the addition of names of voters ahead of the poll. The EVMs which developed glitches during voting were replaced immediately,” said an officer, requesting anonymity. The election to the Assembly constituency in Nanded in central Maharashtra was necessitated because of the death of the sitting Congress MLA Raosaheb Antapurkar in April this year. The constituency is reserved for Scheduled Caste. Congress has fielded his son Jitesh as the candidate of MVA. The candidate is facing BJP’s Subhash Sabne, who joined the party, defecting from Shiv Sena a day before filing nomination. Prakash Ambedkar-led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi has fielded Dr Uttam Ingole. The MVA candidate believably has an upper hand for various reasons. “Though by poaching Shiv Sena leader and 3-term MLA Subhash Sabne ahead of filing of nomination, BJP tried to turn the table on ruling parties. The defection of Bhaskar Khatgaonkar changed the picture. KHatgaonkar, who has served three terms each in Assembly and Lok Sabha, has sizable influence in the constituency. The Maratha leader who is a hardcore Congress leader had defected to BJP in 2014 but never could be established in the party. His differences with sitting BJP MP Pratap Chikhalikar triggered his ‘ghar vapsi’ which will play in our favour,” said a Congress leader. Nanded is stronghold of Congress and citadel of state minister and former chief minister Ashok Chavan. Most of the local bodies in the district are controlled by the party. The results of the bypoll will have direct bearing on the politics of the leader. Knowing this, the BJP has gone all out to win the election. The BJP leaders have claimed to repeat the history of Pandharpur bypoll in Deglur by snatching the seat from the ruling parties. In May this year, the BJP had defeated NCP candidate which was seen as the major defeat for the state government as the ruling parties had fought it collectively. The results of the bypoll could be an indication of the mood of the people ahead of major local body elections to be held early next year. BJP’s union minister Raosaheb Danve, Bhagwat Karad, state leaders Devendra Fadnavis, Chandrakant Patil, Ashish Shelar campaigned for the party candidate. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, social justice minister Dhanajay Munde, minority minister Nawab Malik (all NCP), Congress’s senior leader Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushilkumar Shinde, Shiv Sena leader and junion minister Abdul Sattar campaigned for Antapurkar. Political analyst Hemant Desai said the bypoll will help the ruling or the opposition parties to score over each other depending upon the result. “Amid the ongoing fight between the BJP and MVA over in the wake of the Aryan Khan drug case and ahead of the forthcoming local body elections, the bypoll results are important. The victory will help them to turn the table on the opponents by giving it the colour of public sentiments. More than anything else, it’s a presige fight for Ashok Chavan as it will be viewed as his victory of defeat,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/deglur-bypoll-sees-63-turnout-result-on-november-2-101635628084433.html
31-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: SI, insurance firm told to pay ₹20.9-lakh compensation to family of accident victim||Three years after the death of a mason in a road accident, the motor vehicle claims tribunal had directed a sub-inspector in the transport battalion, ITB Police, Behlana, Chandigarh, who was driving the vehicle involved in the accident along with the insurance company to pay a compensation of ₹20.97 lakh to the victim’s family. The tribunal presided over by additional district and sessions judge Rajeev K Beri had ordered that the compensation would be paid “jointly and severally” by Santosh Kumar Sharma, posted as sub-inspector in transport battalion of the ITB Police, Behlana, Chandigarh, who was driving the car that caused the accident and Universal Sompo General Insurance Company Limited – that is the insurer of the vehicle. The claim was filed following the death of Vilash Mukhiya, 43, in September 2018 due to the injuries sustained in the accident. The claim was filed by his widow Rambha Devi, 41, and her children. The petition said Mukhiya, who succumbed to injuries on September 8, 2018, was working as a mason with JB and Company, Industrial Area, Phase-9, Mohali. On September 3, 2018, at 6.30 pm he along with his brother was on his way to Khanpur village. He was about to cross the road when a car driven by Sharma coming from the Kurali side hit Mukhiya in which he received a severe head injury and other grievous injuries. He was taken to the Civil Hospital, Kharar, from where he was referred to the PGIMER and then to the GMCH, Sector 32, Chandigarh. He was again referred back to the Civil Hospital, Kharar, where he succumbed to his injuries on September 8, 2018. A case under Sections 279 and 304A of the IPC was registered in this regard. Meanwhile, denying that the accident was caused by him, Sharma said the deceased was hit by some other vehicle. He said he along with drivers of other vehicles had to stop their vehicles on the road because of the jam caused due to the accident on the national highway. He as well as the insurance company had prayed for the dismissal of the petition. However, Joginder Mukhiya, alias Yogi Mukhiya, an eyewitness, said the rashly driven car that hit his brother was driven by Sharma. He said Sharma had briefly stopped before driving away. He had later approached Mukhiya’s family assuring them to bear all medical expenses but later backtracked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cop-insurance-firm-told-to-pay-rs-20-9-lakh-compensation-to-family-of-accident-victim-101635627961646.html
31-10-2021||Chandigarh||PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram retires||Dr Jagat Ram, director, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), retired on Saturday after over four decades in the profession. He served as the PGIMER director for four years and seven months and worked in various other capacities at the institute for 38 years. Dr Ram has been awarded with 35 national and international awards, including ‘Oscar in pediatric ophthalmology’ in Barcelona in 2015 and ‘Best of the Best Award’ in San Francisco in 2013 and again at New Orleans in 2016 for his trailblazing work in the world of cataract surgery. In 2018-19, Dr Ram was also awarded the prestigious Padma Shri by the President of India for his significant contributions in the field of medicine. Joining PGIMER in the department of ophthalmology in 1979 as resident doctor to becoming a prominent faculty in 1994, head of the department in 2015 and finally the director of PGIMER in March 2017, Dr Ram accomplished several exemplary feats during his 42-year-long journey with the institute, which include his visit to USA for a World Health Organisation (WHO) fellowship in advanced phacoemulsification in 1993 and then award of a second fellowship in 1998 in pediatric cataract surgery.In 1994, Dr Jagat Ram introduced the technique of phacoemulsification by replacing the older method of extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE), while working at PGIMER as a faculty member. Almost a year later, he began to use the method to operate patients suffering from cataract blindness and was able to successfully restore their vision. In the last four decades, Dr Ram has successfully conducted over 90,000 cataract surgeries in adult patients and over 10,000 surgical procedures on children. He has also offered free eye-care services in over 130 relief and screening camps in rural areas. However, during the Covid-19 pandemic, Dr Ram was criticised for admitting limited patients to the institute and for delaying the resumption of non-Covid services, especially reopening of the walk-in outpatient department of the institute.“The 42-year long journey in PGIMER is memorable. This is an institute of national importance, and a certain depth of dedication is required to be here where ethics cannot be compromised. Due to our team’s dedication, PGIMER has been the second-best medical institution in the country for four years successively,” said Dr Ram. Meanwhile, Dr Surjit Singh, head, department of pediatrics, PGIMER, has been given the officiating charge for the post of the director, from November 1 (Monday), for a period of six months or till such time the regular director is appointed, whichever is earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pgimer-director-dr-jagat-ram-retires-101635627721925.html
31-10-2021||Chandigarh||Jammu and Kashmir saw lowest Covid cases in 8 months in October||Srinagar Jammu and Kashmir logged 2,724 Covid infections in October, the lowest in the last eight months. This is lowest since February, when the first wave had receded and just 1,935 cases were reported. These two months have reported the lowest cases since March and April last year when the pandemic had started and 614 cases had been recorded cumulatively. In September this year, around 4,011 infections had been reported from the union territory. “There were apprehensions that the third wave might start by September 15. However, those predictions were wrong. God has been kind and there have been few Covid cases and deaths,” said Dr Owais H Dar, consultant at Government Medical College, Anantnag and former general secretary, Doctors’ Association of Kashmir. The monthly deaths also remained low as 10 people have succumbed to the disease in October so far, the same as September. This is the lowest since March and April last year, where there were eight deaths cumulatively. In February, when the first wave had subsided, 21 deaths were logged. In May, when the second wave was at its peak, 1,625 deaths were logged. The UT saw 37 deaths in March, 289 in April, 1,625 in May, 416 in June, 55 in July, 30 in August and 10 in September. Dr Dar said that there are multiple factors for Covid remaining under control in the union territory. “A lot of people got infected naturally in the first and second wave which increased the immunity among the community. Secondly, the vaccination drive was also rigorous. National and international travel is also limited and schools and colleges have mostly been closed which was one of the major factors of containment,” he said. October’s test positivity rate (TPR) in J&K– the percentage of tests turning positive out of the total tests conducted – also dropped to 0.20% from 0.27% in September. If TPR is below 5%, it indicates that the infection is under control in the community. October’s TPR is lowest since the second Covid wave peaked in May. In June, July and August, it was 1.80%, 0.32% and 0.23% respectively. The average daily tests conducted in the union territory have been consistently reducing since July. The data reveals that on an average 43,635 tests were conducted daily in October so far, against 49,374 daily tests in September, 53,359 in August and 56,719 in July. Overall, the union territory conducted 13.09 lakh tests in October (till Oct 30), as against September when 14.81 lakh tests were carried out. In August, 16.54 lakh tests were conducted. The vaccination drive over the past two months has been very rigorous. Around 65 lakh people have been vaccinated in J&K with one or both doses during this period. Experts now hope that the Covid-19 may likely become a seasonal illness similar to flu thatpeaks in fall and winter and its impact in terms of deaths, illness and the need for social isolation will lessen. “Covid-19 pandemic will end at some point, but the virus will continue to circulate in the human population. But, that will happen when the pandemic phase of the virus is over,” said influenza expert Dr Nisar Ul Hassan. “Covid is still in a pandemic phase as infections continue to increase across the globe and many people are still susceptible. Vaccination is critical to end the pandemic phase of the virus,” he said. In October, 31.56 lakh vaccine doses have been administered in the union territory till now. In September, over 33.78 lakh people were jabbed, 18.5 lakh in August, 16.76 lakh in July, 12.36 lakh in June and 9.49 lakh in May. Till October 30, the UT has administered a total of 1.459 doses. The overall number of people who have recovered reached 3,26,836 prompting the recovery rate to reach 98.39%. Since the pandemic started, the overall cases in J&K have reached 3,32,154 and the death-toll has reached 4,432. The Jammu district has the highest number of fatalities with 1,145, followed by Srinagar with 846 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jammu-and-kashmir-saw-lowest-covid-cases-in-8-months-in-october-101635627542429.html

31-10-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali: Poor quality denture lands hospital in soup||For providing a denture of “not of very high quality”, leading to the harassment of a Phase 10 resident amid the 2020 lockdown, the district consumer disputes redressal commission, Mohali, directed the hospital to refund ₹15,000 charged for the denture with 9% interest. Disposing of the complaint filed by GS Chhabra, the district consumer commission directed Guru Harkrishan Sahib (c) Eye Hospital Trust, Sohana, also known as Sohana Hospital, to pay ₹1,500 as compensation for the mental agony and harassment he suffered. Chhabra said he had approached Sohana Hospital for implanting a denture on March 26, 2019 and paid ₹15,000 for the preparation of the denture after persuasion by a doctor at the hospital. He was asked to choose from three dentures of varying costs. He said he visited the hospital eight times for measurements and reshaping. He alleged that on April 8, 2020, while cleaning the denture with a brush and soap solution, the lower denture slipped from his hand, fell on the floor of the bathroom and broke into two pieces. He said on April 8, 2020, as Mohali was under lockdown, it was not possible for him to approach the hospital for repairs of the denture. He had also called the hospital but was told they are closed. Finding no alternative, Chhabra sought the help of the police to collect the broken denture and deliver it to a dental care clinic in Sector 68 from where he got it repaired. He said then again on July 30, while eating fruits, one of the teeth got separated from the denture plate and similarly on August 7, while having breakfast, another tooth also got separated. On October 13, another tooth got separated from the denture plate while he was having breakfast. So, he had to visit a dental clinic in Sector 68 four times during a period of six months for the repair of the denture. Guru Harkrishan Sahib (c) Eye Hospital Trust, Sohana, was issued notice but as none appeared on their behalf, they were proceeded ex parte. ‘Deficiency writ large’ The district consumer disputes redressal commission held “it was incumbent upon the hospital to bring sufficient evidence on file to prove that a very high quality material was used while preparing the implanted denture and there was no deficiency in service on their part.” The district consumer commission added, “In the instant case, it is an admitted fact that the hospital had given three options to Chhabra to choose a denture having three different prices and he opted for the most expensive one. These three options were given by the doctor. This shows that the doctor was fully conversant with the fact that the material used or supplied to her by the hospital was not of very high quality and it was possible that the denture could break even if it falls from very little height. “It is also an admitted fact that Chhabra had to undergo mental as well as physical harassment at the hands of the hospital. Deficiency in service on the part of hospital is writ large.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-poor-quality-denture-lands-hospital-in-soup-101635626161627.html

He is being challenged by Congress’ Rohit Thakur, the grandson of former chief minister Thakur Ram Lal, and Neelam Saraik of the BJP.Congress has fielded the late legislator’s son Bhawani Singh Pathania from the Fatehpur assembly. He will slug it out against BJP’s Baldev Thakur and former MP Rajan Sushant who is in the fray as an independent. In Arki, Congress’ Sanjay Awasthi will compete against BJP’s Rattan Pal Singh.Kinnaur villagers boycott pollsMeanwhile, villagers of three panchcyats in Kinnaur district boycotted the polls in protest against the Jangi Thopan hydropower project and non-implementation of the Forest Rights Act.The three panchayts are Jangi, Apka and Rarang. Gian Kumar, a local activist from Akpa panchcyat, said only four votes were polled in Akpa panchcyat of 298. “Only the polling staff cast their vote,” he said. Notably, the Forest Rights Committee had also given a call to use NOTA in the elections.“No political party is clear about the Forest Rights Act. Most panchayats in Kinnaur are still unaware of their rights. We had given a call to press NOTA button to lodge our protest,” says Jiya Lal Negi, president, Forest Right Act Committee Kinnaur.“Now, election results will revel how many people have used NOTA to protest against power projects,” he added. Voters in Ahlemi, Klans, Jagat, Balmuin and Klah booth of Bharmour area of Chamba also boycotted elections over non-fulfilment of their demands for roads and mobile connectivity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/66-turnout-in-himachal-bypolls-101635626101577.html

He had also slammed the Congress while claiming that many people from the party are in touch with him. On October 19, Singh was quoted as saying by Thukral that he planned to soon announce his political party, and was hopeful of sealing a seat arrangement with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) if the farmers’ issue was resolved.HT was the first to report on October 2 that this development on the cards.Farmers from all across the country, mainly from the states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have been protesting against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act passed by Parliament last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/time-for-rapprochement-over-capt-denies-backend-talks-with-cong-101635622681281.html

31-10-2021||Chandigarh||Pink bollworm attack: Punjab records 34% cotton crop loss||A field inspection ordered by the state government pegged a loss of 34% produce of raw cotton this year due to the pink bollworm attack in the south Malwa region of Punjab.As per the crop loss assessment report submitted by the district authorities, 54% of 7.51 lakh acres of the total area under cotton cultivation was under pest infestation.With 3.03 lakh hectares area under cotton this season, southern Punjab recorded an increase of 17% than last year when the cash crop was sown on 2.51 lakh hectares.In 2020-21 kharif season, Punjab had produced about 50 lakh quintals of cotton. But owing to an infestation of the deadly pest, the state’s loss projection indicates a drastic fall in cotton production this season.According to details released today by the state revenue minister Aruna Chaudhary and agriculture minister Randeep Singh Nadha in Chandigarh, Bathinda is the worst-hit district where almost the entire area of 2.43 lakh acres, the largest cotton-producing district, witnessed damage to the tune of 76-100% of the cotton produce.The entire crop on 1.52 lakh acres in Mansa also falls in the bracket of severe damage of more than 76%.Cotton on 2.39 lakh acre in Fazilka district and another 6,325 acres in Moga and Faridkot reported no case of pink bollworm infestation.Muktsar has 1.01 lakh acre under cotton and the pest attack damaged crop in 5,125 acres. Damage of 76-100% was reported in only 55 acres.Details shared by the Punjab government debunked claims made by the opposition political parties and farmer unions that this season there was almost a complete loss of cotton crop in the entire state.Nabha said the government has granted compensation of up to ₹12,000 and fortunately farmers are getting handsome returns for their remaining 56% produce.“Farmers are holding back their cotton stocks in hope higher rates in the coming weeks. The market is very encouraging and now farmers are being paid more than ₹9,000 per quintals,” said the minister.Farmers getting good returns According to official data of the Punjab Mandi Board, there has been a rise of ₹1,990 per quintal or 27% in the highest prevalent market rates in the last 30 days.On October 1, the highest rate for cotton was ₹7,390. On October 30, one quintal raw cotton reached the all-time high ₹9,380 that was 58% of this kharif season’s minimum support price (MSP) of ₹5,925.On October 1, total of 1.8 lakh quintal cotton was purchased in mandis of different districts of the semi-arid region of the state.On Saturday, Punjab Mandi Board data records sale of 6.23 lakh quintals. In the past one month the daily average purchase of more than 20,000 quintals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pink-bollworm-attack-punjab-records-34-cotton-crop-loss-101635622561375.html

31-10-2021||Chandigarh||Akal Takht acting jathedar completes three years||It’s been three years since Giani Harpreet Singh was installed as the acting jathedar of Akal Takht, the highest temporal seat of Sikhs. However, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has neither appointed a permanent jathedar nor accorded this status to him. The jathedar of Takht Damdama Sahib, Giani Harpreet Singh was given the additional charge of Akal Takht on October 30, 2018. His performance in the past three years has evoked a mixed response from the Sikh masses. Around four years after his predecessor Giani Gurbachan Singh pardoned Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim in a blasphemy case, which made the office of Akal Takht jathedar lose credibility, Giani Harpreet Singh appeared to have regained the trust of the Panth, especially the anti-Badal section, gradually.For instance, he got an overwhelming support from the NRI Sikh community when he visited the UK two years ago. He was invited by managements of various gurdwaras, most of which are anti-Badal. He was also felicitated by pro-Khalistan groups.The acting jathedar was also hailed by the same group back home when he sought a ban on the RSS (parent organisation of Badal-led SAD’s then ally BJP) in 2019, expressed solidarity with Kashmiri activists on the issue of Article 370 abrogation and favoured Pakistan-based pro-Khalistan leader Gopal Singh Chawla during his speech at Nankana Sahib. However, his speech on the SGPC’s 100th foundation day on November 17, 2020, was a turning point that changed popular perception about him, feel many Sikh thinkers that HT talked to. He tried to make a political pitch for the SAD with its top leaders present on the occasion. The jathedar ended up drawing flak for his speech, especially from the Akali splinter groups.His statement in favour of Khalistan on the Operation Bluestar anniversary in 2019 also did not go well with a section of Sikhs and other communities in Punjab.‘Shattered the hopes’Avtar Singh, a UK-based Sikh thinker, says: “When Giani Harpreet Singh was appointed to the top post, he had boldly raised the Panthic voice, which usually stays mum. There was something courageous in him, that was never seen in his predecessors. Initially, he approached all sections of Sikh intellectuals, irrespective of their critical view about the SAD.”However, this kind of “impartial approach” continued only for around a year and a half; thereafter, sentiments of the SAD, not of Panth, started reflecting in his speeches and statements, says Avtar Singh.Sukhdev Singh Phagwara, coordinator of Alliance of Sikh Organisations, says: “He brought a glimmer of hope. He made the quam (community) feel that after a long time, a jathedar is delivering justice to his post. Unfortunately, he stepped back from continuing these actions; thereby shattering these hopes.”‘Accepted by all sections’Meanwhile, the community is facing a situation wherein it has five temporal seats but doesn’t have five jathedars, despite the importance of five in the Sikh faith.SGPC chief secretary (honorary) Harjinder Singh Dhami said as far as Giani Harpreet Singh’s tenure is concerned, he is accepted by all sections of the Panth. “Right now, he has a dual charge. The SGPC will sit together to give the full-fledged charge of Akal Takht to Giani Harpreet Singh, after finding a new jathedar for Takht Damdama Sahib. However, the issue has not been discussed so far.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/akal-takht-acting-jathedar-completes-three-years-101635622141560.html
31-10-2021||Chandigarh||New book highlights Covid impact on Punjab’s economy||A book on the economic impact and lessons to be learnt from Covid-19 pandemic was released by Punjab’s former information commissioner and veteran journalist PPS Gill here on Saturday. Titled “Covid-19 Pandemic and Economic Development — Emerging Public Policy Lessons for Punjab”, the book has been edited by agriculture economists Prof Sukhpal Singh of the IIM, Ahmedabad; Prof Lakhwinder Singh Gill, who retired as the chairperson of economics department at Punjabi University, Patiala; and Prof Kamal Vatta of Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana. The book comprises more than 25 chapters written by leading personalities working in the fields of economics, and includes studies covering issues related to governance, agriculture, agriculture markets, industry, service sector, labour, diaspora, gender, environment, state revenue, Centre-state relationship and public policy. It also suggests some policy measures for the state government. “The Punjab government has set up a committee led by Montek Singh Ahluwalia to suggest a road map for the revival of the state economy during the post-Covid period, which submitted its interim report in July 2020. It is expected to submit the final report anytime soon, though it missed the December deadline. But you can well assess the state of affairs of this committee as it was not having any economist from Punjab,” said Prof Sukhpal. He said the book tries to study how Covid-19 impacted various sectors and what can be done by the state government to improve these sectors. Meanwhile, Prof Gill said that Punjab needs a medium- and long-term strategy to rejuvenate its economy following the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/new-book-highlights-covid-impact-on-punjab-s-economy-101635622083123.html
31-10-2021||Chandigarh||Pink bollworm attack: Punjab govt announces ₹416-crore relief package for cotton growers||The Punjab government on Saturday announced releasing ₹416 crore to compensate cotton growers for their crop loss due to pink bollworm attack, that caused extensive damage in Mansa, Sangrur, Bathinda, Muktsar Sahib and Barnala districts. The announcement was made by agriculture minister Randeep Singh Nabha and revenue and rehabilitation minister Aruna Chaudhary in a joint press conference here. The ministers said that the pink bollworm caused severe damage to cotton crops in Mansa, Sangrur, Bathinda, Muktsar Sahib and Barnala districts. The ministers said this time around, 4 lakh acres out of the total area of 7.51 lakh acres of cotton crop have been damaged by pink bollworm. They said the compensation was being paid at the rate of ₹2,000 per acre for the loss to the extent of 26 to 32%; ₹5,400 per acre for 33 to 75% loss; and ₹12,000 per acre for 76 to 100%loss, which is the highest-ever amount, the ministers claimed. Earlier, farmers were being paid ₹8,000 per acre and pickers 5% of the amount for crop failure, they said. The ministers said 10% of the total compensation would be provided to the cotton pickers and the amount will be sent in the accounts of deputy commissioners before Diwali. The district administration will directly transfer the aid in the bank accounts of farmers. To a query regarding damage caused to crops by recent rains and hailstorm, Chaudhary said the ‘girdawari’ orders have been issued for the assessment of crop loss. As soon as the reports are received from the deputy commissioners, steps will be taken for giving compensation to the affected growers. The deputy commissioners had been directed to send crop damage reports within a week. Nabha said that state-of-the-art technology was being introduced by the government to prevent such losses. Expressing his commitment to the farmers, he said that appointment letters have been issued to 157 members of the families of the farmers who lost their lives during agitation against the agricultural laws. Govt cheated farmers, offered meagre relief: SAD The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Saturday said the Congress government as well as chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi had cheated farmers by offering a meagre and partial compensation despite the widespread destruction of their cotton crop due to pink bollworm attack in the Malwa region. The SAD also condemned the Congress government for failing to announce a financial package for “khet mazdoor” (farm labourers) on the pattern of that announced by the previous Parkash Singh Badal government when farmers had suffered a loss due to whitefly attack. In a statement, SAD kisan wing president Sikandar Singh Maluka said it was shocking that despite a clear-cut demand from the farming community for award of compensation at the rate of ₹50,000 per acre, the Congress government had come out with a partial compensation policy. “It seems the government wants to cheat farmers further as it has kept a measly compensation of only ₹2,000 for up to 35% crop damage and ₹5,400 for up to 75% crop damage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pink-bollworm-attack-punjab-govt-announces-416-crore-relief-package-for-cotton-growers-101635622081326.html

While the number of Covid-19 cases saw a huge spurt during the second wave, the city’s death toll was around 5,000, comparatively lower than the first wave, according to the civic body data.The public health authorities hustled to create new medical infrastructure for a sudden inflow of patients during the first wave. On the other hand, the medical fraternity grappled to treat the infection caused by the new, unknown virus. “There were huge mortalities that time,” said infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava, who is also a member of the Covid-19 task force of Maharashtra. “We were looking at the evidence coming from other countries and trying everything possible to not let patients slip to the critical state and revert the ones who were critical. But when the first wave hit us, we knew nothing about Covid-19,” he said.According to Srivastava, slowly, doctors learnt that none of the drugs was making any difference and found that timely oxygen therapy and good intensive care unit (ICU) support played a key role in reducing mortality. “We became more and more clear that none of the agents and interventions showed any survival advantage barring oxygen support, ICU care and steroids,” he said adding that by the time the second wave hit Mumbai, the treatment strategies were slightly more evolved.Mumbai’s first case of Covid-19 was recorded on March 11, 2020. From 119 cases and 14 deaths that month, the number of cases jumped to 5,904 in April and the death toll climbed to 431. In the following month of May, the number of cases went up to 33,189 and the death toll touched 2,414, the highest during the first wave. Experts consider the period between March to November 2020 as the first wave. Thereafter, the city experienced some respite. Once again, cases began to climb again from the end of February 2021, which is considered as the onset of the second wave.“By the time the second wave hit, the experience of the medical fraternity was much better,” said physician Dr Jalil Parkar from Lilavati Hospital. The use of repurposed drugs like remdesivir and tocilizumab had started during the end of the first wave. Most importantly, there was awareness among people about the symptoms and the need for timely oxygen support. “The starting of the vaccination drive in January 2021 has also played a crucial role in reducing the mortalities in the second wave,” said Parkar.Mumbai’s Covid-19 mortality trend is the opposite of the scenario observed in overall Maharashtra which recorded more fatalities during the second wave. “Mumbai developed a protocol which instilled hope among patients and the city’s streamlined system of allocating beds through war rooms, creating massive jumbo facilities with ample oxygen storage helped during the second wave when the number of cases was much higher,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. “Other parts of the state perhaps implemented different strategies that were not so effective,” he said.Mumbai boasts of much better healthcare infrastructure compared to other parts of Maharashtra. Health activists said that as the virus spread rapidly into the rural parts of the state, patients suffered due to the lack of better health facilities as well as difficulty in accessing them.As the state anticipates a post-Diwali spurt and a third wave anytime soon, will the learnings from the first and second waves help us tide over smoothly? “All our strategies are better evolved now, but whether that’s enough for a third, fourth or fifth wave is something we don’t know,” said task force member Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/first-wave-of-covid-19-claimed-nearly-11-000-lives-in-mumbai-may-2020-was-most-lethal-101635621902678.html
31-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab MLA abuses, threatens official over power theft FIR||Harminder Singh Gill, Congress MLA from Patti assembly constituency in Tarn Taran, has courted yet another controversy after he abused and threatened a subdivisional officer (SDO) of Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) over a phone call for allegedly getting a power theft case registered in Tung village.The incident came to light after an audio clip of the conversation between the two was shared on social media. The exact date of the conversation could not be confirmed, but it took place after the case was registered on October 10. While the SDO has gone incommunicado and made no complaint about the incident, the legislator issued a clarification on Facebook feeling apologetic for his language, though slamming the official for allegedly recording and sharing the conversation. Even last year, the MLA’s purported audio clip had gone viral on social media after he allegedly threatened a station house officer in his constituency for not paying a “courtesy call” to him after taking charge of the police station.The callIn the present case, the audio starts with Patti SDO Sushil Kumar greeting the MLA. The conversation soon turns heated as Gill points to the FIR, ignores the justification provided by the official and starts abusing him. The Congress leader also threatens to get police cases registered against Kumar besides getting him transferred to a location “where he will not even find water to drink”.The MLA and SDO didn’t answer to repeated phone calls for a comment. However, Gill posted a clarification about the incident on his Facebook page, stating: “Officials should serve the people without any greed. The Punjab government has been waiving the pending electricity bills that are in crores, but some officials of the department have unnecessarily been imposing fines... What does Patti SDO want to prove by making my audio viral?”A senior PSPCL official, privy to the development, said Patti subdivision has been facing 70% losses due to power thefts, the second highest in Punjab. “On October 8, the SDO and his team went to Tung village to inspect the installation of a new transformer. In the meantime, they found that two houses had installed ‘kundis’ (illegal connections). When they removed these connections, the occupants and some farmers gheraoed the team and tried to take them captive. The officials, somehow, managed to flee,” said the official, who didn’t wish to be named. Later, a case of power theft was registered against Palwinder Singh and his brother Dawinder Singh, and a fine of around ₹1 lakh was imposed on them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-mla-abuses-threatens-official-over-power-theft-fir-101635621901125.html
31-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab assembly will pass SKM suggestions in toto: CM on scrapping farm laws||Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Saturday spoke to farm union leader Balbir Singh Rajewal to seek suggestions on what should be included in the state government’s proposal to scrap the Centre’s contentious agriculture laws in the upcoming assembly session. A special assembly session has been convened on November 8 to oppose Centre’s notification extending the BSF jurisdiction besides “repealing the three black farm laws”.Channi shared a video of his conversation with Rajewal on Twitter. He can be heard telling the farm leader to share guidelines on behalf of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) to pass them in the Vidhan Sabha. SKM is a coalition of over 40 farmers’ unions to coordinate the agitation against the three central legislations.“The government will pass recommendations of the SKM in toto,” said Channi, claiming that he had suggested to scrap the bills in the Vidhan Sabha during the previous Congress regime (led by Captain Amarinder Singh) as well. “I had sought to reject the three bills but the government officials threatened the dispensation that if Punjab opposes the bills, the Centre might impose President’s rule in the state. But I am not bothered about my government on this issue,” he said. Stop misleading farmers: CaptReacting to Channi’s claims, Captain told him to stop misleading farmers on the issue. “Even my government did all this. We spoke to farm leaders on these laws and passed our own legislations in the assembly too. However, the governor is sitting on them and he will sit on any new law too. Please, don’t mislead the farmers with false promises,” said the former chief minister on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-assembly-will-pass-skm-suggestions-in-toto-cm-on-scrapping-farm-laws-101635621841202.html

Meanwhile, 60 deaths have been confirmed so far, he said. Spread by the bite of an infected female aedes aegypti mosquito, dengue cases start rising every monsoon and peak between September and November. The present outbreak is turning out to be the deadliest in several years.Last year, a total of 8,435 confirmed cases of dengue were reported in Punjab whereas the number was around 11,000 in 2019.The deputy CM said the number of fresh cases is on the decline in the past couple of days and adequate arrangements have been made for the patients at government hospitals. Soni was interacting with the media during the coronation of Rajkanwalpreet Pal Singh Lucky as the chairman of District Planning Board, Amritsar.“It’s been just one month since the Congress formed a new government in Punjab, and around 85% of the promises made with the people have been fulfilled.

31-10-2021||Chandigarh||Solar power PPAs: Tariff needs to be reduced, says Punjab minister||Punjab new and renewable energy minister Raj Kumar Verka on Saturday emphasised the need for reduction of tariff in power purchase agreements (PPAs) for solar power projects. Stating that the pressure of high costs is being borne by the people of Punjab, he directed officials concerned to find legally sound reasoning and methodology for exploring the possibility of reduction in tariff. Presiding over a meeting in this regard, the cabinet minister said that PPAs were signed in three phases about seven years back when the cost of solar power at the national level was much higher. Verka said the state is exploring all ways and means, including possibility of bringing a legislation in the state assembly, to reduce the tariff of these high-cost PPAs as electricity laws are a concurrent subject. “However, there is a need to look at the possibility of reduction in tariff being paid by the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) for these projects in view of the much lower cost of solar power at present,” he said. Giving a complete overview of the PSPCL’s power purchase scenario, its chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) A Venu Peasad said the current power purchase rate is quite low. He said efforts are being made by the corporation for exploring the possibility of reduction in tariff for PPAs signed much earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/solar-power-ppas-tariff-needs-to-be-reduced-says-punjab-minister-101635621781174.html

The department had issued termination letters to 178 contractual NHM employees after they missed their duties on October 27 to protest against the revised working conditions offered against salary hike. “Under the given circumstances and gross misconduct, the mission director took the appropriate decision to terminate services of the 178 NHM staff and the same was ratified. For stop-gap arrangements, staff may be hired from an outsourcing agency for a short period. However, the department need not to mechanically hire fresh staff against the vacancies created under each category because of the termination of contractual appointments. The actual requirement will be ascertained after an exercise of rationalisation and thereafter, due process is to be followed as per NHM guidelines for fresh selection of staff. It must be ensured that the persons whose contractual appointment has been terminated because of misconduct are not considered in the fresh selection process”, said Garg.“The aspect of pay to NHM staff as per the DC rate needs to be re-examined carefully after getting status from other UTs, Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. Till then, the guidelines issued by the central government for service conditions including pay to the NHM staff to be strictly followed”, he added. Meanwhile, NHM employees, who have been terminated, continued their protest outside GMSH-16 for the third consecutive days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-health-department-to-replace-178-terminated-nhmemployees-101635621661416.html
31-10-2021||Chandigarh||DAP shortage: Licences of three shops in Ambala cancelled for 15 days||Amid apprehension among farmers in Haryana over shortage of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP), which is used after cultivation of paddy, the district administration on Friday cancelled licences of three fertiliser shops for 15 days over alleged disparity in stock.The licences of Antaal Beej Bhandar and Laxmi Trading Company in Ambala City and Ram Pesticides in Naneola were cancelled for 15 days, after they were issued show-cause notices that remained unanswered for two days, officials said.According to a statement issued by the agriculture department, it has been observed that a few dealers were involved in the sale of fertilisers to other states and there was a mismatch from POS entries with physical verification at the store. SDM (city) Hitesh Kumar, who carried out the inspection, said that other than a mismatch in the number of 30 bags and non-working of the POS machine, there was no board depicting rates of available fertilisers found at Antaal Beej Bhandar.“At Laxmi Trading Company, there is a doubt of black marketing to other states, as the owner has no record of selling all 400 bags in large numbers, not less than 30 bags to each farmer. In Naneola, there was a disparity of 500 bags and the owner had no reply,” Kumar said.The SDM has also ordered registration of an FIR against Ram Pesticides, Naneola. However, the process is still underway and the copy is not available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dap-shortage-licences-of-three-shops-in-ambala-cancelled-for-15-days-101635621421052.html
31-10-2021||Mumbai||Premier Marathi library in Mumbai grapples with multiple problems||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar has been elected as the president of Mumbai Marathi Granth Sangrahalaya (MMGS), a 123-year-old library which he has headed for 28 years after being elected unopposed every time. The former Union minister’s first election for a post in Mumbai’s largest library had seen controversy over the poll process and allegations that the elected body was eyeing the land parcel that the library has across the city. Today, the library continues to grapple with multiple issues. Besides the shoddy leaky premises, depletion of members, political interference, paucity of funds, underpaid staff and the infighting among members have resulted in one of India’s premier libraries losing out the spotlight.The recent high-profile election, in which Maratha strongman Pawar won by an overwhelming majority, has once again helped in reviving hope for the library which is in a bad shape.Pawar’s opponent in the election, Dhananjay Shinde, who is the general secretary of the Maharashtra Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) contented that the poll was virtually rigged by Pawar and his team to exploit the land on which these libraries stand, especially its Naigaon headquarters that is valued to be around ₹4,000 crore. “The entire focus of Pawar’s team is to redevelop this prime land and hand it over to the builders. This is a prime land in Dadar and this election was manipulated to ensure that opponents of the redevelopment project are eased out. One of India’s prime libraries, which was frequented by scholars in the past, is today in its worst phase as they [members] are just concerned about its redevelopment,” said Shinde.Along with Pawar, his entire panel of seven people, led by former vice-chancellor of Mumbai University Dr Bhalchnadra Mungekar, got elected with an overwhelming majority. However, the opponents contended that just 34 secretaries of its 21 branches were allowed voting rights out of the 6,000 members. “The joke of this election is neither Pawar nor me, who were the contenders, were given the right to vote,” said Shinde.Dr Mungekar responded that redevelopment was inevitable. “Our entire premises is in a bad shape and cannot take repairs anymore. We will need to redevelop it,” he said and accused Shinde and his team of spoiling the whole atmosphere of the library by propagating the revamp angle. “We don’t even have a rough sketch of redevelopment and have not even discussed it with anyone. But our opponents have already accused us of selling the land. As per our system, members from each branch elect their representatives and these representatives form an electoral college. They elect the presidents and vice-presidents. This was precisely what we did, and even the charity commission (the government authority of all non-government bodies that are registered with it) dismissed their complaints and we were elected by an overwhelming majority,” said Dr Mungekar.Real estate experts point that the Naigaon branch is sitting on a “goldmine” of realty development. “This place is in Mumbai’s centre and commands more than ₹35,000- ₹40,000 per square feet rate. A 2-BHK (bedroom, hall and kitchen) will command a price of ₹3.50- ₹4 crore onwards, while a 3-BHK will be priced from ₹6 crore onwards,” said real estate expert Naresh Kewlani, chief executive officer (CEO), Creative Realtors, which deals in real estate in the Island city.Pawar’s opponents contend that his tenure as MMGS president for the past 28 years has been a colossal failure as the library has lost its former glory. “Half of our branches have closed down, and despite having such a large Marathi population, our membership is merely 8,642. MMGS owns Sharda Cinema, which has been shut. Many multiplexes and Marathi film personalities are ready to run it, but our administrators are not ready to give it to them. This place would have served as a good platform for our drama and literary events,” said Right to Information (RTI) activist Anil Galgali.Sharda Cinema, which was once a hub of Marathi cinema frequented by actors such as Sachin Pilgaonkar, Ashok Saraf and Dada Kondke, has been closed since 2019, after MMGS did not extend the lease of the contractor running it.Dr Mungekar puts the onus on the closure of libraries to social factors which has impacted the city as the whole. “The closure of the textile mills was a death blow to the Marathi culture as many migrated out of Mumbai in large numbers. This affected all spheres of the city, including our library,” said Dr Mungekar. “As far as Sharda Cinema is concerned, we are not leasing as we plan to redevelop this land and it will be unfair to the new tenants as they will have to move out when this happens,” he added.MMGS also has high profile trustees, such as Pawar’s daughter Supriya Sule, Shiv Sena parliamentarians Sanjay Raut and Anil Desai and well-known political analyst Pratap Asbe.One of the major problems for MMGS is the pittance funding it receives from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) – the richest civic corporation in India – and well as the state government. In 2019-20, it only received ₹19.68 lakh from BMC and ₹34.00 lakh from the state. It has to cover the salaries of its 101 employees as well maintenance of the premises. The Raj Thackeray-led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) said this shows the hypocrisy of the Shiv Sena-NCP over the Marathi language issue. “The Shiv Sena has been ruling BMC for decades and claims to uphold the Marathi cause. However, they turn a blind eye when it comes to Marathi institutions and the library is the best example, as it’s rotting due to paucity of funds. Pawar has been in power in the state for decades and has still not able to secure a decent funding for the institution he headed. All employees of MMGS are Maharashtrians and they are being unfairly exploited by the management,” said MNS leader Rita Gupta.Despite being a former Rajya Sabha member from the Congress, Dr Mungekar blames the state government for MMGS’ neglect over the years. “The state government just neglected our institution over the years and reduced it to a sorry state. Even we as administrators share a collective blame for such state of affairs. It is unfair to just blame Pawar for all the failures, as it is collective responsibility,” he added.However, he said that this has always been the case with all public trusts. “I agree that staff salaries are less but then they were lesser than this also. In 2017, when I took over, I increased it to the current level. This is, however, a problem with all public trusts,” he added.MMGS, one of the reputed and well known libraries, was founded in 1898. It has a treasure trove with more than 645,569 Marathi books, some of them rare and over 200 years old. The library was used by well-known luminaries such as Lokmanya Tilak, Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar and well-known Marathi scholars. Some of the rare books include ‘Geeta Rahasya’ written by Tilak from the jail in Mandalay, Vishnu Shastri Chiplunkar’s essays, ‘Mao Che Laskari Avahan’ on the 1962 Indo-China War and a book named ‘Maharana Pratap Ani Tyache Purvaj’. It has books written by VV Shirwadkar, Vinda Karandikar, Krishnaji Keshav Damle and Shripad Krushna Kolhatkar.However, over the years, the membership has dwindled to about 8,642 from 11,787 in 2014. There were initially 44 branches, which has now come down to 29. Of these 29 too, only 21 are actively working.Dhananjay Shinde, who has been a member of the library since the 1990s, said, “My aim is to bring back the glory of this centre. The current management is not doing anything and hence, I ran for the elections, even though I knew that I did not stand a chance against Pawar. They have failed miserably to attract the new generation and modernise the library. This place has the potential to become the cultural centre of Marathi literature.”Ganesh N Devy, who is well-known Indian literary critic and a cultural activist, outlined three points with reference to MMGS. “The use of books has reduced across the world and this is not a solitary position in Mumbai. But at the same time, MMGS management should update itself. They need to connect with libraries across the world so that long-distance lending is facilitated,” said Devy, who founded the Adivasi Academy. He said the strength of MMGS is its Marathi connection. “Maharashtrians should come forward to salvage MMGS, which would empower the Marathi language,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/premier-marathi-library-in-mumbai-grapples-with-multiple-problems-101635621301151.html
31-10-2021||Chandigarh||PU may conduct semester exams in offline mode||With Panjab University (PU) already reopening campus for students in a phased manner, there is a possibility that the upcoming semester exams may be held in physical mode.According to sources, the office of the controller of examinations has already been asked by the varsity to make preparations for physical exams this time. However, the modalities are yet to be finalised and it is expected that PU will deliberate on the matter after Diwali.Since the pandemic broke out last year, the varsity has conducted its semester examinations in online mode three times so far, without any invigilation. However, there was criticism over the sanctity of these online exams.A university official said, “As Covid-19 cases have subsided now, we will prefer to conduct the examination in offline mode. If the varsity reopens for all students prior to exams, then we can hold them physically. But, there is no concrete plan as of now.”Before their term ended on December 31, the members of the syndicate had also urged vice-chancellor Raj Kumar to hold semester exams offline. The university has already reopened a number of departments for final-year students of postgraduate (PG) courses and it is expected to reopen for more students after Diwali.According to the academic calendar, the odd semester exams of ongoing batches and first year UG/PG students will start in December at PU as well as affiliated colleges. The classes for ongoing batches had started in August .However, many students are not in favour of offline exams for the current semester, for which they are studying online. They said that most of the syllabus has been completed through online mode and calling students back to campus just two weeks before exams is unjust. “If the university wants to conduct offline exams, it can do so from the next semester after physical teaching is conducted for that semester,” said Nikhil Narmeta, president of National Students Union of India (NSUI), PU.Practical exams from December 17PU has announced that practical examinations for undergraduate batches will be conducted from December 17 to 21 and for postgraduate batches from December 21 to 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pu-may-conduct-semester-exams-in-offline-mode-101635621001193.html
31-10-2021||Mumbai||Pune tops Maharashtra in Covid-19 statistics||While the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic is receding from the state, Pune has emerged as the top contributor in cases as well as deaths. As of Saturday, the district had recorded over 1.1 million cases and more than 19,500 deaths. Mumbai was second in line with over 756,000 cases and more than 16,200 deaths. State health officials have been mulling the reasons behind the rise in Pune’s cases and have found similarities with the 2009 H1N1 outbreak. “The H1N1 outbreak behaved the same way, with a surge in Mumbai initially, but Pune eventually taking the top slot,” said state’s surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate. “We believe that Mumbai’s coastal proximity has a role to play in the way the virus circulates and thrives. Pune’s weather conditions seem more conducive for the virus to thrive. We saw a similar pattern during the H1N1 outbreak as well,” he said. Awate said that the state was closely watching the district’s pattern as the temperature is likely to fall further and a wide difference between the day and night time temperatures was setting in gradually in Pune. Pune’s district health officer Dr Bhagwan Pawar said Pune is land locked and has dry weather, which seems to be conducive for pathogens like the Sars-CoV-2. “We need detailed studies to link the weather pattern in the district and if it lets pathogens thrive. But preliminarily, the weather pattern seems to definitely play a role,” he said. Health activists, however, said that Pune’s medical infrastructure and the strategies to deal with Covid-19 have been extremely weak. “One may link the spread to the weather patterns and climatic conditions, but the reality is that Pune failed at many levels while tackling the pandemic,” said Dr Abhijit More of Jan Arogya Abhiyan. “When the pandemic hit, Pune’s public sector did not have a single medical intensive care unit (MICU). The contact tracing measures in Pune have been weak. More importantly, it had a very centralised approach of allotting beds to patients, which was a complete failure,” he said. According to More, while Mumbai created 24 war rooms in each of its 24 wards, Pune had one centralised war room approach. “The problem became worse when the authorities did not change their strategy by learning from the Mumbai model. They continued with the same centralised model, leaving patients struggling at home. Many patients never heard back from them and had to run from one hospital to another looking for beds. All this led to the widespread of the virus,“ said More adding that Pune eventually crossed Mumbai even as its population density is much lower. As the state anticipates a third wave sooner or later, More said that Pune should rethink its strategies for future spurts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pune-tops-maharashtra-in-covid-19-statistics-101635620710086.html

In 2018, Suryamani called them to the office of the PWD engineer-in-chief in Bhubaneswar to execute the agreement. Later, Suryamani introduced them to Amit as an engineer with PWD,” EOW officials said.The accused used Odisha Niwas in New Delhi to strike a deal and gain the trust of the victims.They also saved the mobile phone numbers of senior IAS, IPS, OAS officers and Judges on their phones to impress people, the EOW officials said.“The accused, Suryamani, handed over two work orders to the complainant, purportedly issued by the assistant engineer in PWD (Civil) for a contract value of over ₹80 crore and asked Jain to pay money on the pretext of expediting the process,” the EOW officials said.The EOW officials said that Jain started to have doubts when a no work order was issued and an RTI was sought about the accused persons. Later, on finding that all documents, including treasury receipts, were fake, he registered a case in connection with the fraud. Gahlot is yet to be arrested. “Several fake orders, agreements, treasury receipts have been seized and it is suspected that the accused might have cheated other persons also,” said EOW SP Dilip Tripathy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-police-arrest-2-for-duping-delhi-businessman-of-rs-1-17-cr-101635619862415.html

Exasperated, Bittu asked police commissioner Gurpreet Singh Bhullar to file a case against him, as being an elected representative, he takes responsibility if a civic negligence endangers lives of residents in his constituency. Bittu, along with local Congress leaders, visited Deep Nagar to inspect the accident site on Saturday. “The road caves-in incident, where two girls were injured, is a serious matter. People are mocking us after the mishap. When I approached the civic body looking for answers, the officials just passed the buck. The responsibility has to be fixed and I have asked the police commissioner to register a case and investigate, so that the culprit is identified,” said Bittu. Bittu said that he first asked MC commissioner Pradeep Sabharwal, who said that zonal commissioner Neeraj Jain was looking into the matter. “Jain told me that some IAS officer is dealing with the issue. Then, I was made to talk to Raman Kumar of B&R branch, who passed the buck to O&M cell. They further shifted the blame to the contractor, with some Bathinda connection. This is so unfortunate and unfair,” said Bittu, while reiterating that there was no politics involved behind his visit and it was due to the increasing incidents of road cave-ins. Interestingly, Bittu carried out his visit at the same time when cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, said to be Bittu’s close confidant, was conducting a meeting with civic body officials at the mayor’s camp office.

Grewal said that instead of digging the road and then carpeting it, a lair of bitumen is being laid over the existing road, thereby elevating the surface its surface which could pose a problem of waterlogging in residential areas and commercial establishments. He said that roads carpeted in such a manner wither away easily. Pvt telecom firms also under scannerWhile leakage in the sewerage is being suspected to be the primary reason behind the road cave-in at Deep Nagar, the reckless drilling and road cutting by private telecom companies for laying fiber optic cables are also being blamed for the problem.The issue came to light during a special meeting being convened by cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu with buildings and road department and the health department, at the mayor’s camp office.Sharing details, Congress councillor Mamta Ashu said during the preliminary investigation, it has come to light that leakage could have occurred due to a damage in the pipeline.“During inspection, two fibre optical cables were seen running on the sewer line. It is being suspected that the drilling of the road for laying the fibre optic cable may have caused damage to the sewerage line which resulted in a leakage and further led to road cave-in,” said Mamta Ashu.Cleanliness driveThe department officials were asked to launch a cleanliness drive across the city to clear debris of construction work. The officials said that with changing weather, the construction material kept outside the house was also leading to a rise in pollution levels.Mamta Ashu said officials have been told to involve residents so that the inner streets are rid of dust and pollution.The officials were also asked to encourage residents to keep their surroundings clean. “It has been witnessed that during the time of Diwali, residents’ carry out construction work and a few residents let the debris stay outside their house.

31-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt makes dengue, malaria notifiable diseases, to help track cases better||The Delhi government has made vector-borne diseases such as dengue, malaria, and chikungunya as notifiable diseases under the Epidemic Diseases Act, making it mandatory for all hospitals and healthcare institutions to report any case that they receive to the government, according to a notification issued mid-October but being implemented from this week.According to the the Delhi Prevention and Control of Malaria, Dengue, Chikungunya or any Vector Borne Disease Regulations, 2021 vide notification dated October 14, 2021, the data provided by the hospitals will be used to map out regions where the diseases are spreading and declare them an “infected” or “threatened” area for focussing mosquito control measures, according to the notification.Any individual or institution violating the instructions such as not following through on breeding control measures or not reporting cases will be liable to be prosecuted under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) that allows up to six months imprisonment and ₹1,000 fine or both, according to then notification.The notification makes provision for appointing a regulating officer who will coordinate with the local bodies, the central government, and implement the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme. A controlling officer for the infected or threatened area will ensure all medical practitioners in the area report the cases, get people in the areas suspected to have the disease tested, carry out survey and take preventive measures, the notification said.Dr BS Charan, head of the integrated disease surveillance programme cell of the Delhi government, said they were ensuring that hospitals not only report not just dengue but all fever cases.“We have also asked all hospitals to share details of the beds available for dengue patients. We have also asked the corporations to collect data and share report of cases every day rather than once a week. It will take some time but everything will be streamlined,” Charan said.The notification gives more powers to the local bodies to implement all mosquito breeding control measures. In addition, it states that contractors at construction sites will be responsible for screening of all the migrant labourers for such diseases.“This will certainly help us in implementation. The notification grants us more powers and no one can now refuse inspections for breeding checking,” according to a senior official from South MCD.So far, 1,006 dengue cases and one death of the disease has been reported. However, officials confirmed that so far six deaths that have been investigated by the death audit committee, which will be added to the toll.The notification of malaria has been a long awaited step, especially as Delhi has targeted elimination of the disease by 2022. This year in June, the then union health minister Harsh Vardhan urged the government to make the disease notifiable to help in accurately tracing cases and identifying areas where the disease was spreading.“Basically, the impact of the notification is that everyone has to report these cases. So, one we get to know the true burden of the disease. Such notification is especially important for a disease like malaria because there are few cases, that may miss the stay and this will help in micro-mapping,” said Dr Kaushik Sarkar, director, Malaria No More-India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-makes-dengue-malaria-notifiable-diseases-to-help-track-cases-better-101635613020688.html

Justice Rekha Palli, while hearing a plea by the worker who had applied for it eight years ago, was informed by the Delhi government that based on the 2011 Census, the Centre has set a limit of 72 lakh ration cards in the city, which stands exhausted.Earlier this month, the court had sought the Delhi government’s stand on why the application for issuance of a ration card by a daily wage worker was pending for eight years.“On the last date, Mr(Gautam) Narayan, learned counsel for respondent nos.2 to 4 (Delhi government and state food supplies and consumer affairs department), was granted time to obtain instructions. Today, he submits that no ration card could be issued to the petitioner as the limit for issuance of 72 lakh ration cards set by respondent no. 1 (Union government), based on the Census of 2011, already stands exhausted and, therefore, the respondents nos.2 to 4 cannot be faulted for not having issued a ration card to the petitioner,” the judge noted in her order dated October 25.“In the light of the stand taken by the Delhi government, it is deemed necessary to have the stand of the respondent no.1, i.e. the Union of India as well,” the order added.The court directed the Centre and the Delhi government to file their counter-affidavits within a period of four weeks and listed the matter for further hearing on January 5.In the plea, the petitioner alleged that in spite of applying for a ration card in September 2013 and making repeated representations, no action was taken by the authorities. The petitioner claimed that she and her family reside in a jhuggi in South Delhi and the ration card issued in her husband’s name in 2005 was unilaterally cancelled by authorities in 2013.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/already-reached-limit-set-by-centre-on-issuing-ration-cards-delhi-govt-to-hc-101635612002060.html

And we stand by that. The president does sit by that strongly".“We want to make sure that no one takes any unilateral action that would disrupt the status quo with regard to Taiwan. That hasn’t changed,” Blinken said.Wang told Blinken that Taiwan is the most sensitive issue between China and the United States. “We require the United States to pursue a real one China policy, not a fake one China policy,” Wang was quoted by the ministry as saying.Blinken and Wang did not discuss a recent Chinese hypersonic weapons test that military experts say appears to show Beijing's pursuit of an Earth-orbiting system designed to evade American missile defences, the State Department official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-warns-china-against-any-unilateral-changes-to-status-quo-around-taiwan-101635698064353.html

A man in his 60s was unconscious and in critical condition after being stabbed, while witnesses also said the attacker had spread fluid around the train and started a fire, according to media.One video uploaded on Twitter and broadcast on NHK showed a steady stream of people running away from a train car where, seconds later, a small explosion caused a fire. Another video showed passengers rushing to squeeze out of the train's windows and onto the platform where the train had made an emergency stop."I thought it was a Halloween stunt," one witness told the Yomiuri newspaper, recalling the moment he saw other passengers running in a panic towards his train car. "Then, I saw a man walking this way, slowly waving a long knife." He said there was blood on the knife. The attack occurred on the Keio express line bound for Shinjuku, the world's busiest rail station, at around 8 p.m. (1100 GMT), media said.Partial service on the Keio line remained suspended late on Sunday, when Japanese voters went to the polls in a lower house election. TV footage showed scores of firefighters, police and emergency vehicles outside the station where the train had stopped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-in-batman-s-joker-costume-terrorises-tokyo-train-10-injured-101635688941426.html

31-10-2021||World||G20 agrees on keeping global warming to 1.5 degree celsius above pre-industrial levels: Report||G20 countries have agreed on the need to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, in language tougher than the 2015 Paris accords, several sources said Sunday.Three sources told AFP that diplomats had approved language for a final summit communique going beyond what was agreed six years ago, when the landmark climate deal called for capping global warming at well below 2 degrees, and ideally closer to 1.5 degrees.The declaration, expected to be released later Sunday, will talk about keeping the 1.5 degrees target "within reach", one source said, without elaborating.Earlier drafts seen by AFP suggested that G20 countries were going to fall short of a firm pledge on the 1.5 figure, but officials worked through the night to toughen up the language ahead of crucial UN talks on climate starting in Glasgow Sunday.The Group of 20 major economies emit nearly 80 percent of carbon emissions, and a promise of action on their part would provide a much-needed boost to the make-or-break COP26 summit.Opening the formal discussions on climate on the second and final day of the Rome summit Sunday, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi urged counterparts to aim high."The decisions we make today will have a direct impact on the success of the Glasgow summit and ultimately on our ability to tackle the climate crisis," he said.He added: "We need to set long-term goals which are consistent with the objectives of the Paris agreement and make short-term changes to achieve them."Experts say meeting the 1.5 degree target -- the most ambitious goal in the 2015 Paris climate deal -- means slashing global emissions nearly in half by 2030 and to "net-zero" by 2050.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g20-agrees-on-keeping-global-warming-to-1-5-degree-celsius-above-pre-industrial-levels-report-101635681445372.html
31-10-2021||World||Japan's ruling coalition to retain power but lose seats: Report||Japan's ruling coalition is on track to retain power but lose seats in parliament, media predictions said after polls closed in Sunday's general election, the first major test for Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.In forecasts based on exit polls, public broadcaster NHK said the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its junior coalition partner Komeito would win between 239-288 of the 465 seats in the lower house.TV Asahi said the coalition was expected to win 280 seats, down from its previous total of 305 -- weakening the dominance of the LDP, which has held power almost continuously since the 1950s.Kishida, 64, became party leader a month ago after Yoshihide Suga resigned just a year into the job, partly due to public discontent over his response to the Covid-19 crisis.Cases have dropped precipitously since a record wave that pushed the Tokyo Olympics behind closed doors, but voters in the capital said the pandemic was a major factor in their decision."The economy is suffering because of the coronavirus, so I compared the politicians' responses," said Chihiro Sato, 38, a housewife and mother of a toddler.But engineer Hiroyasu Onishi, 79, said he was more concerned by "the military threat from China".Kishida has pledged to issue a fresh stimulus package worth tens of trillions of yen to counter the impact of the pandemic on the world's third-largest economy.He has also outlined plans to tackle inequality heightened by the neo-liberal policies of Suga and his predecessor Shinzo Abe, saying he will distribute wealth more fairly under a so-called new capitalism, although the details remain vague.Japan's 106 million voters have "struggled to get excited about the new prime minister", said Stefan Angrick, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics."Kishida will need to convince the public and younger members of his party that continuity does not mean status quo, but rather maintaining what has worked and improving on what has not."Revolving-door riskKishida had set a comfortable target of winning 233 lower-house seats, a simple majority including LDP and Komeito lawmakers.The LDP previously boasted a commanding majority of 276 seats on its own. NHK predicted the party would hang on to between 212-253 seats on Sunday, while TV Asahi said it would win 243, still a simple majority without Komeito.Kishida has not enjoyed a political honeymoon, with approval ratings around 50 percent, the lowest in two decades for a new administration in Japan.In recent decades, votes against the LDP have been split between multiple major opposition parties, but this time five rival parties boosted cooperation in a bid to dent its stranglehold.The LDP wants to put a tumultuous year behind it, but "the fact that they are still having to fight so hard is, for them, highly embarrassing", said Michael Cucek, assistant professor of Asian studies at Temple University."If (Kishida) leads the party into a loss of seats, a clock starts ticking in the minds of his rivals in the party, saying 'maybe he is only a one-year prime minister'," he told AFP.Only five politicians have hung on to the prime minister's office for five years or longer since World War II, including Abe, who was in power from 2012 to 2020 after a previous one-year term.Turnout stood at 31.6 percent as of 6 pm on Sunday, higher than the 30.0 percent at the same time during the 2017 general election, when overall turnout reached 53 percent.As well as vowing to tackle the pandemic and working to boost the middle class, the LDP has said it will aim to increase defence spending to counter threats from China and North Korea.Meanwhile, some opposition parties have emphasised their support for social causes that Kishida has so far distanced himself from, such as same-sex marriage and allowing married couples to have different surnames."I focused on the candidates' policies on same-sex marriage and LGBT issues. I have many friends in gay or lesbian couples. I hope public understanding on these issues will deepen," said 18-year-old Eko Nagasaki as she voted for the first time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japans-ruling-coalition-to-retain-power-but-lose-seats-report-101635680035218.html
31-10-2021||World||Israel, US likely behind cyberattack on gas stations, Iran says||An Iranian general said Israel and the U.S. were probably behind an Oct. 26 cyberattack that paralyzed gasoline stations across Iran, state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported.Initial investigations show “the U.S. and the Zionists” are likely to have been responsible for the “highly complicated” assault, General Gholamreza Jalali, head of Iran’s passive defense organization, said in an interview to state TV on Saturday, according to IRNA. A final identification will be determined after all assessments are completed, Jalali said, adding that investigators were also looking into whether any Iranian institutions were involved.Jalali said the attack bore similarities to cyber strikes on Iran’s rail network and the Shahid Rajaee port, a major trade terminal on the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Iranian officials also blamed the U.S. and Israel for those attacks. Tuesday’s cyberattack targeted software that controls an online payment system used by tens of millions of drivers in Iran to buy state-subsidized fuel at gasoline stations. The strike came near the anniversary of widespread and violent protests against a hike in fuel prices in mid-November 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-us-likely-behind-cyberattack-on-gas-stations-iran-says-101635670556225.html
31-10-2021||World||Five to watch: the big numbers in Japan's general election||Japan's new prime minister, Fumio Kishida, faces his first major test on Sunday as Japan holds a general election that could see his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lose its majority in the powerful lower house.Here are five numbers to watch as Kishida's LDP and junior partner Komeito seek a fresh mandate.233 seats for a majorityKishida has said he wants to maintain a majority - or 233 seats of the 465-member lower chamber - for the ruling coalition, a low-ball target given that the LDP alone held 276 seats before the election was called this month.The coalition is expected to remain in power, but the focus is on whether the LDP can retain a majority by itself.It is expected to lose some seats because of disapproval of its handling of the coronavirus pandemic and lacklustre support for Kishida. Some polls show the LDP could lose its majority, a result that would raise questions about Kishida's ability to hang in for the long term and weaken him ahead of next year's upper house election.261 for stabilitySome media polls suggest the ruling coalition could reach the so-called absolute stable majority of 261 seats - enough for it to take all the parliamentary committee chairs and maintain a majority on each committee, making it easy to push through bills.Treble for Japan Innovation PartyThe reform-minded Japan Innovation Party (JIP) could treble the number of its lawmakers as its support base expands from the western city of Osaka and surrounding areas to the rest of the country, several surveys have shown.The JIP, which held 11 lower house seats before the election was called, could win up to 36 seats, an outcome that could make it the third-biggest party in the chamber, the Asahi daily said, bolstering its influence in national politics.Although the JIP is in opposition, like Kishida's LDP it is in favour of revising the U.S.-drafted, post-war constitution and letting the defence budget break away from a narrow range around 1% of GDP to increase Japan's security posture.A strengthened JIP could also put more national focus on Japan's drive to build casinos. The party is in favour of casinos and Osaka last month picked MGM Resorts International and partner Orix Corp to build what could be Japan's first casino.10% Female lawmakersWomen accounted for 10% of lower house lawmakers before the chamber was dissolved this month, far behind France's 40% and 27% in the United States.Japan comes 120th in the World Economic Forum's global gender gap report, due mainly to limited presence of women in political leadership.Thirty-three women are on the LDP ticket, accounting for 10% of its candidates in the election, while the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan has fielded 44 female candidates or 18% of its candidates.53.7% - Voter turnout last timeVoter turnout came in at 53.7% in the 2017 general election, the second-lowest in post-war Japan, meaning nearly half of the electorate failed to exercise their right to vote.A higher turnout typically favours the opposition. Polls have suggested turnout will be slightly higher than the post-war record low of 52.7% in 2014.The youth turnout was particularly low in 2017, with only three out of every 10 people in the 20-24 age bracket casting votes. As a result, lawmakers tend to pay more heed to the needs of the elderly, who are far more likely to vote in ageing Japan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/five-to-watch-the-big-numbers-in-japan-s-general-election-101635677723275.html

However Ali, who finished not out on 25 off just seven balls, hit four sixes to win the match for his team.The match was played in the backdrop of the Taliban seizing power in Afghanistan for a second time, in August. Pakistan, on its part, has faced allegations of aiding the Taliban in its power grab, a charge which Islamabad has repeatedly refuted.

31-10-2021||World||COP26: World leaders set to kick off UN climate summit in Glasgow||The UN climate summit in Glasgow formally opens Sunday, a day before leaders from around the world gather in Scotland’s biggest city to lay out their vision for addressing the common challenge of global warming.The meeting will see negotiators from almost 200 countries try to tackle issues left hanging since the 2015 Paris climate accord was forged, and find ways to ratchet up their efforts to keep global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) this century compared with pre-industrial times.Scientists say the chances of meeting that goal, agreed in the French capital six years ago, are slowly slipping away. The world has already warmed by more than 1.1C and current projections are for it to hit 2.7C by the year 2100.The amount of energy unleashed by such planetary warming would melt much of the planet's ice, raise global sea levels and greatly increase the likelihood and intensity of extreme weather, experts warn.Many of the issues being discussed during the Oct. 31-Nov. 12 talks have been on the agenda for decades, including how rich countries can help poor nations tackle emissions and adapt to a hotter world. The slow pace of action has angered many environmental campaigners, who are expected to stage loud and creative protests during the summit.The opening day of the talks is expected to focus on procedural issues. One big worry is that not all the delegates will be able to meet in person, as the venue and room capacities have been limited due to COVID concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cop26-world-leaders-set-to-kick-off-un-climate-summit-in-glasgow-101635670945241.html
31-10-2021||World||Japan votes in national election as PM Kishida seeks public mandate||Voters in Japan headed to the polls on Sunday to elect a new lower house of the national parliament where Prime Minister Fumio Kishida seeks to maintain his party's majority.The election is a test for the new premier who took over as the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party a month ago.Kishida became party leader and prime minister after Yoshihide Suga resigned just one year into the job.The LDP-led government has faced criticism for its mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic.The new government will face the task of steering the world's third-largest economy battered by the pandemic, tackle a fast-aging and dwindling population and security challenges from China and North Korea.Kishida called the election soon after taking the top job to shore up his mandate in the 465-seat lower house.Electoral victory with setbacks?The LDP currently holds 276 seats, but opinion polls show it may be on the brink of losing its sole majority in the lower house for the first time since 2009.While Kishida is expected to remain prime minister, observers say the ruling party will likely lose seats and may have trouble retaining its commanding majority.The 64-year-old premier did not have a political honeymoon, with his approval rating lagging at around 50%, the lowest for a new administration in two decades.He has promised to issue a fresh stimulus package worth tens of trillions of yen to counter the impact of the pandemic.Stability or return to revolving-door era?A weakened majority for the LDP could mean further losses in the upper house election next summer.While the LDP has held power almost continuously since the 1950s, only five politicians have hung on to the prime minister's office for five years or longer.A poor showing could embolden Kishida's rivals within the party, threatening to return Japan to an era of short-lived administrations.The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, the biggest opposition group, is expected to gain seats but will be nowhere close to toppling Kishida's coalition.Handling of the pandemicThere has been a major public discontent over the government's response to the coronavirus pandemic.Japan initially lagged behind other developed nations in the vaccination drive. But it soon caught up and now more than 70% of the population is fully vaccinated.While infections have dropped sharply, some voters remain wary."It's hard to say the pandemic is completely snuffed out and society is stable, so we shouldn't have any big changes in coronavirus policy," said Naoki Okura, a doctor, after voting in Tokyo."Rather than demanding a change in government, I think we should demand continuity."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-votes-in-national-election-as-pm-kishida-seeks-public-mandate-101635664329202.html

But the situation was quickly exacerbated by limited staffing levels and then snowballed over several days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/american-airlines-cancels-hundreds-of-flights-over-staff-shortage-101635650389373.html

None of the train's passengers or crew were hurt, Amtrak said.The North Charleston Fire Department said the SUV was heavily damaged when police arrived at the marked crossing early Saturday after the collision was first reported to emergency dispatchers shortly before 2:30 a.m.Three of the dead in the vehicle were pronounced dead at the scene, and a fourth person was taken to a hospital. None of the four were identified and there was no immediate update on the condition of the survivor.Amtrak spokesperson Olivia Irvin said in an email that Auto Train 53 was traveling from Lorton, Virginia, just outside the nation's capital, to Sanford, Florida. Twelve of its cars had passengers.There were 474 passengers but no reported injuries on board, Irvin wrote. The Amtrak train was able to make a controlled emergency stop after the collision.The train was delayed for several hours and resumed its journey just before 8:30 a.m.Damage to the train is being assessed by Amtrak representatives.

31-10-2021||World||If non-recognition of Afghanistan govt continues...: Taliban's message to US||The Taliban called on the United States and other countries on Saturday to recognise their government in Afghanistan, saying that a failure to do so and the continued freezing of Afghan funds abroad would lead to problems not only for the country but for the world.No country has formally recognised the Taliban government since the insurgents took over the country in August, while billions of dollars in Afghan assets and funds abroad have also been frozen, even as the country faces severe economic and humanitarian crises."Our message to America is, if unrecognition continues, Afghan problems continue, it is the problem of the region and could turn into a problem for the world," Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told journalists at a news conference on Saturday.He said the reason the Taliban and the United States went to war last time was also because the two did not have formal diplomatic ties.The United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001 following the Sept. 11, 2001, attack after the then-Taliban government refused to hand over al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden."Those issues which caused the war, they could have been solved through negotiation, they could have been solved through political compromise too," Mujahid said.He added that recognition was the right of the Afghan people.While no country has recognised the Taliban government, senior officials from a number of countries have met with the movement's leadership both in Kabul and abroad.The latest visit was by Turkmen Foreign Minister Rasit Meredow, who was in Kabul on Saturday. The two sides discussed the speedy implementation of the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline, Mujahid said earlier on Twitter.China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, met Taliban officials in Qatar earlier this week. Mujahid said on Saturday that China had promised to finance transport infrastructure, and to give Kabul's exports access to Chinese markets via neighbouring Pakistan.Mujahid also spoke at length about the issues facing border crossings, particularly with Pakistan, which have seen frequent closures and protests in recent days. The crossings are crucial for landlocked Afghanistan.He said serious talks on the matter were held when Pakistan's foreign minister had travelled to Kabul last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/if-unrecognition-of-afghanistan-govt-continues-taliban-s-message-to-us-101635643659492.html
31-10-2021||World||‘First target is Pakistan’: ISIS-K aims to go global, impose Sharia law, says report||Afghanistan's ISIS Khorasan (ISIS-K) also known as Daesh, has said that its hardline goal remains the implementation of Sharia law and warned that whoever in the world went against Islam and the Quran will have to face the terror group's wrath."Our first target is to destroy Pakistan because the main reason for everything in Afghanistan is Pakistan. When the Taliban were here (even as the previous government still reigned), they were saying that we control 80 per cent of the country, but they were not implementing Islamic rulings. That's why we stood up in we started (ISIS-K) over here in this area," knewz quoted Nazifullah, a member of ISIS-K as saying.According to him, Afghanistan has gone from bad to worse since the Taliban - who he accuses of "destroying the country" took the helm some two-and-a-half months ago."We want to implement Shariah Law. We want to implement the way our Prophet was living, the way he was clothed, the dressing hijab was there. Currently, we don't have much to fight. But if you give me anything, I am going to fight Pakistan now," knewz quoted Nazifullah as saying.Knewz notes that Nazifullah is wanted by everyone from US troops and the now-defunct Afghan Security Forces and the Taliban.Since August 15, ISIS-K has waged a deadly spate of suicide attacks and targeted bombings across multiple provinces and claimed dozens of lives. While some assaults have targeted the Taliban, the vast majority have been inflicted upon innocent civilians, particularly the minority Shia population.Most of the recruits of the ISIS-K "are believed to have defected from the Taliban branches in Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan, seeking an even more extreme interpretation of Islam with more international rather than domestic-centered goals of 'caliphate' control."Like others who have joined ISIS-K, Nazifullah said he too joined as he was tired of the lack of truthfulness of the Taliban."We kept asking the Taliban to show us a video of Mullah Omar, but we couldn't get any. That is why Daesh here was created. They seemed truthful and said they were going to implement Shariah Law, so that is why I joined them," knewz quoted Nazifullah as saying.Notably, the founder of the Taliban had died in 2013 which was kept a secret for nearly two years. The supreme leader of the Taliban, Haibatullah Akhundzada is being kept under the veil as well.Nazifullah, 24, further said that ISIS-K has the ability to wreak havoc on the state of Afghanistan despite being outnumbered by the Taliban, according to knewz. The number of Taliban operatives on Afghan soil is estimated to be nearly around seventy thousand whereas the ISIS terrorists are believed by the US intelligence to be around two thousand mark.To establish this point, ISIS has started the targeted attacks not only on the Taliban but also on the civilians after the Taliban takeover on August 15. The biggest such instance was the suicide attack on the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul.However, the ISIS member said that he was unclear about the number of ISIS terrorists in Afghanistan as he was locked in the Bagram prison, arrested by the Afghan government until he was freed by the Taliban after sweeping into power.The terrorist further revealed that he had pledged his allegiance to Abu Bakr Baghdadi who is now reportedly dead.Upon becoming a Daesh, members are sent for training to eastern Nangahar province and Nazifullah revealed that the group has been joined by an international cadre of jihadists coming from China, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Iran, and Russia.The Taliban, however, has been denying the presence of ISIS on Afghan soil and claims that they have been defeated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-target-is-pakistan-isis-k-aims-to-go-global-impose-sharia-law-says-report-101635641775126.html

The report was given to President Joe Biden in August. ODNI oversees 18 intelligence agencies such as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), National Security Agency (NSA), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency.The slim 17-page document bears out the key findings that were widely reported back in August: that the Sars-CoV-2 emerged and infected humans through a small exposure no later than November, 2019, and the first cluster of infections was reported in December; the virus was not developed as a biological weapon or genetically engineered, and the Chinese did not have foreknowledge of the virus before the outbreak.But, the community remains unclear on the key question of the origin of the pandemic—the main task assigned to them by Biden in May.The report also gives details of the discussion and disagreements within the intelligence community on the findings, without identifying the agencies.Four of them and the National Intelligence Council assess with “low confidence” that initial infection was most likely caused by “natural exposure to an animal infected with it or a close progenitor virus—a virus that probably would be more than 99 per cent similar to SARS-CoV-2”.One agency assessed with “moderate confidence” that the first human infection “most likely was the result of a laboratory-associated incident”, probably involving experimentation, animal handling, or sampling by the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is at the centre of the controversy.Analysts at three agencies remained unconvinced about either hypotheses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-origin-probe-impossible-without-china-s-help-us-intel-101635615422439.html

31-10-2021||India||After 9 months in BJP, Rajib Banerjee rejoins TMC||Former West Bengal minister Rajib Banerjee on Sunday returned to the Trinamool Congress (TMC) after a nine-month stint with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Expressing regret over his decision to join the BJP ahead of the assembly elections, Banerjee joined the ruling party in the presence of TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee at a party rally in Agartala. “I am repentant now. I am ashamed that I did not listen to Abhishek Banerjee who tried to talk me out of my decision to join the BJP. There was a misunderstanding and I got carried away. I was made to believe that the BJP would usher in development and progress. I do not want people to make the same mistake and regret. I have many friends and relatives in Tripura. Every time they heard me talking about the success of the BJP, they called me to say how they are suffering in their (BJP) regime,” he told the crowd. Referring to chief minister Mamata Banerjee as “goddess” and “our mother”, Banerjee said: “I failed to recognise her. She has transformed Bengal. BJP ruled-states are copying her social welfare schemes.” On January 22, the former forest minister resigned from the Mamata Banerjee-led Cabinet just before the crucial March-April assembly elections. On January 29, he drew much attention when he carried home a large photograph of the chief minister while vacating his chamber at the state assembly. He also broke down after tendering his resignation as minister to governor Jagdeep Dhankhar. A day later, he, along with four other rebel TMC legislators, joined the BJP in presence of Union home minister Amit Shah in Delhi. The TMC, however, swept to power for the third time by winning 213 out of the 292 seats in the elections. Banerjee also lost the Domjur assembly seat in Howrah, which he had earlier won twice since 2011, when the TMC first came to power. Banerjee, who had been maintaining silence and distance from the BJP since his poll loss, was inducted in the national executive committee of the BJP on October 5. While this appeared like an attempt by the national leadership to retain him in the party, the action triggered strong resentment in the BJP’s Bengal unit. The former BJP MLA, however, was not welcomed by a few TMC leaders, especially those with whom he had differences in the past. “I don’t know why he was brought back after Abhishek Banerjee said in public that there is no place for traitors in the TMC,” Lok Sabha member Kalyan Banerjee said. Reacting to Banerjee’s latest move, BJP chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said: “BJP leaders and workers in Bengal stopped thinking about Rajib Banerjee a long time ago. He is not a subject of discussion for us.” “It was known for a long time that Banerjee was trying to find a way to return to the TMC. Our party inducted TMC leaders randomly and gave them star treatment. This disillusioned old and dedicated BJP workers,” BJP national secretary, Anupam Hazra, who is also a former TMC Lok Sabha member, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-9-months-in-bjp-rajib-banerjee-rejoins-tmc-101635703645880.html
31-10-2021||India||India highlights north-south divide in emissions on day 1 of COP 26||On the first day of the Glasgow climate change conference (COP 26), India highlighted the large disparity in historical emissions of rich or developed countries and developing countries like India.The Climate Change Group at MS Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) launched a Climate Equity Monitor, an online dashboard for assessing equity in climate change mitigation.Union environment minister, Bhupender Yadav, said the monitor will encourage discussion on issues related to equity and justice at the ongoing climate negotiations.“Welcome the scientific initiative, Climate Equity Monitor, (https://t.co/KzqShJ1Ggt) which went live today. Its focus on equity & climate action from a data and evidence-based perspective will encourage vigorous discussion on the crucial issue and engage experts from all nations,” he tweeted on Sunday. PM Narendra Modi is likely to address COP 26 and over 120 world leaders on India’s actions to mitigate climate change during the World Leaders Summit scheduled on November 1.The Climate Equity Monitor has a stark map of carbon credit/ debt which shows all the northern countries, including the United States, Russia, Australia, most European countries, have exceeded their fair share of the global carbon budget. Carbon debt, according to the monitor, is the difference between the actual cumulative emissions for a country and its fair share of the global carbon budget already consumed. The values for developed countries clearly indicate their responsibility and the massive carbon debt they owe the world, it states. On the other hand, the southern countries including India, China, Africa, South America and others highlighted in blue indicating that they have generated credits by consuming less than their fair share.A fair share of the carbon budget is defined as the share of the cumulative emissions based on the share in the global population.The monitor also has an interactive graph on historical emissions which indicates China, followed by the US and the EU, have the highest historical greenhouse gas emissions, the monitor was jointly developed with the Natural Sciences and Engineering department at the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS) Bengaluru.“The Climate Equity Monitor is aimed at monitoring the performance of Annex-I Parties (developed countries) based on the foundational principles of the Climate Convention, namely equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC). The performance and policies of the Non-Annex-I Parties (developing countries) will be also provided for comparison,” a statement by the union environment ministry welcoming the launch of the monitor said. CBDR RC is a principle under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which acknowledges different capabilities and differing responsibilities of individual countries in addressing climate change based on their social and economic conditions.“In keeping with the latest scientific results of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that have underlined the importance of cumulative emissions and carbon budgets, the analysis will be anchored in these two concepts. The equitable sharing of the global carbon budget is the fundamental equity principle that will underpin the assessments that will progressively appear on the website. Existing “tracking” websites on climate policies are based in the global North and routinely do not address the crucial aspects of equity and differentiation. Other websites, according to the researchers, bury the key issues in complexities that are not transparently dealt with,” the ministry further said in its statement.Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) had recently flagged that China is currently the world’s biggest emitter – it has increased its share of global CO2 emissions from 5.11% in 1990 to almost 21% in 2019. According to a recent analysis by CSE, in the coming ten years, China will take up 33% of the remaining carbon budget of 409 GtCO2 and India may occupy only 9.54% of the budget. Between 1870 and 2019 China occupied 13.4% of the global carbon budget; India 3.16% and the seven historical polluters— United Kingdom, United States, European Union-27, Russia, Japan, Australia, and Canada occupied 60.53% of the carbon budget. The share changed quite a bit between 1990 and 2019 when China occupied nearly 21% of the carbon budget. This means China went through a very intense phase of development mainly dependent on fossil fuels during those 20 odd years. “We cannot compare India and China. It’s time we de-hyphenated the two,” Sunita Narain, director general, Centre for Science and Environment, said during a recent briefing to climate journalists.Meanwhile, the Climate Action Tracker also released an analysis on India’s role in climate change mitigation on Sunday. It suggested that coal should be phased out globally, and in India by 2040, to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C. Early retirement of older coal power plants and re-evaluation of the coal pipeline – would align India with the level of policies and action consistent with its own “fair share” contribution to the Paris Agreement. Such measures in India would very likely result in a 1.5 degree C compatible rating by CAT, it said.“We estimate that this reduction in coal-fired capacity, in the absence of additional efficiency measures, would require 160–320 GW of additional renewable capacity to India’s previously communicated 450 GW by 2030 goal. India is likely to achieve, and may even over-achieve, the 450 GW goal, including hydro, under current policies,” the CAT said.HT reported on September 17 that India’s nationally determined contribution (NDC), which was rated as 2 degrees compatible or “almost sufficient” by the Climate Action Tracker until August, had rated India as “highly insufficient” in its action and policies on climate change in September. This is because Climate Action Tracker had updated its rating system. CAT is supported by several foundations and governments including the European Climate Foundation and the German Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-highlights-north-south-divide-in-emissions-on-day-1-of-cop-26-101635703228108.html
31-10-2021||India||In concluding remarks at G20, Goyal calls for need to do more to achieve net-zero emission||Developed countries will have to do more to achieve net-zero carbon emissions and to provide low-cost finance and technologies to developing nations for climate transition, commerce minister Piyush Goyal said at the conclusion of the G20 Summit on Sunday.The Rome Declaration, adopted at the end of the summit after five days of negotiations, acknowledges that the developed world has not done enough in terms of meeting its commitments and will have to be more forthcoming with finance and technology, Goyal told a media briefing in Rome.The grouping of the world’s 20 largest economies further agreed that Covid-19 immunisation is a “global public good” and that Covid-19 vaccines deemed safe and efficacious by the World Health Organization (WHO) will be mutually accepted, said Goyal, who is India’s G20 sherpa or representative of the head of government for negotiations at the summit.“We have got into the text the language which confirms that the developed world has acknowledged that they have not done enough in terms of meeting their commitments and that they will have to be more forthcoming in providing finance, technologies and the enablers to make the transition to a clean energy world in the future,” he said.With the G20 agreeing on achieving net-zero by or around the mid-century, Goyal said a firm date was not identified as technologies needed to “transition in a big way to clean energy and innovation” do not currently exist.“We have discussed and decided [on] global net zero. So, all the countries put together will be net zero, which means the developed countries, which have already enjoyed the fruits of low-cost energy for several years, will have to go in for net-zero much faster and possibly even go in for net negative, so that they can release policy space and some carbon space for the developing countries to pursue their development agenda,” he said.More work will have to be done on technological solutions and innovations to absorb clean energy and maintain grid stability. “We will have to look at more technology and innovation playing an important role before we can identify a year,” he said.Goyal said while responding to a question on India’s capital needs to transition to clean energy that this would be determined by factors such as switching from coal to nuclear power. India will need large amounts of capital to set up more nuclear plants to replace current demand and to meet future demands for development imperatives, and it will also have to become a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group to get raw materials, he said.The G20 pushed the developed world to deliver on its commitment to provide $100 billion a year from now till 2025 so that greater levels of capital are available for developing countries.Net-zero emissions refer to achieving a balance between a country’s greenhouse gas emissions produced and emissions removed from the atmosphere through natural means or by using carbon capture technology. India is the third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China and the US but has pushed back against calls by the developed world to work for net-zero.Goyal said the G20 Summit, with a theme of “people, planet and prosperity”, has delivered a strong message of recovery from the pandemic in terms of the economy, health, employment, education, tourism and climate action. The Rome Declaration also gives a very strong message under the health section, through an agreement that Covid-19 immunisation is a global public good and Covid-19 vaccines declared safe and efficacious by WHO will be mutually accepted, he added.The G20 states agreed to help optimise the processes and procedures of the WHO for approving vaccines, and to strengthen the UN’s health body so that it can approve jabs faster.The G20 states also agreed to extend the Debt Service Suspension Initiative so that vulnerable and low income countries are not burdened with debt repayment amid the Covid-19 crisis.There was also a focus on protecting the livelihood of small and marginal farmers, while energy and climate action were at the centre-stage of discussions. Goyal said India made a concerted push for safeguarding the interests of the developing world.The developed countries in the G20 also identified sustainable and responsible production and consumption, and the provision of finance and technology as critical enablers for achieving the climate goals set by the Paris Accord, he said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for sustainable lifestyles found resonance in the Rome Declaration, which encouraged developed countries to reduce their luxurious and energy-intensive lifestyles, Goyal said. There was also a focus on gender-based violence and increasing women’s participation in the workforce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-concluding-remarks-at-g20-goyal-calls-for-need-to-do-more-to-achieve-net-zero-emission-101635701965323.html

In the wake of the caste controversy of Wankhede, Kranti Redkar has extended her full support to husband Sameer and issued several statements. She has also written a letter to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray urging justice.Kranti Redkar is Sameer Wankhede's second wife and the duo got married in 2017, 11 years after Sameer Wankhede's first marriage with Shabana Quraishi, which is also at the centre of controversy.Here are 5 things that Kranti Redkar said over the controversy:1. Kranti Redkar said the attack on Sameer Wankhede is well-orchestrated as a number of people may benefit if her husband is removed from his current post.2. On the allegation that Sameer Wankhede's first marriage was conducted according to Islamic rituals, Kranti said it is true but that does not prove that Sameer converted to Islam. The nikahnama that was published by Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik is true, but the marriage was registered under the Special Marriage Act. Had Wankhede been a Muslim, there would have been no need for the Special Marriage Act, Kranti Redkar contested.3. Amid the controversy, Kranti Redkar shared the photos of her wedding with Sameer Wankhede and claimed that neither Sameer nor she ever converted to any other religion. She clarified that her wedding was according to Hindu rituals.4. Countering the allegations of extortion, Kranti Redkar has said that they are not rich people; Sameer Wankhede is an honest government officer. She also said her husband is not after Bollywood.5. In her letter to Uddhav Thackeray, Kranti Redkar invoked her Marathi identity and wrote Uddhav's father Balasaheb Thackeray would not have tolerated such personal attack.

31-10-2021||India||‘No one is allowed to interfere’: On Nawab Malik’s allegations in drugs-on-cruise case, PIL seeks CBI probe||A public interest litigation (PIL) filed in the Supreme Court by a lawyer has sought for an investigation into the Mumbai drugs-on-cruise case by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), claiming that there has been interference in the ongoing probe by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB).Filed by ML Sharma in his personal capacity, the PIL has referred to the ongoing allegations and counter-allegations by Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik and NCB Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede against each other, according to news agency PTI.In the PIL, Sharma asked if a minister can continue to hold their position despite “interfering” with the probe of a case and “maligning” the investigative officer. “No one is allowed to interfere in the criminal justice systems. The state and the state minister are duty bound to protect the Constitution and not to interfere in the investigation and criminal process,” the PIL argued.Also Read | Day after Aryan Khan's bail, Nawab Malik takes swipe at Wankhede, GosaviSharma has also sought for giving “protection to all the witnesses” in the drugs case, thereby, indirectly likening to the extortion allegation raised by Prabhakar Sail – the former bodyguard of NCB’s primary witness in the cruise ship drugs’ case Kiran Gosavi. “Witnesses are liable to be protected and not to be arrested and tortured to give favourable statements favouring the accused persons,” PTI reported quoting the PIL.Controversies engulfing the drugs-on-cruise case has been at its peak with Malik making a myriad of serious allegations against Wankhede, which even includes extortion from one of accused Aryan Khan, son of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan. Notably, Aryan was granted bail by the Bombay high court on Thursday after the 23-year-old spent more than 20 days behind bars. He walked out of Mumbai's Arthur Road jail on Saturday, escorted by his father’s security team.Also Read | Drugs-on-cruise case: Other than Aryan Khan, who all have got bail till nowMalik has also said that he will submit proofs and documents related to his claim that Wankhede has framed as many as 26 innocent people in “fake” drugs cases in the past. Although Wankhede has refuted the allegations saying that they are being made to target his reputation, he was questioned for more than four hours on Wednesday by NCB deputy director general (DDG) Gyaneshwar Singh.Furthermore, the PIL’s reference to witness protection and their arrest emerges from the Pune Police nabbing Gosavi on Thursday in a 2018 cheating scandal. Notably, Sail – who is also one of the witnesses in the ongoing cruise ship drugs’ case said he overheard Gosavi telling one Sam D’Souza about settling Aryan Khan’s case (reference to earlier when he was still lodged in jail) at ₹18 crore – with ₹8 crore to be given to Wankhede. The Mumbai zonal director of NCB has dismissed the claims.Besides Aryan, as many as 13 people have been given bail in the case. This includes actor Arbaaz Merchant and model Munmun Dhamecha as well. Meanwhile, six more individuals continue to remain in jail as the NCB team that Wankhede continues to head, investigates the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pil-seeks-cbi-probe-into-drugs-on-cruise-case-over-interference-by-nawab-malik-101635695246581.html
31-10-2021||India||Govt mounts ‘hub-and-spike’ supply model to ease fertiliser crunch ahead of key sowing season||The Union government has formed a ‘crack team’ to ensure priority movement of fertilisers to key food-bowl states as fears of shortage have sparked panic buying of crop nutrients. For the first time, a hub-and-spoke model was being implemented to reach supplies from nearly 50 factories and ports to be about 1000 railheads, backed by real-time tracking, as farmers scrambled for key crop nutrients. Officials are redirecting railway rakes, or wagons, to areas of shortage and are holding a series of meetings with fertiliser firms and their dealers to quicken shipments to Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Escalating global prices and a supply-chain squeeze have hit the availability of fertilizers, threatening the oncoming winter-sown or rabi farming season. Cultivators have been making beelines for crop nutrients in many districts of states, such as Punjab, where they said some key farm chemicals were selling at higher than label rates. “We are sure there will be no crisis. The team is monitoring movement and dispatch of fertilisers and coordinating with port authorities and railways to ensure faster movement (of fertilisers),” an official of the fertiliser department said, requesting anonymity. Additional railways rakes, or train wagons, were being made available to ship fertilisers on a priority basis and at short notice, the official said. Inventories of key crop nutrients, especially DAP (diammonium phosphate) and murate of potash (MPO), have hit a five-year low, the managing director of one of India’s largest crop-nutrient firms said, requesting anonymity. A sharp increase in international prices, lower production of feedstock or raw materials during the peak pandemic phase and shipping bottlenecks are key reasons for the crisis. The Union, as well as state governments, have pressed authorities to crack down on hoarding, as farmers in grain-bowl Punjab said they were buying some nutrients above the label price. On October 14, the Union government revamped parts of its subsidy regime for fertilisers and crop nutrients to continue providing them at below-market rates, while rolling over special discounts announced for the summer-sown season to the oncoming winter-sown months. International prices of raw materials for some crop nutrients such as DAP and 22 grades of P&K fertilisers have been increasing for over 18 months, trade data show. Most of these fertilisers have seen a jump of over 50% in prices, forcing the government to expand subsidies. India offers subsidies to compensate fertiliser companies who sell them at below-market rates. The country imports up to a third of its fertilizers to meet domestic demand. China, the largest producer of DAP, is a key supplier of nutrients to India. “Prices have gone through the roof and urea, for instance, is very very expensive to buy. That is the main issue,” said KS Raju, chairman of the board at Nagarjuna Fertilizers and Chemicals, a large conglomerate. Although the government has announced additional subsidies under the so-called nutrient-based subsidy regime - the mechanism by which the Centre disburses the subsidy to manufacturers –worth ₹28602 crore, manufacturers could be buying at a slower pace. “Since extra capital is required because of higher global rates, purchase deferment is taking place, adding to the shortage,” said Ashok Agrawal of Comtrade, a commodities trading firm. He said shipments, however, were expected to increase. Data shows that India needs to ratchet up imports as stocks run low. During the summer-sown months, DAP demand outstripped availability by 13.6%, official data accessed by HT show. “Indigenous production of urea at 7.89 million tonnes and DAP at 1.11 million tonnes during April-July 2021 declined by 3.9% and 12.3%, respectively, over April-July 2020,” wrote Satish Chander, the director-general of Fertiliser Association of India in the latest issue of the Indian Journal of Fertilisers. Rumours of a shortage have prompted farmers to panic and buy nutrients like DAP in excess quantities, said Amrik Singh, an official of the Punjab agriculture department. DAP is an essential nutrient for winter-sown wheat. “I bought two bags for ₹1400 each against the label price of ₹1200,” said Lakhbir Singh of Nizampura Vegetable Growers Association in Punjab. The Union government has asked railways to increase railway rakes ferrying fertilisers to states such as Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, a fertilizer department official said, requesting he not be quoted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-mounts-hub-and-spike-supply-model-to-ease-fertiliser-crunch-ahead-of-key-sowing-season-101635694525261.html

Addressing a press conference in Indore, he also said that it was not possible for the government to give everything for free.“I'd be very practical with you on this. Has there been no increase the income of a common man? If the income was hiked and it was acceptable to us, then a little bit of inflation should be acceptable as well. The government cannot give everything for free. This is where the government gets its revenue from. This is what drives all government schemes,” the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader said. #WATCH | "Hasn't income of the common man increased? Govt can't give everything for free. People should understand that if their income is rising, then they will have to accept inflation also," says Madhya Pradesh Minister Mahendra Singh Sisodia in Indore pic.twitter.com/kpTdogH0RhHe further called upon the public to realise that if they received a hike in their salary, a little bit of price rise was justified as well. “It's very practical. You cannot say that 10 years ago, my salary was ₹10,000 per month and now it is ₹50,000 in a month, but petrol and diesel should cost what they used to 10 years ago,” Sisodia elaborated further.The minister was then asked about the link between the Covid-19 pandemic and price hike. He replied, “If you look at the previous record, then you will see that inflation is not measured on the basis of present day. Covid-19 has been there for the last 12 months, and industries were closed. But, you will have to look from the last five years. I want to ask you, who did not receive hike in their salary? Is it that employees who used to get ₹5000 per month are not getting ₹25,000 in a month? Employees across all categories have seen their income rise.”Sisodia then sought to know if inflation came up only during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's term, and not when the Congress was in power. “This is a cycle which keeps on going, and we will have to accept it,” he said.On Sunday, prices of a litre of petrol and diesel were hiked by 35 paise each to ₹109.34 and ₹98.07 respectively. Among the four metros, fuel prices are the highest in Mumbai, with a litre of petrol and diesel retailing at ₹115.15 and ₹106.23 respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-minister-thinks-some-price-rise-should-be-acceptable-here-s-why-101635686855977.html
31-10-2021||India||Indo-Nepal friendly bus service resumes after 19-month||Indo-Nepal friendly bus service that had been suspended due to the Covid-19 pandemic resumed after 19 months. A bus of UP roadways arrived at Mahendra Nagar in Nepal and went back with Nepalese passengers on Saturday, officials said. “Indo-Nepal friendly bus service has resumed after a long gap. As of now, only UP roadways has started the service. The Nepalese seem to be happy because they get direct buses for their destinations,” said Indra Singh, immigration officer Banbasa check-post in Champawat district. A friendly bus service between Mahendra Nagar of western Nepal and Delhi and Dehradun had started in 2017. Buses of India and Nepal used to ply daily between these stations via Banbasa of Champawat district of Uttarakhand but were suspended on March 23, 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Indo-Nepal border had been sealed from both sides in a bid to check the spread of the pandemic. The private committee of Nepal operates bus friendly services on these routes while Uttarakhand and UP roadways perform this responsibility. Efforts were on to resume friendly bus service on these routes as earlier as before the spread of the pandemic but resumed on Saturday. A bus of Sahibabad depo of UP arrived in Mahendra Nagar from Anand Vihar in Delhi with 20 passengers and went back with 36 passengers. Nepalese residing in border areas and families of those Nepalese whose family members work in India hailed the resumption of bus service. Nepalese, in a considerable number, travel between India and Nepal from Banbasa which is a notified entry point of both countries. Uttarakhand and UP roadways earn income by transporting the Nepalese. Besides Nepalese workers, thousands of Nepalese come to India for pilgrimage round the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indonepal-friendly-bus-service-resumes-after-19month-101635690085274.html

31-10-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: November 1, 1984 — Prime Minister Indira Gandhi shot dead; 12-day mourning announced||New Delhi- Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who steered the nation for 15 daunting and often turbulent years to bring India on the threshold of greatness, was assassinated this morning on the lawns of her residence here by two of her security guards.Both the assailants were shot at by the other security guards in the Prime Minister’s house. One of them, sub-inspector Beant Singh, died on the spot while the other, constable Sabwant Singh, is reported to be serious in hospital. Beant Singh had been on security duty at the Prime Minister’s house for eight years. A pall of gloom spread over the country as reports came that doctors at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences were waging a desperate but losing battle to save Mrs Gandhi’s life. The Prime Minister, who received 16 bullets from an automatic gun and a pistol at point-blank range around 9-15 a.m., passed away at 2-30 p.m. Within hours of her passing away, Mr. Rajiv Gandhi was sworn in by President Zail Singh as the new Prime Minister. The President advanced his schedule of a three-nation tour to return to the country on learning of the assassination attempt on Mrs. Gandhi. Mr Rajiv Gandhi also rushed back to the Capital from West Bengal. Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and Railway Minister Ghani Khan Chaudhury also were away in Calcutta and Home Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao was in Andhra Pradesh. They all flew back to the Capital, and Defence Minister S. B. Chavan was on his way back from Moscow. Mrs Gandhi’s body, draped in tricolour, was taken from the hospital to her residence at 1, Safdarjung Road at 9.30 p.m. The body on a gun carriage will lie in state at the Teen Murti House where her father Jawaharlal Nehru lived as Prime Minister. The funeral takes place on Saturday. State mourning will be observed throughout the country for 12 days (upto Nov. 11), it was officially announced here tonight.Central Government offices all over the country will remain closed tomorrow. During the period of mourning, the national flag will be flown at half-mast throughout the country, and there will be no official entertainments. A black-bordered extraordinary gazette notification was issued this evening announcing the sad demise of the Prime Minister. Signed by the Home Secretary, the gazette notification said the “Government of India announced with most profound regret the death of Shrimati Indira Gandhi, Prime Minister of India at New Delhi, on 31st October. 1984.” Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi, who would have been 67 on Nov. 19, and who was described by Sarojini Naidu at her birth as a “new star on India’s horizon” was respledent in a saffron saree when the assassins struck. She was getting ready for a session with an Irish Television team led by the renowned British actor, Peter Ustinov. Mr Ustinov, who had accompanied Mrs Gandhi on her tour of Orisa from where she returned last night, told a news agency that the TV camera could take shots of the Prime Minister when she lay in a pool of blood. Around 9 a.m.. word was sent to her at the Saidarjung Road bungalow that the TV team was ready for filming. Mrs Gandhi came out and walked towards the lawns of the adjoining 1, Akbar Road bungalow forming part of the Prime Minister’s house complex. Near the gate that led to the Akbar Road bungalow, the two assailants shot at her. There were no family members with the Prime Minister. As she slumped on the lawns, other security guards fired at the assailants. Mr H. Y. Sharada Prasad, Information Adviser to the Prime Minister, who was waiting with the television team, told newsmen he heard the shots and ran towards the direction from where the sound came. The Akbar Road bungalow presented a direct view, and as he reached the spot he found the Prime Minister being attended to by the security staff. Mrs Sonia Gandhi with some relatives rushed out of her house amidst a loud shriek. Behind Mrs Gandhi were her Special Assistant, Mr R. K. Dhawan, and Mr D. K. Bhatt, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Special Security Zone. Mrs Gandhi was helped into an ambassador car and rushed to’ the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences at 9.30 p.m. Dr A. N. Safaya, Medical Superintendent of AIIMS, said that Mrs Gandhi was alive when she was brought to the emergency ward. A team of doctors headed by Prof Venugopal attended on her. The 16 bullets on her chest and abdomen were extricated but, despite the doctors’ heroic efforts, the Prime Minister passed away at 2-30 p.m. Soon after Mrs Gandhi was taken to the AIIMS, Central Ministers, MPs and senior officers converged there. The entire hospital complex was cordoned off and security tightened. A security ring was also placed around the 1, Safdarjang Road bungalow. Cabinet Secretary Krishnaswamy Rao Sahib and Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, Dr P. C. Alexander, who were away in Bombay returned in the afternoon and went straight to the AIIMS. Among the large number of people at the AIIMS was Mrs Maneka Gandhi, accompanied by her son, Varun. Many others who rushed to Delhi on hearing about the assassination attempt on Mrs Gandhi were, however, prevented from entering the AIIMS by the security staff. Thousands of people were collecting outside newspaper offices eager to learn about the latest on the Prime Minister’s condition. Many among them were heard claiming that some foreign radio stations had pronounced her dead around 12 noon. According to official sources, sub-inspector Beant Singh had endeared himself as a household member. He was not on morning duty, and had been assigned the afternoon shift. But he came on the morning duty, reportedly on the plea of indisposition. It could not be established immediately whether Beant Singh was aware of the fact that the Prime Minister had cancelled all her programmes of the day except three, including the interview with the television team. Mrs Gandhi’s day usually began with meeting a large number of people who would gather at 1, Akbar Road. She did not go through with this today, presumably because of a tiring tour of Orissa from where she flew back last night. By nightfall, security arrangements were being tightened in the city not only to ensure that communal harmony was not ruffled but in preparation of the large number of VIPs expected to arrive in Delhi in the course of the next two days to pay their homage to Mrs Gandhi and attend her funeral.Till late in the night, messages of condolence had been pouring into Delhi from all over the country and the world where she had attained a new stature with her election in March, 1983, as chairperson of the Non-Aligned Movement.PTI, UNI add: The body of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was brought tonight to her residence in a gun-carriage and was received tearfully by shocked family members and close friends. The body was draped in a tricolour and carried on a gun-carriage towed by an Army three-tonnor. The four-km route was cordoned off by armed policemen. Mrs Gandhi was dressed in a fawn-coloured sari. The family of sub-inspector Beant Singh is reported to be missing from the police officer’s house in the security lines, according to police. Police sources said when a special force set up to investigate the slaying raided the house in Teen Murti lines, they found a padlock and neighbour, when contacted, said that the family had left the house about five days ago. No one seemed to know about their whereabouts. Beant Singh, was a 1950 batch officer of the Delhi Police and had been with the Prime Minister’s security for around 10 years. He was one of the most trusted bodyguards of Mrs Gandhi, security officers at 1, Safdarjung Road said. Satwant Singh, the second assailant, joined duty only three days ago after a two-month leave in Punjab. He belonged to the Seventh Battalion of the Delhi Armed Police and joined the Prime Minister’s security district a few months ago. Satwant Singh’s sten-gun, which carried 30 rounds, was fully emptied, the sources said. Mrs Gandhi was shot from a distance of seven feet, according to the sources. The entire security unit at the Prime Minister’s house is being interrogated for any possible links with the assassins.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-november-1-1984-prime-minister-indira-gandhi-shot-dead-12-day-mourning-announced-101635688584055.html
31-10-2021||India||Tikait threatens fresh escalation if protesters are removed||Farm union leader Rakesh Tikait, at the forefront of the year-long agitation against three agricultural laws, on Sunday threatened to escalate protests and turn all government offices into “galla mandis” or grain markets if authorities dismantled protest sites.Tikait first tweeted his new protest plan and then talked to farmers in Ghazipur asking them to be prepared. “If farmers are forcibly removed from the borders then they will turn government offices in the country into grain markets,” Tikait’s tweet in the morning said. Since November last year, thousands of farmers have pitched tents at five sites near Delhi’s borders - Singhu, Ghaziabad, Tikri, Dhansa and Shahjahanpur (on the Rajasthan-Haryana border) - from where they have been carrying on their protests. “Protest is a constitutional right. Farmers have been peacefully camping at the borders. If that right is taken away, then we will turn all main offices in districts across the country into grain markets. Our farmers are prepared to do it,” Tikait told HT.On October 29, Delhi Police started removing barricades and concrete barriers put up by farmers at the Gazipur and Tikri protest sites. The stretch cleared by the police was closed for nearly a year ever since the farmers’ agitation started. The police said the closure of a section of roads near these sites had caused inconvenience to commuters and traffic.On October 21, the Supreme Court had said farmers had a right to protest but roads should be blocked indefinitely. The court made the observation on a plea against the blockade of roads between Delhi to Noida due to farmers’ protests against the three agriculture laws.Farmers are continuing with their protests demanding the scrapping of new laws brought by the Modi administration to liberalise agricultural trade. The government has argued that these changes were necessary to boost investment in the farm sector which employs half of all Indians.Major farm unions, led by the umbrella platform Samyukt Kisan Morcha, have said the laws will leave cultivators at the mercy of big corporations by dictating prices. Asked about the Supreme Court’s observation on blocking roads, Tikait said farmers had not blocked roads. “The police had placed these barricades. Farmers are cooperating with the public to ensure smooth traffic,” he said.Farmers protesting at different sites since November 26 last year want the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 rolled back. Despite 11 rounds of talks, the last one was held on January 22, there has been no point of agreement between the government and the farmers. The government then offered to freeze the laws for 18 months, a proposal which the farmers rejected.The new laws at the heart of the protests essentially aim to ease restrictions on trade in farm produce by setting up free markets, which will co-exist with regulated markets, allow food traders to stockpile large stocks of food for future sales and lay down a national framework for contract farming based on written agreements. Farm unions say free markets under the laws will erode their bargaining power, weaken a system of assured prices and make them vulnerable to exploitation by corporate giants. The government has said the laws would not impact the current system of assured prices for cereals that farmers are offered in government-run markets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tikait-threatens-fresh-escalation-if-protesters-are-removed-101635688044779.html

With the state assembly elections due early next year, Trinamool Congress supremo and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had visited the state in the past week.“This is political tourism. During the next four months, the taxi and hotel businesses, which had suffered due to the pandemic, would get a good business with this kind of tourism,” news agency PTI quoted Sawant as saying on Sunday. He also said that he wanted leaders of national political parties to visit Goa for the taxi and hotel businesses to grow.Also read | ‘They didn’t take politics seriously’: Mamata’s fresh jibe at Congress in GoaThe Bengal CM reached the state earlier on Thursday on a three-day visit, where she met with several party leaders and the electorate. The TMC also gained several new entries into the party, including Bollywood actress Nafisa Ali, Mrinalini Deshprabhu and renowned tennis player Leander Paes.“It is my promise to each and every one of you that all your issues will be heard and addressed. The Trinamool Congress family will stand beside you through thick and thin in this fight for Democracy in Goa. We will fight together for a New Dawn!,” Banerjee tweeted on concluding her visit.Rahul Gandhi visited the poll-bound coastal state on Saturday and alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre was “attacking” small and medium businesses. He also promised that his party would offer more jobs to the youth of the state.During his day-long visit, Gandhi also took a ride on a two-wheeler taxi and said that he had a discussion with the driver. He also said that like the driver and the “lakhs of Goans” the Congress also wanted a change in the state.In response, Sawant said, “I felt good that he rode pillion [in] a two-wheeler taxi.

Wankhede’s wife, Kranti Redkar Wankhede, said Halder visited their residence to see some original documents, adding that a probe will now be conducted against those who levelled the allegations, reported news agency ANI.“He (Arun Haldar) came here to see some original documents. Now investigation will be conducted against the people who were making allegations against us,” ANI quoted Kranti Redkar Wankhede as saying.Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik brought a series of allegations against the NCB zonal director following the arrest of Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan in the drugs-on-cruise case. Malik alleged that Wankhede was not only running an extortion racket in the garb of anti-drug raids but had converted to Islam and later forged caste documents for getting into civil services through the reserved Schedule Caste quota.Also Read | 'I think he is from a Scheduled Caste': Wankhede gets support from SC CommissionHe tweeted a picture of Wankhede and his first wife, Shabana Quraishi, and also posted a copy of the couple’s ‘nikah nama’, insinuating that Wankhede got married as per Islamic rules and, thus, is a Muslim.“I want to make it clear that the issue I am exposing of Sameer Dawood Wankhede is not about his religion. I want to bring to light the fraudulent means by which he has obtained a caste certificate to get an IRS job and has deprived a deserving scheduled caste person of his future,” Malik wrote on Twitter.Wankhede has repeatedly denied the claims made by Malik, saying the sole intention was to humiliate him and his family. He released caste certificates of several of his family members, showing that all of them belong to Mahar, a Scheduled Caste.After Halder’s visit, Wankhede’s wife said that the safety of her family is in jeopardy, claiming that some people conducted a recce of the house.“We will provide the CCTV footage to the police.

It is a three-minute video where an emotional Rahul Gandhi narrates how he lost one of his mothers as Indira Gandhi was his second mom, ‘supermom’, and used to protect him when his father Rajiv Gandhi got angry. The video shows a young Rahul crying at Indira Gandhi's last rites, crying, apart from visuals of Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi paying their respect to Indira Gandhi. "That morning before she died she told me don't cry if something happens to me. I didn't understand what she meant. And 2-3 hours later, she was dead. She sort of sensed that she would be killed. And everybody in the house also knew it," Rahul says in the video posted on his YouTube channel.Here is the video That day was the second most difficult day of his life, Rahul said, and also explained why he was hiding his face in the video. Because his grandmother told him to not cry."She once said to me, to all of us, at the dining table, that the biggest curse would be to die of a disease. From her perspective, this was probably the best way to die... for her country... defending the idea she loved," Rahul said. At that time, the young Rahul did not understand the idea behind it, but now he understands, he said."In my house my father was strict... and I essentially had two mothers, including a 'super' mother who was my grandmother, who would defend me when my father got angry," Rahul said. Earlier on Sunday, Rahul Gandhi paid floral tributes to Indira Gandhi at her memorial Shakti Sthal. "My grandmother served the country fearlessly till the last moment -- her life is a source of inspiration for us," Rahul Gandhi tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indira-gandhi-sort-of-sensed-she-would-be-killed-rahul-recollects-dadi-s-funeral-101635682721242.html

The incident took place when an army column was on patrol duty to check infiltration of terrorists from across the border. As the news of his death reached the colony, Kumar’s family members and all other residents were shocked. His mother Sarita Devi fell unconscious and father Rajiv Ranjan Singh, a furniture trader, turned speechless and kept staring at the sky blankly. His house was swarmed by mourners from the locality who came to console the bereaved family members. On October 27, Sarita spoke to her son over phone and he promised to come home for Chhath Puja even if it was for a very short stay, however, a day later he said his leave had been rescheduled to November 22. “However, he did not come but we got the heart- wrenching news of martyrdom of my son. I never thought that it would be the last time I will speak to him,” Sarita added. Neighbour Vikas Vaibhav said Rishi Kumar had joined 17 Sikh Infantry of the Indian Army in 2020 and was posted to Jammu and Kashmir only two months ago. The slain officer has two sisters and the elder one is also in the army. Rishi’s younger sister’s wedding was fixed for November 29 during his leave.

She may live in a village but her 38 year old father, Brijesh Saini, has to still pay tax for the garbage collection service. Saini pays ₹130 every month as water and sanitation tax, introduced two months ago by the village in a gram sabha, for daily collection of garbage from every household in the village. Intkhedi is one of close to 23,000 villages in Madhya Pradesh, where the local panchayat bodies are planning to introduce annual property tax and monthly water and sanitation charges to provide basic civic amenities and drinking water. Most villages in Madhya Pradesh such as Intkhedi lack the basics with open drainage systems and heaps of garbage everywhere. The source of water in these villages is are hand pumps that do not assure a high quality of drinking water. Last year under the Central government’s Nal Jal Yojana, people started getting clean tap water in their households and in June this year, MP Panchayat and Rural Development department trained panchayat secretaries to collect water, sanitation and property tax under section 77 A of MP Panchayat Raj and Gram Swaraj Adhiniyam 1993, which empowers panchayats to levy tax and impose penalties, like urban municipal bodies. Intkhedi sarpanch Leela Bai fixed ₹100 per month as water charge, ₹30 per month for sanitation services apart from ₹200 per lakh as annual property tax, which the panchayat could collect. While the property tax is a fixed rate decided by the district administration, gram sabhas are free to decide the rate of water and sanitation tax as per the Panchayati Raj Act. The sarpanch’s decision is being opposed by some villagers. Ramesh Meena, who runs a shop in Intkhedi village, asks why should he pay tax for a government scheme. He has support from many in the village. Sarpanch Leela Bai, panchayat secretary Gulab Singh Mehra and chief executive officer Phanda janpad panchayat, Upendra Parihar, tried to convince the villagers in the first week of August to pay these taxes but residents said they first wanted to see evidence of change. “The Gram Sabha started cleaning of roads and heaps of garbage and also made an arrangement for door to door collection of garbage and gave cycles to women sanitation workers in August. The panchayat officials have started the supply of uninterrupted clean water. Now, many villagers are convinced and have started paying the tax from October 1,” said Mehra, the panchayat secretary. Out of 400 families, all are paying sanitation tax but only about 300 families are paying water tax leaving those that are below the poverty line. The property tax is yet to be collected. A village’s self-help group member Radha Meena said, “We put in a lot of effort to convince villagers to pay sanitation and water tax but they are yet to be convinced to pay the property tax as they feel that it has no benefit. We are convincing them that under SVAMITWA Scheme, they will get property rights and correct valuation of the property. We are seeing a change in the attitude of villagers but it will take time.” IMPLEMENTATION The success in a few villages including Intkhedi where 100% people have started giving sanitation tax has convinced the MP government that asking villagers to pay for water and sanitation could work. It has now started training of secretaries of 23,000 panchayats to collect money for providing basic amenities to every household. The training started in June and is still going on in several places. Till now, MP government officials said, 10,000 village panchayats have imposed sanitation charge and property tax and 16,000 villages have introduced a water charge from September. “We have just implemented the monthly charge to make villages self-reliant,” said Umakant Umrao, principal secretary, Panchayat and Rural Development department. While payment of the tax is not optional, the state government has asked gram sabhas to exempt families under the poverty line, and those that express an inability to pay can be excused. Gram Sabhas can take a decision on waiving off their tax. Also Read | Sabyasachi gets warning from minister for mangalsutra ad: ‘Take down in 24 hrs’Umrao said that during the second wave of Covid 19 pandemic, panchayats imposed a fine of ₹28 lakh across the state for violation of guidelines such as social distancing and wearing of masks in the villages of MP. “That made us realise that panchayats of MP are getting empowered and can generate funds to become self-reliant. Facing a shortage of funds, we asked panchayats to use their power under the Panchayat Raj Act to impose taxes in a phased manner,” he said. Explaining the scheme, Umrao said in the first phase, fully developed villages will be asked to impose all three taxes while others will be asked to impose any one or two charges as per the services being provided. “If SVAMITWA survey (being done for property evaluation) has been completed, panchayats can come up with property tax. If they get 100% tap connection under Nal Jal Yojna, they can impose water tax and as per cleanliness, they can impose the sanitation tax,” he added. In Madhya Pradesh while 100 per cent of villages have been declared open defecation free (ODF), the last National Family Health Survey (NFHS) revealed that only 19% have sanitation facilities. 16,000 village panchayats have household tap connections under Nal Jal Scheme and in 3000 village panchayats, survey of properties has been completed. OPPOSITION The government plan, however, is being opposed as many villagers feel the villages still lack basic amenities including roads, sanitation and water supply, and therefore, hold the monthly taxes to be unjust. Meherban Gurjar, the sarpanch of Ramha Village, 35 km from Bhopal, said, “When most of the population is poor and get a kg of ration for ₹1 or 2 then how can we ask them to pay ₹50 or 60 for other services. We have imposed the system but I am not convinced enough.” According to the MP statistical department, about 36% of the rural population is below the poverty line, significantly exceeding the urban poverty rate of 21%. Similarly, according to the NFHS, only 79% households in rural MP have access to drinking water while only 19% have access to sanitation. In Jhaliwada village of under developed Balaghat district, sarpanch’s husband Chander Warwade points out that the villagers have an issue of trust as they feel that the government failed to provide basic infrastructure like roads in the past. “For them, the question is how will the taxation change the ground situation? They are opposing it tooth and nail.” Even officials admit that the scheme is facing opposition. Bhopal district panchayat CEO Vikas Mishra said they know it is very tough to impose any tax and that’s why they have asked sarpanchs and panchayat officials to pressurise only warehouse owners, affluent farmers and people having a farm house for recovery of tax. “By using their money, we will develop villages and later we will start compelling others to pay. This will create trust among not so affluent villagers,” he said. Mishra said this plan has worked out and in the past two months, they collected more than 1 crore as water, sanitation and property tax from 187 panchayats in Bhopal. However, Congress leaders attacked the state government for silently introducing taxation system in rural MP. Congress MLA Kunal Chaudhary asked if the government was going to introduce all the taxes provided for in the panchayati raj law. “The BJP-led state and the Central government are putting additional burden on the people through taxation to run development projects. They took this decision when the rural economy was in dire straits due to Covid 19 and people were suffering,” he said. One expert said the state government should first win the trust of people before imposing additional taxes. “This is true that there is a provision in the act as well as in the Constitution that local bodies can create their own fund for the development work by imposing taxes but it shouldn’t be done without winning the trust of people. The rural economy is in bad shape. The villages don’t have basic infrastructure like proper roads and health facilities, leaving alone civic amenities. When people are facing so many troubles, how can we expect them to pay tax,” said Sachin Jain, convener Vikas Samvad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/like-cities-mp-villages-to-pay-for-property-water-sanitation-as-state-invokes-old-law-101635679463363.html

The manufacturer had earlier proposed ₹1900 for the regimen, which comprises three doses and is yet to be included in the nationwide inoculation drive, which commenced on January 16 this year.Also Read | Zydus proposes ₹1,900 for its vaccine; talks on to cut price“The company has brought down the price to ₹265 for each dose. Additionally, ₹93 will be charged as the cost of a disposable jet applicator. This was achieved after repeated negotiations with the central government. A final decision in this matter is likely to be taken this week,” news agency PTI quoted officials familiar with developments as saying.The need for a painless jet applicator stems from the fact that ZyCoV-D is a needle-free vaccine. The three doses have to be given on days 0, 28 and 56 respectively; each round of vaccination will see the jab being administered in both the arms.ZyCoV-D, which received clearance from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) on August 20, is the only vaccine to have been approved for an age group below 18, as it was given emergency use authorisation (EUA) by the top drugs regulator for beneficiaries aged 12 and above. At present, every citizen who is 18-years-old or above is eligible for the vaccination drive.Besides ZyCoV-D, Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech International Limited's Covaxin is the only other jab to have been recommended by the Subject Experts Committee (SEC) to the DCGI. Covaxin, which is the country's first indigenous anti-Covid shot, is among the two most widely used vaccines in the inoculation drive, Covishield being the other.Thus far, the DCGI has give emergency use approval to six jabs.

Following multiple rejections of bail plea applications, the 23-year-old was granted bail by the Bombay High Court (HC) on Thursday, and Aryan reached his home – Mannat, amid cheers and drumbeats from fans on Saturday.His bail plea, however, was not the only application that received a go-ahead by the court as Aryan’s co-accused actor Arbaaz Merchant and model Munmun Dhamecha, who were arrested along with him on October 3, were also permitted to walk out of jail.According to latest updates, as many as 14 persons have been granted bail so far while six others, including two Nigerian nationals Okaro Ouzamo and Chinedu Igwe, remain behind bars.The case has witnessed numerous twists with Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik and Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede indulging in allegations and counter-allegations against each other. Extorting money from Aryan and framing more than 20 people in fake drug cases in the past are some of the serious allegations that Malik has levelled against Wankhede. This has even made the Mumbai Police commence an investigation into the matter, while Wankhede was interrogated for more than four hours by the NCB deputy director general (DDG) Gyaneshwar Singh on Wednesday.As of now, the investigation of the case continues and although Aryan has been given bail, the Bombay HC has mandated a host of conditions that the 23-year-old must follow.Here’s a list of 14 people who have so far got bail in the Mumbai cruise ship drugs’ case:1.     Aryan KhanOn Saturday at about 11am, Aryan departed from Mumbai’s Arthur Road jail after spending more than 20 days in prison. He was escorted out by his father’s security team, who also took him back home. Notably, on Friday, Bollywood actor Juhi Chawla, reached the Special NDPS court and signed a ₹1 lakh bond for Aryan. Aryan’s counsel Satish Manishinde had named Chawla as his client’s surety, which the court accepted. “We are all happy it is over,” Chawla told reporters.2.     Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun DhamechaAryan’s friend and actor Arbaaz and model Munmun were also granted bail on October 28. Similar to Aryan, they also have been given bail with conditions, which include presenting at the NCB office as per the central agency’s requirement in order to facilitate the drugs’ case. Notably, Arbaaz was found in possession of six grams of charas and Munmun was found with five grams of contraband on the day of the NCB raid on October 2.3.     Avik Sahu and Manish RajgariaThey were the first individuals in the drugs-on-cruise case to get bail after the Special NDPS court granted them the same on October 26. According to the NCB, Rajgaria was held for the possession of a small quantity of hydroponic weed multi-strain cannabis, while Sahu was apprehended on consumption charges.4.     Achit KumarSpecial NDPS court judge VV Patil on Saturday granted bail to alleged drug peddler Achit Kumar in the Mumbai cruise ship drugs case. In their statements of the NCB, both Aryan and Arbaaz had named Kumar as their peddler. He was, however, not present on the Goa-bound cruise on the day of the raid.5.     Organisers of the cruise ship partySamir Sehgal, Bhaskar Arora, Manav Singhal and Gopal Anand, who organised the rave party aboard the Cordelia ship earlier this month, were also granted bail by the special NDPS court on Saturday.6.     Shreyas Nair and Ishmeet Singh ChadhaChadha is a resident of Delhi and drugs were recovered from him when the NCB team raided the cruise ship.

She said she would rather die, but have any kind of tie-up with the saffron camp.Addressing a 'Pratigya Rally' of the party in Gorakhpur, Gandhi urged those present at the gathering to think why the SP and BSP leadership was never seen standing by them during their tough times. “They (SP and BSP) say the Congress is working in collusion with the BJP. I want to ask -- why don't they stand with you in your tough times? Only the Congress is fighting. I will die, but never have any kind of relationship with BJP,” Gandhi was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Also read | Sunil Jakhar has a 'Capt Saab' twist to Channi govt's no ad on Indira Gandhi's death anniversaryRecalling her grandmother and late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on her death anniversary, Vadra said she knew she could be murdered, but never bowed down as she promised to keep her own vows. “For her, there was nothing greater than your faith in her. It's because of her teachings that I'm standing in front of you and I'll also never break your faith,” Vadra, who has been on a mission to revive the Congress' fate in the state, said.#WATCH | They (SP & BSP) say Congress is working in collusion with BJP.

When 40 per cent women will come into politics, they will change the face of politics,” she said.Further hitting out the SP and BSP, she said it was them who closed down all mills that were opened during previous Congress regimes in the state. “You know who shut down sugarcane mills established during Congress governments here. The governments of SP and BSP closed those mills and they're saying that Congress is working in collusion with BJP.”She also hit out at the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government for announcing a raise in the minimum support price (MSP) for sugarcane only months ahead of the election. “It has been said that the MSP for sugarcane will be raised. Why are you announcing it now? What were you doing in the last four-and-a-half years?

31-10-2021||India||Rajib Banerjee returns to TMC, regrets 9-month tryst with BJP||Ending his 9-month tryst with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), former Trinamool Congress minister Rajib Banerjee on Sunday returned to the TMC at party national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee’s rally in Agartala, telling Tripura residents that he was regretful.“I am repentant. I am ashamed that I did not listen to Abhishek Banerjee who tried to talk me out of my decision to join the BJP. I was made to believe that the BJP would usher in development and progress. I do not want people to make the same mistake and regret. I have many friends and relatives in Tripura. Every time they heard me talk about the success of the BJP they called me to say they were suffering in the BJP regime,” Banerjee told the crowd.Abhishek Banerjee handed the party flag to Banerjee after the two embraced each other on the dais.On January 30, days after he resigned from the state cabinet and the TMC, Rajib Banerjee drew attention and envy when he and a team of turncoat legislators under his leadership were flown to Delhi in a chartered plane so that they could join the BJP at the residence of Union home minister Amit Shah. The special privilege, which no other TMC leader has enjoyed till now, made bigger news than his shift in allegiance which was anticipated.Banerjee, who had been maintaining silence and also distance from the saffron camp since the TMC returned to power in Bengal for the third time in the March-April polls, was inducted in the national executive committee of the BJP on October 5. While this looked like the national leadership’s effort to keep Banerjee in the party, the action triggered strong resentment in the BJP’s Bengal unit.Also Read | Country suffering as Congress can’t take a decision: Mamata Banerjee in GoaSeveral state office bearers told HT that they were shocked and surprised by the national leadership’s decision because Banerjee not only criticised the BJP’s opposition to Mamata Banerjee but distanced himself from the party after his defeat at the Domjur assembly seat in Howrah. Banerjee had won the seat twice since 2011 when the TMC came to power for the first time.Banerjee drew media attention when he carried home a large photograph of Mamata Banerjee while vacating his chamber at the state assembly. He even broke down after tendering his resignation as minister to governor Jagdeep Dhankhar.On Sunday, he referred to Mamata Banerjee as “goddess” and “our mother.” “I failed to recognise her. She has transformed Bengal. BJP ruled-states are copying her social welfare schemes,” he said.“BJP leaders and workers in Bengal stopped thinking about Rajib Banerjee long time ago. He is not a subject of discussion for us,” Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajib-banerjee-returns-to-tmc-regrets-10-month-tryst-with-bjp-101635675322998.html

31-10-2021||India||India fully capable of meeting internal, external challenges: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday that India is becoming fully capable of meeting any internal or external challenge and the country’s unity was integral to achieving national goals. He was paying tribute to the country’s first deputy Prime Minister and home minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on his 146th birth anniversary, celebrated as National Unity Day.“Our goals can only be met if we stay united. Sardar Patel always wanted India to be strong, inclusive, sensitive and alert. He always gave importance to the nation’s interest,” PM Modi said in a video message, and added, “Inspired by Sardar Patel, India is becoming fully capable of meeting external and internal challenges.”October 31 is observed as the Rashtriya Ekta Diwas or National Unity Day since 2014, marking the birth anniversary of the leader credited with uniting all the 562 princely states of the pre-Independent country to build the Republic of India among other achievements.Prime Minister Modi, who is currently attending the G20 summit in Rome, also listed his government’s work towards strengthening the country’s unity in the last 7 years. “...the country got rid of unnecessary old laws, strengthened the ideals of unity, and [the] emphasis on connectivity and infrastructure has reduced geographical and cultural differences,” a press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) stated. In August 2019, Modi government abrogated Article 370, revoking the temporary special status of Jammu and Kashmir to bring it under direct Central rule to accelerate the development of the region. PM Modi also emphasised the importance and power of ‘Sabka Prayas’ or united effort shown in the fight against the coronavirus disease which has recently resulted in record vaccination with the administration of 100 crore doses. Modi said it was made possible with the collective effort of every citizen.Also Read: PM Modi meets Singapore counterpart, French President Emmanuel Macron on sidelines of G20 summitIn other programmes held on the occasion, Union home minister Amit Shah targeted the opposition, saying efforts were made to forget Patel, who is also referred to as the Iron Man of India and recalled his role in making Lakshadweep an integral part of India.“It is unfortunate that efforts were made to forget Sardar Saheb. After independence, his contributions were never given proper respect and place. He was neither conferred the Bharat Ratna (the country’s highest civilian honour), nor proper respect. But it is said, how long can clouds keep the sun hidden,” the senior BJP leader said. As the situation changed in the country, Sardar Patel received the Bharat Ratna, and the world’s tallest statue, dedicated to Sardar Saheb, was also constructed to pay homage to him, Shah added.Apart from this, President Ram Nath Kovind paid a floral tribute at the Sardar Patel statue at Patel Chowk in New Delhi and said that the countrymen will always be indebted to Sardar Patel for establishing a work culture based on morality and service to the nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-fully-capable-of-meeting-internal-external-challenges-pm-modi-101635671063008.html
31-10-2021||India||Sabyasachi Mukherjee gets warning from Madhya Pradesh minister for mangalsutra ad: ‘Take down in 24 hrs’||Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra on Sunday issued a warning to designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee for his recent mangalsutra campaign that if the designer does not take down it within 24 hours, he will face legal action. This is not the first backlash from power the celebrity designer is facing for his latest creation, as a legal advisor of the BJP has already issued a legal notice for Mukherjee's Mangalsutra collection advertisement.This comes as several advertisements in the recent past have received flak including that of Fabindia's 'Jash-e-Riwaaz', Ceat's advertisement featuring Bollywood actor Aamir Khan and Dabur's Karwa Chauth ad showing a lesbian couple."I have seen the (mangalsutra) advertisement. It is very objectionable. Also hurtful to religious sentiments. The yellow part of a mangalsutra stands for Parvati, while the black part represents Shiv. A mangalsutra stands for conjugal happiness. I have already raised objections before. Now I am warning designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee personally and giving him an ultimatum of 24 hours," the Madhya Pradesh minister said, issuing a video message.The legal notice sent by BJP-Maharashtra Palghar unit legal advisor Ashutosh Dubey said using semi-naked models for mangalsutra advertisement is obscene and outrageous. फैशन डिजाइनर सब्यसाची मुखर्जी के मंगलसूत्र का विज्ञापन बेहद आपत्तिजनक और मन को आहत करने वाला है।अगर 24 घंटे में आपत्तिजनक विज्ञापन नहीं हटाया तो #SabyasachiMukherjee के खिलाफ केस रजिस्टर्ड कर वैधानिक कार्रवाई की जाएगी।#Sabyasachi pic.twitter.com/iGl9lp3gsRA few days ago, the designer launched his 'Intimate Fine Jewellery' collection, which invited criticism as social media users asked the designer whether the ad is for innerwear or mangalsutra. "Introducing the Royal Bengal Mangalsutra 1.2 and the Bengal Tiger Icon collection of necklaces, earrings and signet rings in 18k gold with VVS diamonds, black onyx and black enamel," the description of Sabyasachi's version of mangalsutra read.

A number of BJP leaders, including former Union minister Babul Supriyo, have also joined the TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjps-rajib-banerjee-set-to-officially-return-to-tmc-today-101635664961687.html

31-10-2021||India||Pawan Kalyan joins strike against Vizag steel plant privatisation||Tollywood actor and Jana Sena Party president Pawan Kalyan will on Sunday join the ongoing agitation by the workers of Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL), the corporate entity of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP), against the Central government’s decision to privatise it.Pawan Kalyan will address a rally of the steel plant workers under the banner of Visakha Ukku Parirakshana Porata Committee (Committee to fight for protection of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant) at the steel plant entrance near Kurmannapalem junction at around 2 pm.Though the Visakhapatnam police initially denied permission for the meeting on the grounds of law and order, they later consented following protests by the Jana Sena Party activists, who said it was not a political meeting, but was meant only for expressing solidarity with the striking steel plant workers.In January this year, the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) under the Union ministry of finance announced 100 per cent disinvestment in RINL through privatisation because of the accumulated losses to the extent of ₹20,000 crore.Since then, the steel plant workers have been agitating against the move and stepped it up after the DIPAM in July invited proposals for the engagement of transaction advisors and legal advisors to complete the disinvestment and later called for expression of interest from various bidders.Barring the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), all the opposition parties in Andhra Pradesh have been strongly opposing the move to privatise the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant. Even Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government adopted a resolution in the state assembly requesting the Centre to drop the move because of people’s sentiment while suggesting various measures to revive the steel plant.Since the Jana Sena Party has been a political ally of the BJP in Andhra Pradesh, it did not actively participate in the anti-privatisation agitation initially, though Pawan Kalyan made a representation to the BJP leadership in Delhi to reconsider the move.However, in the recent past, relations between the Jana Sena Party and the BJP have strained with both taking independent stance against the Jagan Mohan Reddy government on various issues.Against this backdrop, Pawan Kalyan participation in the agitation is seen as yet another indication of the differences between the alliance partners.“Yes, Jana Sena and the BJP are allies, but the alliance is confined only to the elections. We do have our own independent political ideologies and strategies. The BJP cannot expect that we blindly support their decisions. We cannot nod our heads to whatever they do,” Jana Sena Party state general secretary T Shiva Shankar Rao told reporters on Friday.Also Read: YSRC’s strategy to field deceased MLA’s widow gives them edge in Badvel bypollHe said Jana Sena Party would strongly oppose the BJP’s stand on the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant privatisation. Meanwhile, retired IPS officer and former joint director of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) V V Lakshminarayana, who contested on the Jana Sena ticket from Visakhapatnam in the 2019 general elections, complimented Pawan Kalyan for taking up the agitation in support of steel plant workers against privatisation.“Glad to know that Sri Pawan Kalyan garu is expressing solidarity with the people fighting against the privatisation of Vizag Steel Plant. Hope this will certainly influence government of India to change their decision. #savevizagsteelplant,” the former JD tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pawan-kalyan-joins-strike-against-vizag-steel-plant-privatisation-101635661102297.html
31-10-2021||India||‘Farmers will set up tents in police stations, DM offices’: Rakesh Tikait on attempts to remove them at Ghazipur||Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait on Sunday alleged that the administration was trying to take down the tents of the farmers protesting against the three farm laws at the site in Ghazipur border between Delhi and Uttar Pradesh.“We have come to know that the administration is trying to pull down the tents here with the help of JCB. If they do that, the farmers will set up their tents at police stations and DM offices,” news agency ANI quoted Tikait as saying.“If there is an attempt to forcibly remove the farmers from the borders, then they will make government offices across the country into Galla Mandi,” Tikait also tweeted.Also read | ‘Now will sell crops in front of Parliament’: Tikait on removal of barricadesThe Union government enacted the three contentious farm laws in September last year and several farmer unions have been protesting against them at the borders of Delhi for almost a year now. The protests, spearheaded by the BKU and the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of several farmer unions, began in November 2020 with the participation of farmers mostly from neighbouring Haryana and Punjab.Tikait’s remarks came two days after the Delhi Police began removing the barricades at the Ghazipur and Tikri borders where the protests were going on. The barricades were removed with the intention of restoring the movement of traffic.Meanwhile, the SKM said that the removal of barricades vindicated their stand that it was the police who were blocking the movement of traffic and not the protests. “Police had fortified the protest sites by placing huge cement boulders, multiple layers of metal barricades, and sand trucks across the roads, apart from fixing spikes on the road. As part of the latest narrative that they are trying to spin, partial removal of these barricades has been taken up, ostensibly to impress the Supreme Court,” it said in a statement earlier on Friday.The Supreme Court on October 21 said that the farmers have the right to protest but couldn’t block the roads indefinitely. “Farmers have a right to agitate even if there is a legal challenge pending. We have no difficulty on that as we feel people have a right to go to the streets and protest. But roads cannot be blocked and ultimately some solution must be found,” the bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh said on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-will-set-up-tents-in-police-stations-dm-offices-rakesh-tikait-on-attempts-to-remove-them-at-ghazipur-101635660480423.html
31-10-2021||India||Proposed Khasi inheritance bill evokes lukewarm response||The proposed Khasi Hills Autonomous District Khasi Inheritance of Property Bill, 2021 has evoked lukewarm response from the stakeholders with some welcoming it while others advising caution. A sizeable chunk of the indigenous population for whom the proposed bill is intended, believes that it has been announced without proper and adequate consultation and is a premature attempt to woo voters for the ensuing 2023 assembly elections.A prominent group advocating for a patrilineal system since 1990, Syngkhong Rympei Thymmai (SRT) which was founded on the principles of the 1960/61 movement of ‘Kaiktiar longbriew manbriew’ from Sohra, opines that one must also consider the flip side of the law proposed by the Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council (KHADC).Among matrilineal Khasis, lineage and inheritance is traced through the mother, and not the father. The community, which comprises nearly half of Meghalaya’s total population (2011 census), practices the custom of the youngest daughter in the family becoming custodian of the family’s land and assumes responsibilities of taking care of parents, unmarried or destitute siblings. As per custom, she’s not the owner of the property and can sell it only after getting permission from her maternal uncle. Over years, there has been a demand among some section in the community seeking a change in the custom so that sons and other daughters in the family also get equitable share of the family property. SRT advisor Keith Pariat tells HT, “It may have detrimental effects if this law is activated right away as we feel that the majority of Khasi males will be led to misuse the wealth given to them, as at this present moment, they have not been taught to be responsible by custom and may not be ready to handle wealth responsibly.”He claims it was therefore important to ensure that males are first made “responsible” and only then allowed to inherit any wealth or property. “Imagine an alcoholic or drug addict inheriting money or property, what do you think he would do?,” he asked.Echoing similar sentiments, Mait Shaphrang Movement (MSM), another civil rights group which came to fore in the 80s pointed out that the Meghalaya assembly had already passed the Meghalaya Succession to Self-Acquired Property (Khasi & Jaiñtia) Special Provision Act 1984. MSM convenor Michael Syiem said MSM only wants an amendment to this act to include “Ancestral Property” as well without having to bring in a new law.“The Khasi Pnar are one people, we want a common law [and] not two separate laws by two separate district councils. And before this amendment, we want wider consultations with all stakeholders and invite more inputs especially with this issue being serious and sensitive,” Syiem said, before adding, “If the Garos want to be included in this law, it justifies a state legislation. This law will economically empower all children in the family.”Another organisation that has surfaced lately, the Saiñdur Tipkur-Tipkha Ïeng Ehrngiew Hynñiewtrep (STIEH) which has been articulating views on various socio-economic issues concerning the indigenous population ,said such an inheritance law is not as urgent as a lineage bill.“Instead of making new bills why doesn’t the District Council enact the pending bill which is most needed at this hour, the Khasi Social Custom of Lineage Bill 2nd Amendment 2018 which will really safeguard the Jaitbynriew (Indigenous people)?, STIEH president Ms D Tongper said.KHADC chief executive member Titosstarwell Chyne said the proposed legislation has been misunderstood.“The objective of this bill has been misunderstood. It is not mandatory that all the children will get equal share of the parental property. It depends on the will of the parents to decide who will be the genuine heir of the property,” Chyne told HT over phone.He said nowadays, despite the age-old practice of the youngest daughter inheriting ancestral property and becoming its custodian, several parents are giving other siblings a portion of their property as well. “There won’t be any problem if the youngest daughter does not object,” he said. Chyne cited an interesting clause in the draft bill which says the youngest daughter cannot claim to be the legal heir of the property if she does not take care of her parents.Chyne emphasised that the legislation will protect the will of the parents who want to distribute parental property equally among all their offspring and empower the Khasi male to avail finance facilities from banks in lieu of their land/inheritance as collateral.“The bill seeks to codify and make provision for regulation and administration in the inheritance of property amongst the Khasi in consonance with the prevailing practice of the Khasis in the Khasi Hills,” he explained.Also Read: Tripura mandates negative Covid-19 report from visitors from states with 5%+ positivity rateThe CEM further said that another clause in the bill specifies that an offspring who marries a non-indigenous person and adopts the culture and tradition of the spouse will not be entitled to any share of the property.Responding to observations that such a clause seemed too harsh, Chyne said the members of the Council can deliberate on this issue once the bill is tabled in the House during the re-assembled autumn session on November 8. The KHADC chief had earlier pointed out that there was no law to regulate the inheritance of property in the indigenous society.“We have no law to address issues concerning tribal parents who have only sons, parents without children or ‘Iapduh’ who do not have anyone. This has led to many disputes among families of different clans,” he had said, providing a strong rationale for the new legislation. “We want to ensure equal distribution of property among the siblings, both sons and daughters, instead of saying that only the youngest daughter should inherit the parents’ wealth,” he had said, while categorically stating, “However, we have inserted a provision that it all depends on the will of the parents as to whom they want to bequeath their property.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/proposed-khasi-inheritance-bill-evokes-mixed-response-101635659122111.html

31-10-2021||India||National Unity Day: As India pays tributes to Sardar Patel, know the history||India is celebrating October 31 as National Unity Day to pay tributes to veteran freedom fighter Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who was also the country's first home minister whose contribution in convincing many of the princely states to join the Union of India after Independence remains especially notable. As the country remains grateful for Patel's crucial efforts leading to the integration of India, the day is celebrated as a homage to that “national unity”. The government in 2014 declared that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's birth anniversary on October 31 will be celebrated as National Unity Day or Rashtriya Ekta Diwas.HistoryDeclaring in 2014 that India will henceforth celebrate National Unity Day on October 31, the central government said in an official statement that this occasion “will provide an opportunity to reaffirm the inherent strength and resilience of our nation to withstand the actual and potential threats to the unity, integrity, and security of our country.”Vallabhbhai Patel was dubbed “Sardar” (chief) for his leadership skills in leading the country through the struggle for independence and beyond, and most notably during the integration of the princely states and the India-Pakistan War of 1947.Sardar Patel achieved the incredible feat of persuading almost every single one of the 565 self-governing princely states, that had been released from British suzerainty, to accede to the Union of India. For his commitment to the national integration of the newly independent country, Sardar Patel earned the sobriquet “Iron Man of India”.SignificanceOn National Unity Day, a pledge is read out in government offices:“I solemnly pledge that I dedicate myself to preserve the unity, integrity, and security of the nation and also strive hard to spread this message among my fellow countrymen. I take this pledge in the spirit of unification of my country which was made possible by the vision and actions of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. I also solemnly resolve to make my own contribution to ensure the internal security of my country.”By official order, all government offices, public sector undertakings (PSUs), and other public institutions are required to arrange the pledge-taking ceremony on October 31 to observe the Rashtriya Ekta Diwas.The ministry of human resource development has also issued instructions to allow students of schools and colleges to be administered the Rashtriya Ekta Diwas pledge to motivate them to strive to maintain the unity and integrity of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-unity-day-as-india-pays-tributes-to-sardar-patel-know-the-history-101635651558670.html

As a result, retail prices of petrol and diesel are creating record almost every day.On Saturday, a litre of petrol was priced at ₹114.81 and a litre of diesel was available at ₹105.86 in Mumbai.In Thane, price of a litre of petrol crossed ₹115 to reach ₹115.29, while a litre of diesel was being sold at ₹106.37, following the Sunday hike in retail fuel prices. Similarly, in Parbhani, a litre of petrol was selling at ₹118.09 on Sunday and a litre of diesel was available for ₹107.78 in Amravati. With a hike of 35 paise a litre, the price of petrol in national capital Delhi too rose to its highest-ever level of ₹109.34 a litre. The price of diesel also saw a hike by 35 paise and took the fuel’s rate to ₹98.07 per litre in the national capital.Also Read: Check sale of ‘fake’ biodiesel, Punjab petroleum dealers urge govtIn Hyderabad, one litre of petrol is selling at ₹113.72 while a litre of diesel is available at ₹106.98. In Chennai, a litre of petrol is available at ₹106.04 and one litre of diesel is priced at ₹102.25.India is heavily dependent on energy imports--85% of crude oil that it processes and 55% of its gas consumption. Earlier this month, Union petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri said that India’s fuel consumption had surpassed the pre-Covid period-- petrol by 16% and diesel by over 10%, and that country’s energy consumption will increase further with the rapid economic recovery. Puri cited supply squeeze by global oil producers as one of the key reasons for high energy prices and said that the supply curve has been kept below the demand curve by the crude producing countries. He added that such high prices were undermining the global economic recovery and hurting the interests of both the developing and developing countries.He said that the Central government was in talks with other countries such as the US and Saudi Arabia to ease the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petrol-crosses-rs-115-per-litre-and-diesel-rs-106-per-litre-in-mumbai-101635653061164.html

All you need to know||India has launched its first manned ocean mission, ‘Samudrayan’, joining six other nations engaged in exploring the ocean depths for studies and research. While launching the mission on Friday, Union minister Jitendra Singh said India has made huge progress in science and technology and when an Indian goes up into space as part of the Gaganyaan programme, another would dive deep into the ocean."Launched India’s First Manned Ocean Mission #Samudrayan at #Chennai. India joins elite club of select nations USA, Russia, Japan,France & China having such underwater vehicles.A new chapter opens to explore ocean resources for drinking water, clean energy & blue economy,” Singh tweeted.Here’s all about Samudrayan:1. Undertaken by the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), the Samudrayan project will be a part of the ₹6,000 crore Deep Ocean Mission.2. The Matsya 6000, the deep-sea vehicle under the Samudrayan initiative, is designed to carry three people in a titanium alloy personnel sphere of 2.1-metre diameter enclosed space.3. It will have an endurance of 12 hours and an additional 96 hours in case of an emergency situation.4. It could work at a depth between 1000 and 5500 meters.5. The niche technology facilitates carrying out deep ocean exploration of non-living resources such as polymetallic manganese nodules, gas hydrates, hydro-thermal sulphides and cobalt crusts.6. According to a NIOT official, Matsya 6000 will be ready for qualification trials by December 2024. The official also said that the shallow water (500 metres) phase is expected to happen by the end of 2022 or 2023 and will be followed by deeper initiatives.7. NIOT developed a 'personnel sphere' made of mild steel with local industry for an operational capability of 500 metres and tested for its usage as per the International Classification and Certification Agency for man-rated operation during this month sea trial using Ocean Research Vessel Sagar Nidhi in the Bay of Bengal.8. The deep-sea vehicle shall be manoeuvred at deep-seafloor with six-degree freedom using a battery-powered propulsion system for 4 hours at 6000-metre depth, according to the release. "Basically this vehicle is a platform to carry any devices, sensors etc to deep-sea for doing experiments/observations in the presence of a human being,” the official said.9. This programme will augment India's capability with infrastructure facilities such as a high thickness welding facility and deep ocean simulator.10. The government has approved the Deep Ocean Mission to be implemented by the Union ministry of earth sciences at a total budget of ₹4,077 crore for 5 years.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-launches-its-first-manned-ocean-mission-all-you-need-to-know-101635649948300.html

31-10-2021||India||Battle for UP: Priyanka Gandhi to hold rally at Gorakhpur today, dare CM Yogi in his bastion||Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Congress general secretary in-charge of Uttar Pradesh, will on Sunday address a public rally at Gorakhpur ahead of the upcoming assembly elections in the state. The rally comes days after the Congress leader launched her party's election campaign early this month in Varanasi, where she targetted the reported “failures” of the Yogi Adityanath-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in meeting its promises to the people of the state.The Gorakhpur rally on Sunday is being seen as critical by political watchers since the seat of Gorakhnath Math is considered Adityanath's area of dominance, and as such, is expected to draw major attention. Priyanka Gandhi's rally on Sunday also marks the second major Congress event in the Purvanchal region, the earlier being the Varanasi rally on October 10.Also Read | UP people suffering due to 'loot' of electricity bills, will end once...: Priyanka GandhiConfirming that the rally was going to be held, a senior Congress leader told Hindustan Times earlier this week that veteran party functionaries – including Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) president Ajay Kumar Lallu – have been camping at Gorakhpur for a while to advocate in support of the rally.“Yes, Congress will challenge chief minister Yogi Adityanath in his bastion,” said UPCC president Ajay Kumar Lallu. “There is great enthusiasm among the people about the rally.”The Congress leader said that the party has worked for the sugarcane growers in the Purvanchal region by setting up sugar mills and has also set up canals to take the water of the Gandak for irrigation. He alleged the non-Congress governments of pushing the area on “the path of backwardness”.Also Read | Can Priyanka Gandhi Vadra revive the Congress in UP?Notably, the Congress also aims to launch its fourth “Pratigya Yatra” from Gorakhpur after Diwali, with an aim to take the promises made by Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to wide sections of people ahead of the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly poll. Among its electoral promises, the party has vowed to provide smartphones to 12th class pass girls, electric scooters to graduate girls, 50 per cent cut on power bills, a waiver on power dues during the Covid-19 period, financial assistance of ₹25,000 for the poor families hit by the pandemic, and up to ₹10 lakh in free treatment at government hospitals for patients suffering from any ailment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/battle-for-up-priyanka-gandhi-to-hold-rally-at-gorakhpur-today-dare-cm-yogi-in-his-bastion-101635640644191.html

However, the court clarified that there was no blanket ban on firecrackers, and that green crackers can be used during Diwali.In his order Gurugram deputy commissioner Yash Garg said directions have been issued to allow only use of green crackers in cities/towns, where air quality is ‘moderate’ or below, for a duration of not more than two hours.Officials, quoting an order issued by the Uttar Pradesh additional chief secretary (home), Awanish Awasthi, on Friday night, said the use and sale of green crackers on Diwali will be allowed only for two hours in areas where the air quality is in the ‘moderate’ category or better.“The Supreme Court has clarified in an order dated July 23, 2021, that if the air quality in the region is under the ‘moderate’ category or better, respective officials may allow use and sale of green crackers there,” said the order issued by Awasthi.Officials of the Ghaziabad administration, however, said that they will take the present air quality of the city into account to implement the order.“We have taken a legal opinion in the matter, and will take into account the current AQI which is under the ‘poor’ category. If the AQI is ‘moderate’ or better, we may allow sale and use of crackers as directed. In case the AQI is in the ‘moderate’ or better on Diwali, we will allow sale of green crackers to seven traders -- who already have permission for the same,” said Vipin Kumar, additional district magistrate (city).The bursting of crackers is also banned under the Grap measures for the ‘very poor’ air category that are currently in force in Delhi-NCR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bursting-of-green-crackers-allowed-in-gurugram-and-up-for-2-hrs-on-diwali-101635625805861.html
31-10-2021||India||Country suffering as Congress can’t take a decision: Mamata Banerjee in Goa||West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo Mamata Banerjee on Saturday attacked the Congress, saying the party was incapable of taking on the Bharatiya Janata Party and that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will become more powerful as the grand old party is not serious about politics.She alleged that the country is suffering because the Congress does not take decisions. “Modiji is going to be so powerful because of Congress. If one cannot take a decision, why should the country suffer for that? They (Congress) got enough opportunities. Instead of fighting against the BJP, they contested against me in my state. How do they expect that they will contest me and we will only give flowers and sweets to them in return,” Banerjee said, while addressing a group of media persons here on the last day of her three-day visit to Goa, where assembly polls are due early next year.She was referring to the fact that the Congress contested against the TMC during the assembly elections in West Bengal earlier this year.Taking a veiled attack on the BJP-led Centre, she said, “I want to see that all regional parties are strong. We are a union of states and the federal structure should be strong. If the state is strong, the Centre is strong. Delhi ka dadagiri anik naka (We don’t want bullying from Delhi anymore). Enough is enough.”When asked if she would become part of an alliance that included Congress to take on the BJP in 2024 general election, she said, “I cannot say everything right now... they (Congress) don’t take politics seriously.”“We want committed people, committed local political parties that really want to fight against the BJP,” she added.She also backed the recent comments made by political strategist Prashant Kishor, who had said the BJP will remain at the centre of Indian politics for the next many years whether it wins or loses elections. Kishor also took a swipe at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for “thinking it is just of matter of time before people throw BJP away”.Goa Congress president Girish Chodankar said the TMC chief’s comments reflected their intentions to split the vote and benefit the BJP. “The Goa BJP doesn’t have the strength to defeat the Congress. That’s why the BJP tries each time to split the votes or buy the MLAs. Each election their focus on only splitting the votes. They bring A or B party, now they have brought a third party.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/country-suffering-as-congress-can-t-take-a-decision-mamata-banerjee-in-goa-101635617700944.html

31-10-2021||India||High turnout as bypolls held for 30 assembly, 3 Lok Sabha seats||There was high participation in the bypolls for 30 state assembly seats and three Lok Sabha constituencies, which were conducted mostly peacefully on Saturday amid tight security, social distancing and frequent sanitisation, as mandated by the Election Commission of India.Although the results of the bypolls will not affect stability in any state government, they might point to trends and could be significant for some political parties.Nearly 70% polling was recorded by 5 pm in the five assembly seats of Assam, Election Commission data show. Temporary malfunctions of voting machines were reported but polling was restored quickly, officials said. The voting was peaceful.Two of the five seats, Tamulpur and Gossaigaon, were vacant because Covid-19 had claimed the lives of lawmakers from opposition Bodoland Peoples’ Front and ruling United Peoples Party Liberal. The other three are going to polls as two Congress MLAs, from Mariani and Thawra, and an All India United Democratic Front MLA from Bhabanipur, resigned from their parties and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party.In Bihar, bypolls in two constituencies, Tarapur and Kushweshwar Asthan, saw voter turnout at 49.59% at 5pm, lower than the 54.76% in the 2020 assembly polls. The percentage might rise slightly. There was no untoward incident reported from any constituency, Bihar’s chief electoral officer H R Srinivasa said in a media briefing. There were some preventive arrests, according to Jitendra Singh Gangwar, additional director general of police.The bypolls saw the return of Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad Yadav to active campaigning after several years of jail in Ranchi, and then health complications in Delhi.Over 73% voter turnout was recorded till 5 pm in the Ellenabad byelection in Haryana, election officials said. No incident of violence was reported and polling went smoothly, said Sirsa deputy commissioner Anish Yadav. The three main contestants are Indian National Lok Dal candidate Abhay Singh Chautala, his former aide and Congress nominee Pawan Beniwal, and the BJP’s Gobind Kanda, although 17 candidates are in the fray.Average voter turnout in West Bengal bye-elections to four assembly constituencies – Khardah, Santipur, Gosaba and Dinhata – was recorded, officials said. There were some reports of intimidation by political workers.“Some men came last night on motorcycles and threatened by son, who is a BJP polling agent. I didn’t allow him to go out,” said Madhabi Das, mother of Tapas Das and a resident of Santipur in Nadia.While two of the seats, Dinhata and Santipur, were won by the BJP in the March-April polls, the winners did not take oath in order to retain their Lok Sabha seats. In the other two, the Trinamool Congress’ candidates died. At Gosaba in South 24 Parganas, a BJP polling agent’s house was set on fire on Friday night. At Khardah, the car of Tanmay Bhattacharya, a former CPI (M) legislator, was attacked with bricks.“Multiple incidents of violence have been reported since last night,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson.“The BJP knows that they are going to lose and are raising such allegations as excuses,” said Sovandeb Chattopadhyay, TMC minister and party leader.At the fag-end of polling day on Saturday, there was tension at Khardah in North 24 Paraganas after security guards of BJP candidate Joy Saha allegedly assaulted Aryadeep Sinha, son of former TMC legislator Kajal Sinha. Kajal Sinha had died after testing positive for Covid-19, necessitating the bypolls.In Madhya Pradesh, 63.02% voters in three assembly constituencies – Raigaon, Jobat and Prithvipur – and 59.02% in a lok Sabha constituency – Khandwa – cast their ballots till 5 pm. A teacher, Dayaram Jatav, deployed in Badwaha, Khandwa, for poll duty, died of cardiac arrest. In Prithvipur, BJP election in-charge and urban development minister Bhupendra Singh accused Congress for rigging and threatening voters. However, state Congress president Kamal Nath said, “The BJP has accepted its defeat and that’s why they are making false accusations.”The turnout in the Deglur bypoll was about 63.33% but will rise, officials said. Congress’s Jitesh Antapurkar and BJP’s Subhash Sabne are key contestants from the constituency in central Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-turnout-as-bypolls-held-for-30-assembly-3-lok-sabha-seats-101635617414130.html
31-10-2021||India||Army officer, soldier killed in explosion along LoC in Rajouri||Two army personnel were killed in an explosion near a forward post along the Line of Control in Rajouri district of Jammu and Kashmir on Saturday, officials familiar with the matter said. The deceased have been identified as Lieutenant Rishi Kumar and Sepoy Manjit Singh.The blast took place when an army column was on patrol duty in the Kalal area of Nowshera sector, as part of measures to check infiltration of terrorists from across the border, an official added. “An officer and a soldier were critically injured in a mysterious explosion along the LoC around 4.30 pm in Kalal area of Nowshera. They were evacuated to Command Hospital in Udhampur in a helicopter but they succumbed to their injuries,” officials familiar with the matter said.“GOC #WhiteKnight_IA and all ranks salute bravehearts Lt Rishi Kumar and Sep Manjit Singh, who made the supreme sacrifice in line of duty along the Line of Control in Naushera sector on 30 Oct 21 and offer deep condolences to their families,” the White Knight Corps posted on its Twitter handle.The nature of the explosion could not be immediately ascertained, but officials said it could either be a mine blast or an improvised explosive device (IED) planted by terrorists to target the patrol team.With the two killings, the number of army personnel killed in Rajouri and Poonch districts this month rose to 11.Meanwhile, a search operation to track down a group of terrorists hiding in the forest belt of Jammu and Kashmir’s twin border districts of Poonch and Rajouri entered 20th day on Saturday. So far, a total of nine soldiers, including two JCOs, have been killed in the operation.On October 24, a Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist was killed when the security forces came under fire from the hiding terrorists.The operation in the forest areas in the twin border districts began on October 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-army-personnel-killed-along-loc-in-rajouri-blast-official-101635617344252.html
31-10-2021||India||Rise in NREGS demand shows return to cities delayed||The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and slow economic recovery has seen high participation in the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), the country’s flagship welfare programme, resulting in a temporary shortage of funds.Between April and October this year, more than 60.1 million households have worked in the manual jobs scheme, widely regarded as the last resort of the rural poor.More than 85.6 million individuals have participated so far over this period, government data shows. These are higher employment rates than in three financial years between 2017 and 2019.In the financial year ended March 2021, which saw a stringent nationwide lockdown and disruptions due to Covid-19, 75.5 million households and 111.9 million people demanded work under the scheme.With the onset of winter, more people are likely to want work under the programme as November to March is the preferred time for construction-related work. The central government is “committed to release funds for wage and material payments” for proper implementation of the demand-driven scheme that gives a guarantee for jobs or compensation in case jobs could not be given, the rural development ministry said in a statement on Saturday.The government admitted it has less than ₹9,000 crore left in its MGNREGS kitty, but indicated that the scheme would get more funds in supplementary demand for grants, or additional budget in the upcoming winter session of the Parliament.“Whenever additional fund is required, the Ministry of Finance is requested to provide the funds. In the previous financial year, the Ministry of Finance allocated ₹50,000 crore additional funds for the scheme over and above that of BE (budget estimate),” the statement said.The Centre underlined that the rush for work has so far generated more than 222 crore person-days as employment has been offered to 99.63% of those who sought jobs.After the massive funding of MGNREGS last financial year, the prediction for this year was that demand would decline as economic activities resume and people return to cities for employment, an official said on condition of anonymity.“But the second wave and infiltration of Covid-19 in rural belts prevented many people from leaving their villages,” the official said. “Also, the slow pace of economic recovery prompted many people to opt for MGNREGS job that provides low wage rate but a guaranteed income for up to 100 days,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mgnregs-participation-rose-amid-covid-second-wave-govt-data-101635617162392.html
31-10-2021||India||Upcoming polls a battle for state’s future: Rahul Gandhi in Goa||The upcoming assembly election in Goa is not just a political but also an ideological battle for the idea of India and the idea of Goa, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said on Saturday, urging party workers to help the state retain its identity in the face of the “hatred” that is being spread by the Bharatiya Janata Party.Addressing a convention of Congress workers at Taleigao on the outskirts of Panaji, Gandhi carried forward the tone he set earlier in the morning during an interaction with fishermen that the Congress was out to spread love and affection.“This is a political fight but this is also an ideological fight,” he said. “The culture of Goa, the way of life of Goa is also the culture of India and the way of life of India. We are not just fighting an election here. We are fighting a fight about defining what Goa is going to become. How Goa is going to treat itself and how it is going to treat the rest of the world. I want Goa to show the rest of the world that it can stand together to maintain and protect its wonderful culture, maintain and protect its wonderful environment and still move forward with vigour and dynamism.”“We are the political party that represents a united Goa, a prosperous Goa. We are a political party that represents the idea that Goa can love each other, can work with each other. They (BJP) are the political party that represents that Goa has to be divided. That Goans have to disrespect each other. That Goans cannot share a future together...”BJP MP from South Bengaluru Tejasvi Surya said Gandhi was holidaying in Goa. “Rahul Gandhi, like Mamata Banerjee, is a political tourist in Goa.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/upcoming-polls-a-battle-for-state-s-future-rahul-gandhi-in-goa-101635617100962.html
31-10-2021||India||‘India’s action on climate is already impressive’: British High Commissioner||The joint initiative of India and the UK, dubbed the Green Grids Initiative – One Sun One World One Grid, is one of the biggest announcements expected at the United Nations climate summit in Glasgow. The initiative will stimulate green investments and create green jobs, Alex Ellis, British High Commissioner to India, said in an interview to Jayashree Nandi. Edited excerpts:The UK is the host of the climate summit. It’s the most important climate conference, after Paris in 2015. What are your expectations?The international scientific consensus is that the world is running out of time to avert great harm to ourselves and our planet through climate change. The COP26 summit is our last best chance to avert this by putting the world on the path to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees.The UK, as hosts of COP26, is asking all countries together to keep the path to 1.5 degrees alive, enhancing their emissions targets for this decade and setting out long-term strategies... We also want to ensure that countries are supported in adapting to climate change and that developed countries deliver climate finance, and technology flows to support green economic transformation in developing countries.Glasgow’s success is India’s success and the world’s success.How are the UK and India collaborating ahead of COP26?The UK and India work closely on climate change. It’s one of the five pillars of the India-UK 2030 Roadmap agreed by prime ministers Narendra Modi and Boris Johnson in May this year. India’s action on climate is already impressive, with wind and solar capacity quadrupling in the last decade and the PM’s recent announcement of the new National Hydrogen Mission.The UK is investing in India’s renewable and clean transport sectors, including through our joint Green Growth Equity Fund. We have joint research and innovation partnerships to develop the next generation of solar buildings and energy efficiency solutions.We are working not just bilaterally but also to support other countries adapt to and reduce climate change, through the International Solar Alliance and Coalition for Disaster Resilient infrastructure, both launched by India.One of the major initiatives at COP26 will be the UK and India’s green grids initiative. Could you share some details about it?The Green Grids Initiative is due to be launched by our two prime ministers during the World Leaders Summit at COP26. The objective is to help develop a more interconnected grid that enables the sun to become a secure and reliable source of energy for all. These efforts will stimulate green investments and create green jobs.There is a lack of trust among developing countries like India because the promised $100 billion a year climate finance has not come through. Yet, at the same time, developing nations are being expected to commit to net-zero emissions targets. What are your thoughts on this trust deficit?The UK agrees that the goal of securing $100 billion is a priority to help developing countries grow in a clean way, and to protect those affected by climate change. We have led by example, doubling our international climate spend to at least £11.6 billion between 2021-25. We now have pledges by major developed countries like the US, Germany, Canada, Japan, Denmark, Sweden, and New Zealand, as well as the European Union, among others. The UK COP26 presidency have recently published a delivery plan, which shows that developed countries will make significant progress towards the $100 billion goal in 2022 and provides confidence that it will be met in 2023. The data also provides confidence that developed countries can mobilise more than $100 billion per year thereafter through to 2025.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-action-on-climate-is-already-impressive-british-high-commissioner-to-india-alex-ellis-101635616923927.html
31-10-2021||India||Climate finance, carbon markets to top India’s agenda at COP26||The United Nations climate summit that begins in Glasgow on Sunday could be the last chance for humanity to tackle the catastrophic changes due to unrestrained global warming, scientists and activists have said.Under current national climate commitments, the world is on track for a temperature increase of 2.7 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, the United Nations Environment Programme warned on October 25, which is much above the goal of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement to keep it below 2 degrees compared with the beginning of the industrial era.Unless countries agree to steeply cut carbon emissions, global temperatures will rise beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius in the next 10 to 20 years compared with pre-industrial times, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s largest group of climate experts, had said in its scientific assessment in August.Scientists, activists and environmentalists believe that the Glasgow summit, also known as COP26, could be the last opportunity to keep global warming to agreed upon limits.Over 25,000 delegates are expected to gather in Glasgow for the climate talks. While one of the main agenda is keeping the 1.5 degrees goal alive, countries will have to negotiate and agree on several critical issues like carbon markets, loss and damage and long-term climate finance.In the previous conference held in Madrid in 2019, countries were unable to reach an agreement on new market mechanisms. Several other issues were left unresolved as well, including common time frames for implementation of voluntary national pledges, long-term climate finance and transparency on climate action, all of which will have to be resolved at COP26.COP26 begins with the World Leaders’ Summit on November 1 and 2, which will be attended by over 120 world leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Usually, the leaders’ summit is held in the second week of the annual talks. The world leaders are this time expected to set the tone for COP26 and declare their intent of containing global warming even before negotiations start.At the Rome summit of the G20 nations, the climate crisis featured high on the agenda. G20 leaders, including Modi, are expected to reach a consensus on how to deal with the crisis and transition to a low-carbon economy. “This time, world leaders will set the agenda for COP26, which is a positive development,” Sunita Narain, director general of advocacy group Centre for Science and Environment, said at a media briefing. “Over the past few decades, climate negotiations were going nowhere. COP26 must reclaim its leadership and the trust of people from across the world, both rich and poor. It must not be lost to the usual prevarication in negotiations and the tantrums and posturings of pusillanimous leaders.”For India, the two critical issues are climate finance and carbon markets. India seeks a level playing field for all countries by pushing for climate finance and technology transfer, environment minister Bhupender Yadav, who is the leader of India’s delegation, had told HT in an interview on October 29.Carbon markets are critical for India because trading can lead to both a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions and can generate climate finance, he said.Carbon markets are touted to be one of the most efficient tools to keep mean global temperature rise to under 2 degrees by capping global emissions globally after 2020. Simply put, when a country limits carbon emissions through a project, it creates carbon credits, which can be sold to another nation that fails to meet its target.Under the Paris Agreement, nations will have to come out with a new market mechanism, but there are logjams over various issues. For example, India wants unused carbon credits from the Kyoto Protocol era to be recognised and traded, while experts from the developed world have raised concerns that these credits could flood and ruin the new market even before it starts.Climate finance is the other contentious issue expected to feature prominently in the summit.According to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change’s standing committee on Finance, developing countries need almost $6 trillion up to 2030 to implement their national commitments. The highly anticipated climate finance delivery plan released last week said developed countries will likely be able to mobilise the promised $100 billion a year only in 2023, a delay of three years from the 2020 deadline originally promised.“A successful outcome at COP26 will be a balanced package of measures to cut emissions rapidly in this decade and urgently scale up finance to adapt to climate impacts. Developed countries need to reassure developing countries that they will make up the shortfall in climate finance and set an ambitious new goal. Finalising the rules for carbon trading will help create a common currency that enables Indian industry to link its efforts to international markets and reduce the cost of emission reduction,” said Ulka Kelkar, economist and director, climate at World Resources Institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/climate-finance-carbon-markets-to-top-india-s-agenda-at-cop26-101635616272896.html

31-10-2021||India||Power ministry proposes mandatory green energy use for industrial units||Industrial units may soon have to use a share of renewable energy mandatorily as the Union power ministry has proposed amendments to the Energy Conservation (EC) Act, 2001 to increase India’s reliance on green power resources. The amendments will also include incentives in the form of carbon saving certificates for use of green hydrogen as an alternative to the fossil fuels that are currently being used by the industries.“Amidst the growing energy needs and changing global climate landscape, the Government of India has identified new areas to achieve higher levels of penetration of renewable energy by proposing certain Amendments to Energy Conservation Act, 2001. The objective will be to enhance demand for renewable energy at the end-use sectors such as industry, buildings, transport and so on. The ministry of power has prepared amendments, after consultations with stakeholders, and the proposal includes defining minimum share of renewable energy in the overall consumption by industrial units or any establishment,” the ministry said in a statement.The move, once notified, will be significant as 41.16% of India’s total electricity demand comes from the industrial sector. The proposal is also likely to be mentioned by the government in the Glasgow climate change conference (COP26), which starts from Sunday since the developed countries want India to frame the updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) or targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.At present, India has an installed renewable energy capacity of 147 GW, including hydropower, and another 63 GW is under installation through various projects.“Union power minister RK Singh reviewed the proposed amendments recently and directed to seek comments and suggestions from the concerned ministries, departments and state governments. Accordingly, a meeting was held by Alok Kumar, secretary (Power) on October 28 with all the stakeholders to give a final shape to the proposed amendments in the EC Act,” a ministry spokesperson said.A senior ministry official, on condition of anonymity, explained that the prescribed minimum consumption of renewable energy by industries could either be through direct consumption or even indirect use by purchasing green energy from the grid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/power-ministry-proposesmandatory-green-energy-use-for-industrial-units-101635615240828.html
31-10-2021||India||Uttar Pradesh: 3, including 2 more IAF officers, test positive for Zika||Two Indian Air Force (IAF) personnel and a civilian were tested positive for zika virus disease in Kanpur on Saturday, taking the tally in the district to four, Uttar Pradesh health officials said, adding that the state now has the second highest number of cases after Kerala, where 90 cases have been confirmed so far.Of the three new cases, two are IAF personnel and one is a family member of one of the infected personnel. Their reports came in on Saturday evening from King George’s Medical University (KGMU), Lucknow.Confirming the new cases, Kanpur district magistrate Vishakh G Iyer said, “The health department had sent 500 samples of IAF personnel, their family members and people living in a radius of two km of IAF station to KGMU on Thursday. Three of these samples tested positive.”The new cases have come a week after the first case of zika virus in Uttar Pradesh was reported in Kanpur on October 23, when an IAF warrant officer’s sample tested positive.According to health experts, zika virus disease is caused by virus transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes, which bite during the day time. Symptoms of the disease are generally mild and include fever, rash, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain and malaise or headache.While the source of the infection in Kanpur has not yet been traced, a senior health official said that the storage facility between hangars seven and eight at the IAF station has emerged as an area of interest. Specialists from the Centre and the state are camping in the city for about a week.“Three of the infected IAF personnel were working in hangars seven and eight and may have contracted the infection,” said a senior health official requesting anonymity. The health authorities believe this storage facility at the IAF station could be the possible breeding ground.In the first case, the IAF warrant officer was diagnosed with fever and admitted in 7 Air Force Hospital. When his condition did not improve, doctors at the hospital sent his samples for tests on October 20, on suspicion that he might have contracted a vector-borne disease.Twenty-two contacts of the IAF warrant officer had tested negative. The reports of subsequent samples, around 250, had also come negative.However, the fresh cases have added to the concerns of the health department, which has increased the area of screening. According to health officials, the department has decided that samples from as far as Adarsh Nagar and Shyam Nagar localities, where three infected people lived, would be screened. Earlier, the main focus was on Pardevanpurwa, the IAF station and localities within its one-km radius.Iyer said that pregnant women living at the IAF station and other localities were the main priority for the health department. “We have asked the IAF to share the details of such women, their samples will be taken and tested in Lucknow,” he said.The Zika virus is known to affect the baby’s head in the womb, said health experts.Kanpur’s chief medical officer Dr Nepal Singh said the health department has formed containment clusters—each consisting of 400 houses. The health department teams are doing rigorous screening, source reduction, anti-larva spray and identification of people who are sick, Singh added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-3-including-2-more-iaf-officers-test-positive-for-zika-101635614820740.html

31-10-2021||Today's||Indira Gandhi’s legacy: The successes and the mistakes||Some terrible moments stay with one for years. October 31, 1984, is a day I remember every year with a degree of horror. It was on this day that Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was killed by her bodyguards at her official residence, following which a cycle of violence and riots took over the country for several days. As a journalist, I witnessed some of those tragic moments first-hand.Today, when we remember Indira Gandhi, many think of her as one of the architects of modern India. As soon as she assumed office, she made a series of hasty, populist decisions. The abolition of the privy purses and the nationalisation of banks were among her early decisions, which were considered at that time to be positive socio-economic reforms.The most marginalised segments of society reposed high hopes in these reforms. This formed the foundations of her long and successful stint in politics. Indira Gandhi had an amazing ability to communicate with and mesmerise the poor and disadvantaged. In 1971, her slogan, “They say remove Indira, I say eradicate poverty” was a crowd-puller.Poverty, of course, was not eradicated but the poor turned up in droves to vote for her.We should also remember that, just before she came to power, India fought a fierce war with Pakistan. India was badly affected; there had also been a period of shortages and an inability to feed a huge population. We had to rely on wheat provided by the United States (US). Using this as a lever, then US President Lyndon B Johnson took to threatening India in various ways. It is also believed that the US once actually stopped a ship laden with wheat meant for India at a port for some length of time. This was hurtful and embarrassing for India as the warehouses did not have enough food grains. India had no choice but to survive at the mercy of the US.This was the time when Indira Gandhi, on the advice of experts, instituted a series of improvements in the field of agriculture. The historic Green Revolution was the product of the decisions she took. If India’s warehouses are overloaded with grain today, much of the credit must go to Indira Gandhi.She was also extremely sensitive on the matter of India’s borders. She strategically changed the map of this subcontinent a second time by making Sikkim a part of India. That was an extremely bold move. There was a possibility of strong resistance from China, and it was also feared that small neighbouring countries might react badly. But she was firm in her resolve.She had already divided Pakistan into two parts in 1971. That battle will always hold a high place in the military history of the world. This was the first time that more than 90,000 soldiers from one country were forced to surrender before the Indian Army. Imagine what would have happened if Pakistan had not been divided like this? We would have had much more insurgency in the border-states such as Kashmir and in the Northeast.Despite having been personally insulted by former US President Richard Nixon, Indira Gandhi did not back down. By signing a long-term strategic treaty with the erstwhile Soviet Union, she gave India a considerable degree of security. The first nuclear test at Pokhran on May 18, 1974, is no less important. This put the brakes on any possible misadventures by audacious neighbours. These were remarkably bold moves.Despite her many successes, she stayed in touch with people. When I was in primary school in Allahabad, we would be taken to greet her during her visits. We often found people there holding black flags and chanting hostile slogans When asked by journalists, her answer would be that the Opposition had every right to protest. But was she really so generous?Those were the days of political heavyweights in the Opposition. Leaders such as Ram Manohar Lohia, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, George Fernandes and many others were bitterly opposed to her, at times calling her a dictator. She proved her dictatorial tendencies by imposing the Emergency. The 21 months of the Emergency from June 25, 1975, to March 21, 1977, blotted her political record.She is also known as the real founder of dynastic politics. She tried to promote her younger son, Sanjay, and after his tragic death in a plane crash, she pulled her reluctant older son into politics. A dynast herself, she perpetuated this trend.Though she failed to establish peace in Punjab, Kashmir and the Northeast, her legacy remains strong even 37 years after her death. Her memories will live on.Shashi Shekhar is editor-in-chief, Hindustan The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/indira-gandhi-s-legacy-the-successes-and-the-mistakes-101635683724011.html

31-10-2021||Editorials||The NDA’s step towards inclusion||On Saturday, this newspaper reported that a third of the students appearing for the entrance exam for the National Defence Academy (NDA) on November 14 are women. The absolute number is significant — 178,000 women. This is testimony to how far the armed forces have evolved, with army chief General MM Naravane terming the induction of women in NDA as the first step towards gender equality, and anticipating a woman army chief in 40 years. The number of applications also shows how an enthusiastic and willing, but excluded, constituency is embracing the first opportunity it has got to exercise its right. This moment comes three decades after women were allowed into select branches of the armed forces as short service commission officers.
31-10-2021||Editorials||Two paths of recovery||That the economy is on the path to recovery, and has been for some time, is beyond doubt. This recovery could have been even stronger if not for glitches in international value chains that have created a supply-side constraint in crucial industries such as automobiles and electronics. Does that mean the Indian economy has fully shed its pandemic blues? Data on the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) shows that such a conclusion is far from true. MGNREGS is the employment of last resort in rural India. It involves manual work, pays less than market wages and the payments come with a delay. Yet, demand for MGNREGS work continues to be high. HT reported on October 31 that the programme continues to see high participation, so much so that it now needs more funds.
