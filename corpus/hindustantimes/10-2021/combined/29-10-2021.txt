29-10-2021||Chandigarh||SAD constitution forgery: Hoshiarpur court summons former CM Badal||Hoshiarpur additional chief judicial magistrate Rupinder Singh has summoned former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal in a case of alleged forgery of the constitution of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). SAD patriarch Badal was on Thursday asked to appear before the court on November 28. His son, Sukhbir Singh Badal, who is the SAD president, and party spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema have already got bail in the case. According to a directive of November 4, 2019, on the plea of complainant Balwant Singh Khera, Badal, Sukhbir and Cheema were to be summoned. Sukhbir and Cheema have already appeared. “Let accused Parkash Singh Badal be summoned on November 28,” the court order concluded. Complainant cites SAD’s ‘panthic’ activities Khera, a social activist, had complained that the SAD possessed two constitutions – one that it had submitted with the Gurdwara Election Commission and the other with the Election Commission of India (ECI) to seek recognition as a political outfit. He alleged that the SAD had given a false undertaking to the ECI that it had amended its constitution to incorporate the principles of socialism and secularism, whereas it continued its activities as a ‘panthic’ party and openly participated in gurdwara elections. Sufficient evidence against Badals: HC On August 27, the Punjab and Haryana high court disposed of a petition by the SAD against the proceedings of the Hoshiarpur court, saying there was sufficient evidence before the judicial magistrate to summon Badal, Sukhbir and Cheema on their undertakings regarding the party’s constitution. “Sufficient material has come on record wherein contrary stands have been taken regarding the constitution of the political party and whether it has adopted the principles of secularism or is still a religious party. It has also come on record that the SAD has been contesting the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee elections,” the high court bench of justice GS Sandhawalia observed. The SAD leaders had approached the high court in 2019, seeking a stay on the trial after the Hoshiarpur additional chief judicial magistrate summoned them in the case. The high court stayed the trial. Badal approaches SC against HC order Badal filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court against the Punjab and Haryana high court order dismissing his petition seeking quashing of the complaint filed by Khera in the Hoshiarpur court, besides rejecting the prayer to set aside the summoning order of November 2019 and stay the proceedings of the Hoshiarpur court. The SC is yet to take up the matter for hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-constitution-forgery-hoshiarpur-court-summons-former-cm-badal-101635532194520.html
29-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM Channi in Delhi again, meets Soni, Maken||Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi travelled to Delhi again on Friday to meet Rajya Sabha MP Ambika Soni and other central leaders of the Congress to discuss the political scenario in the state ahead of assembly polls. Channi was accompanied by Harish Chaudhary, the newly appointed in-charge of Punjab affairs, and Mohammad Mustafa, principal strategic adviser to state Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu. They first met Soni and discussed the election strategy and related issues, a party leader privy to discussions said. The CM later met Congress treasurer Pawan Kumar Bansal and All India Congress Committee general secretary in-charge of Rajasthan affairs Ajay Maken, who was one of the two observers sent by the central leadership for the appointment of the new chief minister following the resignation of Capt Amarinder Singh. Bansal termed it a courtesy call. “When politicians meet, there is obviously a discussion on politics,” he said, refusing to go into specifics. Channi on Thursday met former Congress president Rahul Gandhi in Delhi amid apprehensions about the fallout of his predecessor Capt Amarinder Singh’s plans to form a separate party in next few days. The CM’s frequent flying visits to Delhi have drawn flak from the opposition. The Shiormani Akali Dal (SAD) said the (Congress) infighting was costing the state exchequer. “Since when are Congressmen are entitled to choppers? CM@CharanjitChanni flying to Delhi with state in charge @Barmer_Harsih & @sherryontopp strategic advisor @MohdMustafaips to discuss internal matters with Ambika Soni on taxpayers’ money,” the opposition party tweeted. Earlier, former Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar also took a dig at the CM’s frequent trips to the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-channi-in-delhi-again-meets-soni-maken-101635532075693.html
29-10-2021||Noida||Noida: Man held for posing with sub-inspector’s revolver, cop suspended||A 25-year-old man was arrested for allegedly posing with a sub-inspector’s revolver at a police check point in the jurisdiction of Expressway police station. The suspect was identified as Nagesh, a resident of Yakutpur village. Police said he frequently visited the check post and was known to the sub-inspector Umesh Kumar, who has been suspended. Yatendra Kumar, station house officer of Expressway police station, said a video was making the rounds on social media on Friday, in which a man was seen moving around a police check post with the revolver in his belt. “We scanned the video and identified that the police check post was in Sector 168. We questioned the check post in-charge and sub-inspector Kumar in this regard,” he said. Kumar revealed that on Thursday morning, he had placed the gun on the table and went to the washroom. “In his absence, the suspect reached the check post, picked up the gun and hung it in his belt,” said the SHO. The sub inspector got his revolver back but someone recorded Nagesh with the revolver. The video then went viral on social networking sites. Police said a case has been registered against the suspect under Section 7 and 25 of the Arms Act. “He was produced in court and sent to judicial custody. The sub-inspector has been suspended for negligence,” said the SHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-man-held-for-posing-with-sub-inspector-s-revolver-cop-suspended-101635532016604.html
29-10-2021||Mumbai||Bullet train: Bids invited for 20-km underground tunnel||In what could be termed as a major development on the ambitious Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train corridor, the National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) on Friday invited bids for the construction of the 20.37-km underground tunnel, including a 7-km part under the sea between Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) and Shilphata in Thane, for the route. The bids for the tunnel work have to be submitted by March and the construction work is likely to begin by the end of next year.The underground tunnel will be a single-tube twin track of 13.1m diameter, which will start from BKC and end at Shilphata. Of the 20.37km, 15.42km of tunnelling work will be carried out with three tunnel-boring machines (TBM) and the remaining 4.96km will be carried out with a new Austrian tunnelling method.“NHSRCL has invited bids for the tunnelling work of 21km. The package is open to Japanese and Indian companies,” said a senior NHSRCL official.In order to complete the work in the stipulated time, three shafts have been planned. The depth of the tunnel will vary from 25-40 metres. The tunnel will cross Thane creek. The survey works under the creek was conducted by underwater static refraction technique and was successfully completed.The work on the underground sea tunnel is critical and had begun in December 2017, wherein a team of engineers from NHSRCL and Rail India Technical and Economic Service Ltd, and Japan’s Kawasaki Geological Engineering studied data on the seabed, based on geo-technical surveys. The study was conducted to understand the structure and depth of the seabed of Thane Creek and based on the report the alignment of the tunnel was fixed.The 508.17-km-long Mumbai-Ahmedabad high-speed rail corridor project work commenced in 2017. The work on the project was initially aimed to be completed by 2023. The estimated cost of the project is ₹110,000 crore, of which ₹88,000 crore will be funded by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).The project is facing hurdles owing to land acquisition issues, mostly in Maharashtra. Of the 508.17km for the project, 155.76km is in Maharashtra, 384.04km in Gujarat and 4.3km in Dadra and Nagar Haveli.The Mumbai-Ahmedabad corridor will have stations at Bandra-Kurla Complex (terminal on Mumbai-end of the corridor), Thane, Virar, Boisor, Vapi, Billimora, Surat, Bharuch, Vadodara, Anand, Ahmedabad and Sabarmati.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bullet-train-bids-invited-for-20-km-underground-tunnel-101635531954392.html

29-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi schools to reopen: Tiffin preps and alarms are back, say parents||It’s been a long year-and-a-half for students since schools first shut down due to Covid-19. However, as Delhi returns to normalcy, schools in the city are ready to welcome back students for in-person classes after November 1. And while students and parents see this as a welcome change, returning to the traditional schooling routine will be no child’s play. From having to wake up early to getting kids (and themselves) back in a routine will be tricky, feel parents of school going kids in the Capital. For Model Town resident Ankita Sarda, this means the end of a flexible lifestyle. “Now, we’ll have to start following a strict routine. The kids’ sleep timings were flexible so far but now early bedtime has to be in place. My morning workouts would be replaced by lunch box preparation and getting my kid ready for school! But yes, I can plan my day better now that school will reopen and I won’t have to be restricted to the house all day,” says the mother of a second grader and a toddler. And while preparing tiffin is one task, deciding what to make, is another! Geeta Verma, an entrepreneur from Patparganj, whose daughter attends the sixth grade, says, “Thinking of what to make for lunch is as it is tough and now this would have to be done early morning as I would have to pack it for my daughter! Abhi toh jab bhi bhook lagti thi, I would cook something for her.” Nidhi Dhull, an advocate and social activist from Saket, feels that schools opening will again make holidays feel special for her son, who is in the first standard. “Children will enjoy the charm of holidays once again, after a long time. My son is excited to meet his classmates face-to-face. Finally, this will give me free hours during the day for some me time,” she says.Along with some personal time, getting back to work with more focus is also a possibility now. Anandika Leekha Tandon, mother of a five-year-old and a businesswoman from Sarvodaya Enclave shares, “I’m glad we’ll be able to get back to work full-time once the kids go back to school.” However, for some parents, schools reopening also means making sure their kids keep up with their peers. “We were taking it slow initially, as we were getting used to the online setup. We thought it was all too much to take for the kids during the lockdown. So last year, we didn’t attend classes properly. This was when she was in KG. She’s in first grade now and have a lot to catch up on,” says Garima Sharma, a homemaker from Model Town.Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-schools-to-reopen-tiffin-preps-and-alarms-are-back-say-parents-101635531730258.html
29-10-2021||Gurugram||GMDA to repair master drain to solve waterlogging woes of Old Gurugram||With an aim to solve waterlogging problems of different areas near the Railway Road, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has decided to repair the damaged master stormwater drain at a cost of around ₹15 crore. The repair work is likely to start in December and will be completed before the next monsoon season, said officials. The officials said that the drain got damaged between Umang Bharadwaj Chowk and Basai Chowk while construction of a flyover at Basai and a railway overbridge at Railway Road. “The master drain was dismantled during the construction of the flyover and the rail overbridge. Once the drain is redeveloped, it will help solve waterlogging problems in Old Gurugram, especially areas like Hero Honda, Umang Bharadwaj Chowk, Basai, sectors 9, 9A, and 10 till Civil Lines. This monsoon season, we had to deploy additional pumps to drain out water from the surface drain, which was not sufficient compared to the amount of rainfall received,” said Vikram Singh, executive engineer from infrastructure-2 division of GMDA, who is working on the project. Around 1,530 metres of the drain was damaged during the development works, the officials said, adding the repair work is likely to start by end-November or in December. During this monsoon, waterlogging was reported from various parts of the city due to heavy rainfall. Some of the worst-affected areas were Narsinghpur-Khandsa stretch, Sohna Road, Sector 9, Sector 10, Gurugram bus depot, CH Baktawar Singh Road, and Rajiv Chowk. The authority had last year identified 20 critical waterlogging points, which included many areas in Old Gurugram, where damage to this stormwater drain was a primary reason for waterlogging. MD Goel, a resident of Khushboo Apartments in Sector 9A, said, “Areas around our society get waterlogged even if it rains for half an hour. With the repair of this drain, the situation might improve.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gmda-to-repair-master-drain-to-solve-waterlogging-woes-of-old-gurugram-101635531594389.html
29-10-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: RWAs need civic body’s permission for hosting Diwali fairs||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on Friday issued a notice to all the resident welfare associations (RWAs) in the city, directing them to take its permission for organising Diwali fairs or any other public events during the upcoming festival season.The notice issued six days before Diwali, which will be celebrated this year on November 4, is the first such directive issued by the civic body since its formation in 2008.“It is mandatory to take permission from the corporation for organising any type of public events, including Diwali mela (fair) in the city. If any society or organisation conducts such events without permission, then action will be taken against them under the Haryana Municipal Act 1994, fire safety norms, and solid waste management rules, among other relevant laws,” said Hariom Attri, joint commissioner (headquarters), MCG.Attri said that during Diwali fairs and other festival events, a lot of waste is generated, fire safety norms are violated, and advertisements are displayed without any prior approval. Hence, the MCG has issued the directive to ensure norms are adhered to, he said.The notice was issued to the resident bodies of all condominiums and gated colonies, the officials said. Although Attri did not specify the actions which can be taken for violation of the directive, a senior MCG official privy to the matter said, “The Haryana Fire Safety Act and the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act allow the MCG to seal and close down events being organised without its permission. In case there is a fire, criminal action can also be taken against the organiser or RWA.”The MCG’s directive has evoked a mixed response from RWAs.Jyoti Ahuja, administrator, RWAs United, a group of 77 RWAs, said that the MCG’s directive has left RWAs with a little time period to procure requisite permissions.“The MCG should have issued the notice a month ago. By now, most RWAs would have done their venue bookings, while stalls would have also been booked. With just six days left for Diwali, including the weekend when government offices will be closed, it will be very difficult for most RWAs to procure the licences in time,” said Ahuja.Dhruv Bansal, official spokesperson for Gurgaon Citizens Council (GCC), an umbrella body of RWAs in the city, said that the move may lead to lower turnout and help RWAs maintain Covid-19 norms.“If a licence is compulsory from the MCG for holding public events in residential areas, it can prove to be a deterrent for violation of Covid-19 norms. The directive to take permission from MCG is an important step, especially due to the possibility of third Covid-19 wave,” said Bansal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-rwas-need-civic-body-s-permission-for-hosting-diwali-fairs-101635531539501.html
29-10-2021||Gurugram||Diesel generator sets banned under Grap in Haryana||A day after the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) issued directions banning the use of diesel generator sets in the National Capital Region keeping in view the deteriorating air quality, the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) on Friday ordered all NCR districts of the state, including Gurugram, to follow the directions strictly. S Narayanan, member secretary of HSPCB, said, “We have issued orders to all NCR districts to follow the directions as air quality is likely to dip to ‘very poor’ category by next week. On October 1, we directed the power department to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply to minimise the use of DG sets. No exemptions will be given as the power department has assured us that supply will be uninterrupted.” The CPCB on Thursday banned the use of diesel generator sets and ordered enhancing of parking fee by up to four times in Delhi-NCR, measures listed under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) when the air quality hits ‘very poor’.Though the air quality in Gurugram has been oscillating between ‘satisfactory’ and ‘poor’ categories over the past five days, pollution levels have increased fast during the period. On Friday, Gurugram recorded ‘poor’ air quality with an air quality index (AQI) value of 262, according to CPCB’s daily bulletin. Before this, the city reported ‘poor’ air quality on October 20, after which the air quality improved to ‘satisfactory’ on October 24, but again there was a sharp dip by Friday. The CPCB order to enforce the implementation of Grap measures under ‘very poor’ category came after a meeting by a sub-committee of the Commission for Air Quality Management in Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas concluded that the air quality in Delhi-NCR is likely to reach ‘very poor’ category in the coming days. The committee also said that the minimum temperature is likely to drop to 14-15°C with increased moisture, which is unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants. Besides ban on diesel gensets and increase in parking fee, other measures that will come into force include ban on the use of coal and wood in restaurants and open kitchens and augmentation of bus and Metro services. These measures will be in addition to the steps that were enforced on October 18 listed under ‘moderate to poor’ category such as ban on firecrackers, stopping burning of garbage, mechanised sweeping of roads, and sprinkling of water on unpaved roads, among others. Meanwhile, officials from the Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) said that they are prepared to give uninterrupted power supply to all residents in Gurugram. “We are trying to give uninterrupted power supply to all households across the district, except some areas where builders have not laid down the power infrastructure as per norms for providing connection and the issue is under consideration with the government,” said Naveen Kumar, chief engineer of DHBVN. Sherebanu Frosh, a resident and member of Warrior Moms said, “Putting a ban on diesel generator sets just during the winters will not solve the problem. Stopping the use of diesel gensets can cause problems to elderly residents. The condominiums where such sets are used can get the latest tech devices fitted to the sets which can reduce pollutants by almost 80%.”In December 2020, around 19 residential societies in both Gurugram and Faridabad were dependent on diesel generator sets for power supply, which was down from 209 in 2019. For this year, officials could not provide the numbers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/diesel-generator-sets-banned-under-grap-in-haryana-101635531534614.html

In the first phase, 25 e-rickshaws will be made available at the metro stations of Noida Electronic City, Noida City Centre, Sector 62 and Sector 34 for commuting to neighbouring areas. The shared e-rickshaw will also help people in navigating to Ghaziabad’s Indirapuram, said officials. Mangu Singh, managing director of DMRC, launched a fleet of e-rickshaws from Noida Electronic City metro station on Friday. “Along with providing metro rail connectivity to the people of Delhi-NCR, we aim to address the last mile connectivity challenges faced by commuters by providing clean, safe and shared services. This would play a major role in contributing towards a safe travel experience,” said Singh. These e-rickshaws will ply from 6am to 11pm daily from the four metro stations.N K Rawal, managing director of ETO Motors, said his company has a tie-up with the DMRC and similar e-rickshaw services are in place in Delhi. “We received good response at Delhi’s metro stations in Jamia Nagar, Shaheen Bagh and Sukhdev Vihar and hence we launched this service in Noida. These GPS enabled e-rickshaws are specially designed with a covered cabin and full front windscreen to provide last mile connectivity within an area of four to five kilometres around metro stations,” he said.The fares have been kept nominal at ₹10 for first two kilometres and ₹5 for every kilometre after the first two kilometres. The commuters can also book vehicles through the ETO app and pay in cash or through e-wallets for their rides. Charging stations have been put in place at the Electronic City Metro Station. Rawal said the company has also hired 10 women drivers in order to support women empowerment. Suman (28), a woman e-rickshaw driver, said an NGO had provided her training for driving heavy vehicles in Delhi. “I worked in Delhi for few years. Recently, someone informed me about the e-rickshaw driver’s job in Noida. I am happy to have been selected for driving the e-rickshaws here,” said Suman, who lives in Delhi’s Madanpur Khadar.The DMRC and ETO Motors plan to launch 1000 e-rickshaws and e-autos in Delhi-NCR by March 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-gets-e-rickshaws-at-four-metro-stations-for-last-mile-connectivity-101635531475579.html

29-10-2021||Mumbai||Iconic Metro Cinema in south gets Mumbai heritage nod for floor addition||The Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee (MHCC) has given its nod for the construction of an additional floor at the city’s iconic theatre Metro Cinema in Marine Lines. MHCC granted a no-objection certificate (NOC) to the heritage theatre – which is over 80 years old – after its owner had sought permission to allow them to construct an additional fifth floor on the existing wing of the Metro Cinema building, facing MG Road.As per MHCC’s records, Metro Cinema is listed as Grade-2A structure in the heritage list. The proposal for the construction of the additional floor was put forward by conservation Architect Kirtida Unwalla, who was the owners’ representative at MHCC and also a member of the committee. The proposal stated that there is an existing parapet wall of 3.4metres (m) in height at the terrace level and a new floor is proposed of 3.8m in height, citing that it would substantially not change the skyline of the building. The proposal further explained that a receding parapet wall is proposed at a new terrace floor and elevation of the floor would match the overall aesthetics of the art deco building.The minutes of meetings of MHCC, released on Thursday, read, “The committee found the proposal acceptable from a heritage point of view. However, it was suggested that the tower structure at the corner is an important art deco element of the structure and junction/intersection of new parapet wall and the tower shall follow the proportions of overall art deco scheme of the building.”The suggestion was accepted by the owner, post which MHCC decided to grant its NOC. However, the committee put forward four conditions, including ensuring the building’s structural stability as per the prevailing norms for the additional floor before starting work at the site and implementation of the elevations suggested by MHCC.Similarly, another two other conditions included that the NOC is issued from the heritage point of view and the authenticity/approvability of the proposal, including structural stability, floor space index (FSI) etc should be approved by the building proposal department of the civic body, as per the provisions of the prevailing policies. The NOC also mandated getting all other applicable permissions and ensuring that the applicant takes a completion certificate of MHCC on completion of the work at site.Metro Cinema is a beloved icon of Mumbai since the late 1930s and has played a vital role in the history of India’s film industry. The cinema house was built and originally run by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). In the 1970s, after being taken over by the Gupta family, the cinema became Indian film industry’s most famous red-carpet theatre.The Metro Cinema building – ground-plus-four structure – is now being operated by Inox as a multiplex. Metro Inox has eight screens and a seating capacity of 1,350 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/iconic-metro-cinema-in-south-gets-mumbai-heritage-nod-for-floor-addition-101635531415529.html
29-10-2021||Noida||Experts say at least 5 months needed to demolish Twin Towers of Supertech group||Experts studying the Supertech group’s twin towers in Noida’s Sector 93-A, which were constructed in violation of building norms, said on Friday they need at least five months to demolish the structures. They have suggested that the Supertech group plan the future course of action accordingly.Mohan Ramanathan, founder and chairman of the Indian Demolition Association and officials of three private agencies from Mumbai, which specialise in demolishing tall towers, visited the twin towers on Friday and accessed the inside of the twin towers. The team entered the tower after the vegetation and debris were cleared from the site as the buildings were lying sealed for the past seven years. “For the first time, we had access to the inside of the twin towers. Earlier, we had visited only the outside premises. To study such buildings, it takes at least a month or two, depending upon the structure and drawings. Once the study is complete, it will take at least another three months for demolition. In this case, it may take at least five to six months to demolish the twin towers. We will calculate the exact time required to complete the whole process once we complete assessing the building,” said Ramanathan, who was involved in the demolition of a 65 metre-long building in Maradu in Kochi, Kerala.Ramanathan said they used explosives for the demolition of the buildings in Kochi in January 2020, after those buildings were found to be in violation of the Coastal Regulation Zone norms by the Supreme Court.“We cannot say right now whether we can use explosives in this case; that will depend on technical calculations, which will be carried out once the study is complete. This is a difficult case technically because it will be the tallest residential tower ever to be demolished in India, as it is 100 metres in height. We need to assess the consequences because it is surrounded by residential towers,” said Ramanathan.In its order on October 31, the Supreme Court gave three months to the Supertech group to demolish the towers, and directed the Noida authority and Central Building Research Institute (CBRI) to supervise the demolition work. The Supreme Court ordered the demolition of the twin towers as the structure was built in violation of building norms. Two months have already passed since the apex court passed the demolition order.Experts said they are discussing only technical issues. The issue of the time taken to demolish the twin towers will be taken care of by parties concerned, according to the Supreme Court order. Experts gave a presentation to the Noida authority officials on Wednesday and informed them of the total time that will be required for the demolition process. They informed the officials that it may take more time as they have to ensure the safety of residents living in nearby towers.The Noida authority had sealed the twin towers following a Supreme Court order in April 2014. The building was de-sealed on October 26 this year again, further delaying the demolition process. “We are here to make sure that the Supreme Court order is implemented in totality. We are not concerned with how much time the agency hired for the demolition will take as it is the duty of Supertech to demolish the twin towers as per the court order. What is important is that we carry out our duties as per the SC order,” said Ritu Maheshwari, CEO of the Noida authority.Chairman of Supertech Limited RK Arora said, “We will communicate all technical issues to Noida authority and the CBRI. We are committed to adhering to the SC order.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/experts-say-at-least-5-months-needed-to-demolish-twin-towers-of-supertech-group-101635531114195.html

He also said that Kranti should not play the ‘Marathi Card’.“Dr Shabana Quraishi was never willing to come forward or speak over this issue (earlier). When Sameer Wankhede started stressing that he is Hindu, they had to speak up. Her father then told everyone that they always knew Wankhede family as being Muslim,” Malik was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. Some Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders questioned Malik’s decision to use the photos to get his point across.“When the photos were received, it was said that the person in the photograph agreed that they could be used,” Malik said.“While she has been playing the Marathi card, I want to underscore the fact that I and my family have been living in Maharashtra for almost 70 years. Am I not a Maharashtrian,” Malik said, highlighting that Wankhede’s wife Kranti was playing the ‘Marathi Card’. He reiterated that no accusations were made against Kranti Redkar.“Redkar should not forget that her husband was part of a conspiracy to defame Maharashtra and Mumbai,” Malik said, adding that he feels that a person can be saved because they are Maharashtrian or they belong to a certain caste or religion.The NCB zonal head and the NCP leader were at loggerheads since the arrest of actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan. Malik accused Wankhede of extortion and by publishing his photo on social media Malik alleged that Wankehde falsely claimed that he belonged to the Scheduled Caste community and got his job. Malik says that Wankhede was a Muslim by birth, however, the NCB official has maintained that he is Hindu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/published-photos-of-wankhede-s-first-wife-with-prior-consent-malik-101635529403613.html

29-10-2021||Kolkata||One more held for murder of Kolkata corporate executive, driver; main accused still at large||The Kolkata Police on Friday arrested an e-rickshaw driver in connection with the murders of Subir Chaki, 61, the managing director of Kilburn Engineering, and his driver Rabin Mondal, 65, at the corporate executive’s ancestral house at Kankulia Road in south Kolkata’s Gariahat area on October 17, said officers involved in the investigation. The arrested man was identified as Sanjay Mondal. He was picked up from the Parulia area of South 24 Parganas district in the early hours of Friday. Mondal was allegedly present at the scene of the crime, an officer said on condition of anonymity. With this, the number of arrests in the case has gone up to four. Two other suspects, Jahir Gazi and Bapi Mondal, were picked up from the remote Patharpratima area of South 24 Parganas on October 22 by officers of the detective department. Vicky Haldar, the principal accused is still absconding, officers said. Vicky is the elder son of Mithu Haldar who was the first to be arrested. She was found at her home in South 24 Parganas district’s Diamond Harbour on October 20. Investigators suspect that Vicky was assisted by at least four people. Jahir Gazi and Bapi Mondal were allegedly offered ₹50,000 by Vicky’s mother for taking part in the crime, the police found during the investigation. Vicky continued to dodge the police till Friday evening by changing locations. Chaki and his driver were murdered after the top executive recognized Vicky who came to rob him posing as a buyer for Chaki’s three-storey ancestral house, the investigation has revealed so far. Vicky met Chaki for the first time around 10 months ago posing as a buyer but under a different name, police found after interrogating Vicky’s mother, father Subhas Haldar, younger brother Bilash and maternal uncle Tarun Haldar. The last three were detained for interrogation and were later allowed to go. On the evening of the murders, Chaki recognized Vicky from their earlier meeting. The gang decamped with Chaki’s gold rings and purse, which contained some cash and credit cards. The officers are trying to trace the knives used in the crime and find out what else was taken from the house. Chaki was trying to sell the house for the last six years and many people came to see the property which is valued at around ₹2 crore, given its size and prime location, residents of Kankulia Road told the police. In the past, Chaki sent his driver with the keys when prospective buyers wanted to see the house. The police suspect that Chaki might have been led to believe that he was close to sealing a deal and hence came to the house himself on October 17.“The investigation will be complete only after Vicky’s arrest. Bapi Mondal’s wife told us that after returning home he said it was Vicky who killed Chaki,” said an officer. Mithu Haldar, who worked as a nurse for elderly people in the Kankulia Road area, is in police custody. The police told the court that she and Vicky planned the robbery that led to the murders. Mithu Haldar and her husband Subhas Haldar had an estranged relationship and used to live separately, the probe has revealed. South 24 Parganas district police officers said that in 2021 Subhas Haldar filed a complaint against his wife and Vicky saying they tried to kill him. Mithu Haldar and Vicky were arrested and remanded in judicial custody before being released on bail. Chaki, who lived in New Town on the eastern outskirts of the city with his wife, mother and mother-in-law, also owned property at a posh south Kolkata condominium.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/one-more-held-for-murder-of-kolkata-corporate-executive-driver-main-accused-still-at-large-101635529494950.html

29-10-2021||Mumbai||MMR accounts for half of daily Covid caseload and active cases of state||The Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), comprising nine municipal corporations and nine municipal councils, continue to report a high Covid-19 daily caseload. The region has been reporting almost half the daily cases in the state of late and has 46% of the active cases.Maharashtra on Friday recorded 1,338 cases with 36 deaths taking its tally to 6,609,292 and toll to 140,170. Around 638 or 47.68% of the new cases were from MMR. Of the 18,465 active cases reported in the state, MMR accounted for 8,910 or 46.25%.MMR includes Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai and Raigad districts, with a cumulative projected population of more than 25 million, over 20% of the state population. It is regarded as one most urbanised pockets in Maharashtra.With the comparatively high number of daily caseload, Mumbai outnumbered Pune to lead in the number of Covid-19 active cases. Thane, a part of MMR also featured in the third position contributing to the growing number of cases in the MMR.The reason for the high number of cases in MMR is attributed to the high density of population, huge network of local trains, reopening of various facilities, a large number of workspaces and crowded places making social distancing impossible.State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said, “The MMR has a high density of population, hence we are seeing a high number of cases here. In the second wave, we saw a surge of cases in the rural parts of the state but now they have gone down significantly. In Mumbai and Thane, the numbers have stabilised though they are not coming down as rapidly as in other parts. Though they may seem high the situation is under control,” said Dr Awate.The MMR has for months hovered between 35% and 50% of new cases. Depending on the surge in rural areas, the percentage of the cases to total state figure decreased during the peak of the second wave as districts like Ahmednagar, Pune, Satara and Sangli witnessed a huge surge of cases. However, now with the decline of Covid-19 cases in the rural parts, the MMR has again seen a significant rise in cases.Take the case of a year back on October 29, 2020, when the number of cases in MMR clocked 2,076 of the total 5,902 cases that day which worked out to be 35.17%. In the case of active cases, MMR stood at 45,351 of the total 127,603 which is 35.54%.This dropped to 27.65% as of April 22 this year when the virus was at its peak as the cases in MMR stood at 17,195, of the total 67,013 new cases. The active cases in MMR were 191,926, of the total 6,99,858 active cases, which is 27.42%.On September 29, 2021, there were 1,064 Covid-19 new cases, of the total 3,187 cases, which come to 37.38 % and the active cases stood at 12,602 of the total 36,675 active cases which are 37,36%.Dr Wiqar Shaikh, professor of medicine, Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Hospital described the crowding in urban pockets as dangerous. “We have space in rural pockets to spread out but there is no such luxury in the MMR due to paucity of space,” said Dr Shaikh. “We are also seeing the people in urban pockets letting their guard down which is becoming very risky,” warned Shaikh.Meanwhile, Mumbai reported 330 new cases and six deaths taking a tally to 756,134 and toll to 16,241. There were 1,22,990 tests done on Friday across the state, while the number of recoveries clocked 1,584. The total number of active patients in Maharashtra currently stands at 18,465. Mumbai tops with 4,955 active patients, followed by Pune with 3,759 and Thane with 2,829.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mmr-accounts-for-half-of-daily-covid-caseload-and-active-cases-of-state-101635525533973.html

A CCTV footage that emerged shortly after showed the vehicle swerving to the left and hitting Anand on a road that had sparse traffic, leading to suspicions that it was a murder.The Supreme Court and the Jharkhand high court had taken suo motu cognisance of the case.“The court observed it was clear from the charge sheet that CBI still remains where it started from. There has not been much of difference between the investigation of the state police and CBI. They have filed the charge sheet without any clarity on the motive behind the murder, which will be considered a failure for a professional agency like CBI,” a lawyer who was present at the hearing said, quoting the division bench of chief justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and justice Sujeet Narayan Prasad of the HC. CBI, however, assured the court it was pursuing the investigation and needed some time to come up with concrete evidence to back its case, the lawyer said, adding that the court has fixed the next hearing in the case for November 12. The vehicle that mowed down Anand was found to be stolen from Dhanbad and was recovered from neighbouring Giridih district the same night. Two persons, auto driver Lakhan Verma, 22, and his accomplice Rahul Verma, 21, were arrested two days later.Last week, CBI filed the charge sheet against the two under sections 302 (murder), 201 (destruction of evidence) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code. CBI took over the probe on July 31 after the top court said the incident had larger ramifications for the independence of the judiciary. The state government had also recommended an investigation by the central agency into the case.The HC bench also asked the state government to file an affidavit related to withdrawal of the advertisement to fill vacancies at the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL). The Jharkhand Staff Selection Commission submitted that notification for recruitment in FSL was cancelled as rule regarding recruitment in the FSL has to be changed. “On the next date of hearing, the state government has to reply explaining the facts about change in rule and cancellation of notification,” the lawyer quoted above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dhanbad-judge-death-cbi-has-no-evidence-to-back-its-claims-says-hc-101635525297121.html
29-10-2021||Other||MBBS interns in Bihar call off strike||PATNA Around 900 MBBS medicos across nine government medical colleges of Bihar resumed duty Friday morning following verbal assurance from the state health officials that their demand for hike in monthly stipend would be considered sympathetically. The MBBS interns get a monthly stipend of ₹15,000, which they claim is the lowest in India, and want it raised to ₹35,000. Over the last two days, the medicos had disrupted hospital services, including outdoor patient department (OPD) and laboratory investigations, at most of the nine government medical colleges. The Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH), Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH), both in Patna, and the Darbhanga Medical College Hospital (DMCH) in Darbhanga were among the worst affected as many patients coming from different districts had to return due to lack of treatment. “We have withdrawn our work boycott call following an assurance by Pratyaya Amrit, additional chief secretary, health, that our demands will be looked into sympathetically and expeditiously. We have resumed duty from Friday morning,” said Rohit Kumar, a 2016-batch MBBS student at the PMCH. “If the government still does not listen to our demands and implement them, we will paralyse both emergency and OPD services,” he said. Meanwhile, the Junior Doctors’ Association (JDA), which was tacitly supporting the interns, termed their demand as genuine. “Their (the MBBS interns) demands are genuine and the government should revise the stipend, which is due for revision since April last year,” said Dr Manoranjan Kumar, JDA president, PMCH. “MBBS students have been getting ₹15,000 as monthly stipend during their internship period since 2013 in government medical colleges of Bihar. The health department had in April 2017 issued a letter mentioning that our stipend will be revised every three years, but has not done it so far,” said Rohit. PMCH principal Dr Vidyapati Choudhary said he had to caution the medicos to call off their protest and return to work, failing which he would have initiated action against them. “Our OPD services were partially affected for two days. I then warned the students of repercussions if they continued to disrupt hospital functioning and did not return to work. The medicos have joined their work today,” he said. OPD services at most of the nine state-run medical colleges, including the PMCH, NMCH, DMCH, the Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College in Gaya, Sri Krishna Medical College Hospital in Muzaffarpur, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College Hospital in Bhagalpur, the Government Medical College in Bettiah, the Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur Medical College and Hospital, Madhepura, and the Vardhaman Institute of Medical Sciences, Pawapuri, were affected due to the medicos protest over the last couple of days. MBBS students have to undergo one-year compulsory rotational internship, after clearing four university exams in four-and-a-half-years during the course. They are attached to different departments and are tasked to do initial assessment of patients under guidance of senior doctors during their internship period during which they get a consolidated monthly stipend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mbbs-interns-in-bihar-call-off-strike-101635525295781.html

29-10-2021||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai DCP breaks stereotypes, keeps fit by lifting weights||A DCP with the Navi Mumbai police is using social media to break traditional stereotypes that associate lifting weights in the gym with male exercisers. While DCP Rupali Ambure has only recently started publishing videos of her workouts, she has been sweating it out on the mat for the last seven years.Currently posted as DCP Special Branch, Navi Mumbai, Ambure, a mother of two daughters, first hit the gym in 2014 when she got posted as DCP Central Railway, Mumbai Government Railway Police. “Fitness has always been a passion since childhood. I used to be a runner in school and have also participated in marathons. During our training at the academy, we used to have daily morning and evening physical training sessions and drills. After I became an officer, I found myself missing these sessions and also realised that I wasn’t able to give time to my fitness,” Ambure recalls.During her initial postings in districts like Nashik, Jalgaon and Amravati, Ambure also had two daughters, who are now 14 and 12, with her. By the time she got her first posting in Mumbai, she had resolved to turn back to a fitter lifestyle. She joined a gym in Mumbai and started a combination of weight training, cardio and diet – a regimen that she still follows religiously.“Slowly but very surely, I started noticing a change in myself. The change was not just physical but also in my attitude and mental health. I started feeling youthful and more energetic throughout the day,” Ambure says. Today, she wakes up at 5am and is in the gym by 5.30am, determinedly obeying all her trainer’s orders, faltering sometimes but never giving up. She works out hard till 7.30am, after which she heads home to take the rest of the day by its horns. Videos of her workout, where she is seen lifting heavy weights without breaking a sweat, occupy positions of pride among her Instagram posts, with each video - or Reel, getting anything between 500 and 1,500 views. “It is a myth that lifting weights makes you look masculine and I am aware that a lot of women still have this misconception. There are so many women in my gym who follow the same workout programme that I do. Although I have never thought about it in terms of gender, these are definitely some notions that we need to do away with,” Ambure says.Along with her workout, her diet, too, is an important part of her day. She makes it a point to take home cooked food with just the right balance of proteins, carbohydrates and other nutrients with her to work. Besides, she avoids junk food whenever she needs to go out for meetings. Even if she does indulge herself once in a while, she makes sure she eats small portions. “The trick is portion control. After all, what is the point of lifting all those weights if you can’t have a cheat meal once in a while?” Ambure asks.Like a true-blue gym-rat, Ambure, too, has her favourite day at the gym; leg day. “Squats are truly a full-body exercise and very beneficial. While some hate leg day because of how gruelling it is, I find myself looking forward to it,” she says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-dcp-breaks-stereotypes-keeps-fit-by-lifting-weights-101635524874030.html
29-10-2021||Lucknow||Green crackers permitted in UP for 2 hrs in areas with moderate/better air quality||LUCKNOW Uttar Pradesh will permit use of green crackers during Diwali celebrations for a duration not more than two hours in areas where air quality is moderate or better.This will be as per the orders of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), passed on December 1, 2020 and the Supreme Court order passed on July 23 this year over the sale and use of green crackers during festivity for a stipulated time frame during the Covid pandemic, said Awanish Kumar Awasthi, additional chief secretary, home, in a letter to all divisional commissioners, DMs, IGPs, DIGs, police commissioners and SPs. The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) is monitoring the air quality of 27 cities. From January to September, the air quality of Lucknow, Kanpur, Agra, Sonbhadra, Gajraula, Ghaziabad, Hapur, Varanasi, Noida, Firozabad, Jhansi, Khurja, Prayagraj, Meerut, Moradabad, Bareilly, Rae Bareli, Mathura, Saharanpur, Gorakhpur, Unnao, Greater Noida, Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat, Bulandshahr, Aligarh and Ayodhya was found moderate, he said.The Supreme Court, in its order, has made it clear that if the air quality of an area is moderate or better then local authorities can give permission for the sale and use of the green crackers, he added.District administration officers have also been directed to follow the NGT order in which it has directed that there will be a total ban on sale and use of all kinds of fire crackers in cities and towns, where the ambient air quality falls under the poor and above category.The NGT has ordered for restricted use of fire crackers in cities and towns where air quality is moderate or below to green crackers only for duration of not more than two hours, only for celebration of any specified festivals or permitted occasions. Such festivals will be specified by the states. Other than specified festivals, prior permission of the district magistrate of the area will be required for use of crackers for limited period. Green crackers are produced with less harmful raw materials, in accordance with instructions issued by the top court, and are made in a way that suppresses the dust when they are burnt – thus reducing emissions. They also do not contain harmful chemicals such as lithium, arsenic, barium, and lead and instead release water vapour that does not allow the dust to rise. Although still impactful on the climate to an extent, these green crackers are believed to cause 30% less particulate matter pollution than traditional crackers and are thus considered generally less harmful than their conventional alternatives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/green-crackers-permittedin-up-for-2-hrs-in-areas-with-moderate-better-air-quality-101635524813830.html

He later locked himself in a room. Police broke down the lock and arrested him.The accused, identified as Mohhamad Ansari, 45, of Gabir Nagar, Bhiwandi, had a fight with one of the deceased neighbours a few days ago on petty issues. The wife of the deceased, Imtiaz Khan, had scolded him, saying he was a freeloader and lived off their earnings, that he was jobless and a troublemaker. After this, some of the neighbours teased him a few times over the accusations that enraged him.He did odd jobs earlier. However, since the last few years, he merely indulged in alcohol, allegedly harassed his mother and neighbours, claimed the police.On Friday, after lunchtime, when he was alone, he saw neighbour Kamruja Ansari, 45, standing out and chatting with his son. He came out with a knife and stabbed him on the chest. While other family members and neighbours saw this and came out to stop Ansari, he attacked all six of them. The neighbour who came to the rescue, Imtiaz Khan, 35, was also stabbed and he died before being admitted to a hospital. The other four injured neighbours were admitted to the hospital.Investigation officer of Shanti Nagar police station, police inspector Nilesh Badakh, said, “The accused was held by a neighbour after the incident, but he locked himself inside his house and was not coming out for half-an-hour, after which our officials broke the door and held him.

I am a father and I can understand the trauma the family must be going through. My deepest condolences to the family of Mamita Meher. I was shocked by how certain media have launched a malicious character assassination campaign based on falsehood against me. This has also hurt my family. Therefore, my family has filed a criminal and civil defamation case against three media groups for defaming me and assassinating my character with false, malicious and wild allegations for furthering their narrow personal and political gains,” said Mishra.Gobind Sahu, president of the managing committee of Sunshine English medium school in Mahaling grampanchayat of Kalahandi district allegedly strangled to death 26-year-old Mamita Meher, a teacher in the school, in his car somewhere in Kalahandi district on October 8 after the latter allegedly threatened to expose her extramarital affairs. He then allegedly dismembered the body, burnt it and buried it in an under-construction stadium near the school. He was arrested on October 19 and is now in judicial custody. Since then, the opposition has been stridently demanding his sacking from the Naveen Patnaik ministry alleging his complicity with Sahu.“As an MLA, I have attended functions at many educational institutions. In fact, public representatives are supposed to attend functions in educational institutions. Therefore, a crime happening in any one of the institutions that I have visited as a guest for functions cannot be attributed to me,” he said, alleging that a smear campaign by some media houses and opposition political parties was on.“These media houses, apart from their smear campaign, have also been questioning my silence. I have always believed that in case of sensitive, heinous offences, law enforcement agencies should act in a free and fair manner so that the accused meet the ends of justice. Hence, I always avoided commenting on heinous offences. But I felt the need to give a statement as this smear campaign has been affecting my family,” he said.The minister’s statement came on the day a three-member central BJP team, comprising the party’s Mahila Morcha National President Vanathi Srinivasan, Lok Sabha MP from Haryana Sunita Duggal and West Bengal MLA Sreerupa Mitra Chaudhury, met the family of Mamita Meher at her native village Jharni under Tureikela block of Bolangir district.“The family is in shock. We have doubts about the process of investigation by the police department. How did Gobinda Sahu escape from police custody? The close links of the Minister (Mishra) with the main accused have been established. We demand the resignation of the ninster,” said Vanathi Srinivasan.Duggal said the BJP team would prepare a report in this regard and submit it to BJP president JP Nadda. “Her (Mamita’s) parents want death sentence for those involved in the murder case and we will try our best to ensure justice to the victim’s family,” said Duggal.On Thursday, AICC general secretary Randeep Surjewala demanded the arrest of Mishra alleging his role in the murder conspiracy as well as his sacking from the Naveen Patnaik ministry.“If he (minister Mishra) supervises the investigation then who will punish the culprits? Until the minister has not been removed, the Naveen Patnaik-led government would not be able to punish the criminals. Is it not true that murder-accused Gobinda Sahu had direct links with Mishra. Isn’t it true that Mishra and other ministers of the BJD government were staying at the educational institute? The way the teacher was murdered here in Kalahandi reminds the 2012 brutal rape of Nirbhaya in Delhi. The BJD has made the land of Jagannath a crime-prone one.

29-10-2021||Lucknow||Deepotsav: Five earthen lamps from every Uttar Pradesh village to light up Ayodhya||Five earthen lamps from every village of Uttar Pradesh would help illuminate Ayodhya during the Deepotsav celebrations on the Diwali eve on November 3.As such, the Deepotsav would start on November 1.The respective district magistrates of all the 75 districts of Uttar Pradesh would be entrusted with the task of ensuring that the proposed five earthen lamps from each of the over 90,000 villages of the state reach Ayodhya well in time, said a senior state tourism department official.This year, chief minister Yogi Adityanath has announced that nine lakh (0.9 million) diyas (earthen lamps) would be lit on the occasion in Ayodhya— one diya each for an estimated nine lakh beneficiaries of the PM’s and CM’s Awas Yojanas (housing schemes) in the urban areas of Uttar Pradesh.To ensure that the target of lighting the minimum nine lakh diyas is not missed, officials are planning to light 12 lakh earthen lamps so that a new world record is set during Deepotsav, the last one before the 2022 assembly polls, the official added.Since 2017, the Yogi Adityanath government has been holding the Deepotsav function in Ayodhya, beginning with 51,000 earthen lamps in the inaugural year to 4,10,000 diyas in 2019 and 6,06,569 earthen lamps in 2020 —setting newer Guinness World Records.Deputy director (Tourism), Lucknow, Dinesh Kumar, who has additional charge of Prayagraj, said a decision to have each village of the state contribute five earthen lamps for the Deepotsav celebration has been taken at the state level recently at a meeting held in Lucknow.“District magistrates would be appointed nodal officers for this initiative,” he explained.Another senior official of the state tourism department confirmed the move and said that missives to all DMs would be issued any moment now.Prayagraj district magistrate Sanjay Kumar Khatri said, “It is a welcome step which will allow all villages and districts of the state to be part of the celebrations at Ayodhya.”The district tourism department officials, under the supervision of the district magistrates, would contact the elected gram pradhans and rural potters across the state to ensure that these over 4.5 lakh diyas (five from each of the over 90,000 villages of the state).The villages include around 2800 of Prayagraj district, over 2000 of Pratapgarh district, over 800 of Kaushambi and over 1300 of Fatehpur district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/deepotsav-five-earthen-lamps-from-every-uttar-pradesh-village-to-light-up-ayodhya-101635523733746.html
29-10-2021||Lucknow||Those joining Samajwadi Party from Congress are brave: Akhilesh Yadav||Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav on Friday described as “brave” the leaders who are joining the SP after quitting the Congress.He also said “we will make a better temple” when he was asked about BJP’s attack on him for not making any contribution to the Ram temple in Ayodhya. The SP chief did not specify where and what kind of temple would he get built.He also claimed that farmers have decided to vote the BJP out of power and said that the ruling party was beset by internal differences due to which the “double engine government” at the Centre and in the state were at loggerheads.The BJP would not win the 2022 UP assembly polls even if it denied tickets to all its sitting MLAs, he predicted at a press conference.He made the remark about “brave leaders” as Harendra Malik and Pankaj Malik, a politically influential Jat father-son duo from western Uttar Pradesh, joined the Samajwadi Party after resigning from the Congress. Soon after their resignation from the party last fortnight, the Congress national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had called the Congress leaders going to other parties “kaayar (cowards)”.Harendra Malik is a former Congress Rajya Sabha member and four-time ex-MLA. His son Pankaj Malik was the Congress MLA from Baghra assembly constituency in Muzaffarnagar. He later represented the Shamli assembly constituency.Harendra Malik said: “If there is any party that can remove the BJP from power, it’s the SP.”Pankaj Malik said: “We have to make the SP win and make Akhilesh Yadav the chief minister again.”Addressing a press conference at the SP state headquarters, Akhilesh also said, “If any community is the most distressed, it’s the farmers. And I am happy that farmers have decided to weed the BJP out.”He accused the BJP government of being responsible for all the deaths due to Covid in the state.When asked if the Samajwadi Party would reserve tickets for women in the same manner in which the Congress has promised Akhilesh said: “We will give tickets to winnable women candidates”.On October 19, the Congress had announced that it will reserve 40% tickets for the 2022 UP assembly polls for women contestants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/those-joining-samajwadi-party-from-congress-are-brave-akhilesh-yadav-101635523373745.html

The male child was born to Sushma Akash Prakshale on October 13. The baby was diagnosed to have the tumour much later during pregnancy and was delivered through normal delivery under the care of Dr Shilpa Naik, obstetrician at Sassoon Hospital. The paediatric surgeons at the hospital operated on the baby on October 16 as an emergency surgery since the baby had gross abdominal distension, hypertension and respiratory distress. “We have successfully removed a complete tumour in relation to the left kidney. lt was mainly cystic with solid areas within. The weight of the excised tumour was about 550 gms while the baby’s weight at the time was about 3.5kg. Baby was extubated after surgery and has been vitally stable.” said Dr Naik.The surgery was done by a team led by the head of the department, Dr Minakshi Nalbale-Bhosale, along with Dr Rupesh Sikchi and Dr Naina Ramchandani. Anaesthesiologists were Dr Surekha Shinde and Dr Sunita Khedkar. Dr Naik further added, “The tumour was very large. Though his vital parameters have been stable in the post-operative period, he required phototherapy in view of neonatal jaundice. Now, the baby has recovered very well, his blood pressure has stabilised, the wound has healed well and the baby is about to be discharged. Dr Vinavak Kale, dean, Sassoon hospital said, “The parents were immensely grateful to doctors of Sassoon for rendering a second life to their precious son, since the mother has been divorced once for losing three babies in early neonatal period to various causes. We can now provide surgical services to these delicate babies. We are proud of our team.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sassoon-hospital-doctors-in-pune-extract-huge-tumour-from-3-day-old-baby-101635522593695.html

29-10-2021||Mumbai||PWD plans to develop FOB at Turbhe on Sion-Panvel Highway||From next year, the residents of Turbhe will not have to cross the busy Sion-Panvel highway risking their lives as the state Public Works Department (PWD) has planned to develop a foot over bridge (FOB) in the area.Over the past three months, the PWD conducted multiple surveys in that area and also prepared a detailed project report (DPR) of the proposed FOB. A senior officer from PWD said, “The local residents of Turbhe have long been demanding a FOB to cross the highway there. Due to the lack of such an infrastructure, now they have to cross the busy highway risking their lives. Quite a few people met with accidents while crossing the road like that in the past. Therefore, taking the gravity of the issue into consideration, we are planning to develop a FOB across the highway.”“We sent the DPR for reviewing by our higher authorities a few days ago and will start working at the site as soon as we receive their approval. The site we have selected for the FOB is very close to the area where the Maharashtra Rail Infrastructure Development Corporation (MRIDC) is widening a flyover on the highway. We will need a budget of around ₹1Cr for this project,” the officer further said.According to traffic officials, around two lakh vehicles ply on Sion-Panvel highway daily. The 25 km long highway connects Greater Mumbai with the Mumbai-Pune Expressway and Mumbai-Goa Highway via Navi Mumbai.Suresh Waghmare, 43, a resident of Turbhe said, “The residents of this area are being forced to cross the highway for the past several years. Initially, the number of vehicles plying on the road was not so high and hence it was not so risky to cross it. The number of vehicles has increased manifold in the past decade and now it is next to impossible to cross the highway specifically during peak hours. We are glad that PWD is now thinking of developing a FOB in this area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pwd-plans-to-develop-fob-at-turbhe-on-sion-panvel-highway-101635522058949.html

The various relaxations offered by the DDMA would come into effect from November 1.Cinema halls, theatres and multiplexes in the city would be allowed to operate at full seating capacity from Monday. They were closed in April during the second wave of the infections and were offered partial respite in July, when the government allowed them to operate at 50% seating capacity.The DDMA also noted it would be the responsibility of the owners of the cinema halls, theatres and multiplexes for the “strict adherence” to the standard operating protocol (SOP), following the official guidelines regarding Covid-19 and Covid-appropriate behaviour at the locations.Also read | DDMA allows Chhath Puja at designated sites; bars celebrations at Yamuna“In case any violation is found, strict penal, criminal action shall be taken against the owner of the restaurant, bar, cinemas, theatres and multiplexes,” news agency PTI reported quoting an excerpt from the DDMA order.Further, the maximum attendance at events like marriages and last rites has been increased in the city to 200 from the 100 people allowed previously.

This historic achievement is dedicated to the guidance of respected Prime Minister, commitment of corona warriors and disciplined public cooperation,” the CM said in a tweet in Hindi. “When it’s your turn, you must also get the vaccine ‘Teeka Jeet ka’,” he added. According to data from the health department, 13,00,30,683 doses had been administered by 7pm, including 9,78,40,183 first doses and 3,21,90,500 second doses. “UP is the only state in the country to achieve this figure in Covid vaccination. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has issued directions to speed up vaccination and ordered officers to deliver vaccine doses to 100% eligible population of the state by December 15,” said a state government spokesperson in a press statement. About 66.14 % of the state’s total eligible adult population had received at least one dose, while around 21.51% was fully immunised, according to the data. UP accounts for the maximum fully vaccinated population (3.21crore), followed by Maharashtra (3.05 crore), said the spokesperson. “The CM has asked health officials to come up with a special drive to motivate people towards vaccination,” he added. UP will adopt the Cluster Model 2.0 from November 1 to improve the second dose coverage in the state. Earlier this week, additional chief secretary, health, Amit Mohan Prasad, had told health officials, “Giving priority to full vaccination, the work of administering the second dose using the cluster model 2.0 should be done in those villages/localities where the first dose was successfully administered through the cluster model.” UP’s active caseload had fallen below 100 and the recovery rate was 98.8%. No active case surfaced in 40 districts of the state. Uttar Pradesh saw eight fresh Covid cases while 12 people were discharged after treatment in the last 24 hours, said Amit Mohan Prasad, additional chief secretary, medical health.

Every college should help the civic body in getting it done,” said Sunil Pawar, additional commissioner, KDMC.There are around 29,000 college-going students in the KDMC limits.

A nodal officer will be appointed to get this done,” added Pawar.The colleges that help in doing 100% registration of youth in the voters’ list will be honoured with certificates.The voters’ list updating programme would not only help register new voters but also help the existing voters to change their names, addresses in the list.Meanwhile, the civic body would also carry out several awareness programmes through banners, hoardings, posters and jingles.The voters’ list would be published on the https://ceo.maharashtra.gov.in website from November 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kalyan-dombivli-municipal-corporation-to-approach-colleges-to-update-voters-list-for-next-civic-elections-101635520553672.html
29-10-2021||Mumbai||Thane Municipal Corporation’s special vaccination drive in Mumbra gets poor response||Despite merely 28% population in Mumbra ward being vaccinated so far, the special vaccination drive set up in this suburb by the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has received lukewarm response on Thursday and Friday.Only 3,000 people, as opposed to the 6,000 targeted, have got jabbed. Apart from Mumbra, the vaccination is also slow-paced in Uthalsar with 52% population vaccinated with at least the first dose while around 20%-30% got jabbed in Lokmanya Sawarkar Nagar.TMC claimed that the reluctance among people to get the first dose of vaccination was the main hurdle.TMC has, till now, given 16 lakh doses of vaccine whereas it has a target population of 18 lakh to be double vaccinated. Out of this, around 91% of the population in Kalwa ward, 80% of the population in Wagle Estate, 52% in Uthalsar and more than 100% in Majiwada-Manpada and Vartak Nagar wards are vaccinated with at least the first dose.These are data provided by TMC of those who have availed the vaccination facility within their jurisdiction and includes both private and government vaccination figures.“There are some who do not want to get vaccinated while there are some others who are not sure of the benefits of the vaccine. However, since the last one month, most are delaying the vaccination process by citing the current festive season. As vaccinations often have side effects, many are not keen on falling ill during the festivities. This is the reason we have adopted various modes to understand how many actually have been vaccinated within Thane city,” said a senior officer from TMC.TMC claimed that those not vaccinated in its jurisdiction must be vaccinated elsewhere and thus the data cannot be relied. “As we have access to those availing the vaccination facility within the TMC jurisdiction only, we have a team that calls those who have only taken the first dose of the vaccine and are due to take the second. Almost 80% of the calls we have made so far have been fully vaccinated elsewhere – in a different city or through workplace vaccinations,” said Dr Prasad Patil, vaccination officer, TMC.TMC has assigned ward-wise individuals for both surveys and to make calls to keep track of the number of vaccinations. “As we cannot keep track of the vaccinations occurring beyond our jurisdiction or visit the lakhs of population by door-to-door, it is getting difficult to reach 100% vaccination mark. However, through mass drives in wards that have had a lukewarm response and through our various campaigns, we are trying to make vaccination accessible and increase awareness by reaching out to religious leaders in these areas,” added Patil.In all TMC vaccination centres, preference is given to those who are residents of Thane city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-municipal-corporation-s-special-vaccination-drive-in-mumbra-gets-poor-response-101635520315610.html

There were five X-Ray machines at the security checks and one more has been increased and the area has been also widened at the security check so people consume less time for security checking,” added Dhoke.“Flights at the airport will increase in coming days as the IAF has permitted to increase the slots,” added Dhoke.Before shutting down for repair works –the daily footfall at the airport was touching 13,000 to 14,000 per day with flight movement of 60 flights per day.After the year 2008, it was the second time the airport was closed for 14 days for runway repair works.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-airport-set-to-resume-flight-operations-from-october-30-101635519234281.html

The term “future floods” figures significantly in the letter. Civic activists have moved the the irrigation department raising various issues with the planned river developement. In the letter, dated October 28, the irrigation department say: “In the name of riverfront development, don’t dump materials into the river. While executing project, ensure that there would be no hurdless for water flow. Don’t divert the flow of the river.”Civic activists Sarang Yadwadkar, Vivek Velankar, and Vijay Kumbhar, among others have objected to the river plan.Yadwadkar said, “PMC general body approved this Rs4,727 crore project, but elected members have discussed it at the general body meeting. The project is going to impact the whole city.”Velankar said, “Pune is already a flood-affected city. While executing such projects, civic administration and elected members should address the citizens’ objections. We are asking various questions, but administration claims that the consultant will answer the doubts. Consultant will fly away after getting the fees, but citizens will suffer. If the project is owned by PMC, administration must answer all the questions raised by activist and citizens.”Yadwadkar said that the National Green Tribunal has already been moved on objections to this project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/irrigation-dept-fires-first-salvo-on-pmc-s-riverfront-development-project-101635516953358.html
29-10-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: Diversity, Empathy and Inclusivity||“A girl’s night in: as the conversation unfolds, my thoughts were about how diverse each one of us is. How unique our interests are. Imagine giving us a standardised test!” wrote educationist and founder of a prestigious chain of schools and self-proclaimed happiness and peace advocate Lina Asher, this week in the gratitude journal that she shares on social media. Asher was referring to a group of women whose talent pool included activities as diverse as social work, hiking, pole dancing, new age healing and cross-cultural rapping! “Every child on Earth is talented. Just not in the same way. Education does not honour that uniqueness as it puts us all in the same standardised box of learning and assessing who we are and what our talents and gifts are.” The championing of individuality and diversity appears to be at the crux of Asher’s career as an educationist, which had begun with a single 25-kids preschool in Bandra, and had blossomed to more than 70 across the country and a string of high schools in India and abroad. This individual holistic approach is perhaps also what prompted her to recently sell off her brick-and-mortar empire to embark on what appears to be a long-cherished dream: ‘establishing a happier, healthier and more sustainable online school, which works on the principles of high interest and engagement, interaction and a focus on individual gifts and talents each child has’. “It will solve a lot of what ails education. We will have highly paid teachers, learning that is designed for the technology era and it will be as low cost as possible as we will not have infrastructure and textbook costs. It is also kinder to the planet as it is less resource intensive,” she said about her newest initiative. As for her gratitude journal, which began at the start of the pandemic in response to a particular challenging phase exacerbated by family medical issues, she said her life-long research in education and neuro and behavioural sciences has taught her that gratitude and appreciation, practiced consciously and mindfully, helps people in coping with stressful, negative, and frustrating situations. “Grateful people are able to regulate their negative emotions. Gratitude helps us to think in more innovative and creative ways, which helps us build resources we can draw upon when things get difficult,” She said. Agreed. **************************************************************************************************************‘In some people’s life, a little rain must fall, in others, it seems to be raining all the time.’ This week, friends and fans of the Jafferbhai Mansuri family were particularly devastated to learn of the passing of Nida Mansuri, the youngest daughter of the legendary late Jafferbhai aka ‘The Biryani King of Mumbai.’ Occurring only 16 days after the family lost Lubna – their eldest daughter – this seems to be the cruellest blow. Nida, described as “a sweet God-fearing, affectionate kindergarten teacher” by those who knew her, succumbed to a sudden illness, a few days after complaining of stomach cramps at a south Mumbai hospital. “It’s been one blow after another,” said a stricken Farzana Contractor, publisher editor of Upper Crust and a close friend of the family. “How much can one family take? What is happening?” As is known, Jafferbhai, who had been a cherished institution in Mumbai for his Delhi Darbar restaurant and later with his Jaffer Bhai’s Delhi Darbar chain of eateries, passed away last September owing to a cardiac arrest, while being treated for Covid-19. “He was such a refined, soft spoken man, a dear friend of Behram’s,” said Contractor, referring to her husband, the late Behram (Busybee) Contactor, Mumbai’s much loved columnist and food writer, who’d been a champion of the signature chicken and mutton biryani, chicken tangdi, raan sikandari and daal ghosht, which emanated from the Jafferbhai kitchens. “And despite all his success and fame, he’d remained humble and grounded till the end. In fact, it had been Behram who’d first named him ‘The Biryani King of Mumbai’.” Contractor herself is no stranger to the multiple, cruel blows of fate: Twenty years ago, she had lost her beloved brother in a freak road accident on the same day that Behram had died. “I found myself thinking of that day when I heard about the passing of Nida,” she said, when we spoke, adding, “And wondering how on earth I had coped…” Speaking to Contractor brought to mind one among the many memorable and poignant sentences that Behram himself had penned on the subject of multiple blows, during his illustrious career as Busybee. “In some people’s life, a little rain must fall, in others-it seems to be raining all the time,” the late great Busybee had written – as always, incisive and heartbreakingly true… *****************************************************************************************************Say what you may, but IMHO the 2.18-minute clip ‘Not Just A Cadbury Ad’ is the nicest sparkler to emerge in this season of lights. For those who’ve been in Mars, I’m referring to the latest advertisement from the multinational confectionary brand that has, through the help of machine learning technology, turned Shah Rukh Khan, the country’s biggest brand ambassador, into the brand ambassador for hundreds of local businesses across India, in a bid to brighten up their sales after the long, lean months of the pandemic. Clad in an exquisite cream silk sherwani and looking every inch the Badshah he is, SRK can be made to mouth the name of a hundred different small brands and establishments that would have never been able to afford his services until now. “Big businesses and brands that suffered during the pandemic found their way back but the smaller stores still suffer. It is impossible to cover all the stores, so we gave people the power to create their own version of not just a Cadbury ad,” the clip says, going on to explain how it can be customised by any brand to market its own products. Hearteningly, the response to this generous spirited initiative has been unanimously positive, with many appreciating the spirit of inclusivity and benevolence it fosters. Many of the responses are particularly appreciative of the fact that the chocolate producer has not allowed SRK’s recent travails to affect his engagement with them. As one appreciative fan posted: “Let’s hope SRK’s Diwali is meetha too.” Happy Diwali gentle readers, may yours be as sweet as it is bright.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-diversity-empathy-and-inclusivity-101635516778698.html

We also needed vehicles that can help reach greater height as the current vehicles help reach only 13m. Our personnel face difficulties in removing branches that are higher.”Hence, the four new LPVs of 2,820mm wheelbase with smaller chassis have been acquired by the civic body for the garden department. It will ensure that the vehicles can be used for trimming branches along narrow roads as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-civic-body-acquires-new-ladder-platform-vehicles-to-trim-branches-up-to-23m-high-101635516777401.html
29-10-2021||Pune||Murder trial: Dabholkar’s neighbour takes stand as first witness||PUNE: The trial in the 2013 murder of Dr Narendra Dabholkar began in earnest as the first witness in the case was cross examined on Friday. An eerie silence befell the courtroom as an old identification card – a press accreditation card by Maharashtra government – and a diary of the slain rationalist was produced in court as part of evidence in his murder case on Friday.Avinash Davalbhakt (54), a panch, and the first witness to be examined was the former neighbour of Dabholkar in Pune and lived next door to where Dabholkar used to live twice aweek. A salesman at an ayurvedic company, Davalbhakt was one of the two panch witnesses in the original FIR registered by the Pune police in 2013.Davalbhakt lived in the adjacent flat in a building named Amey Apartment in 212, Shaniwar peth, where known politicians also reside. The flat was used by the late RG Jadhav, a writer who worked with Dabholkar’s Sadhana Trust. The flat was registered as owned by Sadhana Trust and Dabholkar lived there for twice a week.Additional Sessions Judge SR Navandar (special judge for UAPA cases) is hearing the case with five accused – Virendra Sinh Tawde, Sachin Andure, Sharad Kalaskar, Sanjeev Punalekar and Vikram Bhave – and special public prosecutor Prakash Suryavanshi, along with three defense lawyers including Advocate Virendra Ichalkaranjikar, Prakash Shalsingikar, and Suvarna Vast.The special trial court has directed the prosecution to provide a copy of the CD containing video of the post-mortem procedure to the defense lawyers. The court also directed the SPP to provide copies of the x-ray plates in the case.“The Mumbai Forensic science laboratory (FSL) does not have the technical know-how to make the copy of the CD. So it will be sent to the Central FSL in Delhi. The x-ray plates will be provided by Mumbai FSL on A4 size photopaper,” said SPP Suryavanshi.In their cross-examination, Advocate Shalsingikar tried to discredit the panch witness by saying that he was a follower of a certain spiritual guru and his beliefs were not in line with what Dr Dabholkar preached.Dr Narendra Dabholkar, an anti-superstition rationalist, was on a walk on the morning of August 20, 2013, near Omkareshwar bridge in Pune when two bike-borne men shot him. The investigation has since been take up by the Central bureau of investigation (CBI). In an initial chargesheet filed by CBI, Sarang Akolkar and Vinay Pawar were identified as shooters. In the second chargesheet filed by the CBI, Andure and Kalaskar were identified as shooters.In both the chargesheets, Tawade was found to be the main conspirator. Bhave was accused of helping the two shooters with the reccee, vehicle, and escape route. Punalekar was found to have advised one of the shooters to dispose of the weapon, after which Kalaskar allegedly threw parts of the weapons in the Thane creek. This information was provided by Kalaskar to the Karnataka police special investigation team (SIT) investigating the 2017 Gauri Lankesh murder in Bengaluru, Karnataka. While Punalekar is facing sole charge of destruction of evidence, all others are facing charges for terrorism, murder, and criminal conspiracy as per the charges framed against them. All have pleaded not guilty.Kalaskar and Andure have also been named in the 2017 murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh. Kalaskar was also found to have been involved in the August 2018 Nalasopara arms haul by Maharashtra Anti-terrorism squad. Bhave has been convicted in a bomb blast case for possession of explosives. The CBI has also alleged a larger conspiracy by the Sanatan Sanstha, to which all the present accused and their lawyer belong, to kill Dabholkar, Lankesh, and scholar MM Kalburgi in Dharwad, Karnataka in August 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/murder-trial-dabholkar-s-neighbour-takes-stand-as-first-witness-101635516233871.html

But when the autopsy report confirmed that the death was due to strangulation, we started our investigations and suspected that Landway had killed her,” police inspector Bhaguji Auti from Rabale police station said.The deceased’s husband had taken a loan of ₹6.5 lakh from the accused. The accused had taken a personal loan from his bank on his name. The deceased and her husband had not been giving the money for the monthly EMI due to which Landway was under pressure from his workplace.During the investigations, police had found that the accused allegedly had an illicit relationship with the deceased and used to visit her daily when her kids went to classes and husband to work. On the day of the incident, others in the building had seen him coming to the society. The deceased referred to him as her cousin.“On the day of the incident, the accused demanded money and fought with her. The accused then made her write a suicide note and strangulated her. He tried to hang her but could not do so and left her lying on the floor. The door of the house was slightly open. Their two-year-old neighbour entered the house and behind him entered his grandmother and saw the deceased lying on the floor and then alerted her family,” Auti said.The accused was presented before the court on Friday and has been remanded to police custody till Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rabale-police-investigations-reveal-woman-strangulated-by-relative-101635516173122.html

The baby was born at a private hospital after 26 weeks of pregnancy by an emergency Caesarean section due to pregnancy-related hypertension in the mother. Weighing only 480 grammes, the baby was immediately put on to life support with a tiny endotracheal tube in the windpipe.The child was also wrapped in a plastic bag to prevent heat loss after birth. “In such babies, management within the first golden hour after birth is very important. Babies of this size need mechanical ventilator support immediately after birth due to immature lungs. Extreme preterm babies are also at risk of dangerous hypothermia due to immature skin and they need special incubator to prevent heat loss. Special catheters were inserted through babies umbilical cord for delivering nutrition and monitoring vital parameters”, said Dr Shrinivas Tambe, chief neonatologist, Jupiter Hospital, who treated the child. “The baby required mechanical ventilation for seven days and then breathing support was provided by CPAP machine for next 70 days. The baby had a condition called Patent Ductus Arteriosuswhich was picked up by a heart scan and successfully treated with medication. Milk feeds were started with 0.5ml every two hours and gradually increased to a full amount by the eighth day. The baby also had an episode of infection which was immediately diagnosed and treated by antibiotics,” added Dr Tambe.According to Dr Tambe, extreme preterm babies are at high-risk to develop infection, bleeding in the brain, ROP (abnormal development of blood vessels in the retina), Necrotising Enterocolitis (intestinal disorder), PDA (heart problem), and chronic lung disease. The child was discharged after 100 days in the neonatal ICU and weighed 2kg at the time of discharge, said the doctors. Currently the child is at home, gaining weight and showing signs of normal development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/alive-and-beating-the-odds-premature-child-weighing-480-gm-born-in-pune-101635515813130.html
29-10-2021||Ranchi||‘Probe still where it started’: Jharkhand HC upset at CBI in judge’s death case||RANCHI: The Jharkhand High Court on Friday observed that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has not conducted the investigation professionally and has levelled charges without any evidence to back it up in the charge sheet filed in connection with the alleged murder of Dhanbad additional district judge Uttam Anand.“The court observed that from the charge sheet, it was clear that CBI still remains where it started from. There has not been much of a difference between the investigation of the state police and CBI. They have filed the charge sheet without any clarity on the motive behind the murder, which will be considered a failure for a professional agency like CBI,” a lawyer who was present at Friday’s hearing, said. CBI, however, assured the court they are pursuing the investigation and they need some time to come up with concrete evidence to back their case. The court has fixed November 12 as the next date of hearing in the case.This is not the first time that the high court has conveyed its displeasure. Last week, the bench reprimanded CBI over its probe, pointing that the agency “did not inform the high court before filing the charge sheet despite the bench comprising the chief justice monitoring the process”. The bench also frowned at the status reports filed by CBI, saying the agency was filing a stereotyped report every week.Judge Uttam Anand was run over by an autorickshaw on July 28, an incident that sparked off security concerns in the entire judiciary. The vehicle, which was stolen from Dhanbad, was recovered from the neighbouring Giridih district that night. Two persons — auto driver Lakhan Verma, 22, and his accomplice Rahul Verma, 21 — were arrested two days later.Last week, the central agency filed the charge sheet against the duo under sections 302 (murder), 201 (destruction of evidence) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. During the hearing on Friday last, CBI said they filed the charge sheet after consultation with officials in the headquarters, and efforts are underway to establish the motive and the conspiracy behind the alleged killing.The Supreme Court and the Jharkhand high court took suo motu cognisance of the hit-and-run incident after CCTV footage showed the three-wheeler swerving on an empty road to knock him down.The CBI took over the probe on July 31 after the top court said the incident had larger ramifications for the independence of the judiciary. The state government had also recommended an investigation by the central agency into the case.In September, the central agency informed the high court that the judge’s death was not an accident and it was investigating all angles to unravel the conspiracy.Several people have been interrogated in the last three months and lie detector and psychoanalysis tests were also conducted on them, officials said.On the recruitment front, the Jharkhand Staff Selection Commission submitted during the hearing on Friday that notification for recruitment in FSL has been cancelled as the rule regarding recruitment in the FSL has to be changed. “On the next date of hearing, the state government has to reply explaining the facts about change in rule and cancellation of notification,” the lawyer quoted above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/probe-still-where-it-started-jharkhand-hc-upset-at-cbi-in-judge-s-death-case-101635515753721.html

He revealed in a notarised affidavit that he overheard Gosavi talking to another person about a ₹18-crore deal, of which, ₹8 crore was alleged to be paid to NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede. Sail had alleged that ₹38 lakh was collected as the initial payment and it was handed over to Sam D’Souza in a white Innova car near a 7-star hotel.Bafna, who has known Sail since 2019 for business ventures, told the police that he was surprised that his picture and phone number was given as that of Sam D’souza by Sail.

29-10-2021||Pune||Army chief appeals to NDA to accept women cadets with sense of fair play, professionalism||PUNE Indian Army chief General MM Naravane on Friday said it is expected that the women cadets are welcomed with the same sense of fair play and professionalism, and further stressed that their induction will be the “first step towards gender equality” in the armed forces.The army chief made the remarks after reviewing the passing out parade of the 141st course of the National Defence Academy (NDA).General Naravane said that the women officers will be in the same position forty years later in their life at the current position he stands before the audience. “As we open the portals of the NDA for women cadets, we expect you to welcome them with the same sense of fair play and professionalism as Indian Armed forces are known globally,” he stated.Earlier in September, the Ministry of Defence had informed the Supreme Court that a notification allowing women candidates to appear for the entrance exam to the NDA will be out by May next year. But observing that induction of women to the NDA cannot be postponed by one year, the apex court had allowed female candidates to take the exam in November this year and not wait till May 2022 as requested by the government.General Naravane during a media interaction said, “As women cadets are being inducted into NDA, he is confident that they will perform better than their male counterparts.”“Over the years, as we have grown and matured, as the curriculum has changed, training methodology has changed, the course content has improved. We have become more well-trained and better-equipped to meet whatever challenges that emerge. As we go ahead, we will be inducting women cadets in the academy, I am sure they will perform better than their male counterparts,” he reiterated.Referring to their induction into the Army as the first step towards gender equality, the army chief said the army has always been at the forefront of all initiatives that have been taken in the country. “As a result of this, they will also get empowered. They will hold more challenging assignments. It’s not that we don’t have women officers. We already have women officers undergoing training at OTA (Officers Training Academy) in Chennai. They are exceedingly doing well and I am sure that the Academy will continue to prosper and flourish and bring fame and glory,” he said.During his direct address to the cadets, the army chief said, “Little over 42 years back when I stood at the same drill square today as you stand today, little could I have imagined that one day I would be reviewing this magnificent parade.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/army-chief-appeals-to-nda-to-accept-women-cadets-with-sense-of-fair-play-professionalism-101635513833222.html
29-10-2021||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh bypolls: 1 Lok Sabha, 3 Assembly seats up for grabs in bipolar contest||Voting on three assembly seats and a Lok Sabha seat in Madhya Pradesh by-polls will take place on October 30 and results will be declared on November 2.From holding 2-3 public rallies to spending the night in the house of tribal and Dalit, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is leaving no stone unturned to woo voters.Amid speculations of change in the leadership like other BJP ruled states, CM Chouhan has made several announcements to address the local issues. By suspending officers from the stage for the delay in providing beneficial schemes, he is projecting an image of a hard taskmaster.BJP is considering this election important as it is the first election after the second wave of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) when a large number of people died allegedly due to shortages of oxygen and hospital beds.Meanwhile, MP Congress is fighting this election with issues including deaths during Covid 19 second wave, poor roads, power cuts, atrocities with tribal and scheduled caste people and unemployment.Also Read | Rajasthan bypolls: Close fight and triangular contest in Vallabhnagar, DhariawadMP Congress Committee state president Kamal Nath said, “BJP-led state government failed to provide basic infrastructure and now the CM is staging the drama of being tough to put the blame of their failed policies on voters. This election will clear that voters are wise enough and are not going to rely on drama.”BJP state president VD Sharma said, “Congress is losing its existence and leaders are leaving the party. Even, voters are not coming to attend the public rally of Congress leaders. Congress candidates are losing this election due to internal dispute.”KhandwaKhandwa Lok Sabha seat fell vacant after the death of BJP senior leader and six times Member of Parliament Nand Kumar Singh Chauhan. Chauhan contested seven elections and lost only once in 2009 against Congress leader Arun Yadav.In this election, Chauhan’s son Harshwardhan was the probable candidate of BJP but the party gave a ticket to Gyaneshwar Patil, an OBC leader. From Congress, Arun Yadav has shown a willingness to contest election from Khandwa seat but two days before the declaration of the name of the candidate, he posted on social media that he doesn’t want to contest this election. Congress gave a ticket to Rajnarayan Singh, a close aide of Rajya Sabha MP Digvijaya Singh.During the election campaign, Congress MLA Sachin Birla switched his side and joined BJP as he claimed that he was feeling suffocated there. Birla’s left the party in a lurch.JobatThe Jobat seat in the Alirajpur district fell vacant after the death of Congress MLA Kalawati Bhuria. A reserved seat for tribal candidates is being considered significant in order to know the mood of tribal voters. BJP has given a chance to turncoat Sulochana Rawat, a former two time Congress MLA, after she joined BJP last month against the Congress candidate Mahesh Patel.RaigaonThe Raigaon seat in Satna district became vacant following the death of five times BJP MLA Jugal Kishor Bagri. This is a scheduled caste reserved seat. Here too, BJP denied a ticket to Jugal Kishore Bagri’s son and gave a ticket to a woman candidate Pratima Bagri. Congress gave a ticket to Congress leader Kalpana Verma. In Raigaon, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has a good base. In 2013, BSP candidate Usha Chaudhary defeated Bagri in a close fight. BSP is not contesting the by-poll and its local leaders are extending support to the Congress candidate.PrithvipurPrithvipur in Niwari district fell vacant following the death of Congress legislator and former minister Brijendra Singh Rathore. Congress gave ticket to Rathore’s son Nitendra Rathore while BJP gave ticket to a defector Shishupal Yadav, a former leader of the Samajwadi Party.In the 2018 election, Yadav received 30% votes while Rathore received 35% votes. After losing the election, Yadav had joined BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/madhya-pradesh-bypolls-1-lok-sabha-3-assembly-seats-up-for-grabs-in-bipolar-contest-101635512230757.html
29-10-2021||Mumbai||Remove Covid related pay cuts: Air India pilots to aviation minister||Air India Boeing and Airbus pilots’ unions (Indian Pilots’ Guild and Indian Commercial Pilots’ Association) have collectively written to the aviation minister- Jyotiraditya Scindia asking him to remove the Covid-19 pay cut that is still being levied on them. The two airline pilots’ unions, earlier had written individually but did not receive any response from their respective managements. With this joint letter to the minister, sources said that the pilots want the ministry to restore their salaries to pre-privatisation days.The aviation industry in India seems to be back on track with domestic air traffic increasing from 25% in April 2020 to 100% as of October 202. With the opening up of international borders for India, there seems to be an increase in international travel too.‘This ground reality has duly been acknowledged by other airlines, who have rightfully rolled back the Covid austerity pay cuts significantly for their pilots. In stark contrast, our management is still content hiding behind the pandemic. The massive pay cut of up to 60% for Air India pilots has dramatically diminished our livelihoods. Looking at the current aviation industry standards, the continuation of the pay cut does not merit any justification,’ read the letter dated October 28.The airline pilots said that they have been patient and have shown restraint to ensure smooth flight operations. They also reiterated that they have gone beyond the call of duty during the pandemic, risking life and limb to ensure the success of the government’s Vande Bharat Mission (VBM).“We request that you respect our sacrifices and years of faithful service to the National Carrier before handing us over. We would like to think that if not a graceful send-off, we have at least earned the right to a better legacy than our management stealing our hard-earned money with impunity,” the letter read.Before this, the pilots Boeing union- Indian Pilots’ Guild (IPG) had on October 1 and 7 had written letters to the airline management, but did not get a response.Hence, demanding rolling back of the pay cut the pilots said, “We have given the management every benefit of the doubt and ample time to redress the disproportionate pay cut for the pilots. They refuse to part from a practised indifference and have only weak excuses to offer. Every day this draconian pay cut continues is a humiliation to our efforts towards the ongoing VBM and the dignity of our profession.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/remove-covid-related-pay-cuts-air-india-pilots-to-aviation-minister-101635512933158.html
29-10-2021||Delhi||DDMA allows Chhath Puja at designated sites; bars celebrations at Yamuna||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority on Friday barred Chhath Puja celebrations on the banks of the Yamuna river and allowed celebrations at designated sites only.“The celebration of Chhath Pooja during the month of November shall be allowed only at designated sites outside containment zones with requisite permission from the district magistrate. No site shall be designated on the bank of river Yamuna,” the order shared by the DDMA said.The DDMA earlier on Tuesday allowed Chhath Puja celebrations in the Capital. During Chhath, devotees offer 'Arghya' by fasting to the Sun-god in knee-deep water. The festival is celebrated all over India mainly by people belonging to Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.It also said that designated sites shall be identified and managed by the respective district magistrate in coordination with departments and agencies concernedThe approval from the DDMA comes after a meeting among its top officials on Friday. The DDMA, which devises Covid management policies for the Capital, earlier banned Chhath Puja celebrations.The Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) protested against the DDMA decision. BJP MP from northeast Delhi Manoj Tiwari also took out a Rath Yatra against the ban which was imposed earlier and claimed that the announcement was made following the protests taken out by the BJP. Tiwari also thanked BJP workers and Chhath Puja Samitis for their agitation.“The sustained protests by the party for allowing Chhatt festivities in the capital has finally fructified. It is a clear defeat of CM Arvind Kejriwal's anti-Hindu policies,” Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta also said.Tiwari also accused Kejriwal of playing politics with religious sentiments. “There is no doubt in this that Kejriwal has decided to get Chhath celebration done under the pressure of elections. He is stubborn, he hurt the sentiments of the devotees and would have been continuing but he agreed because of the upcoming elections in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh,” Tiwari was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ddma-allows-chhath-puja-at-designated-sites-bars-celebrations-at-yamuna-101635512066830.html
29-10-2021||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai civic body call centre starts calling citizens due for second vaccination dose||In order to make sure that all the beneficiaries who took the first dose of vaccination have taken their second dose, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has assigned its call centre to call the pending beneficiaries.NMMC has a pendency list of around 85,897 beneficiaries whom the call centre employees have started making calls to from Wednesday. Till Thursday, 5,000 people have been called and it has been found that around 62% of the people who were called had taken their second dose under a different mobile number and hence the system showed that their second dose was pending, claimed NMMC officials.Even as more than 100% of the targeted beneficiaries have got their first dose vaccination in Navi Mumbai, around 46% of the people who have taken their first dose, are yet to take their second dose.The 85,897 pending beneficiaries are due for the second dose from 85 to 147 days of which three are due for the second dose beyond 147 days. Those who have taken Covishield have to take their second dose between 84 and 112 days after taking their first.“If there are people who have missed their second dose beyond 112 days, even then the second dose can be given. Initially it was not possible to do that as the system did not accept the input of the second dose if the days expired. But now, it can be done,” the officer added.People who have taken Covaxin need to take the second dose after 28 days.“From the data collected in ‘my family my responsibility’, the calls are also being made to the 60 years and above beneficiaries to check if all of them are vaccinated since door-to-door visits have a limitation. The data collected for the pendency list is via the CoWIN portal. The call centre also informs the beneficiaries from the pendency list to get their second dose as soon as possible as there are no long queues now. We are trying to get everyone under the geographical limits of NMMC to get both the doses,” NMMC commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, said. The state had given NMMC the target of 11.07 lakh target of vaccination while NMMC has, till now, vaccinated 11.21 lakh people with the first dose and 6.06 lakh with the second dose.Nearly 4L missed 2nd dose in Mumbai In Mumbai, nearly four lakh people have missed the second dose, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Early this week, the civic health authorities have created a database of people who have missed the due date for the second dose and have passed it on to the 24 war rooms in the city.“The war rooms have been assigned to call every person who has missed the date for the second shot,” said BMC’s immunisation officer, Dr Sheela Jagtap.“In the earlier phase of the vaccination drive, a lot of people from other parts of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region like Thane, Navi Mumbai, Vasai-Virar among others came to Mumbai to get the shots. It could be that these people have taken the second shot in their areas and the data has not been updated. We have asked the war rooms to simultaneously update the data as well,” she said.Civic officials said that some people may have developed side effects, which may have deterred them from taking the second dose while there could be a section of people who may have missed out due to travel schedules etc.“Our war room staff will also counsel them if needed and ask them to take the second dose without wasting more time,” said Jagtap.(Inputs from Jyoti Shelar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-civic-body-call-centre-starts-calling-citizens-due-for-second-vaccination-dose-101635512518186.html

The continuous use of glyphosate also means groundwater quality will be at risk and the damage could be irreversible,” said Hema Chari, an environmentalist and resident who came across the information on social media.She added that the actual reason for the proliferation of water hyacinth is the unregulated discharge of raw sewage into the rivers, which is neglected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pcmc-use-of-toxic-glyphosate-to-weed-out-water-hyacinth-irks-environmentalists-101635511613552.html
29-10-2021||Kolkata||Calcutta HC imposes blanket ban on firecrackers during Kali Puja in West Bengal||The Calcutta High Court on Friday imposed a blanket ban on the sale and bursting of firecrackers in West Bengal during Kali puja and other festivals including Chhath puja, Christmas and New Year eve, officials said. “The court, after hearing a PIL, has put a blanket ban on all kinds of crackers and fireworks whether it is soundless or produces sound. Only diyas and candles may be used,” said Rachit Lakhmani, the counsel of the petitioner. On Tuesday, the West Bengal government allowed the bursting of green crackers for two hours during Kali puja and Chhath puja, and for around 35 minutes on Christmas and New Year eve, following which a PIL was filed in the high court seeking a complete ban on firecrackers. The petitioner, social worker Roshni Ali, pleaded that the bursting of firecrackers will increase air pollution and lead to breathing problems for Covid-positive patients. Recently, a section of Kolkata’s leading doctors, environment experts medical associations collectively submitted a letter to chief minister Mamata Banerjee requesting a blanket ban on firecrackers. Diwali will be celebrated across the country on November 4 this year. “Much damage has been caused by the rampant violations of Covid-19 safety protocols during the Durga puja. Cases have started rising once again in the city and across the state. We should at least show some restraint during Kali puja by not bursting crackers and fireworks this time. The smoke and pollution would cause more harm to patients who are suffering from Covid-19 or are recovering from the disease,” said Manas Gupta, general secretary of the Association of Health Service Doctors in West Bengal. This comes at a time when the centre has warned the state of rising Covid-19 cases in Kolkata after Durga puja. In 2020, the Calcutta high court banned the use and sale of firecrackers on Kali puja to curb pollution amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The state government too had appealed to the people to avoid bursting firecrackers during Kali Puja and Diwali to check air pollution. The Durga puja, the biggest festival in the state, ended on October 15 and the daily count of Covid-19 cases is again hovering around the 1000-mark after a gap of more than three months. While 976 new cases were detected in the state on Wednesday, on Thursday the number shot up further to 990. With cases shooting up, the state government has reimposed micro-containment zones in various districts including Howrah, North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas and Jalpaiguri among others. Police have started intensifying action against citizens for violating Covid-19 safety protocols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/calcutta-hc-imposes-blanket-ban-on-firecrackers-during-kali-puja-in-west-bengal-101635511555530.html

Ever since the byelections were declared a month ago, the focus of the state government and political parties has been on the elections. Till October 28, a total of 4,558 Covid-19 cases were reported from across the state, taking the total case count to 2,23,619, while the positivity rate again climbed to 2.3%. Also read: Jai Ram confident of sweeping victory in Himachal bypollsAs many as 69 Covid fatalities were recorded during this period with the case fatality ratio at 1.6%. Though there is no evidence to suggest that the election rallies caused the latest spurt, but coronavirus is spreading rapidly again, particularly in Kangra, Hamirpur, Bilaspur and Una districts. Virus spreads among school students What has become a cause of concern for the state health authorities is the spread of coronavirus among children. More than 750 students of government and private schools have tested positive since the schools reopened in the state. This is the number of only those children whose samples were collected at the schools. The number would be higher if the number of those who were detected positive at home is included. According to the state education department data, among the infected students, 386 are from government schools alone. Half of the students have recovered. The highest number of 319 students has tested positive in Kangra followed by 208 in Hamirpur and 131 in Una. Sirmaur is the only district where no student has been found positive. A 13-year-old girl student died of the infection in Kangra on October 21. She reportedly caught the infection after attending a wedding. The district health authorities said the girl was not attending school since October 12. Her family sought medical help only after her condition deteriorated. The state health authorities have sent samples of 70 students to National Centre of Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi, for testing to identify the variant. Decision on schools at November 8 meeting Education secretary Rajeev Sharma said the government is closely monitoring the situation. “The government has already announced week-long Diwali vacations from November 1 in educational institutions to prevent further spread. About 4,000 teachers are on poll duty in the state. Their tests will be conducted after they are back,” Sharma said. Any decision on schools will be taken in a meeting slated for November 8. Chief secretary Ram Subhag Singh held a virtual meeting with all deputy commissioners on Thursday to review the Covid situation, particularly in schools. Most DCs favoured closing down schools again to check the transmission. A recent sero survey found 61% children aged between 10 and 17 years had antibodies against coronavirus. 36% of state’s positive cases in Kangra Kangra, the most populous district of the state, has seen the maximum number of cases. Till Thursday, 1,642 cases were reported in Kangra, which is 36% of the total cases reported in the state. 19% of the new cases in the district are school students. In September, the district reported 1,341 cases. Hamirpur district has seen 949 new infections this month, while Mandi recorded 622, Una 452 and Bilaspur 364.

She also demanded a probe into why fertilisers were not reaching farmers. “Whatever the officers have done here is wrong. If there is any nexus of officers and leaders with those indulging in black marketing of fertilisers, it should be probed. Why are people not getting fertilisers here,” asked Priyanka Gandhi Vadra while speaking to media persons after meeting families of four farmers, who died recently amid reports of fertiliser shortage. Referring to the Lakhimpur Kheri incident of October 3, Gandhi said farmers were struggling from Lakhimpur to Bundelkhand region of the state.The Congress leader accused the BJP government of neglecting farmers. “They have neglected farmers. This is not about these four families. It is happening in the entire Bundelkhand region. The UP government’s cruel face has come to the fore. Farmers were crushed by the son of a union minister who continues to be in office,” she said. “You all know farmers are facing problems and no one is listening to them… we come here and meet them. They are living in these conditions, have loans to pay and are not getting any fertilisers. They also have to pay power bills without getting electricity,” said Priyanka. She listed promises the Congress has made to people ahead of 2022 UP assembly polls, including farm loan waiver, MSP of ₹2,500 per quintal for wheat and paddy and state advised price (SAP) of ₹400 per quintal to sugarcane growers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/priyanka-meets-deceasedfarmers-kin-seeks-probeinto-fertiliser-shortage-101635508496180.html

The former Mumbai top cop, who has been gone missing, earlier alleged that Deshmukh instructed certain Mumbai police officers, including the dismissed assistant inspector Sachin Waze to collect ₹100 crore every month from various establishments such as bars, dance bars and hookah parlours in Mumbai. ED registered its first case in this regard on May 11.To be sure, ED has been issuing summons to Deshmukh since June 25, but he has not appeared before the agency so far.In another case, ED lawyers on October 1 told a Mumbai court that the former minister was summoned five times between June 25 and August 16, but he was a no show. In his petition filed in the high court, Deshmukh’s lawyer Aniket Nikam asked the high court to allow him before investigators via a videoconferencing link and let him produce documents sought by the agency through his representative.Nikam argued that ED created the apprehension that Deshmukh may be arrested as they neither provided him with the list of documents sought from him nor a copy of the case registered against him, and this showed that ED officials were prejudicial to his interests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/high-court-rejects-anil-deshmukh-s-plea-to-cancel-ed-summons-bar-his-arrest-101635507533129.html
29-10-2021||Pune||Incidents of brain stroke increasing among youngsters: doctors||On the occasion of World Stroke Day observed every year on October 29, doctors and medical experts warned that incidents of brain stroke among youngsters are on the rise due to addiction and a sedentary lifestyle. They said that time is of the essence in treating brain stroke patients and that greater awareness is needed among patients.Dr Nasli Icchaporia, director – Neurology, Sahyadri Super Speciality hospital, said that time is crucial while treating brain stroke patients and that we need more stroke-ready hospitals. “We can minimise the disability by early recognition and treatment. Interventional techniques - like administering clot bursting injections within four-and-a-half hours and if required, Mechanical Thrombectomy namely Stent Retrievers with which large vessels can be opened up and which has to be carried out within six hours of the onset of stroke - have significantly improved the outcomes if the patient is brought to the hospital on time,” he said. He said that a new acronym B.E.F.A.S.T. which stands for balance, eyes, face, arm, speech and time will be helpful in encouraging people to recognise the warning signs of stroke and get help as soon as possible.“It is not only important for a patient to be brought to the hospital fast, but it is also important for the emergency department to have a streamlined process to deal with strokes. The emergency department should be designed to do streamlined choreography with their own stroke codes. The entire staff should be educated about the signs and symptoms of stroke, blood sugar should be checked in the ambulance on the way, and the emergency department should be sounded off so that they can keep the entire infrastructure ready. Telemedicine too can prove beneficial,” said Dr Icchaporia.Dr Dhanshree Peddawad, consultant neurologist at Jupiter hospital, Pune, said that incidents of brain stroke among youngsters are increasing as the pressure among them is increasing. She said that many young patients who are in their late 30s and early 40s are suffering brain strokes.“The reason is increase in stress, a sedentary lifestyle and addiction to smoking. These are some of the primary causes that can lead to a brain stroke. Simple changes in lifestyle like regular exercise, healthy diet, and giving up smoking can help eliminate or reduce the risk factors. Also more awareness is needed among the general public to be able to recognise early signs of a stroke and consult a doctor,” Dr Peddawad said.Brain stroke is a medical emergency which occurs when blood supply to the brain is blocked either by a clot or a burst. This can have a damaging and disabling effect on the body depending on the extent and location of the damage as different areas of the brain are responsible for controlling different functions. The ruptured blood vessels can even cause severe damage like brain haemorrhage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/incidents-of-brain-stroke-increasing-among-youngsters-doctors-101635506572649.html
29-10-2021||Mumbai||Kalyan Dombivli civic body asks hotels to manage own waste||As a part of their zero-waste campaign, the Kalyan–Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) has now asked the hotels in the city to manage their own waste. The solid waste management department of KDMC and the hotel association representatives have come up with an idea of installing portable biogas plants in hotels in the coming days.“We had called a meeting with the representatives of the hotel association in the city and have discussed the measures on how to ensure the waste generated in hotels is managed within the hotels. One effective measure that we have agreed upon is installing portable biogas plants at the hotels,” said Ramdas Kokre, deputy commissioner, KDMC.The portable plants at the hotels will treat the waste generated in the hotels daily and reduce the amount of waste collected by the civic body from these hotels.The civic body will organise a workshop to educate the hotel owners in the city on how the biogas plants could work and how it would benefit the city. KDMC also urged the hoteliers to not use plastic bags and to shift to other bags that are eco-friendly.As per the civic body, around 35 tons of wastes are generated from hotels in the city. If the hotels take up the measure of biogas plants and manage their waste daily, the civic body also plans to give them an exemption of 5% on the property tax.“We will give a 5% exemption on property tax to those hotels that install the biogas plants and manage their waste regularly,” added Kokre.Praveen Shetty, president of Kalyan hotel association, said, “We have agreed to install the biogas plants as it will be a major contribution from us to manage the waste. Also, the civic body is giving us an exemption of 5% on property tax that is very motivating. The civic body is not forcing anybody to install the plant, which is a good approach. There are around 150 hotels in Kalyan.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kalyan-dombivli-civic-body-asks-hotels-to-manage-own-waste-101635506272740.html

29-10-2021||Pune||Global Village Idiot: Everyday happenings as the spark for great inspiration||Friends and family often ask where I get the inspiration for books, columns and blogs. At other times, they ask who inspired me to become a writer; which writers I look up to and so on. I have never given it much thought, but when one of my kids asked, I figured it’s important.For most of my life, I have just written. I write every day. Sometimes one line, sometimes one page, sometimes 20, but I write every day. And I write as it strikes me, as it happens (used to be on scraps of paper, notebooks, tissue paper, now it’s on the phone); not at a desk long after the event has happened, long after the thoughts and feelings have come and gone. I don’t recreate or craft stories. I experience and transcribe in the moment. I started writing because I had lots of questions about everything. As I wrote questions, I wondered about answers, and as I wondered, I made choices and as I made choices, I reflected whether they were right or wrong, and corrected my behaviour. To clear all doubts: I don’t rush to call family and friends when something exciting or disheartening or boring happens; I write. What do I write about? Anything and everything. Going to the market with my father, for instance. I learned the importance of selecting the meat and vegetables with one’s own hand (not what the vendor gave you), bargaining hard, walking away from the deal, closing the deal so that’s it’s fair to both sides, and doing all this through pleasant, amiable dialogue. “Kaise diya tamatar? (What’s the price of tomatoes)?”“Bauji, dus rupiya kilo (Sir, ten rupees a kilo)?.”“Tamatar bech rahe ho, ya sona? Aath mein do to batao. (You are selling tomatoes or gold? Let me know if you’ll sell for 8 a kilo)?”“Aap teen kilo le lo to saath mein de dei. (If you buy three kilos, I will give it to you at seven a kilo).”“Beta sabji mein daalna hai, tamatar ka sauce nahin bechna. Theeek bhav bolo. (I need tomatoes to add a bit to the vegetable dish not to make and sell tomato sauce. Give me a good price).”The most important lesson was always the banter - that’s how my father connected with people, speaking in their particular dialect, enjoying the jest, taking interest in where they came from, how many people in their family, what their dreams were. He used to say, “Money is very important, but the world is about people. Kindness is not about giving money, it is about treating people as humans, as your equal.” He had learnt that lesson the hard way - he and his siblings had gone from growing up with means, to growing up in poverty, and then clawing out of that poverty into some meagre means. Through the 1970s and 1980s, while learning about the nuances of such social interactions and everyday life, I was also blessed to have the opportunity to read the highly evolved and intellectual works of Tolstoy, Hegel, Hemingway, Tagore, Vivekanand and Thomas Hardy. I also read Dinkar, Munshi Premchand and heard Kabir dohas every day. I recited shlokas and sang bhajans every evening, and listened to sermons every week and participated in deep debate at every opportunity … and wrote. I also read Lee Falk (Phantom, Mandrake), Abid Surati’s Bahadur, Champak, Chandamama, Tinkle, and Amar Chitra Katha, Reader Digest, Archie, Casper, Hot Stuff, Tintin, and Asterix and Obelix.In the early 1980s I started reading newspapers and discovered RK Laxman. And thanks to our school textbooks, Mario Miranda’s art had a great influence on my style of expression. In 1987 I discovered Larry Siegel, Sergio Aragones, Mort Drucker, Dock DeBartolo, Don Martin (among many others) through MAD magazine. In 1989, I discovered Bill Waterson’s work (Calvin and Hobbes) and the works of Louis L’Amour, Jeffrey Archer and Arthur Hailey. All of these artists and writers and many other philosophers, artistes, film-makers, musicians have helped shape my understanding that there need not be any limits on self-expression so long as I know social and legal boundaries and also how to push those boundaries without breaking them. But, it is Busybee and Dave Barry who influenced my style of column-writing to an extent. Busybee (Behram Contractor) was an Indian journalist and humourist who founded the Afternoon Despatch & Courier, a tabloid I used to buy from my pocket money every day simply to read the columns by Busybee on the long bus journey home from Madras Hotel to Sayyad Gaon in Delhi. Dave Barry is an American humourist and columnist who used to write for the Miami Herald and I found his column by chance in the early 1990s, through an online friend in Syracuse (later through the sitcom Dave’s World).I still have no preference of subject matter when it comes to reading - history, economics, political science, geography, technology, engineering, sports, art, wine labels, nutrition information on grocery ingredients, aircraft safety cards, EULAs, comics, religious books, text books, how-to’s, how-not-to’s … I read anything and everything.I guess it’s natural that I write on anything and everything, but the focus is always on the ordinary person’s experience. Like the cabin crew wearing spectacles on my first time flying Emirates. When I walked into the aircraft on that particular flight, there was this crew member wearing spectacles who was doing a little jig to the catchy music that was playing on the music system. And she was smiling as she worked because she was enjoying the music. As were some of the other crew. They were all pleasant and cordial and focused on what they were doing. Guess what I am saying is the crew was of real people in a relaxed environment, liking their work and it reflected on my travel experience. The average, ordinary person is therefore my inspiration. People who have little or no power, who keep getting up every day no matter what happened the day before, and taking one step and another through the day. People who are not born or bred for success. People who have to make choices between rent or mortgage payments and children’s education, between healthcare and that additional hour of remuneration, between their dreams and the immediate security of their families. The men and women who deal with high stress every day for decades, but have the gumption to sympathise with the troubles of others, or lend a hand whenever they can.That’s who inspires me.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/global-village-idiot-everyday-happenings-as-the-spark-for-great-inspiration-101635505075000.html
29-10-2021||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai crime branch constable accused of rape not arrested yet 40 days on||It’s been 40 days since a 23-year-old woman registered a rape case against police constable Rupesh Kohli (attached with Navi Mumbai crime branch) at Khandeshwar police station. However, the police are unable to arrest the accused till date. In her statement, the survivor mentioned that she had met Kohli on social media a few months ago and they became friends. Kohli, 23, then established a physical relationship with her promising marriage and later when she conceived, he forcefully got her pregnancy terminated by giving her some medicines. After all these, he refused to marry her. The police booked the accused under Sections 376, 313, 323, and 417 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the relevant sections of Atrocity Act as applicable in this case. Navi Mumbai police commissioner Bipin Kumar Singh suspended Kohli two days after the case was registered.Bhagawat Sonawane, assistant commissioner of police (Panvel division), said, “As the accused is also a policeman, he knows the strategies we use to arrest the absconding accused. He went into hiding before the case was registered and has not taken any step that might give us clues about his whereabouts. Our teams are still searching for him at different places of the state.”Hemant Sharma, a social activist and convener of Sahayak Janheet Abhiyan, a non-governmental organisation, alleged, “We have observed that in such cases the police normally delay in arresting the accused and, meanwhile, try to influence the complainant’s decision. If the complainant agrees to settle the case outside the court, the police don’t arrest the accused at all. We hope the police are not purposely delaying arrest in this case too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-crime-branch-constable-accused-of-rape-not-arrested-yet-40-days-on-101635505073023.html
29-10-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan bypolls: Close fight and triangular contest in Vallabhnagar, Dhariawad||Rajasthan’s two assembly seats going for bypolls this Saturday – Vallabhnagar and Dhariawad have become political hotbeds, with parties putting in all their efforts to bring them in their kitty.The ministers and other leaders camping in for weeks, the CM addressing rallies twice, and the large presence of senior BJP leaders from Delhi and state has surprised the people of the constituencies with this attention.The bypolls have been necessitated due to the demise of BJP MLA from Dhariawad, Gautam Lal Meena, and Congress MLA from Vallabhnagar, Gajendra Singh Shaktawat.Both the assemblies are facing a close contest with regional parties and independent candidates giving a tough time to the ruling Congress and Opposition BJP.The Vallabhnagar assembly constituency is witnessing close contest among three candidates including that of Congress, Rashtriya Loktantrik Party, and Independent (Chief of Janta Sena), while BJP appears to be lagging behind.The constituency has been a stronghold of Congress with the party winning nine of the 16 assembly elections held since 1952. The BJP candidate Randhir Singh Bhindar managed to win in 2003, and later as an independent in 2013.Playing the sympathy card, the Congress has fielded Preeti Shaktawat, wife of late Vallabhnagar MLA Gajendra Singh, whereas BJP has picked up a new face Himmat Singh Jhala. Denied ticket, former BJP MLA Bhindar is once again contesting as independent, while another Udailal Dangi of BJP is contesting on RLP ticket.Also Read | TMC, BJP gear up for close contest in four Bengal bypollsIn Dhariawad, independent candidate Thawarchand, a rebel of the Bhartiya Tribal Party (BTP) would play a spoilsport for Nagraj Meena (INC) and Khet Singh (BJP).The constituency came into existence after delimitation in 2008 and has witnessed three assembly polls since then, where BJP won twice (2013 and 2018) and Congress in 2008.Confident of winning both bypolls, CM Ashok Gehlot has stated that BJP would come in fourth place in Vallabhnagar. “People of the BJP and the RSS are roaming from village to village and misleading people. Somebody should ask them why inflation is increasing in your rule (at the Centre). Do they have any answer? Petrol, diesel and LPG prices are increasing day by day,” he said, addressing byelection rallies on Tuesday.“Whatever promises were made seven years ago, even if (PM Narendra) Modi made them, these people do not mention them,” he said. He alleged that people have been suffering due to inflation since the BJP came to power at the Centre.On the other hand, the BJP is cornering the government on issues such as anti-people policies, law and order and power cuts.Addressing a byelection rally on Tuesday, BJP national general secretary and in charge for Rajasthan Arun Singh said voting for Congress means giving license to the inaction of the Gehlot government, increase in crimes and misgovernance.The chief minister did not leave the residence for 18 months during the so far tenure of 3 years, Singh continued. He said that development works came to a standstill in the Congress rule.BJP state president Satish Poonia said there is a lot of resentment among the people about the anti-people policies of the Congress government.He said that "there is a lot of resentment among the people about the anti-people policies of the Congress government, including increased power tariff, undeclared power cuts, incomplete farmer loan waiver, deteriorating law and order. And people of Vallabhnagar are also not untouched by it."Political analyst Manish Godha said Dhariawad is known to be a bastion of BJP but the selection of candidates has somehow created problems for the party. A sympathy card could have been a better option for BJP as Congress has done in Vallabhnagar.He said Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria has a good hold in the Mewar region and if BJP had put the responsibility on his shoulders then it would have been a better contest on both seats.The polling will take place on October 30 and counting of votes on November 2.In the House of 200, the ruling Congress at present has 106 MLAs, BJP - 71, Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) - 3, CPI(M), and Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP) - 2 each, Rashtriya Lok Dal -1 and 13 are independent legislators.

29-10-2021||Chandigarh||Congress leadership of Bathinda patronising corruption: Kejriwal||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday accused the Congress leadership of Bathinda of patronising corruption. During a closed-door interaction with representatives of the business community, Kejriwal said extortion and murders have shaken the faith of industrialists in Punjab. Also read: SAD constitution forgery: Punjab court summons ex-CM Parkash Singh BadalThe Delhi CM repeatedly referred to the name of an aide of a senior Punjab minister for allegedly running the goonda tax regime in Bathinda. “During a series of meetings with industrialists and traders since Thursday evening in Bathinda, the name of a person was taken prominently by all organised corruption. Industrialists are being harassed and framed in false cases,” he said. During his maiden political visit to Bathinda ahead of the state elections, Kejriwal tried to win over small and medium-scale industrialists and traders. Says AAP will ensure transparency, safety The AAP supremo urges electoral support to form the next government in Punjab that will ensure the business community a regime free from ‘raids and inspector raj’. “If voted to power, we will ensure prompt clearance of huge arrears of the obsolete VAT (value-added tax). We will ensure transparent governance and safety of businessmen,” he said. Kejriwal expressed concern over the deterioration of the traditional business of cotton ginning in the cotton-growing region of south Malwa. “The number of such cotton processing units has gone down from 400 to 40 in the past few years. But respective governments have ignored the role of this sector in the economy. The AAP is sensitive to the needs and aspirations of the business community from small and medium sectors and we work to promote them,” he said. Says Channi govt overlooking industries Taking potshots at Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, his Delhi counterpart said that the Congress government is making false claims on new investments by the corporate sector while overlooking the existing industries in need of support. “The industry is bracing with acute electricity shortage. It is a fact that industrialists are moving to other states as the Punjab government has failed to give them an incentive. Channi has been issuing press statements to bring a change in governance but has initiated any move to curb inspector raj that hurts the economic interests of traders and entrepreneurs,” he said. Kejriwal said his party favours empowering the aam aadmi (common man) as they are instrumental in the progress of any society. “Agriculture and industry are two integral sectors to boost the economy of Punjab. AAP commits to make them partners in development and curb corruption with stringent means,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-leadership-of-bathinda-patronising-corruption-kejriwal-101635501472446.html

29-10-2021||Jaipur||Stage set in Rajasthan's Vallabhnagar, Dhariawad for assembly bypolls on Oct 30||The stage is all set for bypolls to two assembly seats in Rajasthan's Vallabhnagar and Dhariawad on Saturday, with the election being viewed as a significant test for the performance of the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government.Polling will be held from 7 am to 6 pm at 638 polling booths in both the assembly constituencies and counting of votes will take place on November 2.Though the number of constituencies going to bypolls is not crucial from the viewpoint of the government's stability but the results will send a message across the state about the performance of the government, which had faced a major threat last year due to rebellion of the then deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and 18 MLAs led by him.In election rallies on Tuesday, Gehlot had appealed to voters to vote for Congress saying it is necessary to strengthen the government.Despite palpable discord over the leadership issue, Gehlot and his former deputy Pilot projected a united face by travelling together in a helicopter along with AICC general secretary in-charge for Rajasthan Ajay Maken and PCC chief Govind Singh Dotasra to address rallies in both the constituencies during nomination filing by the party candidates.It was for the second time after last year's crisis that both the leaders travelled together and shared the stage.Leaders of both the parties camped in the constituencies and left no stone unturned in electioneering.While the Congress targeted the Centre over the issue of inflation and fuel and LPG prices hike as well as highlighted the works of the state government during the campaigning, the BJP made law and order, crime rate, unemployment allowance, increased power tariff etc. key poll issues.BJP leaders from Delhi and Jaipur including national general secretary and in charge of party affairs in Rajasthan Arun Singh, union ministers Arjun Munda and SP Singh Baghel addressed rallies.Baghel's controversial remarks on chief minister Gehlot during a rally in Vallabhnagar last week questioning his parentage had also stoked a controversy.The bypolls have been necessitated due to the death of BJP MLA from Dhariawad, Gautam Lal Meena, and Congress MLA from Vallabhnagar, Gajendra Singh Shaktawat.Both of them died due to Covid-19.While the Congress gave ticket to Gajendra Shaktawat's wife Preeti Shaktawat in Vallabhnagar in Udaipur, the BJP disappointed the son of Gautam Lal Meena and fielded Khet Singh Meena in Dhariawad in Pratapgarh against the Congress candidate Nagraj Meena.Nagraj Meena was defeated by Gautam Lal Meena in the 2018 assembly elections with a margin of 23842 votes in Dhariawad.Gautam Lal Meena's son Kanhaiya Meena had filed nomination papers as an independent candidate after being denied ticket by the BJP but the saffron party persuaded him to withdraw the nomination.A total of seven candidates are contesting elections in Dhariawad (ST) constituency.In Vallabhnagar, the BJP has fielded Himmat Singh Jhala against Preeti Shaktawat while former BJP MLA and chief of Janta Sena Randhir Singh Bhinder is also contesting as an independent MLA.Bhinder's wife had filed nomination as Janta Sena candidate after denial of ticket from BJP but withdrew the nomination paper later.In the 2018 assembly elections, Bhindar, as the Janta Sena candidate, had given a tough fight to Gajendra Singh Shaktawat and was defeated with a narrow margin of 3,719 votes.Apart from them, BJP's rebel Udailal Dangi is also contesting election as Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) candidate in Vallabhnagar. RLP is the party of Nagaur MP and former BJP leader Hanuman Beniwal.As many as nine candidates are in the fray in Vallabhnagar.Chief Electoral Officer Praveen Gupta said bypolls will be conducted as per Covid-19 guidelines.No voter in the constituency has been found suffering from Covid as on Thursday evening.A total of 5,11,455 voters will be able to exercise their franchise with 2,53,831 in Vallabhnagar and 2,57, 624 in Dhariawad.Of the total 638 polling booths, 119 are sensitive.Gupta said 4,468 security personnel have been deployed in both the assembly constituencies for free, fair and peaceful voting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/stage-set-in-rajasthan-s-vallabhnagar-dhariawad-for-assembly-bypolls-on-oct-30-101635493041031.html
29-10-2021||Gurugram||Ellenabad bypolls: INLD's Abhay Chautala eyeing hat-trick||The bypoll to the Ellenabad Assembly constituency in Haryana's Sirsa district on Saturday is all set to witness a triangular contest, with opposition INLD's Abhay Singh Chautala, whose resignation over the farm laws issue necessitated the election, eyeing another win.The bypoll will be held on October 30 and the counting will take place on November 2. Gobind Kanda, brother of Haryana Lokhit Party chief and legislator Gopal Kanda, had joined the BJP recently and had been fielded by the BJP-JJP combine. Pawan Beniwal, who had unsuccessfully contested the previous assembly poll against Abhay Chautala, recently switched over from the BJP to the Congress. He is in the fray as candidate of the main opposition party.Abhay Chautala's resignation in January over the farm laws issue had necessitated the bypolls to the rural constituency falling in Sirsa district.Over 1.85 lakh voters which includes over 98,000 men and 86,000 women, are eligible to cast their votes.The electioneering for the Ellenabad Assembly seat bypoll ended on Wednesday evening with the three central agriculture laws emerging key issue in the election. Although a total of 19 candidates, mostly independents are in the fray, Abhay Chautala, Beniwal and Gobind Kanda are being considered as key candidates. A major part of the Ellenabad Assembly constituency is rural with people mostly relying on agriculture.The elections for the Ellenabad Assembly seat have been held 14 times in which only the candidates of the party led by late Devi Lal were victorious.However, things are a bit different this time as many members of the Chautala family are part of the BJP-JJP coalition government.       During the campaigning, Abhay Chautala's elder brother and JJP chief Ajay Singh Chautala, the latter's son and Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala, targeted the INLD leader holding him responsible for the party's decline.        Power Minister Ranjit Singh Chautala, who is an Independent MLA, also campaigned against Abhay Chautala and in favour of the BJP candidate Gobind Kanda. The Congress and BJP have targeted Abhay Chautala, alleging that he had thrust the election on people of Ellenabad. Tight security arrangements have been made for the bypolls with deployment of 30 companies of central security force, five companies of the Rapid Action Force and Haryana Police.One company comprises around 120 personnel. Abhay Chautala is eyeing a hat-trick as he will be contesting his third bypoll. Earlier, he had won the Rori Assembly bypoll in Sirsa district in 2000 and the 2010 bypoll from Ellenabad when INLD chief O P Chautala had vacated the seat as he decided to retain Uchana seat in Jind district, the other seat from which he had contested in 2009 and won.In the 2010 bypolls to Ellenabad, Abhay Chautala won the seat and retained it in 2014 too. He again won Ellenabad in 2019 assembly polls when he was the lone INLD MLA to enter the Assembly. Winning the Saturday's bypoll is crucial for Abhay Chautala as a loss will deal a body blow to the INLD, which in recent years is reeling under series of electoral setbacks.  While the farmers' agitation against the central farm laws has emerged as the biggest factor in this bypoll, some factors like shortage of irrigation facilities in few villages and waterlogging problem in some segments are also likely to play a role in the bypoll.This is the second bypoll within a year which Haryana faces. In November last year, main opposition Congress had retained the Baroda assembly seat after its candidate Indu Raj Narwal defeated BJP nominee and Olympian wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt.The Baroda seat in Sonipat district had fallen vacant after the demise of Congress MLA Sri Krishan Hooda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/ellenabad-bypolls-inld-s-abhay-chautala-eyeing-hattrick-101635492951878.html

29-10-2021||Chandigarh||SAD constitution forgery: Punjab court summons ex-CM Parkash Singh Badal||Hoshiarpur additional chief judicial magistrate Rupinder Singh has summoned former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal in a case of alleged forgery of the constitution of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). SAD patriarch Badal was on Thursday asked to appear before the court on November 28. His son, Sukhbir Singh Badal, who is the SAD president, and party spokesperson Dr Daljit Singh Cheema have already got bail in the case. Also read: HC seeks Punjab’s response over ‘illegal’ takeover of Patti gurdwaraAccording to a directive of November 4, 2019, on the plea of complainant Balwant Singh Khera, Badal, Sukhbir and Cheema were to be summoned. Sukhbir and Cheema have already appeared. “Let accused Parkash Singh Badal be summoned on November 28,” the court order concluded. Complainant cites SAD’s ‘panthic’ activities Khera, a social activist, had complained that the SAD possessed two constitutions – one that it had submitted with the Gurdwara Election Commission and the other with the Election Commission of India (ECI) to seek recognition as a political outfit. He alleged that the SAD had given a false undertaking to the ECI that it had amended its constitution to incorporate the principles of socialism and secularism, whereas it continued its activities as a ‘panthic’ party and openly participated in gurdwara elections. Sufficient evidence against Badals: HC On August 27, the Punjab and Haryana high court disposed of a petition by the SAD against the proceedings of the Hoshiarpur court, saying there was sufficient evidence before the judicial magistrate to summon Badal, Sukhbir and Cheema on their undertakings regarding the party’s constitution. “Sufficient material has come on record wherein contrary stands have been taken regarding the constitution of the political party and whether it has adopted the principles of secularism or is still a religious party. It has also come on record that the SAD has been contesting the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee elections,” the high court bench of justice GS Sandhawalia observed. The SAD leaders had approached the high court in 2019, seeking a stay on the trial after the Hoshiarpur additional chief judicial magistrate summoned them in the case. The high court stayed the trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-constitution-forgery-punjab-court-summons-ex-cm-parkash-singh-badal-101635486591314.html
29-10-2021||Kolkata||TMC, BJP gear up for close contest in four Bengal bypolls||As West Bengal registered a rise in Covid-19 cases post Durga Puja, the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and its main contender, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), geared up for a close contest in the assembly bypolls to be held on Saturday, October 30, at Dinhata in Cooch Behar district, Santipur in Nadia district, Khardah in North 24 Parganas and Gosaba in South 24 Parganas.Two of these constituencies, Dinhata and Santipur, were won by the BJP in the March-April polls but the winners did not take oath to retain their Lok Sabha seats. In the rest two, the TMC’s winning candidates died.All four districts where bypolls will be held are located along the Bangladesh border and have a record of illegal infiltration, smuggling and influx of Hindu refugees during India’s partition in 1947 and creation of Bangladesh after the 1971 war. Since Hindus are in the majority in all these seats, the BJP is referring to history in its campaign and focusing on the recent attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh.“The attack on the minority Hindus in Bangladesh will increase the BJP’s margin of victory at Santipur three times,” leader of the opposition in the Bengal assembly, Suvendu Adhikari, told local voters last week.“I know only sanatan (eternal) Hindus voted for me. I bow only before them and not the others. I proudly admit that I wash the feet of cows because the cow is our mother. You must proudly declare that you are Hindus,” Adhikari said at Gosaba on Monday.“Murder of ISKCON saints or torture on #BengaliHindus in Bangladesh does not move CM Mamta Banerjee or other ruling party leaders. They play as silent observers, the sole reason behind their muteness is minority Muslim vote bank,” BJP national vice president Ghosh tweeted after addressing voters at Khardah.While campaigning at Dinhata on Monday, the chief minister’s nephew and TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee countered the attacks.“The leader of the opposition is saying that BJP will win these elections because Bengali Hindus in Bangladesh have been attacked. I want to ask the BJP what it has done for Hindus in India,” said Banerjee.Political experts feel that Dinhata will witness the most fierce contest as the BJP, which wrested the seat by 57 votes, has grown fast in north Bengal. The party bagged seven of the region’s eight Lok Sabha seats in 2019 and 30 of the 54 assembly seats in the eight north Bengal districts although the TMC won 213 of the state’s 294 seats.Though the BJP bagged 77 seats in Bengal, it is now left with 71 legislators as four have returned to the TMC since June. The ruling party, on the other hand, has increased its tally to 215 by winning two seats in Murshidabad district where bypolls were held in September.DinhataNumber of voters: 299,251Number of candidates: 6Prominent candidates: Udayan Guha (TMC), Ashok Mondal (BJP), Abdur Rouf (Forward Bloc)Why polls are being held: Winner did not take oath to retain Lok Sabha seat.Who won last time: Nisith Pramanik (BJP) by 57 votesSantipurNumber of voters: 255619Number of candidates: 7Prominent candidates: Niranjan Biswas (BJP), Brajakishore Goswami (TMC), Soumen Mahato (CPI-M), Raju Pal (Congress)Why polls are being held: Winner did not take oath to retain Lok Sabha seat.Who won last time: Jagannath Sarkar (BJP) by 15878 votesKhardahNumber of voters: 232,619Number of candidates: 6Prominent candidates: Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay (TMC), Joy Saha (BJP), Debajyoti Das (CPI-M)Why polls are being held: Winning candidate died of Covid-19Who won last time: Kajal Sinha (TMC) by 28140 votesGosaba (SC)Number of voters: 230,348Number of candidates: 5Prominent candidates: Subrata Mondal (TMC), Palash Rana (BJP), Anil Chandra Mondal (RSP)Why polls are being held: Winning candidate died.Who won last time: Jayanta Naskar (TMC) by 23709 votes||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tmc-bjp-gear-up-for-close-contest-in-four-bengal-bypolls-101635485908178.html

They include a drop in wind speed at night, a spike in farm fires, and low temperatures. On Thursday, the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research, a body under the ministry of earth sciences, said the contribution of farm fires to Delhi’s air touched a high of 19% this season, with over 500 fires recorded across the northern plains.Northwesterly winds were largely bringing pollutants from Punjab and Haryana towards Delhi. Parts of Delhi also reported mist on Friday morning. “There is sufficient moisture in the air at the moment and so misty conditions may be seen in parts of Delhi in the mornings now,” said an official.The CPCB on Thursday banned the use of diesel generator sets and ordered enhancing of parking fee by up to four times in Delhi-NCR as part of measures listed under the Graded Response Action Plan when the air quality hits “very poor”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/14c-delhi-records-lowest-minimum-temp-this-season-air-quality-deteriorates-101635485931666.html

29-10-2021||Delhi||8 of 10 kids in Delhi have Covid antibodies||Despite not being vaccinated against the coronavirus disease, nearly 82% of Delhi residents aged below 18 have were found to have antibodies against the Sars-Cov-2 virus, according to the preliminary report of the city’s sixth serological survey made public on Thursday. Experts cited this widespread seroprevalence among Delhi’s children to argue for the reopening of schools, a move that the state government announced just a day earlier.The antibody-prevalence among children falls just six percentage points short of Delhi’s unadjusted seroprevalence of 88.2%, according to the data. When adjusted for the sensitivity of the kits, Delhi’s overall seroprevalence stands at 97%.Health experts said the statistic was evidence that while a large number of children were infected with Covid-19, they were mostly asymptomatic, as a result of which eight in 10 of Delhi’s children have safely gained antibodies against the infection.

29-10-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Bench in blossom||It’s just a bench. But right now it is hewn out of the sun’s very soul.This is one of the most thaumaturgic sights in Delhi. The setting is Lodhi Gardens. The chosen bench, close to the Athpula stone bridge, lies in a most strategic point. The dipping sun directly hits it at about 5.30pm (October time).This evening, the green seat is dappled in an impossible-to-capture-on-camera misty halo of amber. Pools of luminous light have fallen on the leaf-strewn ground in front of the bench, as well as on the leaf-strewn space behind it. Being empty, the bench is also saturated with the well-known poignancy of all empty park benches, but that mundane melancholy doesn’t dampen the moment’s fantastical spectacle.For now, the painted metal of the bench seems to have lost its solidness, as if the bench were an apparition that could be seen and felt but not touched. Dappled in the dreaminess of the setting sun, it seems to be entirely composed of some supernatural essence containing and concealing a blessing (or a curse). You are reluctant to come close to it, the way one is wary of approaching a person believed to be possessed by a spirit.This perception of the sun-bathed bench isn’t universally shared, though. On some evenings, it is casually claimed by a random park visitor, who shows no consideration for its gold-filled aura. One evening a woman was sitting on it, absorbed in a talk-of-the-town novel. She looked like a sculpture, cast into a red-edged silhouette.The only drawback of this experience is that the magical light stays on the bench too briefly. Try to be here in advance so as not to miss the fleeting moment. Later, the bench retreats to its ordinary existence, and becomes part of the park’s post-dusk darkness. The visitor is left with a feeling of saudade, that enigmatic Portuguese word evoking a sad and intense longing for something that doesn’t exist. The bench lies across the jogging track from a public loo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-bench-in-blossom-101635463002019.html

29-10-2021||Chandigarh||Not an inch of farmers’ land acquired by outsider in J&K: LG Sinha||Jammu and Kashmir lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha on Thursday said not an inch of farmers’ land has been acquired by any outsider in Jammu and Kashmir, and added that attempts were being made to spread confusion in the UT.While inaugurating an apple festival at Sher-i-Kashmir International Conference Centre here, Sinha said no outside person can acquire land of any farmer in J&K. “There is a law that agricultural land can’t be acquired by any person except a farmer,” he added.The Centre had in October last year amended major land laws and notified rules allowing outsiders to buy non-agricultural land in J&K. The J&K Land Revenue Act would not allow any land used for agriculture purposes to be used for any non-agricultural purposes “except with the permission of the district collector”.Last week, the J&K administration, however, had authorised the district collectors to transfer agricultural land to a non-agriculturists for extending the primary activity on a larger commercial scale. On Monday, Hurriyat Conference led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, had alleged that the “efforts to seize resources and alter demography continued in J&K”.Sinha said that the J&K government is legally bound to protect the agricultural land.‘Those who suffered losses due to recent snowfall will get aid’The farmers who suffered losses in the recent snowfall will be provided assistance, Sinha said, adding that the snowfall has been declared as a natural calamity.“The assessment of the loss is going on. The farmers will be provided all possible assistance,” he added. The early snowfall in Kashmir on October 22 and 23 had put thousands of farmers in misery as the snow damaged fruit-laden apple orchards particularly in the Pir Panjal region of Shopian and Kulgam in south Kashmir. Sinha said as the agriculture and allied sectors were contributing to J&K’s economy, they were working to increase the contribution of the apple sector by 10% in the next three years.“We have initiated many plans. I understand that if J&K has to move ahead on the path of development, its important source is agriculture and allied sectors, particularly horticulture,” he said, adding that all assistance will be provided for the development of the horticulture sector. Kashmir is India’s largest apple grower with an average annual production of nearly 2,200 metric tonnes. The apple industry fetches revenue of nearly ₹1,300 crore.The government had deputed requisite field staff in south Kashmir’s snowstorm affected apple orchards to assess the damage caused to trees and fruits and also asked them to furnish the report and recommendations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/not-an-inch-of-farmers-land-acquired-by-outsider-in-j-k-lg-sinha-101635461749760.html
29-10-2021||Chandigarh||J&K land encroachment case: Chargesheet filed against educational trust ex-chairperson, patwari||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday filed a chargesheet against the then chairperson of an educational trust based at Kathua and then patwari of Muthi Hardo in Kathua on the allegations of illegal possession and encroachment of land by said educational trust, said officials. CBI had registered an instant case against RB Educational Trust (through its chairperson Kanta Andotra, who is wife of former minister Choudhary Lal Singh) based at Kathua and others on September 12 last year. Earlier, a preliminary inquiry was conducted by CBI on the allegations of encroachment of huge tract of government and forest land in Kathua (J&K) by certain persons in violation of the J&K Agrarian Reforms Act in connivance with revenue and forest officials. Searches were also conducted on September 15 last year at 10 locations, including in Jammu and Kathua. “During investigation it was found that the then chairperson of said educational trust allegedly entered into conspiracy with the then patwari Muthi Hardo, tehsil Hiranagar (now Marheen) in Kathua. It was also alleged that in pursuance to the conspiracy, farads (maps describing measurement, directions and size of land) were issued by the said patwari, without mentioning the details in respect of ceiling imposed under the J&K Agrarian Reforms Act and mutations were attested, thus facilitating illegal acquisition of land beyond ceiling limit by the said educational trust in gross violation of the Agrarian Reforms Act,” said a spokesperson. Further investigation is on in the case. In September last year, an FIR was also registered against former deputy commissioner of Kathua Ajay Singh Jamwal, former tehsildar of Marheen Avatar Singh and others on allegations of having facilitated the trust in possessing land much beyond the limit and submitting a false affidavits in its support, causing loss to the state exchequer. The trust runs a school, BEd (Bachelor of Education) and nursing colleges on the land, transactions of which are being probed by the central agency for alleged irregularities in their purchase. The then forest minister, Lal Singh, and industries minister Chander Prakash Ganga had resigned from the PDP-BJP dispensation in 2018 after questions were raised over their participation in a Hindu Ekta Manch rally organised in support of those arrested in connection with the rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl in Kathua that year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jk-land-encroachment-case-chargesheet-filed-against-educational-trust-ex-chairperson-patwari-101635461629778.html

An aggrieved relative said the accused woman had also alleged that her father-in-law had molested her and filmed obscene videos featuring her after they had a spat over her share in a 125 square-yard house owned by the family. The teenager is still at large.A neighbour said that the boy was gripped by such a rage that he thrashed his grandparents – Darshan Singh, 72, and Surinder Kaur, 70 – with a baseball bat before hacking them to death. “When we intervened, he threatened to kill us too,” he said. After the murders, the boy and his mother fled from the spot. At the time of the incident, his father and elder sister were at work.The victims’ daughter, Davinder Kaur, said her father had a 125-square yard house with three rooms in Lal Kalan village. “He had given one room each to his two sons and kept one room for himself, but he was living in a rented accommodation in Doraha after locking the room.”“My younger brother lives in Machhiwara with his family and had also locked his room, while my elder brother was living in one room with his wife, daughter and son. My brother was asking our father for keys to his room as he was not living there, but my father was reluctant. A case is also pending between my father and brother in the court,”said Kaur.“On Wednesday, my parents had come to the village to get their woollen clothes. The accused had an argument with them, after which my sister-in-law asked her son to kill both his grandparents,”she said.Inspector Kulwant Singh, the Samrala station house officer, said two months ago the police had been involved in their family dispute and both parties had been booked under sections of the Code of Criminal Procedure. “The boy knew that his mother had accused her father-in-law of molesting her, which had enraged him,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/double-murders-teen-instigated-by-mother-to-kill-grandparents-for-room-in-ludhiana-village-101635459109413.html

However, those favouring the colour pink, when it comes to sweets, may be doing so to the detriment of their health, officials have said. The health department has banned the use of pink colour in sweets, as it has been established to be a carcinogen, but the practice is still going on unabated across the district. On Thursday, the health department teams destroyed 256kg of pink-coloured sweets, which primarily constituted cham-chams and rasgullas. As per district health officer, Dr Dinesh Garg, while yellow and green colouring has been permitted, pink has been banned. “We have formed separate teams to carry out inspections at processing units. While four teams were formed for the city, one team each is scouting sweet shops in Khanna, Samrala, Piyal, Doraha, Machhiwara and Jodhan.The teams also collected 70 samples from their respective areas and sent them for testing, while rasing awareness among locals and confectioners. A sweet maker, on condition of anonymity, said, “The use of pink colour in ‘cham cham’ has been taking place for ages. This is the first I am hearing of it being toxic to health. Besides, customers prefer coloured sweets over all others.”District Health Officer Dr Rajesh Garg said, “This particular colour is stated as carcinogenic and banned by the government. He also asked people to make sure the chocolates they were purchasing were not expired and had been stored at the recommended temperature.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/while-drooling-over-sweets-beware-of-pink-colour-ludhiana-health-officials-101635458269408.html

A similar incident took place in Haibowal four days ago. Both Cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and his councillor wife Mamta Ashu cannot escape from responsibility as there is rampant corruption in the civic body. The couple are the de facto authority of the municipal corporation, while officials merely act as rubber stamps.” “If the couple can install multiple hoardings to project themselves as custodians of development in the city, then why are they shying away from taking the responsibility for dilapidated condition of roads in the city,’ he said. He also said that Mamta had pretended to take the moral high ground when she had tweeted that illegal hoardings with the photograph of Bharat Bhushan be removed. “It was actually aimed at removing my (Grewal’s) hoardings in the West constituency. Yesterday, during the visit of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, illegal hoardings of the couple dotted the city,” said Grewal.Channi no Aam AadmiGrewal said that chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s common man image was just a publicity stunt as he has been selective in meeting people. Grewal said that before the CM’s scheduled visit, the SAD leaders had sought time to submit a memorandum to CM demanding the arrest of Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) Chief Simarjeet Singh Bains, but we could not meet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-trains-guns-on-bharat-bhushan-ashu-his-wife-over-dilapidated-condition-of-roads-in-ludhiana-101635457789353.html

29-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: New vending zones to come up at sites with higher footfall||To maximise earning potential of street vendors, more vending sites will be created at locations in the city which have higher footfall of potential customers. UT adviser Dharam Pal on Thursday directed the municipal corporation to examine and work on creating alternative sites for the street vendors so that their income increases. Pal said, “We have been receiving number of complaints and representations that the current vending sites are proving to be financially unproductive. There is no point relocating the vendors to sites where footfall is low. We need to create more opportunities for them so that their livelihood is not impacted adversely.” Except for “no vending zones” areas like Sector 17, all other locations in the city will be explored for resettling the vendors, said Pal. Currently, there are 46 earmarked vending zones throughout the city. Notably, the MC recently got approval from the UT urban planning department for 15 new zones to resettle around 1,500 vendors. These include Sectors 19, 20, 24, 41, 45 and 52, Ram Darbar, Manimajra and Mauli Jagran. Of these, maximum vendors will be resettled in Ram Darbar, Manimajra and Mauli Jagran. Earlier, under the policy of resettling street vendors from the city’s markets, the MC with the assistance of the administration had created vending sites across the city. The street vendors from different markets, particularly from the no-vending zones, were moved there. Most of them were moved to these clusters like in Sector 15, but have complained that the financial viability of these sites remain poor. In some cases, the vendors even refused to move to new zones as they contended there was little or no potential of income generation. Around 2,000 street vendors have not even taken possession of the spaces allotted to them. Notably, the issue has come into greater focus in the background of the Covid pandemic, wherein many street vendors lost their livelihood. The issue is also politically sensitive, as both BJP and Congress have regularly sparred over the matter and with MC elections around the corner, it has gained added importance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-new-vending-zones-to-come-up-at-sites-with-higher-footfall-101635456889309.html
29-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana road cave-in: Deep Nagar area has seen four cave-ins in 2 years||Roads in the city are still prone to frequent road cave-ins and the Deep Nagar area has witnessed an astonishing four cave-ins in two years. Two of the incidents, including the one on Thursday, were reported outside the old residence of mayor Balkar Sandhu. On October 24, a man and his son had a narrow escape after their car overturned when a portion of the road caved in at Haibowal. Similarly, the driver of a tipper had a close shave after a major portion of the road collapsed near the cremation ground in Model Town Extension on July 22 and the tipper got stuck in the pit. A large portion of road constructed over five-decade-old brick sewer lines also caved in on October 6 and a truck got stuck in the pit in Guru Nanak Pura near Kailash Chowk.A resident of Deep Naar, Nikhil said that with four incidents reported in the last two years, there is always a fear in the minds of the residents. “The authorities should check water and sewer lines in the entire area, so that no such incident is reported in future. Fortunately, no lives were lost in the incident that took place on Thursday, but others may not be so lucky. Road cave-ins have also been reported in Dugri, Kaka Marriage palace Road, and Model Town Extension. A driver died after a road cave-in incident was reported at Kaka marriage palace road in 2011. In 2013, an 80-ft crater had been formed near the Dhami Eye Hospital after the sewer line collapsed. First focus on basic infrastructure: Smart City DirectorBlaming lack of workmanship in the municipal corporation (MC), one of the directors of Ludhiana Smart City Limited (LSCL) Sanjay Goel said that the department should first focus on developing the basic infrastructure in the city and only then can a smart city be developed.Sarcastic digs abound on social media Soon after the road cave-in was reported in Deep Nagar, residents took to social networking sites to slam authorities over their claims regarding the smart city mission. Taking a sarcastic dig, residents demanded a regular city rather than a smart city where roads cave-in. No equipment to check underground leakage: MCMC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said that there is no technology available to check leakage in the underground water and sewer lines and immediate action is taken whenever residents complain of depressions on roads. A proposal to change the decades old sewer line in different parts of the city is also in the pipeline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-road-cave-in-deep-nagar-area-has-seen-four-cave-ins-in-2-years-101635456470587.html

The only thing they heard before the blackness engulfed them were their own terrified screams. The victims, Mahi Malhotra and Kanav Malhotra, said they had no time to apply brakes as the road suddenly collapsed after the school bus in front of them moved. Mahi said,”Soon after falling into the crater, we blacked out and just remembered screaming. The residents came to our rescue and we were then taken to a house from where our father took us to the hospital.” Their parents, Dr Yogesh Malhotra and Shweta Malhotra, were relieved that their children pulled through the incident without a major injury or worse. They were informed of the incident by a family friend who was passing through the area. The children were asked to rest after their discharge from the hospital where they were provided first aid. The students, who are residents of Chhawni Mohalla, said they did not usually take the Deep Nagar route, but made an exception on the day of the mishap as they were running late. Shweta said,” Usually my husband or I take the kids to school, but they went on their own on Thursday and also took a different route. Fortunately, they did not sustain any serious injury.” The victims’ grandfather, Raj Malhotra, said they have not filed a complaint and are just thankful that the children came out alive from the ordeal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-road-cave-in-heard-our-screams-echoing-before-blacking-out-say-victims-101635455569140.html

29-10-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana Vidhan Sabha jobs: 1 held for issuing fake interview letters||A 28-year-old Ambala resident has been arrested for allegedly issuing fake interview letters for jobs in Haryana Vidhan Sabha. Eight of his accomplices have also been identified. The accused has been identified as Jitender Singh, 28, who operates from an office in Sector-34, Chandigarh. He has been sent to eight-day police custody. Addressing a press conference on Thursday, Haryana Vidhan Sabha speaker Gian Chand Gupta said during the recent recruitment drive, the assembly secretariat busted the gang involved in issuing bogus interview letters. Gupta said a few months ago, the assembly secretariat had issued an advertisement inviting applications to fill posts of reporters (English and Hindi), junior scale stenographers, clerks, telephone attendant, telephone operator, Hindi typist, record restorer and watchmen. “We have arrested the main accused in the case while the other accused have been identified. He was operating from a rented accommodation and had even prepared fake stamps,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Chandigarh. Candidate spilled the beans The matter came to light when a person identified as Neeraj, a resident of Pinjore, approached the Vidhan Sabha secretariat with a fake interview letter for the post of reporter, on October 17. As there was no interview scheduled for Sunday, he was asked to deposit all his documents and asked to come the next day. It was then found that the interview letter had a fake stamp, signature and roll number. Gupta said the assembly secretariat staff then began a discreet inquiry in the matter. After Neeraj disclosed that the forged document was given by his relative, Jitender Singh, the latter was summoned to the Vidhan Sabha for inquiry. Modus operandi After issuing the fake interview letters to the candidates and charging them for it, the accused used to dissuade the candidates from appearing before the authorities on the grounds that the interview was deferred due to Covid-19 pandemic. The accused had prepared three fake identity cards and used to introduce himself either as a Haryana government employee or a PA of a minister. Police said the accused, Jatinder, along with his associates identified as Nikhil Kumar, 30, from Ambala Cantt, Rajiv, 32, from Ambala, Amit, 30, from Yamunanagar, Neeraj alias Shanki, 29, from Naraingarh, Rambir alias Karan Naraingarh, Jasbir, 30, from Ambala Cantt, Rahul from Nariangarh and Sudesh, 47, from Yamunanagar, prepared forged documents including appointment letters, ID cards, roll numbers etc from their office in Sector 34, Chandigarh, where they have sublet cabins in the said SCO. He further said they have taken money from different candidates, who were to appear in different exams i.e. HSSC, police and other departments. Haryana police personnel duped too It came to the fore that the accused had not only extorted money from gullible candidates for appointment in Vidhan Sabha but also in Haryana police. Speaker Gian Chand Gupta said when Jitender was summoned for questioning, he admitted before the authorities that he had been generating fake documents. Gupta said the accused had created fake documents for recruitment in police also and 50-odd admit cards of competitive exams being conducted by Haryana Staff Selection Commission HSSC. Accused had multiple bank accounts The accused used to charge a hefty amount in lieu of getting a government job for the candidates. The accused has six bank accounts and used to charge anywhere between ₹5 lakh to ₹21 lakh. He is believed to have duped about 13 people so far and accumulated nearly ₹75 lakh, which has been recovered. Chandigarh police had registered an FIR on complaint of Sandeep Nandal Marshal, secretary, Haryana Vidhan Sabha, under sections 420, 467,468,471 and 120 B of IPC, in Sector-3 police on October 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-vidhan-sabha-jobs-1-held-for-issuing-fake-interview-letters-101635454549112.html
29-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana road cave-in: Civic body officials’ nonchalance to blame, say residents||The road cave-in at Deep Nagar, which sent three people plunging down a deep chasm, sent shock waves through the city with residents blaming the nonchalance of civic body officials who disregarded their complaints for the mishap. Area residents say the same portion of the road had caved-in when the road was being constructed around six months ago and a tractor-trailer had fallen in the pit. Residents suspect that the sewer lines had been damaged in the incident and the soil below the road had gradually eroded, which caused the cave-in. Sunil, who lives in the area, said, “We had flagged the issue when we noticed a depression on the road, but authorities and the contractor did not check the condition of the water and sewer pipes and reconstructed the road.” Some area residents say that water supply to a house adjoining the cave-in spot had been disrupted and when the owner of the house brought repairmen, they found the portion beneath the road hollow. The owner of the said house, Manjul, said that he had apprised the councillor and MC officials regarding the same, but repair was postponed to Thursday as the work could not be done during the night, but the mishap took place around 8am, before repair work could start. Area councillor Indu Thapar’s husband, Raju Thapar, said they had received no complaint from the residents and no MC employee had been deputed to repair the water supply line in the area. “There might have been some leakage in the sewer lines as it is decades old,” said Thapar.Show cause notices issued Municipal corporation commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal has issued show cause notices to three officials of the bridges and road department for negligence. The notices have been issued to executive engineer Raman Kaushal, sub-divisional officer Sanjeev Kumar and junior engineer Ankush Sharma. The officials have been given two days to submit a reply.In the notices, Sabharwal cited two road cave-in incident, including the one which reported in Deep Nagar on Thursday and the other reported in Haibowal area on October 24 where a man and his son had a narrow escape after their car got stuck in a pit and overturned after the road caved in.He directed officials to properly barricade the area before carrying out repair works.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-road-cave-in-civic-body-officials-nonchalance-to-blame-say-residents-101635454189117.html
29-10-2021||Chandigarh||Second dose of Covid vaccine overdue for 75,526 people in Chandigarh||Around 75,526 people, who have taken their first dose of Covid-19 vaccines from healthcare facilities in Chandigarh, have not turned up to take their second jab even after the completion of the recommended vaccine time gap, the UT health department said on Thursday. Of the total, 75,416 people have been administered the first dose of the Covishield vaccine 16 weeks ago while 110 have taken Covaxin more than 6 weeks ago. Those with overdue vaccines include residents of Chandigarh and migrants who had got their first jab from city vaccination centres. According to the latest electoral list and Central government’s set target, around 8.4 lakh people are to be immunised in Chandigarh. As on Thursday, 9,24,651 (110%) people, including migrants, have taken their first shot in Chandigarh, while 5,38,381 are fully vaccinated. The vaccination drive in Chandigarh is gradually slowing down with the weekly vaccination average dipping as only 3,341 people, on average, were vaccinated with the first and second dose daily for the past one week. On Thursday, only 2,924 doses were administered to people. UT health secretary Yashpal Garg said, “Since 75,526 people had taken the first dose of vaccine, this shows that they are not hesitant to get vaccinated. This is strange that even after recording no severe side effects post immunisation, people are not turning up to take their second dose. As per the Central government’s CoWIN app, these people have missed their second dose despite a reminder message, which is automatically sent to the beneficiary once they are eligible for the second dose.” The UT health department is now telephonically contacting these people and is conducting a special drive to vaccinate them at the earliest. “The UT administration has a sufficient number of vaccines, Covishield in government hospitals and Covaxin in private facilities, and there is no waiting time for getting the vaccination either for the first dose or for the second dose. Also, those who have moved out of Chandigarh after getting their first dose can take their next jab anywhere in the country,” Garg said, while requesting people to come forward for complete vaccination. ‘Second dose important for controlling transmission’ Meanwhile, Dr Suman Singh, director, health services, Chandigarh, said, “The first dose of vaccine helps in building antibodies, but without a booster dose, the antibodies are insufficient to fight the virus, especially with more deadly variants spreading fast. Even in the second wave of the pandemic, people who had just got their first dose were getting infected. The second dose is very important to lower the infection severity and to control the transmission.” “The beneficiaries get a message from the CoWIN app when they get eligible for the second dose and they must end hesitancy and come forward to take the jab. The complete vaccination will increase herd immunity in Chandigarh and will help in averting the third wave of the pandemic, especially when transmission can increase due to the festive season,” she said.

They were asked to sell pure and unadulterated items and also to pay special attention to cleanliness. He said checking was not meant to harass anyone, but to ensure that clean and quality food items were made available to the people. He said in case of non-packaged/loose sweets, container/tray holding sweets at the outlet for sale should display the “best before date” of the product which was made mandatory from October 1, 2020.

29-10-2021||Chandigarh||145 more dengue cases, one death in Chandigarh tricity area||As many as 145 more dengue cases surfaced in the tricity on Thursday, of which a whopping 85 infections came from Mohali. The district also reported one death on the day. Chandigarh reported 39 new cases while Panchkula had 21 fresh infections. Both jurisdictions, however, did not have any new fatalities. The UT has so far recorded 776 dengue cases, of which 692 surfaced in October. Three persons have also succumbed to the disease here. Of the fresh cases, 10 were reported from Daria, followed by seven from Manimajra, 6 from Mauli Jagran, and the rest from other rural and urban areas. In Mohali, the latest dengue victim is 60-year-old male, of Barampura village in Dera Bassi. He was admitted at Max Hospital, Mohali, where he later succumbed. Mohali’s dengue count has now gone up to 2,361 as against 471 in 2020. The district has so far recorded 30 dengue deaths, of which 28 took place this month. This is the highest toll since 2018 when eight people had died. In 2019 and 2020, only one fatality each was confirmed. Panchkula’s case tally stands at 540.

29-10-2021||Chandigarh||Three get life-term for murdering rickshaw puller in Chandigarh||Three men were awarded life-term for the murder of a rickshaw puller near the roundabout of Industrial Area I and II in 2017. The trio has been identified as Kallu, Sunny and Kamlesh alias Rakesh Sharma -- all residents of Sanjay Colony. They had attacked the victim, Sunil Kumar of Sanjay Colony, with sticks on October 1, 2017, leading to his death nine days later.The court of additional district and sessions judge, Narender, while pronouncing the sentence said, “There can be no leniency in case of murder. There is a need for people to control their anger.” The court has also imposed a fine of ₹25,000 on each of the convicts. Victim had told family about attackThe victim’s wife, Sangeeta had told the police that her husband, who was a rickshaw-puller, used to park the three-wheeler at a stand near Tribune Chowk, along with the accused.On October 1, 2017, the accused assaulted him with sticks, following which he was rushed to ESI hospital in Ram Darbar from where he was referred to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, Chandigarh. Police could not record his statement at the time as he was not medically fit. On October 3, the family members forcibly took him home from the hospital. Sangeeta said that on the way back home, her husband had narrated the entire incident to the family and also named the accused. On October 6, Sunil’s condition deteriorated and the family had to rush him to a hospital in Panchkula, from where he was again referred to GMCH, Sector 32, where he succumbed to his injuries on October 10. The family was told that Sunil died of a cardiac arrest but his wife urged the police to look into it. On her complaint, a case under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at the Industrial Area police station. Eyewitness, medical reports helped nail accused Even though the defence counsel had tried to pin the blame on Sunil’s alcoholism, the statement of an eyewitness and the medical report helped prove the trio guilty. Sangeeta had told the police that her husband was a habitual drinker and his hands as well as legs used to tremble. The defence had claimed that the head injury may have been caused due to a fall. The prosecution then produced an eyewitness, who also used to park his rickshaw at the same stand. The eyewitness testified before the court that the trio had assaulted Sunil on October 1. Even the medical records stated that Sunil had died as a result of his head injury.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/three-get-life-term-for-murdering-rickshaw-puller-in-chandigarh-101635453168922.html
29-10-2021||Chandigarh||Diesel price hits a century in Mohali||In a first, diesel rates in Mohali crossed the ₹100-mark on Thursday, leaving residents and filling station owners fuming.What’s adding to their anger is the fact that Mohali’s petrol and diesel rates are the highest in the tricity. While diesel was available for ₹100.18 per litre in Mohali on Thursday, it cost ₹96.73 per litre in Chandigarh and ₹97 per litre in Panchkula.The rate of petrol in Mohali was ₹110.34 per litre while in Chandigarh, it cost ₹104.22 per litre and in Panchkula, it was ₹105 per litre.Citing the increasing cost of fuel and the difference in prices between Punjab and its adjoining states, Petrol Pump Dealers’ Association, Punjab, (PPDAP) had on October 22 announced that it would open petrol pumps only for a single shift for 15 days from November 7.Mohali district petroleum dealers’ association president Ashwinder Singh Mongia said: “Due to the disparity in fuel rates in the tricity, we have lost about 70% of our business. All dealers in Mohali whose pumps are located on the border with Chandigarh have been badly hit. When authorities can bring parity in liquor rates, why not in fuel rates?”What makes fuel so expensive in Mohali is the high rate of taxation in Punjab. The effective value added tax (VAT), including cess, on petrol in Mohali is 31.17%, while in Panchkula, it is 26.25%. In Chandigarh, VAT is 22.45% and there is no additional cess. On diesel, VAT in the three districts is 19.56% , 17.23% and 14.03%, respectively.Such high rates have hit the sales in Mohali drastically. According to figures available with the dealers association, diesel sales have dropped by 70% from 10,000 litres per pump per day in August 2017 to 3,000 litres in September this year.Gopal Krishan, an old car dealer in Mohali, said, “Since the rates of both petrol and diesel are at an all-time high in Mohali, we have been going to Chandigarh to fuel up our vehicles. But the authorities concerned should bring parity in the fuel rates across tricity.”Last year, a businessman who owned three petrol pumps in Mohali had ended his life, citing huge losses being suffered due to the substantial difference in fuel rates. In a letter to the Punjab governor, he had stated that non-revision of VAT in Chandigarh had robbed him of 80% of his business as his pumps were situated on the border.The dealers are also resentful of Chandigarh pumps for putting up hoardings to advertise the cheaper rates. Stating that such boards are illegal, they question why the UT administration has not acted against them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/diesel-price-hits-a-century-in-mohali-101635452748634.html

Punjab Khet Majdoor Union general secretary Lachhman Singh Sewewala said farm labourers would bear the brunt if the laws were implemented. Agriculture expert Devinder Sharma said the Centre was forcing those agricultural acts and reforms, which had been completely rejected and failed globally, on all Indians. “We all failed as a society in understanding the farmer’s plight. Farmers are sitting at borders fighting for not only themselves but for us too,” Sharma said, adding that instead of corporatisation and privatisation of agriculture, co-operative model was far more beneficial. Noted economist Sucha Singh Gill seconded views of Sharma on co-operative model of agriculture and farming needed to be turned into a financially viable and profitable enterprise. State president of BKU (Ugrahan) Joginder Singh said the ongoing protest was not the outcome of any agriculture crisis or economic crisis, but a political crisis in the country. “I advise researchers and experts to fight for the farmers on the ground, carrying fact-based research, with them,” he added. Punjabi University vice-chancellor Arvind and Anupama, coordinator of the seminar, also addressed the gathering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/only-modi-or-shah-can-resolve-stalemate-over-farm-laws-skm-leader-rajewal-101635451849070.html
29-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh terminates services of protesting NHM workers||The UT health department terminated the services of around 180 National Health Mission (NHM) employees after they missed their duties on Thursday to protest against the revised working conditions offered against a salary hike, at Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16.Around 500 NHM employees, working under the UT health department as doctors, paramedical staff, managerial employees, nursing officers, pharmacy officers, auxiliary nurse midwives, lab technicians, dental technicians and other Group-4 staffers, have been working on salaries lower than the approved minimum wages since 2013. Earlier in August, over 300 NHM workers went on an indefinite leave for 12 days to press for equal wages for equal work. Following the continuous protest, the UT administration had given a written assurance of salary hike which read: “Finance department has no objection in meeting the additional expenditure of ₹3.92 crore annually to pay salaries at par with DC rate to NHM workers.”However, two months after the written assurance, the UT health department had on October 26, asked the NHM employees to fill a consent form with revised terms and conditions. As per the new conditions, if NHM employees opt for salaries as per DC rate, their working hours and leaves will be revised. But, if they don’t follow the revised guidelines, (which are being followed by every staff member getting DC rate salaries), they will have to continue with the same salaries.Patient care hitDue to non-availability of NHM workers at the government health and wellness centres, especially in rural areas, the general out-patient department services and Covid vaccination drives were hit. Patient care services were also hit at GMSH-16, and the civil hospitals in Sector 22, 45 and Manimajra.In a notice, UT health secretary Yashpal Garg said, “The NHM staff is insisting on pay equal but don’t want to work for eight hours, as applicable to DC rate staff, and also wants to avail the leaves and benefits applicable under NHM which is not available in case of DC rate staff. The department cannot allow such staff to risk the life of patients, especially when hospitals are full of Covid-19, dengue and malaria patients. To avoid such frequent incidents of indiscipline, we need to deal with it strictly.”Garg said, “The NHM staff, who have not reported for duty on Thursday, are not allowed to join duties again and a process will be initiated to terminate his/her contractual appointment with immediate effect. They will not be allowed to enter the premises of any health facility and in case of any unauthorised entry, appropriate action will be taken as per the law.”“The existing staff should be deputed in shifts and extra duty to overcome the staff shortage. The outsourcing agency is requested to provide staff to substitute the protesting NHM staff. During the process, preference may be given to those 81 outsourced employees who were recruited during the second wave of Covid and have been disengaged recently,” he further ordered.‘Staff to continue strike on Friday’Amit Kumar, general secretary of NHM union, said, “The UT administration has betrayed the health staff.

29-10-2021||Chandigarh||Kejriwal promises dedicated farm policy to boost agri sector in Punjab||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday promised a dedicated farm policy to boost the agriculture sector in Punjab.At the “Kisan naal Kejriwal’ programme held at a resort in Mansa, the AAP supremo said it is a cause of concern that the respective governments failed to address a serious problem like farmer suicide.“The AAP is a votary to grant compensation on the basis of actual cost incurred in a particular crop,” he said, referring to the damage to kharif crops of paddy and cotton due to recent hailstorm and pink bollworm attack.Kejriwal flayed Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi for his government’s failure in deciding compensation to farmers.“Channi visited the affected farmers in Bathinda (on September 26) but reduced it to a photo event as no one has got any assistance from the government. The AAP government in Delhi has been disbursing ₹20,000 per acre for crop losses caused by natural calamities. If voted power in Punjab, we will come with a compensation policy in accordance with the economical investment made by growers and farm labourers,” said Kejriwal.It was Kejriwal’s first visit to the south Malwa region ahead of the Punjab assembly elections.At his interactive session, only select persons were allowed. Media was kept away from the political programme. On the occasion, the Delhi CM said the stubble management has the potential of employment generation in Punjab. “Farmer cooperatives would be formed to tap crop residue-to-energy and other similar ventures. It would eliminate the burden of residue management on farmers and provide additional income. I urge farmers not to take extreme step due to crop loss as our party will table a comprehensive farm policy,” he said.SKM holds protestA group of farmers under the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) staged a protest near the venue. They flayed Kejriwal for interacting with a select audience and said the party leadership did not want to address the grievances of the agrarian community.Kejriwal holds meeting with Mann, Cheema SANGRUR: Earlier in the day, Kejriwal reached Sangrur and held a closed-door meeting with Punjab unit chief Bhagwant Mann, leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema and some party MLAs at Mann’s residence.Kejriwal reached the city railway station at 11am and moved to Mansa after having lunch with Mann’s family.“I have come to Punjab and now going to Mansa to meet farmers. I met Bhagwant Mann’s mother, sister and brother-in-law. We have had makki ki roti and sarson ka saag,” said Kejriwal, who refused to take more questions from the media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kejriwal-promises-dedicated-farm-policy-to-boost-agri-sector-in-punjab-101635450708526.html

The court was hearing an anticipatory bail plea from Ram Rahim in a sacrilege case.On Monday, a Faridkot court had issued production warrants against the dera head. He was summoned in the sacrilege case registered on June 2, 2015, at Bajakhana police station in Faridkot for October 29.During the hearing, state’s advocate general APS Deol had argued that the dera head has emerged as a main conspirator and his custodial interrogation was required. He had also assured that adequate security arrangements would be made to bring him to Faridkot. The government had even submitted that it could even arrange a chopper in view of the law and order issue surrounding him.However, the court did not agree and after the hearing, which lasted till late evening, said that the police can interrogate him in Rohtak jail, if required. The detailed order is awaited.Earlier, appearing for Ram Rahim, senior advocate Vinod Ghai told the court that state’s hurry in bringing him to Punjab is unexplained as the FIR in question was lodged in 2015. The statement, which is being cited as basis for his custodial interrogation, was also obtained in July 2020, he had told court adding that custodial interrogation was not required.He had also argued that the Punjab Police want to arrest him, for which a court order has been obtained seeking his presence. The court could not have ordered production of an accused to facilitate arrest by an investigating agency, he told court.The apprehension about law and order situation, if he is brought to Punjab, was also brought before the court.A total of 36 people were killed in Panchkula alone in the violence reported after dera chief’s conviction on August 25, 2017 in two rape cases.The dera head is lodged in Sunaria jail of Rohtak since August 25, 2017. In 2017, he was awarded 20-year jail term for the rape of two disciples. Subsequently, he has been convicted in murder cases of a journalist, Ram Chander Chhatrapati and Ranjit Singh, a former dera manager, in which life sentence has been awarded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2015-sacrilege-case-punjab-police-can-interrogate-dera-chief-in-rohtak-jail-says-hc-101635450528487.html

He is the principal of Christian Medical College (CMC), Ludhiana, president of Indian Stroke Association and vice-president of World Stroke Organisation.He was addressing a press conference at CMC on Thursday ahead of World Stroke Day. Dr Pandian added that In India, 18 lakh cases of stroke are reported every year and about 22% to 42% of the patients die within a month. Dr Rajeswar, associate professor of neurology; said there are two types of strokes-- ischemic, when there is a blockage to one of the brain arteries, and rupture and leakage of blood from the artery called brain hemorrhage.Stroke signs and symptoms can be recognized using the following acronym: FAST- F- drooping of one side of face, A-arm weakness, S-sudden trouble speaking and T- time to reach a stroke ready hospital, said Dr Vivek Agarwal, assistant professor at division of neurointervention. He added that early treatment is of paramount importance as it can reduce the disability associated with stroke. “Recent advances in stroke treatments have introduced newer treatments like removal of the clots that block the blood supply to the brain by using special stents called clot retrievals. These treatments are now only available at the neuro DSA lab of CMCH,” he added.The risk factors for stroke are high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking, irregular heart rhythm, excess alcohol intake, obesity, lack of physical activity and unhealthy diet, said Dr Vineet Jaison, associate professor of neurology. Stroke is preventable in 80% cases and screening for high blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol annually is important. Control of all risk factors with regular exercise and a healthy diet can lead to prevention of stroke, said Dr Pandian. Dr. William Bhatti, director of CMC, appreciated the efforts of the neurology department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/strokes-are-preventable-and-treatable-says-experts-from-cmch-101635450356892.html

These men are not even allowing the petitioner to meet his wife, minor children and other sewadars of the gurdwara, who have been detained on the premises in connivance with the police, according to a plea by Narbir Singh, who said he was the chief sewadar at the Gurdwara since 2019.The plea says the gurdwara is of immense historic significance as during the lifetime of 6th Guru Hargobind Singh, his lieutenant took refuge at this place.On the night of October 16, 15-20 armed men entered the gurdwara. They are with dubious and criminal antecedents. Since then his family and some sewadars are captive, the plea alleges, adding that the illegal act was aided by the local police. The petitioner had also submitted CCTV footage of the night when incident took place.“The case reflects the state of complete anarchy in Punjab, wherein the unholy nexus between dreaded criminals and law enforcement agencies is writ large,” the plea claims, adding that the Patti assembly segment shares International Border with Pakistan. It is not only a matter of clandestine taking over of the gurdwara with the aid of the police, but could also be of great national security implications, the plea further claims.The high court has sought response by November 10 and asked the authorities that it be ensured that basic amenities be provided to the family members of the petitioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-seeks-punjab-s-response-over-illegal-takeover-of-patti-gurdwara-101635450168471.html

According to some media reports, Sarabjit is allegedly behind taking Lakhbir from Cheema village to the Singhu border.Punjab director general of police (DGP) Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota constituted the SIT under the chairmanship of Varinder Kumar, additional director general of police (ADGP)-cum-director bureau of investigation (BOI), Punjab. Deputy inspector general of police (DIG-Ferozepur) Inderbir Singh and senior superintendent of police (SSP) Harvinder Singh Virk are members of the team. The team was formed after victim Lakhbir Singh’s sister Raj Kaur alleged that her brother was “allured by some unknown persons and taken to Singhu border”. Talking to HT over phone, the ADGP said so far they have not found “any concrete” evidence to establish who were behind sending Lakhbir to the Singhu border. “It seems he (Lakhbir) went there with someone, most probably, but we can’t make any concrete comment in this regard.” When asked how much time it will take to conclude the probe, he said: “It can take time as it is a complicated puzzle.”Sarabjit is a member of Baba Aman Singh’s Nihang sect, who is in controversy ever since his pictures with Union agriculture minister Narendra Tomar went viral. In the same pictures is Gurmeet Singh Pinky, former controversial Punjab Police cop. Sarabjit is so far, out of the SIT radar. When asked if the SIT has applied for Sarabjit’s production warrant, the ADGP said: “We haven’t done anything in this regard. For now, we are following some other leads.” It was also alleged by some anonymous people of Cheema village in some media reports that they had seen Sarabjit in Dhan Dhan Baba Sheikh Brahm Peer Ji Gaushala (cowshed) situated on the village outskirts. The police had also taken into their possession the cowshed’s CCTV footage.“No arrest has been made in the case, but we rounded up several people for questioning,” the ADGP said, adding “We have not found anything suspicious in the CCTV footage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-sit-fails-to-find-any-leads-in-conspiracy-behind-singhu-lynching-101635449749688.html

Before launch, a ‘paath’ (recitation) of the Sukhmani Sahib was held at the party’s state headquarters in the city to commemorate the 400th birth anniversary of the ninth Sikh master Guru Tegh Bahadur. Union cabinet minister for jal shakti and election in-charge of the party for Punjab, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, launched the campaign. In an exercise, largely seen as perception management, the BJP got a large number of its Sikh leaders to attend the launch. Later, the party machinery ensured that pictures of these leaders were widely circulated to indicate its presence in the Sikh community. For almost a year, however, there has been a huge backlash, on the ground, against the party from the community for the revocation of farm laws.Addressing a press conference later, Shekhawat said the BJP will give citizens a drug-free and mining mafia free Punjab. “The BJP will contest on all 117 assembly seats. Punjabis are disgruntled with the miserable performance of the Akalis, the Congress and the AAP and these parties will be routed,” the Union minister said. On the farm stir, he said, “Eleven rounds of talks have been held with the farm unions and the government took the extra step of stalling the laws for 18 months. Our initiative to address the issue can never be doubted. Our doors are always open.” He evaded comment on the party’s response if the farm unions escalated their stir, and the possibility of any alliance with former chief minister Capt Amarinder’s new party, when launched. ‘MODI GOVT HAS ACHIEVED A LOT FOR PUNJAB’He added that ensuring justice for 1984 anti-Sikh riot victims through a SIT; the abolition of a blacklist of Sikhs allowing them to reconnect to families; the opening of the Kartarpur Corridor; the removal of GST on items meant for langar at the Golden Temple; Bathinda AIIMS and the Amritsar IIM as achievements of the Modi government for Punjab and the Sikh community. On the Centre’s decision to increase the territorial jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF) in Punjab, he said, “Few political parties are saying that it is an attack on our federal structure. If the earlier jurisdiction of 15km was not an attack on the federal structure, how is 45km an attack?” He added that national security can never be compromised, with the Centre aware of the challenges of drug smuggling and drones carrying weapons that the border state faced. The co-incharges for Punjab polls Union urban development and petroleum minister, Hardeep Singh Puri; Union minister of state for foreign affairs, Meenakshi Lekhi, and Lok Sabha MP from Gujarat, Vinod Chawra, were also present. Puri said the PM has special affection and love for Punjab, particularly for the Sikh community. Later, Puri and Shekhawat held meetings with constituency in-charges.

29-10-2021||Lucknow||Live-in relationships part of life: Allahabad high court||PRAYAGRAJ: The Allahabad high court has said that live-in relationships had become part and parcel of life and were required to be viewed through the lens of personal autonomy rather than the notions of social morality. The Bench of justices Pritinker Diwaker and Ashutosh Srivastava made the observation while disposing of petitions filed by two interfaith live-in couples. The two couples filed separate petitions, alleging that the families of the girls were interfering in their day-to-day life. One petition was filed by Shayara Khatun and her partner of Kushi Nagar (both major and in live-in-relationship for the past more than two years) and another by Zeenat Parveen and her partner of Meerut (both major and in a live-in relationship for past one year). It was also stated that they approached the concerned police authorities, but did not get any help and consequently, their life and liberty were undermined. The court at the outset underscored that the right to life enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution of India was liable to be protected at all costs and further went on to observe thus: “Live-in-relationships have become part and parcel of life and stand approved by the Hon’ble Apex Court. Live-in relationship is required to be viewed through the lens of personal autonomy arising out of the right to live guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, rather than notions of social morality.” The court said that the police authorities were obligated to protect the rights of the petitioners. Therefore, the court ordered that in the event the petitioners approached the police authorities concerned, complaining of any threat to their life and liberty, the police shall perform duties as expected under law. The order was given on October 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/livein-relationships-part-of-life-allahabad-high-court-101635449449557.html
29-10-2021||Chandigarh||Capt’s meeting with Amit Shah on farmers’ stir postponed||ChandigarhFormer Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday to discuss possible solutions to the ongoing farmers’ agitation was postponed. The two-time former CM, who was scheduled to meet the Union home minister with a non-political delegation of agriculture experts and agriculturists from Punjab at 6.30pm, reached Delhi on Wednesday evening. He was, however, informed about the postponement in the morning on Thursday. “The meeting was postponed as Shah had to leave for Gujarat,” said a person privy to Capt’s efforts to resolve the standoff between the Centre and farmer unions, and was part of the delegation. An aide of the former CM said no fresh date has been given for the meeting. Amarinder, who was made to resign as the CM following months of tussle and turbulence in the Punjab Congress, has already announced that he is launching his own party. He had earlier said that any seat sharing arrangement with the BJP for the Punjab elections would be subject to a resolution of the farmers’ issue in their interest. He is, however, still to quit the Congress. On Wednesday, the two-time former CM said he had been discussing various options with the Union home minister and others for resolution of the standoff. “I think I can help in finding a solution as I have been the chief minister of Punjab and am also an agriculturist,” he told reporters at a press conference in Chandigarh on Wednesday. While there could be no pre-decided formula for the resolution of the farmers’ stir, something would emerge during the talks as both sides, the central government and farmers, want a resolution to the crisis triggered by the farm laws, he said, clarifying that he had not met any farmer leader. Amarinder also said he had deliberately not intervened in the matter as the farmers did not want politicians involved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capts-meeting-with-amit-shah-on-farmers-stir-postponed-101635449388593.html

29-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ellenabad bypoll: Abhay Chautala eyeing third victory amid stir against Centre’s farm laws||The Ellenabad bypoll, which is scheduled for October 30, seems to have become more of a prestige issue for the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) as compared to the ruling BJP-JJP coalition and the Congress.After Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait, who is one of the leading faces of the farm agitation, in an indirect reference asked people at the Nathusari Chopta village rally on Wednesday to support INLD nominee Abhay Singh Chautala, the leader’s prospects of winning seem brighter than that of BJP’s Gobind Kanda and Congress candidate Pawan Beniwal, say experts.Four-time MLA Abhay is aiming for a bypoll victory hat-trick as he is contesting his third bypoll from Ellenabad.He had won the Rori bypoll in 2000 and from Ellenabad in 2010 after his father OP Chautala had resigned from here as he won from two seats - Ellenabad and Uchana Kalan in Jind - in 2009 assembly polls.If Abhay wins again, he will level the record of his father Om Prakash Chautala and his grandfather late Devi Lal, who had both won three bypolls in their political career.Former deputy prime minister Devi Lal had won three bypolls - Sirsa in 1959, Rori in 1974 and Meham in 1985, while OP Chautala had emerged a winner from Ellenabad in 1970 bypoll, Darba in 1990 and Narwana in 1993.The 1970 bypoll in Ellenabad was necessitated after OP Chautala had challenged the 1968 assembly election in the Supreme Court (SC) which he had lost to Vishal Haryana Party’s Chand Khod.The SC had declared the 1968 assembly result of Ellenabad void, resulting in poll in 1970 which was won by OP Chautala by defeating independent candidate P Raj. Khod had not been in the fray.Abhay has an upper hand: ExpertsThe bypoll which was necessitated after Abhay had resigned from the state assembly on January 27 after the Republic Day violence in support of farmers, will depict the real mood of the agrarian community against the Centre’s three farm laws, say experts.Of total 211 booths in Ellenabad constituency, 178 are in rural areas and result of the bypoll will give a true picture of the simmering anger against the rulling BJP-JJP over these laws.Maharshi Dayanand University’s (MDU) Prof Rajender Sharma said, “Abhay’s prospects are better this time. This is because there is an internal rift in Congress, while BJP is facing the heat of the farmers’ agitation against the three farm laws.”“After Tikait extended support to Abhay, it is clear that the farm group will back the INLD leader and the ‘anti-farmer’ sentiments will go towards the BJP candidate. Every bypoll depicts the performance of the ruling government and it is important for the BJP-JJP as they had lost the Baroda bypoll a year ago,” he said.“In this election, it is interesting that there is fight for the first three positions. This bypoll will reflect the farmers’ anger against the ruling party, besides the impact of unemployment. This election is important for the INLD to give confidence to its workers that there’s still space for them in the state politics,” he added.Retired political science professor Anant Ram said the main battle is being fought between the BJP and the INLD.“The ruling government made all attempts to give a tough challenge to INLD’s Abhay Chautala. The Congress’ campaign remained slow as most of the MLAs associated with the Hooda camp stayed away and state party chief Kumari Selja tried to utilise maximum of her available supporters,” Ram said.“This constituency has 35% Jat voters while the BJP has relied on non-Jat voters by pitching Gobind Kanda. The results will depict the performance of the BJP-JJP government, the farm laws’ impact and outcome of caste polarisation methodology,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ellenabad-bypoll-abhay-chautala-eyeing-third-victory-amid-stir-against-centre-s-farm-laws-101635449269546.html
29-10-2021||Chandigarh||A day after Capt announces to form new party, Channi meets Rahul||Chandigarh Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi met Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in Delhi on Thursday amid apprehensions about the fallout of his predecessor Capt Amarinder Singh’s plans to form a separate party in next few days. The meeting at the former party president’s residence that lasted close to two-and-a-half hours was also attended by All India Congress Committee general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal and newly appointed Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Chaudhary. Rahul took feedback from the CM on the steps being taken to keep the flock together, besides discussing the strategy for the assembly polls in the wake of the two-time former CM’s announcement to field candidates in all the 117 seats, a person privy to the developments said. Channi’s meeting with the central leadership came a day after Amarinder confirmed that he is launching his new party and only waiting for the Election Commission to approve its name and symbol. The former CM, who is still to quit the Congress, also said at a press conference that some leaders from the Congress were in touch with him. The Congress leadership is wary of party leaders, who have been close to Amarinder, joining him and has reached out to several such leaders. Rahul held separate meetings with four MLAs Balbir Singh Sidhu, Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi, Sunder Sham Arora and Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, who were ministers in the Amarinder government and got dropped in the new dispensation, on Tuesday, telling them that they were not included in the Channi cabinet to give opportunity to other legislators. Amarinder had resigned as the Punjab chief minister on September 18 amid a tussle with Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu and rebellion by several ministers and MLAs. Channi is also learnt to have briefed the central leaders about the welfare measures taken by his government. Jakhar’s dig at Channi’s Delhi trip, Kejriwal responds with smiley Former Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar took a dig at Channi’s frequent trips to the national capital. “Punjab CM in Delhi, Delhi CM in Punjab, yet again! Must say, at least one of them has got his timing right,” he tweeted. The post elicited an instant response from AAP national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal who responded with a smiley on Twitter. Kejriwal is on his fourth trip to the poll-bound state in two months. Former Akali leader joins Cong Punjab Rifle Association vice-president and former Akali Dal leader Parminder Singh Brar joined the Congress. He joined the party in Delhi in Venugopal’s presence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/a-day-after-capt-announces-to-form-new-party-channi-meets-rahul-101635449208479.html

Notwithstanding, people are setting up unauthorised stalls at various locations, especially chowks and along roads and footpaths. The corporation has also filed police complaints against the owners of illegal firecracker stalls.”Last year, setting up firecracker stalls was not permitted due to Covid-19 restrictions. This year, the state and PMC have eased the norms and allowed the bursting of firecrackers during Diwali.

Both performers and audiences are eagerly awaiting the return of these customary early morning cultural events during Diwali however auditoriums and theatres will have to follow the Covid-19 protocol of 50% capacity as per state government guidelines. Still, several programme organisers have announced Diwali pahat functions from November 1 to 6 at Balgandharva Rang Mandir, Yeshwantrao Chavan Natyagruha and Ganesh Kala Krida Sankul in the city.Satish Desai, one of the oldest organisers of Diwali pahat, said, “We are happy to hold an actual event and the audience response to the announcement has been enthusiastic. We are going to have gayan (singing) by Hindustani classical singer Rahul Deshpande and despite the government guidelines of 50% capacity, we are looking at a full house.”Sunil Mahajan, another organiser of Diwali pahat, will hold a unique event on November 5 at ShivShrushti. “I have planned an entire event to showcase the historical moments during the Chhatrapati Shivaji era, complete with Mavalas, Mardani khel etc.,” Mahajan said.Manisha Nischal’s production company, Mehak, has been holding Diwali pahats for six years. “It feels good to be creating a live event and the enthusiasm of the audience and music lovers is overwhelming.

29-10-2021||Lucknow||BJP sends Diwali gifts to its 30 lakh booth-level workers||LUCKNOW: This Diwali is going to be special for more than 30 lakh booth level workers of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Uttar Pradesh (UP). To keep its cadre in good humour ahead of the 2022 UP elections that are just a couple of months away, and to emphasise the importance of booth-level management, the BJP has decided to send attractive gift boxes to them. These gift boxes would contain sweets, door hangings and earthen lamps shaped like lotus. “It’s our parampara (tradition) to gift people on Diwali,” said UP BJP vice president Vijay Bahadur Pathak. Asked if this was the first time the party remembered its booth level workers, he said, “We are a cadre-based party. So naturally, this time too we are connecting with our cadre on the auspicious occasion of Diwali.” A booklet containing various development schemes of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath was also being distributed to the workers so that it acted as a ready reckoner in explaining schemes to the people, party leaders said. The BJP has also decided to light nine lakh earthen lamps in Ayodhya, one each for as many beneficiaries of the government’s free housing scheme in urban areas of the state. Another 45 lakh earthen lamps are to be lit for as many beneficiaries of housing scheme (both urban and rural) across the state. During his visit to Lucknow for inauguration of the urban conclave, Modi had tasked the BJP unit with lighting earthen lamps for beneficiaries of housing scheme.

29-10-2021||Lucknow||UP govt to promote associate profs to professors||The Uttar Pradesh government has decided to promote associate professors to professors in government colleges and government-aided colleges, on Thursday, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma announced.Till now, associate professors of colleges were not getting promoted to the post of professor, prompting them to go to other states. “It was a long-pending demand of the teaching community, which the department under the direction of CM Yogi Adityanath fulfilled today,” Sharma said.When asked if the step was taken in view of the upcoming Assembly elections, he answered in negative. He said because of the many measures to bring a qualitative change to education in UP, which before 2017 was accorded ‘C’ grade by the Centre, it has now got ‘A’ grade. The move, according to Sharma, is a way to improve education quality in the state.The announcement will come into effect with the issue of a notification and it is in accordance with norms of the University Grants Commission (UGC), he said. “The benefit of this arrangement will be admissible to such associate professors, who fulfil the prescribed qualifications on and after the date of issue of the mandate,” said Sharma.More than 4,000 associate professors of about 500 colleges will be able to get the benefit of promotion to the post of professor under the career advancement scheme.Apart from the benefit of promotion to the post of professor, the way has been paved for college teachers to get appointments on the basis of the post of professor in other higher institutions. The decision was welcomed by the teacher fraternity.Maulendu Mishra, professor, Lucknow Christian Degree College, said, “The decision to promote teachers is a commendable step by the government. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath and deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma must be lauded.”Talking about steps taken to strengthen the education infrastructure in the state, Sharma said that the setting up of 12 new state universities is under progress. Besides, 77 degree colleges and 250 new secondary schools have been opened. The process is also on to recruit retired teachers in higher education institutes on a contractual basis to fill vacancies, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-govt-to-promote-associate-profs-to-professors-101635448069600.html
29-10-2021||Pune||PMC order: Masks compulsory in all offices; firms to ensure staff fully vaxed||PUNE The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has made wearing the face mask mandatory for staff and visitors in all government and private offices, along with industries. The PMC issued an order on Thursday stating this, while also instructing those in charge of offices to get staff fully vaccinated on priority and take the responsibility of acquiring vaccination certificates. As per the order, the civic body has asked offices to appoint an officer to ensure compliance to these guidelines. The PMC has also given authority to senior civic officials to fine those in violation of these rules. “These rules will be applicable in the limits of PMC from October 28,” PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar said in the order. Although the Covid positivity rate in PMC limits has dropped drastically in the past few weeks, heavy crowds on streets and reopening of offices and other establishments at full capacity poses a danger of a surge in cases in view of a lack of Covid-appropriate behaviour, experts have said. Experts have warned about flouting Covid-preventive behaviour and emphasised maximum vaccination coverage. “Currently there are serious lapses in Covid preventive norms. As cases have gone down, there is less fear of the virus. Many countries in the world are experiencing a surge in Covid cases because of the new variants and that’s why compliance to Covid prevention norms are necessary. There is huge crowding on roads and markets now and absolute lack of Covid- appropriate behaviour. We may see a surge in Covid cases post Diwali,” said Dr Avinash Bhondwe, family physician and former Maharashtra head of the Indian Medical Association (IMA). He also mentioned that people should be encouraged to get the second vaccine dose. “We had seen this at the time of swine flu as well. People don’t care about getting the jab once the infection rate goes down. We should remember that, in terms of Covid preventive vaccines, only first dose is not of much use and both doses are essential in building immunity. So, second dose should be taken on time without delay,” said Dr Bhondwe. In rural parts of the district, the Pune Zilla Parishad has also decided to step up its vaccination drive.

Shah, who was the UP BJP in-charge in 2014 Lok Sabha polls and 2017 UP elections when the party scripted a miraculous turnaround, is scheduled to spend Friday night possibly at the BJP’s state headquarters in Lucknow that too was refurbished under his watch. Soon after arriving in the state capital, Shah will launch the membership campaign from Defence Expo grounds, Vrindavan Yojana and is set to address Shakti Kendra in charges of Awadh region. “He would also flag off LED campaign vehicles for 2022 UP polls,” party’s co-media in-charge Abhay Pratap Singh said. After that, he is scheduled to visit the Indira Gandhi Pratisthan where he would hold meetings, consulting Lok Sabha in charges in 2019 general election when the party won 64 out of 80 seats in the state. The BJP had won these seats despite an alliance between the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP)—the reason why meeting with 2019 Lok Sabha in-charges was listed prominently in Shah’s Friday itinerary, party leaders indicated. There are expectations that BJP might deny tickets to several of its sitting lawmakers in UP and party leaders indicated that during his meetings, Shah would also clear the air on the subject. “The LS poll in charges would have an in-depth view of things. They have on-the-ground estimate of how we did well despite a tough caste arithmetic that the coming together of SP-BSP presented before us in 2019 LS polls. That’s why his meeting with them would be important because he would surely base his campaign strategy, either wholly or in part, on the basis of his meetings with them,” a BJP leader said. BJP’s election panel chief Dharmendra Pradhan, state chief Swatantra Dev, general secretary (organization) Sunil Bansal and UP incharge Radha Mohan Singh among others, would be present in the meetings. Poll in charges for each assembly segment in 2022 UP polls are also scheduled to meet Shah. Amit Shah is also scheduled to hold meetings with chief minister Yogi Adityanath and senior ministers. Asked about his agenda on Saturday, BJP leaders said that it was still not finalized.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/amit-shah-arrives-in-lucknow-today-to-finalise-blue-print-of-party-s-mission-2022-101635447588336.html

Gosavi was however arrested in connection with a ₹3.09 lakh cheating case lodged in 2018 by the Faraskhana police. According to Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta, so far police from other cities have not approached the Pune police for his custody. “There is no such demand yet (from Mumbai Police or any other agency) to handover Kiran Gosavi to them. They can approach the court if they want it as part of procedure,” said Gupta. On being asked if the arrest of Gosavi by Pune police can be attributed to a political fallout between the state government and the Centre, especially since the case he has been arrested in is four-years old, the commissioner said, “There is no politics involved in this matter.” Gosavi, according to officials, was on the run under the alias Sachin Patil, staying at various places including Lucknow, Jabalpur, Hyderabad, and Fatehpur. “At these places, Gosavi was projecting himself as member of the ‘Stop Crime NGO’ and CIBCA detective agency. He was also claiming to run an export-import business,” said Gupta. Gosavi was detained from a lodge in Katraj at around 3:30 am by the anti-extortion cell of the Pune Police. “We were searching for him based on social media photos. Based on inputs, we detained him at the Katraj lodge,” said Gupta. Pune police have already filed a chargesheet in May 2019 in the cheating case. Police have already arrested Gosavi’s assistant Sherbano Kureshi in connection with the cheating case filed by one Chinmay Deshmukh, who had alleged that Gosavi cheated him of ₹3.09 lakh under the pretext of providing him a job in Malaysia in the hotel industry. Kureshi received the money in her account. A lookout circular to prevent Gosavi from leaving the country was also issued by the police. Gosavi had been reportedly claiming on some news channels that he would surrender before the police in connection with the case. Earlier on Monday, Pune police said had formed at least two teams to trace Gosavi, with one team being sent to Lucknow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/gosavi-arrested-by-pune-police-in-2018-cheating-case-also-witness-in-aryan-khan-case-101635447408472.html

For the first time in Punjab, three new roads will come parallel to the existing routes of Ambala-Zirakpur (40km), Amritsar-Bathinda (155km) and Mohali-Sirhind (27km). All these roads are part of the nationwide Bharatmala Pariyojana. The cost of these projects, which have a completion deadline of three years when started in 2022, is ₹40,000 crore, including land compensation of ₹12,000 crore. “NHAI surveys show that 22,000 acre land will be acquired for these expressway projects,” said RP Singh, NHAI’s project head in Punjab. There are 13 more expressway projects, including seven bypasses to take out traffic from within the main cities of Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Amritsar, Patiala, Malout, Mandi Dabwali and Phagwara. The 6-lane Patran-Gurdaspur road (397 km), a part of Delhi-Katra expressway project, which will cut diagonally across the state is another key part of the project, as it will connect the state’s major destinations. Depending on traffic density, these expressways have been planned to be 4 or 6 lanes, to be built at an elevation from 3-4m above the ground for uninterrupted traffic flow. Toll tax will be imposed on these proposed expressways however there will be no collection barriers as in case of the existing highways. “These expressways will push development in the state as the average speed of the transport shall almost be doubled to 100-120 km per hour. The access-controlled expressway will neutralise the locational disadvantage of state in terms of distance from the ports thus giving a boost to agri-marketing and commercial enterprises,” said Kahan Singh Pannu, NHAI’s adviser for projects in Punjab, adding that fatal road mishaps which claim 12 lives per day in the state will reduce with these roads, as high-speed vehicles and large size goods vehicles will shift there. On a section of farmers claiming that compensation pai to them for their land was low, Pannu said that the matter was in the knowledge of the NHAI and will be resolved shortly. The major brown field projects ( there are 9 in this category) are Amritsar-Hoshiarpur, Bathinda-Malout and Phagwara-Hoshiarpur.

29-10-2021||Lucknow||Air quality worsens in UP cities as winter knocks on doors||Poor air quality has returned to Uttar Pradesh cities with the drop in average day temperatures and increased human activity, if the Air Quality Index (AQI) figures of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) are anything to go by.All major cities in Uttar Pradesh have recorded an increase of an average of 100 units in AQI, reflective of the air quality of a particular region, in a month. According to the data, Agra recorded an AQI of 272 on Thursday up from 58 on October 1. Ghaziabad recorded an AQI of 290, up from 138 in the same time span. Kanpur, Meerut, Moradabad, Prayagraj, Varanasi and Gorakhpur all recorded a considerable rise in AQI value. AQI over 200 is considered poor with adverse impact on human health on long-term exposure.The state capital Lucknow on Thursday recorded an AQI of 179 up from 71 recorded at the start of this month. Within the city, Gomti Nagar and Talkatora recorded the worst air quality with AQI hovering around 300. In these parts of the cities, the major pollutants remained particulate matter 2.5 and 10.According to experts, the drop in average day temperatures, caused by the onset of winter and increased human activity with relaxation in Covid-19 curfew, are major contributors behind the depleting air quality. In the last 30 days, the average day temperatures dropped by 10 degrees across Uttar Pradesh.“Winter poses a particular challenge for particulate matter in the air to settle down due to dense air. This leads to air pollution that is reflected in higher AQI values,” said environmentalist Dinesh Srivastav.Poor air quality is expected to worsen in the coming days with a further drop in temperatures and increase in farm activity, especially the burning of paddy stubble.Considering the depleting air quality, authorities are set to enforce the graded response action plan (GRAP). “GRAP will result in stricter restrictions on various activities like construction, industrial activities and others to limit air pollution. We are monitoring the situation and stricter measures will be taken as and when required,” said Ajay Sharma, member secretary, Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/air-quality-worsens-in-up-cities-as-winter-knocks-on-doors-101635447228173.html

Under this initiative, till October 19, 2021, around 64% of the eligible persons had been administered the first dose of the vaccine while 19% had been administered both doses. Out of 100 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses administered in the country, UP alone accounts for an impressive 12.23 crore doses, officials added.Now, after reviewing the vaccination progress till October 2021, a need for additional efforts has been felt to help meet the target. For this, while the ongoing initiatives of fixed booths, cluster approach and mega vaccination days etc will continue as before, efforts to ensure 100% administration of second doses will be made. The effort will be to focus on villages where the first dose was given using the cluster approach and the second dose will now be administered using Cluster Model 2.0.Additional chief secretary, medical and health, Amit Mohan Prasad, has sent a missive dated October 23 to all district magistrates and chief medical officers (CMOs) in this regard specifying the approach to be taken under Cluster Model 2.0.“All districts will now undertake an assessment using the survey approach in all its revenue villages through tehsildars to assess the administration of the first dose of the vaccine to get reliable figures. Based on these numbers, the villages will be divided into three groups: Those having 95% or more administration of the first dose, those with 80% to 85% administration of the first dose and those with less than 80% administration of the first dose. Based on this list, vaccinations will be prioritised,” informed a senior state health department official.As part of this initiative, mobilisers like ASHA and Anganwadi workers etc will identify individuals who have failed to take the first dose of the vaccine and will motivate such people to get it administered. The progress of this task will be assessed each evening at block development level, he added.Besides honouring Gram Pradhans which attain 100% first-dose vaccination, for urban areas special vaccination rounds with flexi-timings would also be organised to help working people get the jab outside routine working hours also. Every district will also have at least one fixed vaccination session lasting from 8am to 10pm in two shifts at the district hospital, medical colleges etc, says the missive, a copy of which is with HT.“A three-day, door-to-door survey to identify people who have not got their first or second dose of Covid-19 vaccination is already underway in the district as per the state government’s orders. Based on that data, people who have not got the first dose till now, would be targeted and motivated to get it between November 1 and November 15,” said CMO, Prayagraj, Dr Nanak Saran.“Our efforts will be to ensure that all eligible individuals get their first dose during this time in the entire district even as we motivate people to take their second jab too,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid19-vaccination-coverage-up-to-implement-cluster-model-2-0-to-amplify-vax-drive-101635446749806.html

29-10-2021||Delhi||Low temperature, slow winds, stubble burning to worsen Delhi's air quality||Weather forecasters have said that the city is headed for a further deterioration in pollution levels in the coming days under the impact of low temperatures, slow winds and an increase in stubble burning instances in Punjab and Haryana.At least seven of 34 localities in Delhi where air quality is monitored by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recorded ‘very poor’ air quality on Thursday.CPCB recordings show that the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi on Thursday was 268, in the ‘poor’ category. This was a dip from Wednesday’s 232, which was also categorised as ‘poor’ in the AQI scale.On Thursday, pollution monitoring stations at Shadipur, NSIT Dwarka, Bawana, Pusa, Mundka, Anand Vihar and Dilshad Garden showed ‘very poor’ AQI levels.Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that pollution levels are likely to rise further in the coming days and reach the ‘very poor’ zone.“The temperatures are dropping and the local wind speeds are also low, which is not conducive for pollution dispersion. Currently, Delhi is also receiving winds from the northwest direction, where states such as Punjab and Haryana are reporting a rise in stubble fires. All this combined together will adversely impact Delhi’s air,” said a senior Met official.Air quality forecasting systems have also predicted bad air days for Delhi. Union ministry of earth science’ air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) showed that on Thursday 502 stubble fires were reported from parts of Punjab and Haryana and these contributed to 19% of Delhi’s PM 2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres).Meanwhile, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology’s decision support system said that on Friday, the share of stubble fires in Delhi’s air will be as much as 50%. Local factors such as vehicular emissions are likely to contribute to around 20% of the city’s PM 2.6 level and road dust and construction activities are expected to contribute to around 2-4% each.Forecasters also said that the dropping temperatures will also result in pollutants getting stuck closer to the surface. IMD recordings showed that at the Safdarjung weather station, which is the official marker for the city, the maximum temperature was 28.5 degrees Celsius, three degrees below what is considered normal for this time of the year. The minimum temperature was 14.6 degrees Celsius, a notch below normal.“On Friday and Saturday, temperatures are likely to fall marginally and after that because of a passing western disturbance, temperatures will stabilise. With western disturbance, however, winds tend to slow down and this will impact the air quality,” said Mahesh Pawalat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change) at the Skymet Weather Services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/low-temperature-slow-winds-stubble-burning-to-worsen-delhi-air-quality-101635444888031.html

The bulletin features the daily farm fire count, the daily Air Quality Index (AQI), meteorological conditions and forecast for the next day by both the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM).
29-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Diesel gensets banned as AQI tanks||The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Thursday banned the use of diesel generator sets and ordered enhancing of parking fee by up to four times in Delhi-NCR, measures listed under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) when the air quality hits ‘very poor’, according to an official order.Though the air quality in Delhi is yet to hit ‘very poor’ category (when average AQI is between 200 and 300) this month, pollution levels have escalated fast since Monday when the city reported an AQI of 82 (in the satisfactory category) to 268 (poor category) on Thursday.HT reported on Tuesday that according to an assessment by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Delhi is headed towards an air emergency as stubble fires are expected to peak -- coinciding with Diwali (to be celebrated on November 4), when pollution levels usually spike because of large-scale bursting of firecrackers despite a ban.According to the CPCB order, the implementation of Grap measures under ‘very poor’ category were ordered to be enforced after a meeting convened by a sub-committee of the Commission for Air Quality Management in Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas (CAQM) concluded that the air quality in the city is set to deteriorate in the coming days and hit dangerous levels.“Actions under ‘very poor’ category, in addition to steps listed under the ‘poor to moderate’ AQI category should be implemented with immediate effect in Delhi-NCR,” the CPCB order read.Besides ban on diesel gensets and increase in parking fee, other measures that will come into force include ban on the use of coal and wood in restaurants and open kitchens and augmentation of bus and Metro services.These measures will be in addition to the steps that were enforced on October 18 listed under ‘moderate to poor’ category such as ban on firecrackers, stopping burning of garbage, mechanised sweeping of roads, sprinkling of water on unpaved roads and strict implementation of the PUC norms for vehicles.On October 18, three days after its usual commencement date, the CPCB called into force the GRAP, and said that the measures listed under the ‘moderate to poor’ air quality section of the emergency plan should be immediately put into place by the Capital’s agencies, irrespective of the daily AQI readings.Prashant Gargava, chairperson of the sub-committee on Grap, and member secretary, CPCB, told HT that conditions were expected to become worse in the coming days, with north-westerly winds bringing high load of pollutants from stubble fires in Punjab and Haryana. This is coinciding with a drop in the temperature that makes dispersal of pollutants difficult. “Therefore, we have decided to enforce measures under the ‘very poor’ category of Grap,” said Gargava, adding that citizens will be asked to take certain measures such as providing electric heaters to security guards to stop them for burning biomass to keep themselves warm.In a statement the CAQM said, “Grap is in place and under implementation. A statutory sub-committee including experts has been constituted for its operationalisation and issuing necessary orders. The Grap specifically provides for the action to be taken by various agencies responsible for implementation under different AQI categories: moderate to poor, very poor, severe and emergency...The sub-committee is regularly holding meetings to take stock of the situation for appropriate intervention.”Gargava said that power agencies have been advised to ensure that 24x7 power supply is provided across Delhi-NCR to cut dependence on generator sets.However, several areas, especially in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh depend on high power diesel gensets for power back up, as power supply is patchy. In 2019 and 2020, the government of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana had sought exemptions as many private housing societies in the two states completely depended on generator sets for their power supply.However, the CPCB has exempted the use of generators for emergency purposes such as medical services, elevators and escalators, railway, Metro and at airports.Senior municipal corporation officials said that they were yet to receive the CPCB order, adding that a similar order in 2017 led to chaos with people parking their vehicles on roads and pavements to avoid designated lots.A senior South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) official who oversees parking services said the four-fold hike could be counterproductive, saying in 2017 the hike led to chaotic traffic conditions had occurred and traffic jams in many areas. “A considerable portion of the authorised parking lots remained vacant,” he said.BS Vohra, president, East Delhi RWA Joint Front, said temperatures were yet to drop significantly, giving sufficient time to the residents bodies provide heaters to guards. He added, “Citizens are willing to fight pollution, but the government needs to come up with a long-term plan against the sources of pollution,” said Vohra.Experts said Grap measures must be implemented thoroughly.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said, “Everyone knows that Delhi sees the first instance of its worst pollution episodes after Diwali because of cracker bursting. This time around things could get worse because this will be around the same time that stubble burning instances peak. Agencies will have to ensure 100% boots on ground so that we can control the situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/grap-measures-in-delhi-diesel-gensets-banned-as-aqi-tanks-101635444108676.html

29-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police lift barricades at Tikri border after three women run over||The Delhi Police on Thursday started removing barricades at the Tikri border with Haryana, where farmers have been protesting for the past 11 months, to resume movement of vehicles on at least one carriageway, senior police officers privy to the development said.They, however, said that it was not immediately clear when the border will be completely opened.The development came on a day three women farmers were killed and two others injured after a truck hit them near the Tikri border.The accident took place on Thursday morning at Pakoda Chowk in Bahadurgarh, where the women were waiting for an autorickshaw to go to Bahadurgarh railway station. They had come to participate in the farmers’ protest, and were returning to their village in Punjab’s Mansa district .Farmers from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand have been protesting at Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur borders in outer and eastern parts of Delhi against the three contentious farm laws since November last year.After the violence in Delhi during the farmers’ Republic Day (January 26) rally, the Delhi Police put in place multi-layered blockades at the three border protest sites by digging pits, placing iron nails and positioning iron barricades as well as concrete barriers.On Thursday, some video clips were shared on social media sites showing cranes breaking the concrete platforms and removing the jersey barriers installed on the Delhi side of the border.When asked for a confirmation, Delhi deputy commissioner of police (outer) Parvinder Singh said, “We have started the process of removing the blockades with the objective of opening the border and resume traffic on at least one carriageway. We actually began this process a couple of days ago. As of now, we cannot say when exactly the restoration of traffic will happen because removing the entire blockade will take some time.”Police officers in know of the development said that senior officers are in talks with the farm leaders, as well their counterparts in Haryana Police on taking the final decision to open the border.They also attributed the removal of the blockades to the recent remarks that the Supreme Court made on blocking of the Delhi borders by the protesting farmers.Leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of 40 farm unions, could not be reached for comment on the latest development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-lift-barricades-at-tikri-border-after-three-women-run-over-101635443689310.html

The prison authorities said it subsequenlty sacked the contractual doctor for alleged negligence in treating Gujjar.In a status report filed before justice Mukta Gupta on Wednesday, the CBI also said they are examining online payments from Gujjar’s brother.Gujjar (29) was found dead in his cell in Tihar Jail on August 4, following which the mother moved court seeking a CBI enquiry. On September 8, the high court said that it was a clear case of custodial violence and transferred the probe to CBI from the local police.Pursuant to this, the CBI, in a status report before justice Mukta Gupta, said that it had examined the medical staff including the then junior resident and the medical officer on duty at the jail hospital on the intervening night of August 3-4.The agency said that the junior doctor had testified that he did not visit ward no 1 (where Gujjar was lodged) on the intervening night of August 3-4, adding that further investigation on this is underway.A status report filed by the jail authorities said that they cancelled the appointment of the junior doctor, a contract staff, due to negligence in Gujjar’s medical examination, and also initiated action against the medical officer. Jail officials have said that four prison officials, including deputy superintendent Narender Meena (who was allegedly involved in a fight with Gujjar on August 3), assistant superintendents Deepak Dabas and Balraj, and warder Shiva had been suspended after the incident.The reports by the authorities were filed in response to a plea by Gujjar’s mother, through advocate Mehmood Pracha, claiming that her son was being harassed by the jail officials as he was “unable to meet their regularly increasing demands for money” and was murdered “as a part of pre-planned conspiracy”.The agency said that during the investigation, Gujjar’s brother, Ankul, gave them the details of the various payments allegedly made to some persons, which have been scrutinised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/extihar-jail-doctor-denied-treating-ankit-gujjar-hours-before-death-cbi-to-hc-101635443327731.html
29-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi sex ratio up to 933 females per 1,000 males: Manish Sisodia||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday said that the sex ratio has improved in Delhi -- from 920 females per 1,000 males in 2019 to 933 females per 1,000 males in 2020.“There has been a positive change in sex ratio in Delhi due to the (Arvind) Kejriwal government’s efforts. According to the annual report of the Directorate of Economics and Statistics of the Delhi government , sex ratio in Delhi increased to 933 females per 1,000 males in 2020, as against 920 per 1,000 males in 2019. Increase in sex ratio is the result of social awareness. It is a matter of great pride that our society is more educated now and they understand the importance of girl child even better,” said Sisodia in a press statement.Sex ratio is usually used as a yardstick to assess gender-based sex selection in a certain region.In Delhi’s case, sex-ratio witnessed consistent fall between 2014 and 2017. Government data showed, it was recorded at 876 (females per 1,000 males) in 2014, 869 in 2015, 857 in 2016 and 850 in 2017, before rising to 899 in 2018 and 920 in 2019.In 2020, the Central government issued a notice to the Delhi government, flagging the low sex ratio along with other states, including Bihar, Karnataka, Odisha and Uttarakhand.While the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) came to power in 2015 and started cracking down on facilities and individuals enabling sex selection, its effects became visible only in 2019 in terms of sharp improvement in the sex ratio numbers, said senior officials in health department.On Thursday, Sisodia also highlighted trends such as decrease in infant mortality rate, maternal mortality rate, birth rate and death rate which, he said, indicates improvement in Delhi’s health infrastructure.“There has also been a reduction in infant mortality rate in Delhi from 24.19 (per 1,000 live births) in 2019 to 20.37 in 2020. The reduction in infant mortality is the result of great changes in health infrastructure and better access to health facilities to all citizens. The maternal mortality rate in Delhi has also decreased. The maternal mortality rate was 0.55 (per 1,000 births) in 2019; it fell to 0.54 in 2020,” said Sisodia.“In Delhi, public awareness efforts have also yielded benefits. In Delhi, the birth rate fell from 18.35 (per 1,000 population) in 2019 to 14.85 in 2020. In 2020, a number of 301,645 births were registered, compared to 365,868 in 2019... According to the data, the death rate has decreased from 7.29 (per 1,000 population) in 2019 to 7.03 in 2020.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-sex-ratio-improves-to-933-females-per-1-000-malessisodia-101635442967862.html

They have called more people from neighbouring Nuh and Pataudi for support.Haji Shehzad Khan, the chairman of Muslim Ekta Manch, said, “If they (Hindu groups) shout slogans, we will not sit silent. We don’t want to disturb law and order situation, but if they target us, we will not sit quiet,” he said.Khan said that following protests by residents, the site at Sector 47 was reallocated to another in Sector 12A but protests continued. “We don’t want any confrontation and conflict; we are ready to relocate to another place provided the administration can guarantee peace,” he said.Meanwhile, Arya Kendriya Sabha, a central organisation of Arya Samaj branches, submitted a memorandum to the district administration on Thursday demanding a complete ban on namaz in the open. “We demand a complete ban on namaz in the open to maintain peace and harmony in the city,” said Laxman Pahuja, a member.Pahuja said they will protest in large numbers on Friday, in an attempt to disrupt the prayers.Aman Yadav, the assistant commissioner of police (Sadar), said that more than 500 police personnel are deployed at five spots and those trying to disrupt prayers will be arrested. “We will not allow anyone to disrupt the Friday prayers and we will not let people to take the law into their hands,” he said.In a related incident on Thursday, a furniture shop owner in Sector 12 complained to the police of prayers being forcefully offered in front of his shop.Mehmood Khan, a businessman who runs a furniture shop in Sector 12, alleged that last Friday, residents and fringe groups staged a protest against namaz in an open area. “A group of Muslims has been offering namaz in front of my furniture shop for the past few months. I had requested maulvi in the past not to conduct Friday prayers here, but they ignored my request stating that they were not offering prayer on private land but on government land,” he said.A complaint in this regard was lodged at the Sector 14 police station. However, no case was registered till Thursday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/friday-namaz-500-cops-to-be-deployed-warn-of-strict-action-against-disruptive-elements-101635438169380.html

It was a close shave for the pedestrian – a maid, who managed to pull herself out of the crater with the help of pipes – and the siblings whom locals rescued with the help of a ladder. The students, Mahi Malhotra, 16, and Kanav Malhotra, 11, were rushed to the hospital and are said to be in a stable condition. Their two-wheeler ( an Activa) was completely submerged in sewer water and was pulled out with the help of a JCB, seven hours after the mishap. CCTV footage of the incident, which has been widely circulated on social media, shows that the road caved in just after a school bus crossed the area, near Dandi Swami Chowk, around 8am. The road collapsed so abruptly that the students who were at the brink of the chasm were caught unwares and were unable to save themselves, while the two-wheeler behind them was able to apply the brake in time. Incidentally, the students are relatives of municipal corporation assistant town planner Satish Malhotra and the cave-in took place just 50m from the old residence of mayor Balkar Sandhu, who also arrived at the spot.An eyewitness, Harinder Singh, said, “Fortunately, sewer water did not accumulate in the crater, otherwise the students could have drowned. I was around 40-50m away from the spot when I heard the students scream. Fortunately, a major tragedy was averted.”Municipal corporation sub divisional officer Anshul Garcha said the civic body is investigating the matter and the cause for the road collapse is yet to be ascertained. “Underground wires could be seen. It is suspected that they may have damaged the sewer lines, resulting in leakage and soil erosion. We are repairing the road.” The cave-in was reported in a congested area with a residential-cum-commercial building on one side of the damaged road portion. The building was vacant, while shops have been closed as residents fear that the foundation of the building may have been damaged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-road-cave-in-close-shave-for-students-as-two-wheeler-plunges-into-15-ft-crater-101635422806586.html
29-10-2021||Chandigarh||India ready for any challenge, only strong respected: Defence minister||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said that India is a peace-loving country but is ready to face any challenge and the nation’s scientific community is producing the finest defence technology in this endeavour. Addressing staff at the Terminal Ballistic Research Laboratory (TBRL) in Panchkula after inaugurating an augmented environmental test facility, Rajnath Singh said, “It is against our values to start a conflict. But if need be, our country is ready to face any challenge. Only the strong are respected.” Chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, who accompanied the defence minister, said, “We have challenges at our borders and to meet them, we need technology. Our adversaries are using technology in warfare. We also need to do so.” Besides General Rawat, Dr G Satheesh Reddy, the secretary in the Department of Defence R&D and chairman, Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO); Air Marshal Sandeep Singh, the vice-chief of air staff; Dr BHVS Narayana Murthy, director general, missile and strategic system; and Dr Tessy Thomas, director general, Aero, also accompanied the defence minister. Milestone to make India self-reliant Rajnath Singh recalled that in August 2021, he had handed over the indigenously developed and produced multi-mode hand grenade to the Indian Army. This grenade, designed and developed by TBRL, was the first munition that was produced by a private industry, a transfer of technology (TOT) holder of DRDO and inducted into the Indian armed forces. “The safety and performance parameters of this grenade make it truly world class and it has achieved the functional reliability of more than 99.5% in production. This is a clear demonstration of capabilities of our scientists and the production agency,” Singh said. He appreciated the role TBRL and DRDO for this achievement and mentioned that it is an important milestone to make India self-reliant in defence production. He also indicated that indigenous systems would keep getting inducted regularly. “Moreover, the active participation of industry, specifically the private sector, in manufacturing these products with DRDO technologies is the strength, both military and economic, that would make our country aatmanirbhar (self-reliant),” said Singh. TBRL one-stop solution for trials He said that the test facilities at TBRL are being extended to Indian industries, R&D institutions and academia to support the Make in India initiative. He stressed that the TBRL can provide one-stop solution for static and dynamic trials of all munitions and warheads in addition to its core capability of design and development of warheads, munitions and its sub-systems. On this occasion, transfer of technology for the TBRL developed warhead for MPATGM Mk-II was handed over to Economic Explosive Ltd, Nagpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/india-ready-for-any-challenge-only-strong-respected-defence-minister-101635418846275.html

As the Sunni Pashtun group starts to take over Afghanistan’s network of foreign delegations, Mohammad Shokaib has reportedly been sent to Pakistan’s capital as the first secretary or charge d'affaires at the embassy.The post of ambassador has remained vacant since the Ashraf Ghani-led government withdrew its envoy, Najibullah Alikhil, over the alleged abduction and assault of his daughter. The Afghan foreign ministry under the previous government had strongly condemned the “heinous act” and expressed its “deep concern over the safety and security of diplomats, their families, and staff members of the Afghan political and consular missions in Pakistan."Pakistan has not officially recognised the new Taliban government which came to power following years of insurgency, but Islamabad has been active in the government formation in the war-torn country. HT had earlier reported about Pakistan’s interference to sideline Mullah Baradar in the Taliban set-up and empower the Haqqani Network, the US-designated terrorist organisation.Pakistan foreign ministry has said that the latest appointment by the Taliban was mainly about ensuring consular functions."There are millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan and there are visa issues as well," Reuters quoted the ministry spokesperson as saying.Apart from Shokaib’s appointment, two Afghan officials have also been appointed to run the consulates in Quetta and Peshawar. The appointments are significant in nature as both Pakistani cities are close to the two major border crossings with Afghanistan.Similar arrangements had been made in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, reported Reuters quoting two Taliban officials.The Afghan embassies are still largely run by the ambassador appointed by the Western-backed previous government as no country has given formal recognition to the Taliban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-sends-envoy-to-run-embassy-in-pakistan-amid-quest-for-recognition-report-101635523359321.html
29-10-2021||World||India, US call upon Taliban to prevent terror attacks from Afghanistan||India and the United States on Thursday called upon the Taliban once again to ensure terrorists never use Afghan soil to launch attacks on any country and agreed to continue close consultations on developments in that country.In a joint statement issued after the eighth meeting of the US-India Counter Terrorism Joint Working Group and Designations Dialogue, the two sides also reiterated their call against terrorist proxies and cross-border terrorism in any form, which is thinly disguised call for Pakistan, which exports terror across its eastern border into India and into Afghanistan across the western front.India and the United States made clear who they meant when they called once again for bringing to justice the perpetrators of the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, which were carried out by Lashkar-e-Toiba terrorists who had come from Pakistan and received instructions from Pakistani handlers during the attack that had lasted three days.Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the attack, is in jail after being finally convicted in November 2020, after years of indulgent treatment by the Pakistani government. And Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, who led the operation, was jailed this past January for terror financing not specific to the Mumbai attack.The joint working group met on Tuesday and Wednesday in Washington DC. Mahaveer Singhvi, joint secretary for counter terrorism at the Indian ministry of external affairs and John T. Godfrey, US state department acting coordinator for counterterrorism, led their respective delegations.The United States reiterated its commitment to standing together with the people and government of India in the fight against terrorism, the two sides said in a joint statement, adding, “Both sides strongly condemned any use of terrorist proxies and cross-border terrorism in all its forms and called for the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai attack to be brought to justice.” They also called for concerted action against all terrorist groups, including groups proscribed by the United Nations Security Council, such as Al-Qaeda, Islamic State/Daesh, Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT), and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM)In line with an earlier resolution of the UN Security Council, India and Afghanistan also urged the Taliban to ensure “Afghan territory is never again used to threaten or attack any country, shelter or train terrorists, or plan or finance terrorist attacks”.Both sides said they would continue close consultations on developments in Afghanistan and potential terrorist threats emanating from there. The two sides also exchanged views on countering narco-terror networks and trans-national illegal weapons smuggling networks.The two delegations also discussed ways to restrict the ability of terrorists to undertake international travel and they decided to expand terrorist threat information sharing and best practices on countering terrorism funding and the use of internet by terrorists to spread their message and recruit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-us-call-upon-taliban-to-prevent-terror-attacks-from-afghanistan-101635521873773.html
29-10-2021||World||Covid-19: Tonga reports its 1st ever case from plane traveler||The island nation of Tonga on Friday reported its first-ever case of Covid-19 after a traveler from New Zealand tested positive.Tonga is among the few remaining nations in the world that have avoided outbreaks of the virus. Like many of its neighbors, Tonga's isolation has helped keep it safe but it faces big challenges should the virus take hold due to its under-resourced health system.The nearby nation of Fiji avoided significant outbreaks until April, when the delta variant ripped through the island chain, infecting more than 50,000 people and killing at least 673.Tonga's Prime Minister Pohiva Tu'i'onetoa said in a radio address that the traveler was among 215 passengers who had arrived on a flight from the New Zealand city of Christchurch on Wednesday and had been isolating at a quarantine hotel.The prime minister planned on Monday to make an announcement about any future lockdowns, according to news website Matangi Tonga.Christchurch had been free from the virus for months until this week, when four community cases were reported after a returning resident caught the virus while in Auckland, where an outbreak has been growing since August.New Zealand health officials said the traveler to Tonga was fully vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine and had returned a negative test before leaving for Tonga. The officials said they would be working with their Tongan counterparts to confirm the case and provide more details in the coming days.Tongan Health Ministry chief executive Dr. Siale ’Akau’ola said it was unfortunate the plane had already left Christchurch before the news came of the community cases there, Matangi Tonga reported.’Akau’ola said all frontline workers including health staff, police officers and airport staff who were on duty when the plane arrived had also been put into quarantine after the positive case was confirmed. He added that all those working near the flight had been vaccinated.Located northeast of New Zealand, Tonga is home to about 106,000 people. About 31% of Tongans are fully vaccinated and 48% have had at least one dose, according to research group Our World in Data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-tonga-reports-its-1st-ever-case-from-plane-traveler-101635493037283.html
29-10-2021||World||Will Taliban hand over Bagram airbase for CT ops to China or US?||With a number of international terrorist groups now operating from Afghanistan rising, the Taliban cabinet is convening on Friday to examine if Bagram airbase, north of Kabul, could be handed over to a third country for helping the Sunni Pashtun Islamists to launch counter-terror operations in the country. The two countries in reckoning are Pakistan backed China and the US, which left the airbase on July 5, 2021, after two decades of operations.The jostling of power within the Taliban government with defence minister Mullah Yaqoob on one side and Pakistan ISI backed interior minister and global terrorist Sirajuddin Haqqani on the other side has led to total chaos in governance as a consequence of which terrorist groups have homed in Afghanistan as a base for operations. It is precisely because of this unfolding scenario that Pakistan army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa differed with outgoing ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed as the former felt that there would be a huge Islamic fall-out on Pakistan. While both Pakistan PM Imran Khan and DG ISI gloated over the Taliban occupation of Kabul, army chief Bajwa differed from them as the fear was that Pakistan would turn into a rabid Islamic state like Afghanistan under the Taliban.At present, the US is worried about al Qaeda, the Haqqani Network whose boss runs the Taliban government, and the so-called Islamic State of Khorasan Province growing in numbers in Afghanistan and exporting terror to the west, China is worried about three terrorist groups operating in Af-Pak region that have taken explicitly anti-Beijing positions and followed through violence. India specific groups like Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba who have ideological affiliations with the Taliban vis Deobandi and Ahle-Hadith platforms have also started using Afghanistan for launching operations across the Radcliffe Line.While China has decided to open another military base in Tajikistan to monitor the Wakhan corridor that juts into highly restive Xinjiang province, it is courting the Taliban regime via Pakistan to ensure that Uighur terrorists do not start launching operations against the Xi Jinping regime from Afghanistan. Even for the safety of its Belt and Road Initiative, China is worried about three terrorist groups. They are:· Balochistan Liberation Army: They attacked the Chinese consulate In Karachi with three suicide bombers in 2018/· Tehreek-e-Taliban, Pakistan: An offshoot of Taliban, they claimed responsibility for the April 2021 car bomb explosion next to a hotel in Balochistan’s capital city where the Chinese ambassador to Pakistan was due to stay. The bomb exploded just minutes before the ambassador arrived.· ISKP: An off-shoot of ISIS, the rabid Sunni force has started targeting the Chinese through propaganda if not bombs.It is not only China that is worried about the security situation in Afghanistan but also Central Asian Republics as terrorist groups like the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and theEast Turkestan Independence Movement have taken base in Afghanistan.With the Biden administration now openly acknowledging the presence of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, the Taliban regime does not have the much-required air power to fight these terrorist groups as none can afford a prolonged battle on land again.Under the circumstances, the Taliban is considering handing over Bagram airbase for counter-terrorism operations in Afghanistan to a third power. While Pakistan wants the Taliban to hand over the strategic base in Parwan province to China for monitoring, a section of the Taliban group is opposed to Beijing and would rather hand it over to the US again. As Central Asian Republics have denied base facilities to the US for over the horizon capabilities and Pakistan is still trying to cut out a deal with the Biden administration on this issue, the option of theUS conducting CT operations from the Bagram base is not ruled out. The benefit of the Bagram base being handed over to the US is that Washington will accompany this Taliban gesture with much required humanitarian and development aid for a country that is facing a severe drought situation. The great game is still not over in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-taliban-hand-over-bagram-air-base-for-ct-ops-to-china-or-us-101635481648530.html
29-10-2021||World||Wharton School to accept Bitcoin as mode of payment for one of its courses||The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, one of the nation’s premier business schools, plan to accept cryptocurrency as tuition for its online blockchain and digital assets program. The Ivy League institution’s new executive education program will accept coins such as Bitcoin as one method of payment. Due to start in January, the online course offered by the Philadelphia-based school costs $3,800 and is expected to attract several thousand students per year.“It’s a program about blockchain and digital assets, we felt that we should talk the talk and walk the walk,” Guido Molinari, managing partner a Prysm Group, which is working with Wharton to develop the program, said in an interview. Wharton will use Coinbase Global Inc., the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, to accept digital-asset payments.Over the years, there have been many university experiments with cryptocurrencies: Massachusetts Institute of Technology famously gave out Bitcoin to its students in 2014. Other colleges have begun letting students use crypto to pay tuition. In May, the University of Pennsylvania received the largest cryptocurrency gift in its history, $5 million from an anonymous donor. Wharton also has many notable alums actively involved in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, who graduated in 1997, has pushed the company, as well as his SpaceX, to buy Bitcoin for their corporate treasuries.

The Bangladesh's foreign ministry has maintained that contrary to all the “ongoing propaganda”, only six people died during the recent violence."Contrary to all the ongoing propaganda, only 6 people died during recent violence of which 4 were Muslims, killed during the encounters with law enforcing authorities, and 2 were Hindus, one of whom had normal death and another when he jumped in a pond. None was raped and not a single Mandir was destroyed," Bangladeshi foreign minister AK Abdul Momen said in the statement."However, deities or goddesses were vandalized. While the violence was unfortunate and should not have happened, the government took immediate action. The perpetrators have been arrested and now they are under police custody," Momen added.The foreign minister also called out a few "enthusiastic media houses and individuals" for spreading “cooked-up stories” regarding the violence to embarrass the government, branding it as “unfortunate”.AK Abdul Momen said the law-enforcing authorities are investigating the recent communal violence in the country which happened during the Durga Puja celebrations. "The government is committed to hand out justice to every wrongdoer and to save all its citizens irrespective of their faiths," he added.Momen also informed that a probe is underway in the incident wherein a person left a copy of the Holy Quran near the foot of a deity which sparked outrage on social media."Reportedly a drug-addict person left a copy of the Holy Quran near the foot of a deity when there was no worshippers or organizer at the Puja Mondop and another person took a photo of it and put it up in the social media, Facebook, sparking outrage," he said.Reports of tensions between religious groups of Bangladesh have come to light, days after communal violence that rocked various cities in Bangladesh. According to news agency ANI, at least 71 cases have been filed in different parts of the country in connection with the attacks on Hindus and around 450 were arrested for spreading rumours on social media.Communal violence broke out in several places in Bangladesh earlier this month after news emerged on social media about the alleged desecration of the Quran at a Durga Puja venue on the bank of Nanuar Dighi in the Comilla district of the country.The statement by the foreign ministry comes after Bangladesh information and broadcasting minister M Hasan Mahmud on Thursday said elements close to Pakistan who had opposed the 1971 liberation war want to create communal disharmony in his country. He emphasised that secularism remains the guiding spirit of the "nation and its Constitution".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-a-single-temple-was-destroyed-bangladesh-foreign-ministry-on-communal-riots-101635474449607.html
29-10-2021||World||World Stroke Day 2021: Timely access for quality stroke treatment||More than 13 million people will have a stroke each year and around 5.5 million will die as a result, according to the World Stroke Organization (WSO) as we observe World Stroke Day 2021 on Friday, October 29. On this day, the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as other organisations around the world, honour stroke survivors and support countries to identify and apply "best buy" interventions that reduce the risk of strokes.World Stroke Day was established by WSO to increase awareness and drive action on stroke around the world.According to WHO regional director for South-East Asia Poonam Khetrapal Singh, an estimated 70 per cent of strokes and 87 per cent of stroke-related deaths and disability-adjusted life years occur in low- and middle-income countries."The WHO South-East Asia Region is committed to strengthening health care services to prevent, treat and manage stroke, and to provide quality rehabilitative care for stroke-related disability," she said.All of these countries implement multi-sectoral action plans, while also expanding the provision of non-communicable diseases (NCD) services at the primary level, in line with the 2016 Colombo Declaration.Theme for World Stroke Day 2021For 2021 and 2022, the WSO campaign aims to focus on raising awareness of the signs of stroke and the need for timely access to quality stroke treatment. “When somebody has a stroke, every second that goes by is crucial. As brain tissue and millions of neurons begin to fade away, time could not be more precious,” the organisation stated on its website.What is a stroke?According to the World Stroke Organization, a stroke is a non-communicable condition where the blood supply to the brain is disrupted, resulting in oxygen starvation, brain damage and loss of function. A stroke is most frequently caused by a clot in an artery supplying blood to the brain, a situation known as ischemia.The chances of a stroke increase significantly by age and globally, around one in every four adults above the age of 25 have at least one stroke in their lifetime.Evidence has also shown that coronavirus infection increases an individual’s risk of stroke. As a result, countries across the world need to leverage every chance possible to improve health and well-being, increase health system efficiency, and promote social and economic empowerment and growth, the WHO regional director noted."A fairer, healthier, more sustainable region is ours to achieve," Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-stroke-day-2021-timely-access-for-quality-stroke-treatment-101635472571476.html
29-10-2021||World||Market research analyst qualified as speciality job to determine H-1B visa||In a major victory for H-1B employers, a federal court has approved a settlement under which the US Citizenship and Immigration Services has agreed to qualify market research analyst as a speciality occupation for the purposes of determining H-1B visa application of a foreign professional.Based on its prior interpretation of the Occupational Outlook Handbook — a Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics publication profiling hundreds of occupations in the US job market — the USCIS was determining that market research analysts did not qualify as a "specialty occupation".The settlement approved by the federal district court in the Northern District of California would now let companies request that the USCIS reopen and re-adjudicate their denied H-1B petitions."This settlement is an important victory that will benefit hundreds of American businesses and the market research analysts they sought to employ," said Leslie K Dellon, senior attorney (business immigration) at the American Immigration Council."The settlement gives US businesses another chance to have their H-1B market research analyst petitions approved — this time under new guidance worked out by the parties to the lawsuit. Each H-1B petition reopened and approved will represent another opportunity for US employers and the workers they sponsored to advance their business objectives," she said.The class action lawsuit in this regard was filed by the American Immigration Council, American Immigration Lawyers Association, and the law firms Van Der Hout LLP, Berry Appleman & Leiden LLP (formerly Joseph & Hall P.C.), and Kuck Baxter Immigration LLC.Jeff Joseph, partner at Berry Appleman & Leiden LLP, said this settlement finally resolves an issue on which immigration lawyers have been battling the government for years."This settlement strikes the right balance between what the regulations actually say and how employers evaluate a candidate's professional qualifications in the real world. It is our sincere hope that USCIS will now interpret other specialty occupations from a perspective that is in line with what actually happens in the free market," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/market-research-analyst-qualified-as-speciality-job-to-determine-h-1b-visa-101635472377272.html
29-10-2021||World||Leaked photo shows Meta's rumoured smartwatch with front-facing camera||Meta Platforms Inc., the company formerly known as Facebook Inc., is developing a smartwatch with a front-facing camera and rounded screen, according to an image of the device found inside one of the tech giant’s iPhone apps.The photo shows a watch with a screen and casing that’s slightly curved at the edges. The front-facing camera -- similar to what you’d see on a smartphone -- appears at the bottom of the display, and there’s a control button for the watch on the right side. The image was found inside of the company’s app for controlling its new smart glasses launched in partnership with Ray-Ban. The picture was located by app developer Steve Moser and shared with Bloomberg News. A Meta spokeswoman declined to comment.The watch has a detachable wrist strap and what appears to be a button at the top of the watch case. Its large display mimics the style of Apple Inc.’s watch -- rather than the more basic fitness trackers sold by Google’s Fitbit and Garmin Ltd. The camera suggests the product will likely be used for videoconferencing, a feature that would make Meta’s device stand out. Apple’s smartwatch doesn’t have a camera, nor do rival products from companies such as Samsung Electronics Co. Facebook has been planning to launch its first watch as early as 2022, but a final decision on timing hasn’t been made yet and the debut could be later, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The company is working on three generations of the product aimed at different release time frames, the person said. The device in the image could ultimately represent a version that is never released, but it’s the first evidence of the company’s work on the project. The presence of the image in the glasses app, called Facebook View, could indicate the watch will be managed on iPhones and Android devices using that app too. Code inside the software indicates that the watch could be dubbed “Milan.” The code also suggests the camera will be capable of capturing both photos and videos and downloading them to a phone.A smartwatch would be a new major hardware category for Meta, which currently sells virtual reality headsets and Portal video-chat devices. On Thursday, the company said it is working on a new high-end headset codenamed “Project Cambria” that mixes virtual and augmented reality. Meta has said a future watch could work as an input device or accessory for its headsets. If Meta launches the watch next year, it would go up against the next generation of Apple devices. That company is planning as many as three new Apple Watches for 2022, including an Apple Watch Series 8 with a body temperature sensor, a new low-end Apple Watch SE and a rugged model geared at athletes, Bloomberg has reported. A move into smartwatches would escalate a rivalry between Meta and Apple, which have battled over app store policies and privacy changes to the iPhone operating system. Apple is also planning to debut its first mixed-reality headset as earlier as next year, which would compete with the upcoming high-end Meta headset.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/leaked-photo-shows-meta-s-rumoured-smartwatch-with-front-facing-camera-101635465981068.html
29-10-2021||World||US returns antiquities to India in stolen art investigation||US authorities returned about 250 antiquities to India on Thursday in a long-running investigation of a stolen art scheme.The items, worth an estimated $15 million, were handed over during a ceremony at the Indian Consulate in New York City. The centerpiece is a bronze Shiva Nataraja valued at $4 million, authorities said.The ceremony stems from a sprawling probe by the Manhattan district attorney’s office and the Homeland Security Investigations arm of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The investigation has focused on tens of thousands of antiquities allegedly smuggled into the United States by dealer Subhash Kapoor, who has denied the allegations.The case "serves as a potent reminder that individuals who maraud sacred temples in pursuit of individual profit are committing crimes not only against a country’s heritage but also its present and future,” District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said in a statement.Authorities say Kapoor — jailed in India and facing charges there pending a U.S. extradition request — used his Arts of the Past gallery in New York to traffic looted treasures from India and various countries in Southeast Asia. The investigation has resulted in the recovery of 2,500 artifacts valued at $143 million and convictions of six Kapoor co-conspirators, Vance said.The Shiva Nataraja bronze was sold by the mother of Nancy Wiener, a gallery operator who pleaded guilty in the case this month to charges of conspiracy and possession of stolen property, authorities said. Nancy Wiener sold looted items to major museums in Australia and Singapore, they said.In June, the district attorney’s office returned more than two dozen artifacts worth $3.8 million to Cambodia as part of the investigation. Another 33 objects were sent back to Afghanistan in April.Court papers filed in New York says Kapoor went to extraordinary lengths to acquire the artifacts, many of them statues of Hindu deities, and then falsified their provenance with forged documents. They say Kapoor traveled the world seeking out antiquities that had been looted from temples, homes and archaeological sites. Some of the artifacts were recovered from Kapoor’s storage units in New York.Kapoor had the items cleansed and repaired to remove any damage from illegal excavation, and then illegally exported them to the United States from their countries of origin, according to US prosecutors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-returns-antiquities-to-india-in-stolen-art-investigation-101635466307849.html
29-10-2021||World||Facebook to be called Meta in nod to its 'metaverse' vision||Facebook Inc said on Thursday it would rebrand as Meta, a name change that underscores its ambitions to refocus the world's largest social network on building the "metaverse."The rebrand comes as the company battles criticisms from lawmakers and regulators over its market power, algorithmic decisions and the policing of abuses on its platforms.CEO Mark Zuckerberg, speaking at the company's live-streamed virtual and augmented reality conference, said the new name reflected its focus on building this new virtual realm rather than its namesake social media service."Right now, our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can't possibly represent everything that we're doing today, let alone in the future," he said.The tech giant said the change would bring together its different apps and technologies under one new brand. It said it would not change its corporate structure.The metaverse, a term first coined in a dystopian novel three decades ago and now attracting buzz in Silicon Valley, refers broadly to the idea of a shared virtual environment which can be accessed by people using different devices.The company unveiled a new sign at its headquarters in Menlo Park, California, on Thursday, replacing its thumbs-up "Like" logo with a blue infinity shape.Zuckerberg said the new name reflects that over time, users will not need to use Facebook to use the company's other services.The company said in a blog post that it intends to start trading under the new stock ticker it has reserved, MVRS, on Dec. 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-to-be-called-meta-in-nod-to-its-metaverse-vision-101635447377143.html
29-10-2021||World||N. Korea's Kim lost 20 kgs but remains healthy: Report||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has recently lost about 20 kilograms (44 pounds), but remains healthy and is trying to boost public loyalty to him in the face of worsening economic problems, South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers Thursday.The National Intelligence Service gave the assessment during a closed-door parliamentary briefing, saying it used artificial intelligence techniques, an analysis of super-resolution video of Kim and other methods to investigate Kim’s condition, said two lawmakers who attended the session.Kim’s health has been a focus of keen outside attention in recent months because he has appeared noticeably thinner in state media photos and videos. Kim, 37, hasn’t publicly anointed a successor and some experts say an abrupt incapacitation could trigger chaos in the impoverished nuclear-armed country.Despite Kim's thinner appearance, longtime North Korea observers have said Kim has no apparent health problems and his weight loss is likely the result of his efforts to improve his physique. They noted that he has continued his regular public activities and no unusual developments have been seen in North Korean videos.But unconfirmed rumors about him have continued to appear, with one tabloid claiming that recent public appearances used an impostor. The NIS dismissed that report as groundless, lawmaker Kim Byung-kee said.He said the NIS told the parliamentary session that Kim’s weight has fallen from about 140 kilograms (308 pounds) to 120 kilograms (264 pounds). The NIS has previously said Kim is about 170 centimeters (5 feet, 8 inches) tall.It said Kim has been engaged in public activities for 70 days so far this year, a 45% increase from the same period last year.The lawmaker said the NIS found that Kim had photos of his late father and grandfather — who ruled North Korea before him — removed from a Workers’ Party conference room.Another lawmaker, Ha Tae-keung, quoted the NIS as saying North Korea has begun using the term “Kimjongunism,” a political ideology named after Kim Jong Un that is independent of existing ideologies named after his father and grandfather, “KimJongilism” and “Kimilsungism.”After about 10 years in office, Kim is struggling to overcome what appears to be the toughest period of his rule due to economic hardships worsened by the coronavirus pandemic.According to the NIS, North Korea’s annual trade with China, its main ally and economic lifeline, declined by two-thirds to $185 million through September this year compared to the previous year, Ha said.North Korean officials are struggling to deal with soaring prices of goods and shortages of medicine and other essential supplies that have accelerated the spread of water-borne diseases such as typhoid fever. The country has also been unable to import the paper and ink it uses to print banknotes, forcing North Korean officials to issue temporary currency, according to Ha’s account of the NIS briefing.While reduced trade has limited the supply of materials needed for industrial activity, North Korean officials are pushing workers hard to increase production. Excessive factory operations caused an explosion at a major fertilizer plant in August, Ha quoted the NIS as saying.The NIS corroborated recent reports by the World Health Organization that North Korea is beginning to ease its tough COVID-19 border restrictions to receive outside help.The western North Korean seaport of Nampo is now “saturated” with supplies from the outside world after authorities recently began allowing increased maritime transport and the entrance of medical supplies, according to the NIS. North Korea is preparing to open another seaport in the northwest, Yongchon, to handle the increased supplies and is also considering restarting rail transport with China and Russia, it said.North Korea has yet to report any cases of the coronavirus. While experts have questioned its claim of a perfect record, Ha said the NIS has yet to see any signs of a major COVID-19 outbreak.Despite its severe virus-related border controls, North Korea hasn’t shown the same kind of urgency for vaccines, as mass immunizations continue to be delayed amid global shortages.Ha said North Korea has rejected outside offers of Russian and Chinese vaccines. Kim, the lawmaker, said the NIS has determined North Korea also hasn't shown interest in obtaining Pfizer vaccines, which would require negotiations with the drugmaker and the U.S.Analysts say North Korea could be uneasy about international monitoring requirements that would be attached to vaccines it receives from the outside world. There are also views that Kim Jong Un has domestic political motivations to tighten the country’s self-imposed lockdown as he calls for unity and tries to solidify his grip on power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/n-korea-s-kim-lost-20-kgs-but-remains-healthy-report-101635428006576.html

29-10-2021||India||G20 member states have reached ‘broad consensus’ on vaccine certificates: Goyal||The G20 member states have reached “broad consensus” on the issue of recognising vaccine certificates for resumption of travel and economic activities to boost post-pandemic recovery, commerce minister Piyush Goyal said on Friday.Goyal, who is India’s G20 sherpa or personal representative of the head of government for preparing for the grouping’s summit, told a news briefing in Rome that the country had made “significant interventions” in discussions on key issues such as mutual recognition of vaccine certificates, sustainable development and climate change that will figure in the declaration to be issued after the G20 Summit.He said there was “broad consensus” on mutual recognition of vaccine certificates because all the nations wish to resume travel and economic activity. The G20 members are working towards the acceptable language to bring the matter within the grouping’s framework, he said.India and some other states pushed for the inclusion of vaccine certificates into the health paragraph of the proposed declaration so that it takes centre stage for current and future pandemics. The declaration is expected to address the recognition of both vaccines and certificates, and the G20 is also looking at building capacity and strengthening processes for faster approval of more vaccines, he said. “We are quite confident that there is broad consensus and the language is being worked out on how we can bring it in. To bring in the sense and bring confidence to the world, that we are all committed to faster recovery, resilient recovery, yet at the same time ensuring that there is sufficient policy space for nations to protect their own national interests,” Goyal said.The G20 sherpas have held discussions over the past three days on the proposed declaration to be adopted at the G20 Summit during October 30-31. Goyal said India had spoken for developing and low and middle-income countries at these talks, and most G20 states had endorsed the country’s position that “extensive Covid-19 immunisation is a global public good”.India also batted for sustainable development and food security and insisted that policies must protect the interests of small and marginal farmers while conserving local food cultures that are important for food security.On climate change and environment, India spoke on the “need for critical enablers for galvanising global climate action”, including commensurate long-term concessional climate finance, access to affordable and sustainable technology, and a commitment to adopt sustainable lifestyles and responsible consumption patterns, Goyal said. As co-chair of the G20 framework working group on economic recovery, India is ensuring there is no premature withdrawal of financial support for the most vulnerable countries.In the realm of tax reforms, India pushed the G20 to address a “mismatch between the source of generation of profits and jurisdiction where profits are taxed” to ensure that large MNCs pay a minimum effective corporate tax in the country of operation, he said.As the co-chair of G20’s anti-corruption working group, India made contributions to asset recovery, information-sharing, law enforcement cooperation, technology and denial of safe havens. In the field of digital economy, Goyal said India pushed the need for balancing the free flow of data with a “narrative for cross-border data flows and accommodating development imperatives of developing countries”.Goyal also said India was one of the most responsible countries in terms of meeting its nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Accord to cut greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, several other countries hadn’t fulfilled their commitments to providing finance and technology to developing countries. The G20 sherpas discussed how to reflect collective efforts and the need for all nations to meet their targets while being more ambitious while going forward, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/g20-member-states-have-reached-broad-consensus-on-vaccine-certificates-piyush-goyal-101635526435701.html

Here's what happened from 2.30pm to 5.30pm||Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan and the other co-accused in the drugs-on-cruise case Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha could not walk out of the jail on Friday, though the lawyers were expecting to complete the formalities by today evening. They will be released on Saturday morning. All three of them were granted bail on Thursday. As the complete bail order did not come on Thursday, the paperwork was supposed to take place on Friday. While senior lawyers said that it will take a day or two for Aryan Khan to finally walk out of the jail, Aryan Khan's lawyers were hoping and preparing for Aryan Khan's release on Friday itself.Here is what happened after the court released the bail conditions for Aryan Khan1. The Bombay high court which granted bail to Aryan, Araaz, Munmun on Thursday released the bail conditions for the three. Bail conditions are certain requirements that one has to fulfil or agree to in exchange for bail. A surety of ₹1 lakh each was mandated by the court.2. Aryan Khan's lawyers had time between 2.30pm and 5.30pm to process the paperwork as a physical copy of the release order from the court has to reach the prison by 5.30pm.3. As soon as the bail conditions were released, Aryan Khan's lawyers moved to the NDPS court which would issue the release order.4. Around 4.15pm Bollywood actor and Shah Rukh Khan's friend Juhi Chawla reached the court as Aryan Khan's surety. According to reports, Shah Rukh Khan was also on his way to the Arthur Road prison as at that point, Aryan Khan's release from the jail was being expected today.5. As part of the process, the NDPS court then verified Juhi Chawla's documents. Then she proceeded to the department to complete the formalities.6. Meanwhile, a crowd gathered to see Juhi Chawla and click photos with her. According to reports, a lawyer also objected to it as other bonds waiting in line to be signed were getting delayed.7. After Juhi Chawla signed the bond, it went to the NDPS judge. Special NDPS judge Vaibhav V Patil signed the surety bond.8. While it was already 5.30pm, Satish Maneshinde's lawyers were waiting in the court for the process to get completed. Maneshinde was in the Arthur Road prison at that time.9. Reports said Maneshinde's team was hoping that the 5.30pm deadline could be extended to 7pm, while prison officials said they will not make any exception for anyone. According to the rules, the bail box of the prison is opened only at 10.30am and 5.30pm. The jail officials wait until 5.35pm. But any release order submitted after that gets processed the next day.10. At around 6.37pm, Satish Maneshinde's son and lawyer Nikhil Maneshinde left the sessions court with the release order and reached the Arthur Road jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-delayed-aryan-s-release-from-jail-today-here-s-what-happened-from-2-30pm-to-530pm-101635525037060.html
29-10-2021||India||Bengal BJP boss rebuts Mamata on ‘Gorkhaland’, his MLA calls it unacceptable||SILIGURI: Bengal Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Sukanta Majumdar’s rebuttal to chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s veiled criticism of his party over Gorkhaland provoked some pushback in the Darjeeling hill region. Among those who countered Majumdar was his party legislator BP Bajgain who sent him an angry letter on Thursday and released it to the public to make his stand known.Bajgain aka Bishnu Prasad Sharma was upset about Sukanta Majumdar’s statement on Wednesday that the BJP “has never officially uttered the word Gorkhaland”.“It is chief minister Mamata Banerjee who officially acknowledged and included the word by signing the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) accord,” Majumdar said during his visit to north Bengal’s Jalpaiguri on Wednesday, just about 100km from Darjeeling town that has been at the centre of demands for Gorkhaland for decades.Majumdar’s statement was designed to counter chief minister Banerjee who promised a permanent solution for the Darjeeling hills during her visit on Tuesday, underlining that there were “some political parties” which came to town ahead of elections and promised statehood. “Their actual motto is to divide the people of the hills,” she said, a remark seen to be aimed at the BJP.In his letter to the Bengal BJP chief, his party legislator said he could not accept Wednesday’s statement.“Thousands of my supporters have been disheartened by your statement. I, being a Gorkha myself, cannot accept it,” the BJP lawmaker from the Kurseong hill assembly seat said in his letter. “The syllogistic meaning of this statement leads us to think that the BJP was never a pro-Gorkhaland party, either then and now,” Bajgain said, underlining that he and Raju Bista, the BJP Lok Sabha member from Darjeeling, won the elections in 2021 and 2019, respectively by promising before their constituents that their long-standing demand for Gorkhaland would be met.Bajgain’s letter, however, did not specify what he meant by Gorkhaland, a demand for which the Darjeeling hills have witnessed several violent agitations and numerous deaths since the 1980s and is often seen to reflect the demand for a separate state.To be sure, the BJP has never said it will form a separate state. In its 2019 manifesto, the party only promised to find “a permanent political solution”. But its leaders, as Bajgain indicated, have gone a step further during elections. BJP’s Lok Sabha member John Barla raised the demand for the formation of a separate state or Union Territory comprising districts in north Bengal in June this year. But his party promptly and explicitly distanced itself.Asked about the BJP legislator’s condemning his statement, Sukanta Majumdar said he appeared to have been “misinformed”.“I think he has been misinformed. I uttered those words in response to a question and against the statement made by Mamata Banerjee. She said we are separatists and we want to split the hills from the rest of Bengal. She is putting the blame on us when she herself agreed to use the word Gorkhaland when the tripartite GTA Agreement was signed in July 2012,” the Bengal BJP chief said.During her Tuesday trip to Darjeeling, chief minister Mamata Banerjee also sought proposals from the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha and Bharatiya Gorkha Prajatantrik Morcha, parties that are allies of the Trinamool Congress. Both parties accuse the BJP-led Centre of misleading the Gorkhas during elections.On the other hand, pro-BJP parties, such as the Gorkha National Liberation Front and Communist Party of Revolutionary Marxists, which attended the tripartite meeting convened by Union home minister Amit Shah in Delhi on October 12, have expressed their faith in the BJP and the Centre. Majumdar said, “The BJP’s stand is loud and clear. We will provide a permanent political solution that will safeguard the interest of Gorkhas and benefit the state at the same time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-bjp-boss-rebuts-mamata-on-gorkhaland-his-mla-calls-it-unacceptable-101635524153831.html
29-10-2021||India||‘If he is uncomfortable...’: BJP MP slams Varun Gandhi for criticising party||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Harnath Singh Yadav on Friday said that it was not appropriate for BJP MP Varun Gandhi to speak against the party’s policies. He also said that Varun Gandhi should remember the time when his mother Maneka Gandhi first joined the BJP.“It looks like Varun Gandhi is feeling uncomfortable with the BJP. He should remember those days when he was a child and his grandmother threw out his mother. At that time, BJP was the only party that gave them protection. BJP later made him an MP and his mother a minister,” Yadav was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Yadav alleged that Gandhi was speaking against the party’s policies.“Varun Gandhi is speaking against the party policies this way. It is not appropriate and I think he has made a different line of his own,” Yadav said. He said that BJP ‘gave so much’ to Varun.These comments from the fellow parliamentarian come weeks after Varun Gandhi was critical of the government regarding farm laws and the Lakhimpur Kheri incident where eight people died among whom four were farmers. Varun Gandhi called for “accountability for the innocent blood of farmers” after posting a purported video of the incident.Varun Gandhi also said that legal guarantee of the minimum support price (MSP) is required in order to stop exploitation of farmers in mandis.“Till there is no statutory guarantee of MSP, farmers will continue to be exploited in mandis. Strict action should be taken on this,” he said.The Pilibhit MP said that farmers in Uttar Pradesh did not receive fair remuneration for their crops and urged the Yogi Adityanath-led state government to give farmers their due. These comments from Varun Gandhi come at a time when the BJP is gearing up to fight and retain power in Uttar Pradesh, an election which is considered as a semi-final to the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. He and his mother, Maneka Gandhi, were also excluded from the BJP's new national executive committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-he-is-uncomfortable-bjp-mp-slams-varun-gandhi-for-criticising-party-101635523546420.html

All in all, Jammu and Kashmir is peaceful except for a few incidents,” Singh said adding that the confidence of enablers of terrorism in Kashmir is also low.“It is true that our enemy forces are fidgety. I can say with certainty that terrorists' confidence has been broken in Kashmir Valley,” he said. “Now the situation has changed. Our government has said clearly that terrorism and talks cannot go hand in hand. For the last few years, we have stopped having any talks with Pakistan,” he said crediting PM Modi for redefining the fight against terrorism.Singh was addressing an event “Delivering Democracy; Two Decades of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as Head of Government” organised by the Rambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini at India International Centre.The defence minister said India will achieve the target of ₹3,500 crore export. “We were the biggest importer in the world in terms of Defence equipment. We are now among the top 25 exporters of the world. We will soon achieve the target of ₹3500 crore export,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.He also said that PM Modi is ‘24-carat gold’. “True leadership is identified by its intent and integrity and in both cases, Modiji is 24-carat gold.

Designed and developed by DRDO’s Research Centre Imarat (RCI), the LR Bomb can carry a warhead of 1000 kilograms.Using laser guidance, the bomb hit a target range inside the sea around 11.00am, meeting all mission objectives successfully.From the Kargil war to Operation Bandar in Balakot in 2019, India in the past has been using Israeli laser-guided bombs. The successful test of the LR Bomb makes India capable of staying well within its territory and hitting enemy targets at 100 kilometres with high accuracy.The successful flight test of the LR Bomb comes a day after India tested DRDO Smart Anti-Airfield Weapon (SAAW) from the Pokhran range. It is capable of hitting ground targets up to a range of 100 kilometres. Designed to disable airfield runways, SAAW can carry a warhead of 125 kg. DRDO had last tested the anti-airfield weapon in January.The successful tests can prove to be a force multiplier and major boost to the Indian Armed Forces, especially at a time China has been posturing aggressively in the region.Defence minister Rajnath Singh congratulated DRDO, IAF and other teams associated with successful flight tests.Last Friday, the DRDO successfully flight-tested Abhyas High-speed Expendable Aerial Target (HEAT) from the Integrated Test Range in Chandipur, Odisha. The defence ministry said that the indigenous unmanned aerial vehicle will meet the requirements of HEAT for the armed forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-1st-long-range-1-ton-guided-bomb-test-fired-hits-target-100-km-away-101635521080880.html

The flight of the bomb and the performance was monitored by a number of range sensors including Electro Optical Tracking System (EOTS), Telemetry and radar deployed by the Integrated Test Range, Chandipur in Odisha,” the ministry said.Also read | India successfully test-fires Agni-5 missileThe bomb was designed and developed by the Research Centre Imarat (RCI), a DRDO laboratory in Hyderabad, Telangana, in coordination with other DRDO laboratories. The RCI lab is involved in the research and development (R&D) of avionics systems.Meanwhile, Union defence minister Rajnath Singh has conveyed his congratulations to the DRDO, the IAF and the other teams involved in the trial flight, the ministry said. Singh said that the feat will prove to be a “force multiplier for the Indian Armed Forces.”Also, G Satheesh Reddy, chairman of the DRDO, said that the successful test flight of the indigenously developed LR Bomb has “marked an important milestone” in the indigenous development of this class of weapon systems.The development came a few days after the country successfully test fired the Agni-5 missile, from the APJ Abdul Kalam Island off the coast of Odisha. The ministry said that the missile was capable of hitting targets at ranges upto 5,000kms “with very high degree of accuracy.”“The successful test of Agni-5 is in line with India’s stated policy to have ‘credible minimum deterrence’ that underpins the commitment to ‘No First Use’,” the ministry said earlier in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-iaf-successfully-flight-tests-indigenous-long-range-bombs-defence-minister-rajnath-singh-lauds-feat-101635520444746.html
29-10-2021||India||India, Israel to work on 10-year roadmap for defence cooperation||The India-Israel joint working group (JWG) on defence cooperation has decided to set up a task force to put together a comprehensive 10-year roadmap to identify new areas of collaboration, the defence ministry said on Friday. Israel has been among India’s top three arms suppliers for the last five years, according to a report published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) in March 2021. Israel accounted for 13% of India’s imports during 2016-20 after Russia (49%) and France (18%). The decision to form the task force to identify new areas of cooperation for the next decade was taken during the 15th JWG meeting co-chaired by defence secretary Ajay Kumar and the Director-General of Israel’s Ministry of Defence, Maj Gen Amir Eshel (retd) earlier this week. “The two sides reviewed the progress made in military-to-military engagements including exercises and industry cooperation. The co-chairs were apprised of the progress made by the sub-working groups (SWGs) on defence procurement and production and research and development,” the ministry said in a statement. India and Israel also agreed to form an SWG on defence industry cooperation for efficient utilisation of resources, effective flow of technologies and sharing industrial capabilities, officials said. In September, the Indian Air Force inducted a medium-range surface-to-air-missile (MRSAM) system capable of knocking out aerial threats such as enemy fighter jets, missiles, helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles at a range of 70 km. India and Israel have jointly developed the MRSAM or the Barak 8 air defence system that includes advanced radar, command and control systems, and mobile launchers. The missile is powered by a locally-developed rocket motor and control system for high manoeuvrability in the terminal phase. The system has been developed jointly by the Israel Aerospace Industries and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). Other firms involved in the project include Israeli firm Rafael, Bharat Electronics Limited, Bharat Dynamics Limited and Larsen & Toubro. A naval version of the MRSAM is already deployed on a few Indian warships to boost their anti-air warfare capabilities while the army has also placed orders for the MRSAM but it has not yet inducted the system, as previously reported by Hindustan Times. India and Israel have inked separate deals worth around $3 billion over the last four years for advanced surface-to-air missile systems for the three services. The ongoing border conflict with China in Ladakh forced India last year to speed up the purchase of military hardware from several countries including Israel, officials said. India is sourcing from Israel the Firefly loitering ammunition, Spike anti-tank guided missiles, Spice guidance kits that can be mounted on standard bombs to convert them into smart weapons and an operational surface-to-air missile system as a 2017 order worth $2 billion for such advanced systems to take down hostile aircraft and missiles didn’t translate into deliveries. India is also seeking greater participation of Israeli defence companies in the defence manufacturing sector under the new liberalised foreign direct investment (FDI) regime, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-israel-to-work-on-10-year-roadmap-for-defence-cooperation-101635521274759.html
29-10-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: October 30, 2005 — Delhi’s worst terror attacks kill 57, injure 153 just before Diwali||BY 7 p.m. on Saturday, two days before Diwali, most marketplaces in Delhi wore a deserted look. Paharganj and Sarojini Nagar, two of the big shopping hubs, were still noisy —but with wails and the blaring siren of the ambulance.Delhi was hit thrice between 5.30 p.m. and 6 p.m., in what seems to be a coordinated terrorist strike which left at least 57 dead and 153 injured. It was the biggest terrorist strike ever in Delhi.It came within five months of the bomb blasts at two cinema halls and unlike the last time, the Delhi Police had been on high alert following intelligence inputs of a possible strike.Intelligence agencies say the Saturday blasts were carried out by terrorist outfits based inPoK. “They were desperate tomake their presence felt after the earthquake,” an officer said. The blasts are also being linked to the court judgment in the Red Fort attack case, the sentence of which was to be made on Saturday but was deferred to Monday.The targets had been chosen carefully for maximum impact — a jampacked DTC bus and the markets in Paharganj and Sarojini Nagar.The first blast took place at 5.38 p.m. in front of the Chhah Tooti Chowk in Paharganj’s Nehru Market. Police suspect the bomb was planted on a chaat stall or a rickshaw outside a jewellery shop.But it was at Sarojini Nagar’s mini market where the casualty was maximum— 37. Forensicexperts were investigating whether it was a cylinder blast, but the police said the timing and location suggested the involvement of terrorists.By evening, the administration was fighting on several fronts — including blood shortage in hospitals. Raids were on to nab suspects and security was beefed up at DTC and Metro. Plastic explosives were seized from a house in Chandni Chowk and 10 persons were detained.The case has been handed over to the Special Cell of Delhi Police. After a series of meetings, it was decided that additional reinforcements would be deployed for the rest of the festive season extending till Christmas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-october-30-2005-delhi-s-worst-terror-attacks-kill-57-injure-153-just-before-diwali-101635519663006.html

Kashif Khan is a senior executive of Fashion TV and admitted that he was present on the cruise at the party but only as a client. "I am not an organiser of this cruise or the party. The allegations are baseless. The organisers are from Delhi and they have already been detained and questioned. I have nothing to do with them," he said.He also said that he does not know Sameer Wankhede, the Mumbai zone chief of the Narcotics Control Bureau, personally. He claimed he has never spoken to Wankhede. ""I do not even know the NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede. I have never spoken to him in my life. I really do not understand that why Minister Nawab Malik has made such allegations against me. He will be the only person to explain it," Khan said to ANI. Video of Kashif khan dancing on the Cruise ship pic.twitter.com/JoSsYF9Ux1Recounting what happened on October 2 night, he said, "I didn't even realise that the cruise was raided I had been told that some people tried to board the cruise illegally and later they were offloaded. I always thought that the cruise is legal and have cleared all the permissions so we boarded the cruise."Nawab Malik has been raising questions over why no action has been taken against the organiser of the cruise party. In his press meet, the minister also took Kashif Khan's name as one of the organisers. Then he posted a purported video of Kashif Khan on the cruise.Sameer Wankhede has replied to the allegation of Nawab Malik that the organisers of the party were let go as they were known to Wankhede and said it is a lie. "Absolutely a lie and I can't comment. Law will take its own course," Wankhede said.The drugs-on-cruise case took a murky turn with several allegations being levelled against investigator Sameer Wankhede. NCB and Mumbai Police are looking into the allegations, while Aryan Khan, Arbaaz Merchant, Munmun Dhamecha have got bail but are yet to come out of jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wasnt-organiser-of-cruise-party-says-kashif-khan-as-nawab-malik-posts-video-101635519280966.html

29-10-2021||India||Suspension on International flights extended till November 30||India extended the ban on scheduled international commercial passenger flights until November 30, the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) announced on Friday. The DGCA earlier extended the ban till October 31 last month. Similar to the previous order, the DGCA will not restrict international all-cargo operations and flights specifically approved by DGCA.In the circular, it also stated that international scheduled flights may be allowed on selected routes by the competent authority on a case to case basis.India however reopened for tourists earlier this month. India has begun granting fresh tourist visas to foreigners starting October 15. The Union home ministry earlier in October also allowed foreign tourists to enter the country by flights other than chartered aircraft starting November 15.The MHA said that the decision was taken in a bid to boost the slumping tourism sector and help the economic recovery. The tourism and aviation sector were among the largest casualties of the Covid-19 pandemic.Some airports have already started registering growth in passenger traffic in August. Though the growth was recorded in the domestic passenger segment. Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) saw a four-fold growth in passenger traffic in August indicating that travel was rising among Indians.However, a report by credit ratings agency ICRA said that the Indian aviation sector could still incur losses worth ₹26,000 cr in FY22. The report earlier said that the industry will also need an additional funding of ₹45,000-47,000 crore over FY2022 to FY2024.The civil aviation ministry in a bid to help the aviation sector allowed domestic flights to fly at full capacity starting last week. “The airlines/airport operators shall, however, ensure that the guidelines to contain the spread of COVID are strictly adhered to and COVID appropriate behaviour is strictly enforced,” the ministry said.India’s domestic air passenger traffic marginally 2-3% around 69 lakh in September seeing a rise of 2 lakh from August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suspension-on-international-flights-extended-till-november-30-101635517287839.html
29-10-2021||India||Air India pilots asks aviation minister to roll back Covid related pay cuts||Air India Boeing and Airbus pilots’ unions (Indian Pilots’ Guild and Indian Commercial Pilots’ Association) have collectively written to aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia asking him to remove the Covid-19 pay cut that is still been levied on them. The two airline pilots’ unions earlier wrote individually but did not receive any response from their respective managements. With this joint letter to the minister, people familiar with the development said that the pilots want the ministry to restore their salaries to pre-privatisation days.The aviation industry in India seems to be back on track with domestic air traffic increasing from 25% in April 2020 to 100% as of October 2021. With the opening up of international borders for India, there seems to be an increase in international travel as well.“This ground reality has duly been acknowledged by other airlines who have rightfully rolled back the Covid austerity pay cuts significantly for their pilots. In stark contrast, our management is still content hiding behind the Covid-19 pandemic. The massive pay cut of up to 60% for Air India pilots has dramatically diminished our livelihoods. Looking at the current aviation industry standards, the continuation of the pay cut does not merit any justification,” read the letter dated October 28.The airline pilots said that they have been patient and have shown restraint to ensure smooth flight operations. They also reiterated that they have gone beyond the call of duty during the pandemic, risking life and limb to ensure the success of the government’s Vande Bharat Mission (VBM).“We request that you respect our sacrifices and years of faithful service to the National Carrier before handing us over. We would like to think that if not a graceful send-off, we have at least earned the right to a better legacy than our own management stealing our hard-earned money with impunity,” the letter read.Before this, the pilots Boeing union, the Indian Pilots’ Guild (IPG), wrote letters to the airline management on October 1 and 7 but did not get any response.Hence, demanding the rolling back of the pay cut, the pilots said, “We have given the management every benefit of the doubt and ample time to redress the disproportionate pay cut for the pilots. They refuse to part from a practised indifference and have only weak excuses to offer. Every day, this draconian pay cut continues and is a humiliation to our efforts towards the ongoing VBM and the dignity of our profession.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-pilots-asks-aviation-minister-to-roll-back-covid-related-pay-cuts-101635514854601.html

According to reports, the physical copy of the release order has to reach the 'bail box' outside the prison by 5.30pm to make sure that release is done on the same day. Jail superintendent Nitin Waychal said jail officials wait until 5.35pm, but if the release order reaches the prison after 5.35pm, then the case gets transferred to the next morning.“We won’t give special treatment for anyone. The law is the same for all. The deadline for receiving the bail papers was 5.30 pm. That has passed. He won’t be released today,” an official told PTI.With this last-minute delay, Aryan Khan is expected to finally walk out of the jail on Saturday morning, reports said.It was a hectic day for Aryan Khan's lawyers as they have been preparing to proceed with the paperwork throughout the day. The Bombay high court issued the bail conditions after 2.30pm in which it said that Aryan Khan, Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha will have to provide a personal bond of ₹1 lakh. As his lawyers rushed to the NDPS court to get the release order, Bollywood actor Juhi Chawla reached the court premises to by Aryan Khan's 'surety'. She was presented in the court and after the court approved her documents, she signed the ₹1 lakh bond for Aryan Khan's release.What is the 5.30 deadline of Arthur Road Prison?There is a bail box outside the premises of the prison which is opened twice -- at 10.30am and 5.30pm. If it is towards the end of the day, the physical copy of the release order from the court has to be dropped in the box by 5.30pm. Then only the release can be made in the evening. Once this deadline is missed, the bail box will be opened the next day at 10.30am. In Aryan Khan's case, the formalities of the prison will begin on Saturday after 10.30am and will take another hour. Aryan Khan's release on Friday was much awaited after he has been lodged in jail since October 8. On Thursday (October 28), the Bombay high court finally granted him bail, though the bail conditions were not mentioned. As the bail conditions were not out till 2.30pm on Friday, Aryan Khan's lawyers could not proceed with the paperwork. However, as soon as the Bombay high court published the bail orders, the lawyers dived into action and actor Juhi Chawala reached the court to be Aryan Khan's surety. Aryan Khan's team of lawyers were hopeful and were pushing hard to secure his release on Friday itself. Aryan Khan's lawyers were hopeful that a "postponement till 7pm" of the deadline of Arthur Road Jail was possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aryan-khan-won-t-be-released-today-say-jail-authorities-101635510601772.html
29-10-2021||India||Draft amendments to juvenile justice model rules published||The union women and child development ministry on Thursday published the draft amendments to the juvenile justice model rules 2016 for ensuring greater scrutiny of child care institutions (CCIs) and stricter norms for the constitution of child welfare committees (CWCs). It has sought suggestions and comments from the stakeholders.The draft amendments have been published three months after Parliament passed the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Amendment Act. The rules have been revised in accordance with the amended law that increased the powers of district magistrates (DMs) and additional district magistrates (ADMs) in child care and adoption processes. The law permits them to issue adoption orders, a power that was formerly reserved only with the courts. This has been done to ensure speedy disposal of adoption cases and enhance accountability.The rules have been drafted after taking suggestions from states, union territories, and child rights bodies including the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights.According to the proposed amendments to the rules, the DMs and ADMs have been empowered to ensure smooth implementation of the amendment law and also independently evaluate the functioning of District Child Protection Units, Child Welfare Committees, Juvenile Justice Boards, Specialised Juvenile Police Units, Child Care Institutions, etc. The DMs may also be allowed to create a district-level juvenile justice fund.Under the amended norms, the DMs have also been given the responsibility to take measures to expedite the process of adoption of children declared legally free for adoption by a CCI and the specialised adoption agencies.The proposed rules say any CCI will be registered on the basis of the recommendations of the DM. “The DM will verify credibility, background and previous record of the Child Care Institution and the agency/individual promoting the institution and make specific recommendations to the state government for consideration,” say the draft rules.To ensure greater scrutiny of CCIs, the amendments propose that in case any institute commits any offence under the law, the district child welfare committees or board may pass appropriate orders for placing the children in any other institution or agency and recommend the cancellation of the registration and withdrawal of recognition of such institution or agency to the DM.“The DM including ADM may ensure transfer of children and closure of guilty institutions within seven days under intimation to the State Government,” the draft rules say. The seven-day time frame was not there earlier. The draft rules also propose that cameras should be installed at the key positions in all CCIs.The proposed amendments lay down strict norms for the composition of the CWCs. Anyone having past record of violation of human or child rights or child abuse or employment of child labour, or immoral act, etc will be ineligible for selection as a member of the committee.“Any person responsible for receiving foreign contributions in individual capacity or in an organisation, shall not be eligible to be a chairperson or member of the committee,” the proposed rules say.The ministry has published the draft rules on its website and asked the stakeholders to send suggestions and comments regarding them by November 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/draft-amendments-to-juvenile-justice-model-rules-published-101635509752699.html
29-10-2021||India||‘Now will sell crops in front of Parliament’: Tikait on removal of barricades||Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson Rakesh Tikait on Friday said that since the barricades were removed from the Ghazipur, farmers will now go to Parliament to sell their crops.Tikait was reacting to Delhi Police’s decision to remove barricades from the Ghazipur border where farmers’ unions were protesting against the Centre's farm laws for more than 11 months.“The PM said that farmers can sell crops anywhere. Now we will tell the farmers where to sell the crops whose harvest remains unsold. If roads are open, we will go to Delhi. We will go to Parliament to sell our crop,” Tikait was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.“They removed barriers which they put up earlier. The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha will take a decision and then proceed accordingly. We were sitting here for the last 11 months asking to go to Delhi. We were not being allowed. We will now go to Delhi to sell our harvest. First, our tractors will go to Delhi,” Tikait said.Delhi Police started removing barricades placed at the Tikri and Ghazipur borders where farmers were protesting against the Centre's three farm laws which they claim will give the private sector more control over the agricultural sector and lead to a rise in contract farming. The government on the contrary believes that the laws will double farmer incomes and will help the farmer to reach a broader market.On Thursday, JCB machines started removing the barricades placed by the Delhi Police. The Supreme Court during a hearing on traffic-related difficulties in the Tikri border area said that it was the authorities who stopped the traffic, not the protesters. The Supreme Court on October 21 said that the aggrieved farmers’ rights groups have the right to protest but roads cannot be blocked indefinitely while hearing a plea against the blockade of roads between Delhi to Noida due to the protests.The police earlier this year placed elaborate barricades on the roads, along with giant nails and huge concrete blocks and barbed wire, in a bid to stop farmers from entering the Capital to protest against the laws.The impasse continues despite several meetings held between the government and the farmers’ rights activists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/now-will-sell-crops-in-front-of-parliament-tikait-on-removal-of-barricades-101635507686798.html
29-10-2021||India||BJP using NCB to target Maharashtra and Bollywood, claims minister Nawab Malik||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik on Friday urged the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) to probe the 26 cases brought forward by an anonymous employee of the agency. Malik also reiterated his demand for action against Fashion TV executive Kashiff Khan, who he claimed organised a cruise ship rave party that was raided by NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede’s team on October 2, leading to the arrest of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan the next day in the case.Kashiff Khan has refuted all the allegations and said that the minister has been misled and misinformed by someone. He also said that he is not the organizer of any party at the cruise and Fashion TV was the official sponsor of the event. He also clarified that he has no relation with Wankhede as claimed by Malik.He also revealed that Kiran Gosavi, a witness in the Aryan Khan drugs case who was arrested in a cheating case in Pune, is linked with a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader. Malik claimed that Gosavi is a partner in a private firm along with the BJP leader and his wife. He, however, has withheld the name of the BJP leader and said it will be disclosed during the winter session of the state legislature commencing from December 7. He also said that the BJP is conspiring with the narcotics control bureau (NCB) to defame Maharashtra, its government, Mumbai and its Film industry.Malik had earlier claimed that BJP office-bearer Manish Bhanushali is a witness in the Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan drug bust case. Bhanushali was seen bringing Arbaaz Merchant, another accused arrested along with Aryan Khan, at the NCB Mumbai office in a video clip that went viral.“One Shekhar Kamble, a witness in one of the 26 cases, has narrated how the NCB official framed an innocent Nigerian citizen after the raid failed to catch the drug peddler… Not all Nigerians are drug peddlers. I have written a to the NCB chief referring to the statement of Kamble and request him to probe the cases as they are serious in nature. Nabbing offenders is the responsibility of NCB but if innocents are being framed then a probe shall be conducted. Those who are innocent should get justice while those who have framed them should be brought to justice,” he added.later in the day, Malik sent a letter to NCB, director-general, SN Pradhan seeking a probe into the allegations made in the letter. “The NCB has said it will not take cognisance of the anonymous letter purportedly written by an NCB employee as the Central Vigilance Commission guidelines are against it. However, the claims related to 26 cases by the NCB are very serious in nature and more than 100 innocent people booked over the cases are behind bars,” Malik said.“Kiran Gosavi is a director in a private limited company along with a BJP leader and his wife. I am not taking their name, if taken, they will approach the court giving various reasons hence it will be disclosed during the winter session of the state assembly in reply to the allegations to be made by BJP. I have more explosive information, if disclosed they will not be able to show their faces to the people… Many people have drug connections and I am collecting the evidence. Many big names will come out in the winter session,” he said, refusing to disclose a name.Malik also said that Wankhede is a puppet in the hands of BJP, which does now want their ‘parrot’ to speak out, otherwise, the party will be in trouble. He said if investigated Kashiff Khan will spill the beans hinting at his alleged connections with Wankhede and BJP leaders.“These are malicious allegations to target my reputation. They are false and are being levelled for the first time in the 15 years of my service. I condemn the attempt in strong words,” Wankhede said. Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis refused to speak on the allegations levelled by Nawab Malik. “Malik keeps speaking the entire day as he does not have anything else to do. There is no need to react to his every comment. He is a ‘parrot’ of NCP. Malik may be important for you (the media) not us,” he said.BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said, “He (Nawab Malik) should tell the name first and then make the allegations. Making an allegation without revealing a name is not right,” Upadhye said, responding to the allegation.Malik also claimed that Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath wants to build a film city in his state and the move behind attempts is to defame Bollywood. “UP CM Yogi ji wants to make a film city in Uttar Pradesh. He met a few people at Hotel Taj in Mumbai. Those who support the BJP met him. They believe Bollywood will be shifted out of Mumbai, if defamed,” Malik said.“They (BJP) don’t know that great personalities such as Dadasaheb Phalke, V Shantaram, many other Marathi actors, directors and other personalities contributed to the formation of Bollywood. It takes our culture and tradition to the world. It employs lakhs of people. If they believe that by defaming Bollywood, Yogi Maharaj can create UPwood then they are mistaken,” he said making the accusation.“The state government has failed in running the administration. They have failed to sort out any major issue and thus allegations are made only to mislead people,” Upadhye said.“I have spoken about a man with a beard and that person is Kashiff Khan. He arranges fashion shows in which drugs are served. He runs a sex racket and is involved in pornography. He is the one who has organized a program at a cruise and people were invited by posting invitations on the social media platforms. I have got a video of the event organized by Kashiff Khan on October 3 (Sunday) at 6.30pm which was posted on a website. He is having good relations with Wankhede. I have raised the question as to why this honest officer (Sameer Wankhede) is not arresting Kashiff Khan, if arrested he will spill the beans,” the NCP leader alleged.They claimed to have the information of the rave party a month in advance and the organiser who has a criminal background was not investigated. No scanning of around 1,300 people present on the cruise, no detention, means there is some relation. It will come out after the probe. If Kashiff Khan is arrested many will be exposed. How much money he has, of how many people and what all he does for them everything,” he added.Terming the allegations as baseless, Kashiff Khan told a news channel that he has nothing to do with any kind of drugs or any drugs substances as he doesn’t smoke even a cigarette. “Nawab Malik is very misled and misinformed. I think he has all the wrong information. I would like to state categorically that I have nothing to do with any kinds of drugs or any drugs substances. All the allegations and baseless comments are completely false and I am not aware why he is doing that. I neither know Malik nor have I ever met him. I also don’t know why he is dragging me into all this but I am sure there is some misunderstanding from his end. The one, whom he has been informed by, is giving wrong information,” Khan told ABP Majha on Friday.He maintained that he didn’t know Wankhede and had never met him. “I am not aware of any kind of association, friendship, talks, calls with Mr (Sameer) Wankhede,” he stressed. He said that the firm that organized the event is from Delhi and are already booked and arrested. “I have paid for everything including food and beverages with my credit card with duly taxes paid and I have all the bills and invoices. I am also ready to prove this on any forum.”Responding to the claims by Wankhede’s family that his family was being personally targeted by Malik, the minister defended his position, saying didn’t say a word about Wankhede’s wife Kranti Redkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-using-ncb-to-target-maharashtra-and-bollywood-claims-minister-nawab-malik-101635508612837.html
29-10-2021||India||Finance ministry releases ₹44,000 crore GST compensation to boost growth||The union finance ministry on Thursday released ₹44,000 crore back-to-back loans to states - the final instalment of ₹1.59 lakh crore estimated Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall for 2021-22 - with an aim to front-load public expenditure and boost growth.The latest instalment has been issued three weeks after the Centre released ₹40,000 crore on October 7. Earlier, the finance ministry released the first instalment of ₹75,000 crore on July 15, according to an official statement.After GST collections fell sharply due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the 68-day nationwide lockdown from March 25 last year, the union government in 2020 devised a back-to-back borrowing mechanism to make up for the states’ revenue losses.Also Read: Sensex, Nifty bounce back after opening in red but remain volatileThe borrowing mechanism, which was proposed by the Centre and eventually agreed upon by all states last year, is facilitated through a special window of the Reserve Bank of India. The money is collectively borrowed on behalf of states with an assurance that both the principal and the interest would be repaid from the GST compensation cess fund.Under this arrangement, states received ₹1.10 lakh crore to meet their revenue shortfall in 2020-21 and a ₹1.59 lakh borrowing plan was approved for the current fiscal year at the 43rd meeting of the GST Council on May 28.“This release [of ₹44,000 crore] is in addition to normal GST compensation being released every two months out of actual cess collection,” the statement said.At the time of introducing the new indirect tax regime in July 2017, the GST law assured states a 14% increase in their annual revenue for five years (up to 2022), and assured them that their revenue shortfall would be made good through the compensation cess levied on luxury goods and sin products such as liquor, cigarettes, aerated water, automobiles, coal and tobacco.“This amount of ₹1.59 lakh crore [for 2021-22] would be over and above the compensation in excess of ₹1 lakh crore (based on cess collection) that is estimated to be released to states/UTs with legislature during this financial year. The sum total of ₹2.59 lakh crore is expected to exceed the amount of GST compensation accruing in FY 2021-22,” the statement said.“For effective response and management of Covid-19 pandemic and a step-up in capital expenditure all states and UTs have a very important role to play. For assisting the states/UTs in their endeavour, Ministry of Finance has frontloaded the release of assistance under the back-to-back loan facility during FY 2021-22 of ₹1,59,000 crore,” it added.The release of ₹44,000 crore being made now is funded from borrowings of the union government in five-year securities issued in the current financial year, at a weighted average yield of 5.69%. No additional market borrowing by the central government is envisaged on account of this release, it said.It is expected that this release will help states in planning their public expenditure among other things, for improving, health infrastructure and taking up infrastructure projects, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/finance-ministry-releases-44-000-crore-gst-compensation-to-boost-growth-101635508493122.html

29-10-2021||India||Women cadets to be welcomed with sense of fair play, professionalism: Army chief||Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Friday said women cadets are expected to be welcomed with the same sense of fair play and professionalism at the National Defence Academy (NDA) as men.“As we open the portals of the NDA for women cadets, we expect you to welcome them with the same sense of fair play and professionalism as Indian armed forces are known globally,” he said after reviewing a parade of the 141st course at the NDA.The Centre in September told the Supreme Court that the NDA will be ready to welcome its first ever batch of women cadets in January 2023 after they sit for the entrance exam in May next year. This came a month after the court directed that women can also sit for the examination while holding that the policy that restricts their entry into the elite institution is based on “gender discrimination”.Naravane said the induction of women will be the “first step towards gender equality” in the armed forces. He added that women officers will be in the same position 40 years later that he is in now. Watch: Army chief at NDA’s passing out parade, sets tone for women cadets’ 1st batchNaravane said he is confident that women cadets will perform better than their male counterparts. “Over the years, as we have grown and matured, as the curriculum has changed, training methodology has changed, the course content has improved. We have become more well-trained and better-equipped to meet whatever challenges that emerge. As we go ahead, we shall be inducting women cadets into the academy,” he said. “As a result of this, they will also get empowered. They will hold more challenging assignments.”Naravane said the army already has women officers undergoing training at Officers Training Academy in Chennai. “They are exceedingly doing well and I am sure that the academy will continue to prosper and flourish and bring fame and glory.”In his address earlier to the cadets, he said, “A little over 42 years back when I stood at the same drill square today as you stand today, little could I have imagined that one day I would be reviewing this magnificent parade. It brings to mind that the more things change, the more they remain the same.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/women-cadets-to-be-welcomed-with-sense-of-fair-play-professionalism-army-chief-101635507592664.html

29-10-2021||India||Amit Shah sets stage for 2022 UP polls, says ‘300+ seats once more’||Union home minister Amit Shah set the tone for the 2022 Uttar Pradesh elections by coining the slogan “ek baar phir se 300 paar (once more 300+ seats)” and urged the people to re-elect the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to power and Yogi Adityanath as the chief minister in Uttar Pradesh. Shah was at the launch of the party’s membership drive - ‘mera pariwar, bhajapa pariwar (my family, BJP family)’ in Lucknow on Friday. Lauding CM Adityanath’s handling of the Covid surge in the state, Shah lashed out at what he described as ‘Akhilesh and company, behenji and Gandhi-Vadra pariwar’ – the three main political players, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and the Congress - while seeking people’s blessings for another five years for the party. “We have done a lot in these five years. But these political parties have left such big holes behind that filling them would require some more time. UP will set the stage for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. I have come here to appeal to you to give another chance to Modi ji and help make Yogi ji chief minister again and that is why we are saying once more go past 300 seats,” Shah said at a well-attended public meeting at Vrindavan’s Sector 17 Colony Defence Expo grounds in Lucknow. In 2017, the BJP won 312 seats in the UP assembly. Its ally Apna Dal bagged nine seats while former ally Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party managed to win four seats, making it a heady 325 seat win. It was only the third time in the state’s history that a political party crossed the 300-mark in the 403-member assembly. Twice during his address, Shah, who is expected to visit UP twice in November, urged the people to help make Yogi the chief minister again. Within the party, this reference didn’t go unnoticed with some party leaders taking it as a hint of party leadership’s continued backing of the chief minister. Yogi Adityanath’s continuation, as the chief ministerial candidate ahead of the polls, was subject to much speculation in May-June.Shah’s address was sprinkled with remarks on the Ayodhya Ram temple and the exodus of Hindus from Kairana in western UP. He said the temple issue got a clear resolution under the leadership of PM Modi. “Kairana palayan se mere khoon kholta tha… par ab palayan karane wale ab palayan kar rahe (my blood boiled at the Kairana exodus.. but those who forced the exodus have now fled themselves)” he said. “UP is the land of Baba Vishwanath, the birthplace of Lord Ram and Krishna but for the first time since the Mughal rule, the state seems to have got its identity back,” he said. Hailed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the ‘man of the series’ for the party’s win in 2017 UP polls, Shah also launched the Modi 11 app, an online platform to help people connect with the party. He said that the membership drive would continue till year-end during which party cadres would be tasked with decorating people’s homes with ‘mera pariwar, bhajapa pariwar’ door hangings. “I was the UP BJP in-charge during the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and then saw the 2017 UP polls as well as the 2019 Lok Sabha elections as the BJP chief. Each time, we began by launching the membership drive and so is it this time. Our opponents ask us why we need a membership drive as we already have 1.86 crore members. I would say, unlike them who do politics solely for power, we do it to connect with the masses. This outreach would help us gather feedback that would go into planning our manifesto for 2022 polls,” he said. “We believe in family planning but we relax this definition when it comes to expanding our BJP family,” he added. “Governments are not meant for family benefits. They are meant to help the poorest of the poor. We are willing to give an account of our term in power but Akhilesh babu, I surely would like to ask you how much time did you spend in a foreign land, where were you during Covid-19 and floods? These politicians and parties have worked for themselves, their families or at the most, their caste. But, the Modi government has worked for the poorest of the poor, Dalits, tribals, women, backwards,” he said. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, as well as other leaders, hailed Shah as an astute planner and said that the Modi-Shah combination has pitchforked the country into the expressway of progress. Through the day, Shah is set to have a series of crucial meetings including those with Lok Sabha poll in-charges of 2019 Lok Sabha win, former lawmakers and party leaders. Shah is to spend the night at the BJP office in Lucknow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-sets-stage-for-2022-up-polls-says-300-seats-once-more-101635504474402.html

29-10-2021||India||Deaths in Bundelkhand: Priyanka Gandhi alleges black marketing of fertilisers||Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Friday demanded a probe into the alleged complicity of government officials in black marketing of fertilisers in Uttar Pradesh’s Bundelkhand region as their shortage has been linked to the deaths of at least four farmers there. “Whatever the officers have done here [in Lalitpur, Bundelkhand] is wrong. If there is any nexus of officers and leaders with those indulging in black marketing of fertilisers, it should be probed. Why are the people not getting the fertilisers here?” Priyanka Gandhi told journalists after meeting the families of the four farmers, who died in Lalitpur amid the fertiliser shortage.Priyanka Gandhi, who arrived in Lalitpur from Lucknow on an overnight train, assured the families of the farmers that she would fight for their cause.Also Read: ‘Twitter Vadra’: UP deputy CM Maurya’s latest jibe at Priyanka GandhiIn a statement, the Congress party said, “Bhogi Pal and Mahesh Kumar of Bundelkhand were standing in queue to get fertilisers. As they did not get fertilisers for some days, their health condition deteriorated and they died. Soni Ahirwar and Babloo Pal were upset due to the non-availability of fertilisers and they committed suicide.” It added the farmers had loans to repay. “They were upset for not getting compensation for damage caused to their crops. Priyanka Gandhi has assured help to the families.”Priyanka Gandhi accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government of neglecting the farmers. “This is not about these four families. This is happening in the Bundelkhand region. Uttar Pradesh government’s cruel face has come to the fore. Farmers were crushed by the son of a union minister, who continues to be in office. Farmers are fighting for their cause from Lakhimpur Kheri to Bundelkhand,” she said.Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni’s son, Ashish Mishra, is the main accused in the violence that was triggered in Lakhimpur Kheri after a car ran over a group of protesting farmers.Farming groups say Teni’s Mahindra Thar mowed down protesters from behind while they were returning from a demonstration. A video clip that is yet to be authenticated forensically shows the same. The minister and his son have denied the charge.Priyanka Gandhi this month met families of the farmers killed in Lakhimpur Kheri even as she was earlier detained on her way there. She also met the kin of a sanitation worker, who allegedly died in police custody, in Agra.Priyanka Gandhi said no one is listening to the farmers. “They (the farmers) have loans to pay. They are not getting any fertilisers. They have to pay power bills without getting power,” she added and listed promises the Congress has made ahead of the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls due early next year.The pledges include farm loan waiver, minimum support price of ₹2,500 per quintal for wheat and paddy, and state advised price of ₹400 per quintal to sugarcane growers.BJP spokesman Avnish Tyagi insisted the interests of farmers are well protected under his party’s rule in Uttar Pradesh. “Priyanka Gandhi Vadra should look into issues concerning farmers of [Congress-ruled] Rajasthan. There is no shortage of fertilisers in the state. There may only be a minor issue somewhere.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deaths-in-bundelkhand-priyanka-gandhi-alleges-black-marketing-of-fertilisers-101635500632292.html

The MP, who is believed to have invoked the wrath of the BJP by his continuous criticism of the farm laws and the UP government, posted his video interacting with some officials, farmers. As he said that he will depute a representative there to report any evidence of corruption or ill-treatment to farmers and that in case of any irregularity, he will directly approach the court and won't make any request to the government, the people surrounding him clapped, the video showed."At every procurement centre in the state, there is crippling corruption which is completely out in the open. Farmers' grains are forcibly rejected after which they sell their produce out of desperation to middlemen. The administration takes a cut," he said alleging that the nexus between officials and middlemen which is forcing farmers to sell their grains at a much lower price will not be defeated unless there is a legal guarantee for the minimum support price.जब तक एमएसपी की वैधानिक गारंटी नहीं होगी, ऐसे ही मंडियों में किसानों का शोषण होता रहेगा। इस पर सख़्त से सख़्त कार्यवाही होनी चाहिए। pic.twitter.com/pWKI13e4VpFarmers will continue to be exploited in mandis as long as there is no legal guarantee for MSP, the MP said. As he interacted with the officials and the farmers, he said it is a shame for the UP government and the country that the farmers are setting their own produce on fire. A few days ago, the Pilibhit MP posted the video of a farmer burning his crop after failing to get it sold. Since the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP MP has been vocal against the UP government.Following his tweet on Lakhimpur Kheri violence, Varun Gandhi and Maneka Gandhi were dropped from the 80-member party national executive, though the party said it had nothing to do with Varun Gandhi's tweets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-go-to-court-not-govt-people-clap-as-varun-gandhi-takes-up-farm-issues-slams-up-govt-101635498064908.html

Together, we shall ensure that every single person in this nation sees the Dawn of Democracy that we have been waiting for since 2014!,” the TMC said in a tweet.We are extremely delighted to share that Shri @Leander joined us today in the presence of our Hon'ble Chairperson @MamataOfficial!Together, we shall ensure that every single person in this nation sees the Dawn of Democracy that we have been waiting for since 2014!The Bengal CM is currently on a two-day visit to the poll-bound coastal state where she is expected to meet with an array of people regarding the expansion of her party’s footprint in the state. She has already announced that her party would contest from all the seats in the upcoming assembly polls, making clear her national ambition.Welcoming the tennis star to her party, an elated Banerjee said Paes was like her younger brother. “I know him since I was the youth and sports minister of this country… I am too happy,” she said. “Thanks a lot, Leander. Thanks a lot for joining us,” she said, handing him over a party flag. The two leaders addressed the media following the event.During the press conference, Paes thanked the Bengal CM and fondly remembered memories about how Banerjee was “encouraging and supportive” when she was the sports minister. When asked about his plans for the state, he said, “I am very grateful for this opportunity from Didi… The vehicle that I chose for the last 30 years to do our people proud was Tennis. Now that I have retired from Tennis, the vehicle has changed… I would like to make a difference to the youth.” He also said that he has joined the TMC to “make a difference to our country.” He further heaped praises on Banerjee and called her a “true champion.”Earlier in the day, Bollywood actress Nafisa Ali and Mrinalini Deshprabhu also joined the TMC in the presence of the party chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tennis-player-leander-paes-joins-tmc-in-presence-of-mamata-banerjee-in-goa-101635494891131.html
29-10-2021||India||With 2022 assembly polls in mind, Amit Shah visits Uttar Pradesh||Union home minister Amit Shah arrived in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh on Friday for a two-day visit to launch a membership drive, flag off vehicles deployed to publicise government schemes, address the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) booth-level workers, and discuss the strategy for the assembly elections.People aware of the matter said Shah will have a series of meetings with the state BJP leadership to discuss the blueprint for the polls that are due early next year. He is expected to focus on the constituencies the BJP lost narrowly in the 2017 assembly polls when the BJP swept to power with 325 seats in the 403-member House. BJP managed to win just 47 seats in the 2012 assembly elections.Shah was the BJP’s Uttar Pradesh in-charge in 2017, and for the 2014 national polls when the party won 71 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state. Also Read: Diwali bonus: UP govt employees to get salary hike ahead of NovemberHe is also expected to discuss the entry of some opposition leaders into the BJP, the anti-incumbency factor, and the possible replacement of some lawmakers with younger leaders during his meetings with the state leadership.A BJP leader said Shah is no longer the Uttar Pradesh in-charge, or the chief of the party like he was in the 2019 national polls. “And yet, his arrival to prepare the blueprint for the party’s success indicates the kind of credibility he brings... as an astute planner and a great organisational leader... This visit by Shah would surely reveal what is on the party leadership’s mind,” said a BJP leader, requesting anonymity.A second leader said a key part of Shah’s plan is secrecy. “He ensures that internal discussions remain restricted to the party leaders... As a strategist, he surely does not wish to reveal his game plan to his opponents.” Shah is also expected to meet the in-charges of Lok Sabha constituencies, who helped the BJP overcome a formidable alliance between the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) by winning 64 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. He will also meet former lawmakers for their insights as the BJP is holding caste conferences across the state.Irshad Ilmi, a political observer, said Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has been very active in Uttar Pradesh while the SP also looks confident. He added the BSP is wooing Brahmins, who are counted among the BJP’s core supporters, to replicate its success in the 2007 assembly elections. “There are some newer political players... like Aam Aadmi Party and AIMIM (All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen).” He said some of the parties are relying on soft Hindutva as the opposition is desperate to stop the BJP’s winning run. “Shah surely has a challenge... but knowing his ability to outthink opponents, it would be interesting to watch out for what he has up his sleeve.”Booth management has been a key part of Shah’s strategy. The BJP plans to send Diwali gifts, including lotus-shaped earthen lamps, to over three million booth-level cadres. Lotus is also the BJP’s election symbol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-2022-assembly-polls-in-mind-amit-shah-visits-uttar-pradesh-101635492471989.html

The man who was dragging Aryan Khan to the NCB office is now behind bars. The man who was doing everything to ensure that Aryan Khan and others are not given bail was knocking on the court's door yesterday,” Malik was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Malik was referring to Sameer Wankhede, who is in the eye of a political storm following allegations of extortion in the cruise ship drugs case in which Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan is facing trial.Also read: Aryan Khan granted bail. What are his lawyers doing to secure his release from jailMalik was also referring to Kiran Gosavi, who was arrested by Pune City Police on Thursday on charges of cheating and will remain in custody till November 5. Kiran Gosavi is a witness of the NCB in the case.Recently, another witness in the drugs case, Prabhakar Sail, claimed that he overheard Gosavi telling one Sam D'Souza over the phone about a demand of ₹25 crore, and "to settle at ₹18 crore as they have to give ₹8 crore to Sameer Wankhede" after Aryan Khan was brought to the NCB office following the raid.Also read: Aryan Khan gets bail, Bombay high court to dictate judgment todaySameer Wankhede's wife Kranti Redkar Wankhede on Thursday wrote a letter to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, seeking justice in the wake of the "attack on her family and her personal life". “Being a Marathi person, I expect some justice from your side as my personal life is unnecessarily being dragged into a controversy. Had late Balasaheb Thackeray (father of Uddhav Thackeray) been alive today, he would not have tolerated such personal attack on a woman's dignity,” she wrote in the letter.Responding to the letter, Malik said, “His (Sameer Wankhede) family wrote to CM yesterday that they're Marathis and being a Marathi, the CM should help them. Nawab Malik's family too has been in this city for 70 years. I was born in 1959 and have been a citizen of this city. Is Nawab Malik not a Marathi?”Sameer Wankhede is facing the departmental vigilance probe.Nawab Malik has levelled a string of allegations against the NCB official, including illegal phone tapping.Meanwhile, Aryan Khan was on Thursday granted bail by the Bombay High Court, following multiple rejections of his bail pleas in the drugs case. He was arrested on October 3 following a raid on a cruise ship off the Mumbai coast—a case that triggered a series of controversies and put the NCB and its officials under the spotlight.Aryan Khan is likely to walk out of Mumbai's Arthur jail, where he is lodged, in a day or two once the detailed order of the court is out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-aryan-khan-s-bail-nawab-malik-takes-swipe-at-wankhede-gosavi-101635490156258.html
29-10-2021||India||Govt reverses decision on IRCTC convenience fee||The railways ministry on Friday withdrew its decision to ask the Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC), its catering and tourism arm, to share half of all the convenience fee revenue it earns. "Ministry of Railways has decided to withdraw the decision on IRCTC convenience fee," the department of investment and public asset management (DIPAM) secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey tweeted.Shares of IRCTC, which plunged as much as 30 per earlier, pared some losses and were last down 5.2 per cent.The blue-chip NSE Nifty 50 index edged up 0.14 per cent to 17,881 by 10:46am and the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex inched higher 0.17 per cent to 60,089.27, after a more than 1 per cent drop in early trade on Friday. Both indexes were down over 1 per cent so far this week.Sharing started in 2014 in the ratio of 80:20 between IRCTC and the Indian Railways. The ratio was changed to 50:50 in 2015 but the charge remained withdrawn for three years from November 2016, reports news agency PTI.IRCTC on Thursday said that the ministry of railways has asked it to share 50 per cent of its revenue earned as a convenience fee from bookings on its website with the national transporter, an arrangement that had been discontinued since the Covid-19 pandemic.The convenience fees charged from customers generated a sizeable revenue for IRCTC. The fee is not part of the rail fare and is for the service of online ticket booking offered by the IRCTC.IRCTC is the only firm authorised to manage food services on trains and has a monopoly in the online ticketing and catering services for the Indian Railways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-reverses-decision-on-irctc-convenience-fee-101635486388179.html

29-10-2021||India||Promises, allegations, notices and more as Himanta faces first polls as Assam CM||Ever since he joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2015 after a long and successful stint in Congress, Himanta Biswa Sarma has been its star campaigner in Assam elections, crisscrossing the state and attracting large crowds with his oratory skills.Sarma played a crucial role in the BJP’s first stint in power in Assam in 2016 and also in the party’s impressive performance in the 2019 general elections. Earlier this year, after the BJP returned to power for a second consecutive time, Sarma was entrusted with the chief minister’s post replacing predecessor Sarbananda Sonowal.On October 30, he will face his first poll test since assuming the CM’s chair in May when voting will take place in five assembly seats - Bhabanipur, Thawra, Mariani, Tamulpul and Gossaigaon - where byelections are being held. And as in previous elections, Sarma has put on his campaign hat and is addressing four to six election meetings daily.“Remember these are bye-elections and it won’t decide the formation of government. Here voters will only choose who will represent them. So, won’t it be prudent to vote for the candidate from the party, which is already in power in Guwahati?” Sarma said at an election meeting in Thawra on Tuesday.Comparing the BJP-led coalition government to a productive cow, the CM has told voters how it would give lots of milk if they vote the party’s candidate and how a vote to other parties would be a waste. Sarma assured more development projects and schemes for the constituencies if the party wins.The CM’s assurances and promises led the opposition Congress to file two complaints with Election Commission complaining about violation of the model code of conduct and seeking a ban on his campaign. In response, the EC had issued a notice to the CM seeking an explanation by Tuesday evening.On Tuesday, the Congress filed another complaint with the commission seeking lodging of a first information report (FIR) against Sarma and removal of district officials in Gossaigaon “for blatantly and blindly favouring the ruling party”.“The actions of the CM reflect as if he is provoking and teasing the Election Commission and its officials by suggesting that he is above and beyond the law or the control of the election commission,” the complaint read.Reacting to the Congress allegations, Sarma said on Tuesday that the opposition party doesn’t want implementation of development projects mentioned in the state’s budget. “It is their nature to file complaints (against me) in each election,” he commented.During the last assembly polls held this year, based on a complaint by Congress, EC barred Sarma from taking part in campaigns for a day.“I would advise Sarma to get himself tested outside the state. The CM is claiming BJP’s lotus will give lots of milk. It’s such a laughable matter. We have never heard or seen a lotus giving milk,” opposition All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) president Badruddin Ajmal said at an election meeting on Monday.Two of the five seats where byelections will be held, Tamulpur and Gossaigaon, fell vacant due to deaths of opposition Bodoland Peoples’ Front (BPF) and ruling United Peoples Party Liberal (UPPL) legislators from Covid-19 related complications.The other three seats are going to polls as two Congress MLAs, from Mariani and Thawra, and an AIUDF MLA from Bhabanipur resigned from their parties and joined the BJP.At present the ruling BJP has 59 MLAs, UPPL 5 and Asom Gana Parishad 9 while opposition Congress has 27, AIUDF 15, BPF-3, CPM 1 and newly floated Raijor Das has 1 seat in the 126-member house.Byelection to the Majuli seat, which fell vacant after Union minister Sarbananda Sonowal resigned last month, will take place later.A total of 796,456 voters (403,374 men and 393,078 women) in the five seats will be able cast the votes on October 30. Apart from them, there are also 3,165 service voters. A total of 31 candidates are in the fray in the five seats.1.

29-10-2021||India||Ghazipur border: Police remove barricades at farmers’ protest site||The police began the process of removing barricades from the New Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border crossing at Ghazipur on Friday, shortly after officers aware of the matter said there could be efforts to evict the farmers from the protest site.The process to reopen the border connecting New Delhi with Haryana for resumption of the movement of vehicles on at least one carriageway at Tikri began earlier on Thursday. It was not immediately clear when the border will be fully opened.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at the Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur borders in outer and eastern Delhi against three farm laws since last November. The blockades there were put up following the violence during the farmers’ Republic Day rally. Watch: Police start removing barricading from Tikri border, no relief for commuters yetThe movement of vehicles towards New Delhi from Ghaziabad has been blocked on all the carriageways on the Delhi-Meerut expressway as well as National Highway (NH) 24. Farmers have set up temporary tents and parked their tractor trolleys on these carriageways. Police from Delhi and Uttar Pradesh have also installed barricades on the routes. The carriageways for the movement of vehicles towards Ghaziabad from Delhi are open on the expressway but closed on NH-24.After the Republic Day rally violence, the Delhi Police put up multi-layered blockades at the three border protest sites by digging pits, placing iron nails, and positioning iron barricades as well as concrete barriers.An officer said the Delhi Police personnel with the help of cranes will remove the concrete as well as iron barricades placed at Ghazipur to prevent the protesting farmers from entering the Capital. The process will be initiated to reopen the border and resume the normal movement of vehicles.“Many senior police officers, including special commissioner of police (law and order, north zone) Deependra Pathak, will be visiting the Ghazipur border to assess the situation and maintain law and order during the removal of the blockades. They may also be having talks with their counterparts in Uttar Pradesh Police and the protesting farmers over resuming traffic on the roads,” the officer said.A week ago, video clips surfaced on social media showing Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait and some farmers removing a tent at the Ghazipur border. Tikait was heard saying in the video that it was not the farmers but the Delhi Police who had blocked the roads by placing barricades.On Thursday, the Delhi Police confirmed they were removing blockades from the Tikri border. The development came on a day three women farmers were killed and two others injured after a truck hit them near the Tikri border. The Supreme Court last week told the agitating farmer unions that they are free to protest but should not block roads for that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ghazipur-border-police-remove-barricades-at-farmers-protest-site-101635486951470.html

The Court, however, allowed women candidates to take the exam in November this year, ruling that the induction of women to the NDA cannot be postponed by one year.Meanwhile, the army chief also appealed to the cadets to keep themselves informed of new technology that will help them counter the contemporary challenges. "A little over 42 years back, when I stood as a cadet at the same drill square as you stand today, little I could have imagined that I would be reviewing this parade," he said, according to ANI."From here on, you will step into the respective career service academies for more focused military training. You will don different uniforms, but always remember that no single service by itself can fight and win modern wars,” he added.According to the UPSC calendar, the NDA exam will take place on November 14, 2021.

People familiar with the matter said that at least 3,000 people living downstream of Mullaperiyar dam were evacuated as a precautionary measure. The water is expected to reach Idukki reservoir in the neighbouring Kerala in a few hours, with the district put on high alert.Many houses have been submerged since the dam opened at 7am on Friday, however, no untoward incident was reported.Water from the Mullaperiyar dam is being released to maintain its level at 138 feet and will reach Idukki reservoir in two hours. If need arises, Idukki dam might be opened too to ease the pressure, people familiar with the matter said.Kerala water resources minister Roshy Augustine, in a press release issued on Thursday, urged people not to panic and added that there was nothing to be concerned about. He said the storage capacity of Idukki was 70.5 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) as compared to 12.758 TMC of Mullaperiyar and therefore, the water released from the latter would only raise the former's level by a quarter of a foot."Therefore, Idukki will be able to contain the water released from the Mullaperiyar,'' the minister said.People who have been evacuated were moved to camps for accomodation.Mullaperiyar Dam was built in 1895 on the Periyar River in the Idukki district of Kerala.The Supreme Court on Thursday asked Kerala and Tamil Nadu governments to abide by the decision taken by the Supervisory Committee regarding the appropriate water level in the Mullaperiyar dam. The supervisory committee has recommended maintaining the Mullaperiyar dam water level at 139.5 feet.Meanwhile, dam authorities in Kerala are taking cognizance of the situation that can arise out of the torrential rainfall. According to the weather office, heavy rains are expected in some districts. As many as 42 people were killed in flash floods and landslides after heavy downpour in Kerala earlier this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-raises-shutters-of-mullaperiyar-dam-kerala-s-idukki-on-high-alert-101635475411877.html

29-10-2021||India||Delhi high court seeks EC’s response on plea to regulate internal party polls||The Delhi high court on Thursday asked the Election Commission of India to respond to a petition by lawyer C Rajashekaran regarding the poll watchdog overseeing internal party polls and treating a PIL on the matter as a representation, and said it should file a response by December 23.Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh heard the matter, wherein an internal process to outline a standard procedure for party elections was sought.“There are lacunae in the law with regard to power and tenure of party officials and what happens when they exceed tenure, which leads to larger questions regarding internal party democracy,” said lawyer C Rajashekaran.On June 14, HT reported that the EC was served with a legal notice on June 13 for failing to respond to a PIL filed in the Delhi high court seeking fair and transparent internal elections in political parties.The poll body was given seven days to respond, failing which, the petitioner Rajashekaran might initiate contempt proceedings against it.The case dates back to November 11, 2020, when Rajashekaran approached the EC, seeking the establishment of internal democracy in political parties. When he didn’t receive any response, he filed a PIL in the Delhi high court, drawing the attention of the court to the EC’s 1996 notice that asked political parties to follow the rules laid down in their own constitutions regarding internal elections.“The [Election] Commission observed that the various provisions relating to the organisational elections were not being followed by the political parties, and therefore called upon the parties to follow their respective constitutions relating to the said elections scrupulously,” says the petition filed in the Delhi high court.Also Read: Focus on G23 leaders ahead of Congress organisational pollsOn January 12, the high court passed an order in which it asked the EC to treat the petition as a representation.The notice sent to the chief election commissioner accused the EC of treating the representation with “total disregard”. HT has seen a copy of the notice.HT reached out to the EC spokesperson, but did not receive a response immediately.The petition had asked the EC to de-register a political party for non-compliance.“The lack of intra-party democracy in the said political parties to leadership positions within the said parties results in a unique situation where there is no mechanism for the said political party to be held accountable to its members and its own constitution,” the petition said.“It is submitted that although most political parties provide for elections through the provisions, the said elections are often an eyewash for established political families within the said parties to continue to retain power as the top leadership of the said party,” it added.According to a former Election Commission official familiar with the matter, the 1996 notice issued by the EC that threatened “legal measures as are available, necessary and appropriate”, including the de-registering of political parties, was issued in the context of lack of elections in the Congress party.“There were concerns that the Congress was not conducting proper elections and only the Congress working committee was ratifying the appointments,” the former official said. “But the concern was not just limited to Congress. The [Election] Commission continued to monitor party elections post 1996 and granted extensions to other political parties, while telling others to hold elections earlier than the time they sought. Many such orders were passed.”The timing of the petition is significant, given the internal turmoil in Congress over affairs in Rajasthan and Punjab, and internal elections deferred due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The party has now said that polls will only be conducted next year, with interim chief Sonia Gandhi hitting out at regional leaders for a “lack of clarity” over party issues.It is widely expected that family scion Rahul Gandhi will return to the helm of affairs after stepping down as party president following the drubbing Congress faced in the 2019 general elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-high-court-seeks-ec-s-response-on-plea-to-regulate-internal-party-polls-101635476990841.html
29-10-2021||India||Gujarat court asks Rahul Gandhi to appear in defamation case today||A magistrate court in Surat has directed Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to appear before it on Friday to record his statement in connection with a criminal defamation case against him over his remark on the Modi surname.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator from Surat Purnesh Modi filed a complaint against Rahul in April 2019 under sections 499 and 500 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) that deal with defamation. In his complaint, Purnesh alleged that Rahul Gandhi while addressing a poll rally in 2019 defamed the entire Modi community.In his speech at a rally in Karnataka's Kolar on April 13, 2019, ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, Rahul Gandhi reportedly asked, "Nirav Modi, Lalit Modi, Narendra Modi...how come they all have Modi as the common surname. How come all the thieves have Modi as the common surname?"Earlier this week, chief judicial magistrate of the magistrate court AN Dave asked Rahul Gandhi to appear on Friday to record his statement further after the testimony of two new witnesses--the then electoral officer of Kolar in Karnataka where the Congress leader made the speech and a video recorder employed by the Election Commission to record his speech-- were taken since the Congress leader last appeared before the court on June 24 this year. He appeared before the court in October 2019 and pleaded not guilty for his comment."The court on Monday orally directed Rahul Gandhi to appear on October 29 to record his further statement over the testimonies of two new witnesses. He is likely to remain present before the court between 3pm and 6pm on that day," Gandhi's lawyer Kirit Panwala said on Monday, according to news agency PTI.Purnesh Modi is now a minister in the new Gujarat government led by chief minister Bhupendra Patel, holding the portfolios of road and building, transport, civil aviation and tourism and pilgrimage development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-court-asks-rahul-gandhi-to-appear-in-defamation-case-today-101635467541810.html

29-10-2021||India||‘It might work in UP, won’t work here’: Delhi high court pulls up state police||The Delhi high court on Thursday severely reprimanded the Uttar Pradesh Police for arresting the father and brother of a man from the national capital after he married a woman against her family’s wishes.A single-judge bench of Justice Mukta Gupta said, “Illegal kaam Delhi mein nahin chalega (Illegal acts will not be allowed in Delhi),” as it took strong exception to UP Police not intimating Delhi Police and completely ignoring that both the man and the woman were consenting adults.The bench also questioned how the police team showed the arrest from a village in UP and said it would examine the CCTV footage from the area to get to the truth.“Ye kaam na yahan nahi chalega. Illegal kaam koi bhi Delhi me nahin chalega ki aap aaye aur Delhi se log uthaye aur keh de ki humne to Shamli se arrest dikha di. Ye hum yahaan nahi chalne denge (This will not work in Delhi. Illegal acts will not be allowed. You cannot come to Delhi, pick up people and then show arrest from Shamli. We won’t allow this here),” said Justice Gupta.The judge further remarked that the action of UP Police in arresting the two from Delhi was unlawful at every step and that the court could not allow anybody to illegally arrest people from the national capital.“Apni marzi se uthake kisiko nai le ja sakte. Yehi kanoon kehta hai na? Har step pe kanoon ko violate kiya aapne. Ye cheez Delhi main bardasht nai karenge (You cannot pick anyone at your will. You have violated the law at every step. This will not be tolerated in Delhi),” remarked the judge.The court also pulled up the woman’s mother for concealing the age of her daughter and said that it would also initiate proceedings against her and others in Delhi for lodging a sham case.As the mother broke down, Justice Gupta said, “What is the age of your daughter? Why didn’t you tell the police her real age? All this may work in UP but not here. If you think that crying before me will make a difference, let me tell you it will not,” said the judge.On October 26, the high court had directed sub-inspector Pankaj Kumar Tyagi of UP Police to be present before it after the man’s two family members were arrested and taken out of Delhi in an alleged kidnapping case, without informing the Delhi Police.Justice Gupta, while hearing a plea by the couple, said Delhi Police must be informed before arresting anyone from the city.On Thursday, the court reproached Tyagi for not verifying the woman’s age. “Did you ask whether the girl was a minor or a major? If the girl was a major, then will it be her wish or the parents’ wish that would prevail?” it asked the police officer.Tyagi, on his part, responded that he had sought the birth details from the mother, but she did not give the requisite documents. He maintained that the arrest was not made from Delhi but from Khudana in Shamli, UP.The court then asked the station house officer of Shamli police station to submit a report as to what efforts were made to trace the woman from Delhi and whether the UP Police gave any intimation to the Delhi Police before arriving in the city. The court also directed him to get the statement of the woman recorded by the magistrate at the Patiala court by Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-might-work-in-up-won-t-work-here-delhi-high-court-pulls-up-state-police-101635462609357.html

Three houses and a few shops, reportedly owned by members of the minority community, were also ransacked in nearby Rowa Bazar, Bhanupada Chakraborty said after the violence on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panisagar-mosque-is-safe-don-t-spread-rumours-tripura-police-101635451608758.html

The high court gave full effect to this prayer making it absolute. As a result, the direction to hold exams for the two candidates came in the way of the final NEET results announcement.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for NTA along with advocate Rupesh Kumar, informed the court that the two students answered 130 and 160 questions out of a total of 180 questions while the other four candidates attempted all answers. “The four students have not complained of any disadvantage. After we found the mistake, we agreed to rectify it by accepting the mismatch as it is without disqualifying them.”The argument weighed with the court as it observed, “The question papers fell down for all six students. How can you (petitioners in high court) be differently placed as the other four have completed all questions.”Advocate Pooja Thorat, appearing for the two students, said the mismatch was pointed out only by the two candidates and not the other four. “After we pointed out the mistake and said this could result in rejection of our examination sheet, the confusion remained for over two hours into the examination and we had to complete the paper in haste,” Thorat said.The bench told Thorat, “You are not taking into account lakhs of students who are waiting for their results. Whatever confusion is there, the NTA is ready to rectify. They are ready to go by what you have answered.”Abhishek Kapase, one of the two Solapur students to have approached the high court, said the Supreme Court’s verdict might be fair to lakhs of the other aspirants, but they had been penalised.Also Read: SC decision on NEET fair to lakhs but we have been cheated: 2 petitioners“I have attempted the exam with all my knowledge, but due to the error on part of the invigilator, my answers do not match the question paper so I have been marked zero in the exam. None of this is our fault but the judiciary has punished us in this bargain,” Kapase, 19, said.The court posted the matter on November 12 and asked NTA to come out with a plan for the two students. It suggested to Mehta to consider the number of questions answered by the two candidates as 180 and award marks accordingly. Mehta agreed to come back with instructions.In its appeal before the top court, NTA complained that the effect of the high court order is that the petitioner (NTA) who has conducted the NEET (UG) 2021 examination for more than 16 lakh candidates on September 12 is not able to declare their results even though the same is ready for declaration. The delay in declaration of result of NEET (UG) 2021 will affect and further delay the subsequent process of admission to undergraduate medical courses.”The NTA filed an affidavit in the high court accepting the mistake of the invigilators. The high court relied on this fact to ensure that the students do not end up paying the price for the mistake by invigilators. Although the high court held that its order shall not be treated as a precedent, NTA apprehended that for future, similar incidents could lead to cases in courts by students demanding re-examination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-stays-hc-s-neet-order-says-can-t-delay-results-of-16-lakh-students-101635448488391.html
29-10-2021||India||AIADMK dismisses minority wing leader for ‘anti-party activities’||The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) on Thursday sacked minorities wing deputy secretary J M Basheer, who earlier in the day threatened to expose party co-coordinator Edappadi Palaniswami and called for his removal. In a joint statement, Palaniswami and co-coordinator O Panneerselvam announced the party’s decision.“His acts have gone against the principles and values of the party. He has brought disrepute to the party,” the statement read. Basheer was immediately removed from the party’s primary membership and all other posts and responsibilities. “Party members are directed not to have any contact with him,” the statement said. Basheer released a note on Thursday afternoon calling for a press meet in Chennai where he would release evidence against Palaniswami of him being “against minorities”. “I’m going to urge OPS to remove him from the party. He has continuously betrayed minorities,” Basheer said in his letter.At 3.16 pm, the AIADMK released a statement announcing the sacking of Basheer because he indulged in anti-party activities.A senior leader in the party on condition of anonymity said that they felt that Basheer was wrong to bring down the party in the open. “He has been indulging in loose talks and spreading rumours for a while now while holding an important post,” said the leader. “Since the party’s loss (in the rural local body polls in nine districts), this has been happening.”These developments come amidst a volatile time for the AIADMK, with expelled leader V K Sasikala staking a claim as the party’s general secretary and attempting to take control. Her former loyalist turned rebel Panneerselvam had offered support by telling reporters that AIADMK will discuss her re-induction, a claim the party has vehemently denied.“It was OPS who rebelled against her first,” former minister and AIADMK spokesperson D Jayakumar had said on Monday. “The party has passed a resolution that she will not be taken back, and whoever connects with her will be removed. OPS has signed this.” Jayakumar reiterated this on Thursday. “We have also expelled several people who have been in contact with her,” he said. “This was our stance yesterday, and it will continue to be our stance today and tomorrow.”However, a few leaders in the last couple of days have publicly said that Panneerselvam’s opinion that there can be a discussion isn’t wrong. “There is no confusion or problem in our party,” said former AIADMK minister Sellur Raju.Sasikala, meanwhile, is starting a tour on Friday to meet her supporters in the southern districts. With Sasikala not backing down, her thawing with Panneerselvam, and the party speaking in different voices, the situation is tricky for Palaniswami, who has consolidated himself as the numero uno by sidelining his partner-leader Panneerselvam since J Jayalalithaa’s death in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmk-dismisses-minority-wing-leader-for-anti-party-activities-101635448188358.html
29-10-2021||India||Row over Telangana govt decision to stop Rabi paddy cultivation||The Telangana government’s decision to impose an indirect ban on the cultivation of paddy by farmers in the state during the ongoing Rabi season has triggered a major controversy.Though the government has not issued an official order banning the cultivation of paddy this season, it has directed the district collectors to see those seed companies do not sell paddy seeds to farmers at any cost, on the pretext of the problem of plenty. The seed company dealers were asked to procure and stock adequate quantities of seed for alternative crops like pulses and oilseeds such as groundnut, green gram, black gram, Bengal gram, caster, bajra and sesamum but not paddy.At a review meeting held on September 12, the officials of the agriculture department told chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao that it was not advisable to encourage paddy cultivation because of the Central government’s decision not to purchase even a single kg of rice variety being produced in Telangana.The officials said the state produces a huge quantity of boiled rice. In the last Rabi season, the state government had procured 9.2 million tonnes of paddy, and this Kharif, another 5.5 million tonnes of paddy is being procured. Added to this, there are buffer stocks of another 7 million tonnes of paddy.However, the Centre has made it clear that it won’t be able to procure even a single kg of paddy, more than the prescribed quantity of 6 million tonnes through the Food Corporation of India, on the pretext of lack of demand in the country. Union civil supplies minister Piyush Goel told a delegation of the state ministers that there were buffer stocks with the Centre sufficient for the next five years.“Under these circumstances, cultivating paddy again this Rabi season amounting to farmers hanging themselves as there would be no takers for the produce,” the officials told the chief minister.Following a direction from the state government, district collectors have been holding meetings with seed dealers for the last few days and asking them not to sell paddy seeds to farmers this season and encouraging them to go in for alternative crops.At one such meeting held in Siddipet on Monday, collector P Venkatrama Reddy warned the seed dealers against selling paddy seeds lest they would face criminal action. In a video of the meeting, which went viral on social media, the collector was heard saying that if any dealer was found selling even a single kilogram of paddy seed, his shop would be closed and licence suspended.“Even if you get orders from Supreme Court or high court, I don’t care. As long as I am a collector, I won’t allow you. The agriculture officer concerned will also be suspended,” he threatened.The collector’s remarks triggered loud protests from farmers’ organisations and opposition parties. Though Reddy later clarified that his warning was concerning the sale of spurious seeds, the protests have not subsided.Telangana Rythu Sangham on Thursday demanded stringent action against the Siddipet collector for threatening the seed dealers and bringing pressure on farmers not to raise paddy crops.“For the last three years, there has been a steep increase in the groundwater levels due to heavy rains. There is plenty of water in all the reservoirs, irrigation tanks and ponds. It is not possible to grow dry crops in such water-logged fields. Even if they grow, the yield won’t be good. Since there is no support price mechanism for such crops, the farmers won’t get remunerative prices,” Sangham general secretary T Sagar said.However, state agriculture minister S Niranjan Reddy said there was no option for the farmers, but to grow alternative crops. “If the opposition leaders have any love towards farmers, they should bring pressure on the Centre to purchase more paddy from the state,” he said while challenging the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the ruling party at the Centre.BJP state unit president and MP Bandi Sanjay took up a four-hour Deeksha in the state party office on Thursday in protest against the state government’s decision. He threatened to file a criminal case against Siddipet collector for saying that he would defy even the court orders on paddy cultivation.Senior Congress leader and former PCC chief N Uttam Kumar Reddy said it was shameful of the chief minister to ask the farmers not to raise paddy. “He claimed that he would make Telangana the rice bowl of India, but now, he says his government won’t purchase paddy. He cannot take decisions overnight, instead of having foresight,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-over-telangana-govt-decision-to-stop-rabi-paddy-cultivation-101635448131543.html
29-10-2021||India||Hyderabad police face ire for checking mobiles in crackdown on drugs||The Hyderabad police have come under heavy criticism for checking the mobile phones of people as part of their crackdown on narcotics peddling in the city.In a video shared on social media on Thursday, policemen were seen stopping vehicles in some parts of the old city in Hyderabad and checking people’s contact information and text messages. “New policing practices alert: stop and search phone chats by the @hydcitypolice. Police are searching phone chats for words like ganja. Wait until they replace words with NRC, Modi or BJP,” tweeted one netizen.Another person asked: “Is it legal? How can police randomly check the phones without any order from the court? Not sure order from the police department to their team is legal (sic).”“Under what rules and guidelines? Pls share rules, so that I’ll update myself,” said a person. “Are they allowed to do this without a search warrant?” asked another one.Speaking to reporters, Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar said the police had been conducting searches and frisking as part of preventing ganja peddling. “We have every right to check anything, whether it is a mobile phone, iPad, laptop, pen drive or a hard disk when we find suspicious about the movement of people in the area of any crime incident,” he said.Stating that two persons were arrested during the special drive on ganja peddling in the last month, the police commissioner said it was found that they were doing monetary transactions through Google Pay on their mobiles.When quizzed about the video circling on social media, Kumar said as per his knowledge, the video was three years old, and the checking of vehicles and mobiles might have been done as part of an investigation related to any crime. Inquiries, however, revealed that the video was the latest one, as it showed the cops wearing masks as part of Covid-19 protocol. The video showed one of the cops, who took part in the checking of vehicles and mobile phones, saying it had been going on for the last few days and would continue for one more month. “We are checking the mobile phones to get any leads on ganja peddling,” he said, adding that the searches were going on three shifts round the clock.A senior police official said on condition of anonymity that the checking of vehicles and mobile phones was being conducted as part of preventing ganja and other narcotic substances. “There is no big issue, as the people are cooperating. So far, we could not find any cases of ganja smuggling,” he said.People’s Union of Civil Liberties (PUCL) leader and advocate Jaya Vindhyala said it was illegal on the part of the Hyderabad police to look into the mobile phones in the name of obtaining info on ganja peddling.“It is against the Right to Privacy, which is also a fundamental right of an individual, but the police would give it a different interpretation. But they should go as per the procedure if they want to check mobile phones. They should first issue notices to them asking them to show their phones. They cannot force the people to part with their mobile phones,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabad-police-face-ire-for-checking-mobiles-in-crackdown-on-drugs-101635448129747.html
29-10-2021||India||Another sexual assault case against Mavunkal, says SIT||Another woman employee on Thursday registered a sexual assault complaint against self-styled antique collector Monson Mavunkal, accused of multi-crore fraud and raping a minor. The special investigation team (SIT) probing cases against Mavunkal said the team will file a fresh case against him in the matter after recording the victim’s statement before a magistrate.On October 19, Mavunkal was booked under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act for allegedly raping the daughter of one of his employees two years ago. Later his make-up man was also arrested under Pocso after recording her statement. The latest victim said Mavunkal sexually abused her for many months and was scared to file a complaint as many police officers frequented his house, which was also a clinic and museum in Kochi. The SIT suspects many such complaints are likely to surface in the coming days. During the investigation, the SIT also found that some of Mavunkal’s clients were given “special massage”, which he used to discreetly film. He allegedly used some of his female and male employees for this, the SIT said. Mavunkal, who claims to possess “rare and timeless antiques”, was arrested on September 26 for selling fake artefacts and cheating. After his arrest, details of apathy and collusion came to light as many top police officers were reportedly close to Mavunkal. His free run got cut short after five businessmen complained to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan of cheating worth ₹10 crores by Mavunkal, who promised shares in his upcoming international antique museums in Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram. Later, many other businessmen also filed cheating complaints against him. The government constituted the SIT, which also recorded the statement of an Italy-based Malayali woman Anitha Pullayil, who alleged to have introduced many senior police officers to Mavunkal. He allegedly used his connections with the officers to cheat and intimidate gullible antique buyers. Mavunkal has claimed that antiques in his possession included the staff of Moses, a piece of fabric from a garment worn by Jesus, and “Dahi handi” of Lord Krishna. Pullayil has now sought to distance herself from him. She told news channels that she had advised those cheated by him to approach the police. Pullayil added that she was unaware of his shady deals and started avoiding him after she got an inkling regarding some of them. Many police officers regularly visited his house-cum-cosmetology clinic in Kochi that he ran based on a fake degree. Meanwhile, the High Court on Wednesday granted more time to state police chief Anil Kant to furnish details of alleged links of top police officials with the conman. While hearing a plea last month, the court had asked many questions to the DGP, including why police gave protection to Mavunkal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-sexual-assault-case-against-mavunkal-says-sit-101635448128330.html
29-10-2021||India||Kerala begins evacuation as TN set to release water from Mullaperiyar||The Kerala government on Thursday initiated the process of evacuating over 800 families living in the downstream areas of the Mullaperiyar dam after the neighbouring Tamil Nadu announced its decision to open spillways on Friday.Idukki district collector Sheeba George has already announced an alert in the district and ordered the shifting of people from nearby areas of the dam. State water resources minister Roshy Augustine said all arrangements have been made, and there is no need for panic. A native of the district, Augustine has also called a meeting of district officials on Friday to monitor the situation.“We will shift 3,220 people belonging to 884 families. We are keeping a strict vigil. We have opened enough relief camps. This is only a precautionary measure, and there is no need of panic,” the minister said, adding that the Tamil Nadu government hasn’t announced the exact quantum of water to be released.Districts officials said once the water is released, it will reach the first downstream village Vallakadavu in 20 minutes, and the Idukki reservoir will be filled by noon. Initially, spillways of the reservoir will be opened to ease pressure, and if needed, shutters will also be opened. Sluice gates of the Idukki reservoir were opened two weeks ago after catchment areas received heavy downpours. Fast floods and landslides induced by heavy rains claimed 40 lives in two districts, Kottayam and Idukki on October 17.One of the oldest dams of the country, neighbouring states Kerala and Tamil Nadu have been fighting over the water level of Mullaperiyar for many years. While Kerala wants to build a new dam citing frequent tremors and changing rain patterns in the Idukki district, Tamil Nadu opposed it fearing the loss of control over it. After the 2014 SC verdict, Tamil Nadu carried out repairs and retrofitted, but Kerala maintained that these measures were not enough to check the dam’s durability.The dam was built under an agreement between the erstwhile royal family of Travancore and the British administration in 1886 to take water to famine-hit Tamil Nadu for irrigation. Post-independence, the dam became part of Kerala, and since then, its main share of water flows to the southern districts of Tamil Nadu.The contentious issue came up before the apex court on Monday after a resident of Idukki, Dr Joe Joseph, approached it with a plea that the water level should not go above 139 feet because of heavy rains in the area. The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered that the dam supervisory committee’s view to maintain water level at 139.5 feet till Nov 10 should be met. While hearing the case the TN counsel said Kerala was whipping up fear unnecessarily but Kerala maintained that a new dam is a final solution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-begins-evacuation-as-tn-set-to-release-water-from-mullaperiyar-101635448071088.html
29-10-2021||India||Madras high court rejects spl DGP’s plea to transfer sexual harassment case||The Madras high court on Wednesday dismissed a plea by suspended Special Director General of Police (DGP) Rajesh Das challenging the jurisdictional competence of the Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM), Villupuram to adjudicate upon a sexual harassment case filed by a female Indian Police Service (IPS) officer against him in February this year.Das said that the alleged crime occurred in Namakkal, Ulundurpet and Chengalpattu, thus putting the jurisdiction of CJM, Villupuram under question.Justice P Velmurugan dismissed the plea saying that the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Villupuram has got jurisdiction to proceed with the case. “Considering the facts and circumstances of the above-said case, this Court does not find any perversity in the order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Villupuram (which had previously rejected a similar petition, which the petitioner challenged at the high court). The petitioner at any point of time, on an earlier occasion, has not challenged the power of CBCID to investigate the matter,” the court said in its orders. “However, no prejudice would be caused to the petitioner.”The state public prosecutor submitted that as per the order of the high court dated May 2010, the CJM court, Villupuram has been designated to exercise all or any of the powers of the Magistrate of First Class, under Section 14(1) of Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 to deal with the cases registered under the CBCID. “Therefore, the contention raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner is not legally tenable,” the court said. The CBCID has filed a charge sheet against him in the Villupuram lower court. The court also noted that in the suo moto hearing of the case where another justice Anand Venkatesh had taken up to monitor the investigation in the case had in August directed for the case to proceed on a day-to-day basis and dispose of the case within three months. It was posted for compliance with the report on December 23.Das has been booked under section 354(A) (2), 341, 506(i) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and section 4 of Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act. The alleged crime took place when the previous chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami was on an official tour in February 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-high-court-rejects-spl-dgp-s-plea-to-transfer-sexual-harassment-case-101635448068289.html

29-10-2021||India||Karnataka school shut after 33 students test Covid positive||Authorities had to shut down a school near Madikeri town in Karnataka’s Kodagu district after at least 33 students at the institution tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday. According to health officials, the outbreak was reported at Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in Galibeedu village. School authorities told government health officials that the cases were confirmed after Class 10 students were tested for Covid-19. The state government had reopened in-person classes for classes 9 and 10 in all its districts after the daily Covid-19 case tally dipped in recent weeks. Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya was among the schools that reopened on September 20. “Within five days of reopening, two students reported fever. When they were tested, coronavirus [infection] was confirmed,” said a health department official. After that case, all Class 10 students were isolated and tested. Classes reopened after their tests turned negative. A little over a month after that episode, two more students showed symptoms of Covid-19 and later tested positive. Around 270 Class 10 students were then tested for the virus, and 33 of them tested positive on Wednesday. All 33 students are asymptomatic and have been isolated. While the positivity rate in the district stood at 0.19% on Tuesday, it rose to 1.21% on Wednesday following the detection of the new cluster of Covid-19 cases. Pankajashan, the principal of the school said that the condition of any student is of concern. “There is nothing to worry about. The entire campus has been sanitised and other precautionary measures are being taken. The interaction between students and teachers is going on though it has affected the smooth functioning of the school,” he said. The district collector, district health officer, and other officials visited the school and said that appropriate measures have been taken to ensure the safety of the students and prevent further infection. Karnataka on Thursday reported 365 new cases of Covid-19 and 8 deaths, taking the caseload to 29,84,849 and death toll to 37,984, the health department said.

29-10-2021||India||Row over absence of Kannada banners at Karnataka govt conference||The Karnataka government was left red-faced on Thursday after the tourism department failed to put up banners in Kannada during the conference of Tourism and Culture Ministers of the Southern Region here, forcing the state minister to make alternate arrangements.Soon after the error was flashed across local TV news channels, Anand Singh, Karnataka’s minister for tourism, environment and ecology Singh took officials to task after which the digital display behind the dias appeared in Kannada.The absence of Kannada was conspicuous during the inauguration of the two-day conference on tourism and culture on Thursday.Interestingly, the incident on Thursday coincided with an event by the Kannada and Culture department in which it mobilized large number of people across the state to sing pro-Kannada songs and speak only in the native tongue as part of the Karnataka Rajyotsava celebrations on November 1.The drive was also to encourage more people to speak in Kannada across a state where there has been stiff resistance to the imposition of Hindi.Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, during the Kannada and Culture event, said that there was emphasis being given for the usage of native tongue not just in school but in graduate courses as well.“We had brought an ordinance making Kannada compulsory not only in primary or secondary education but also in degree level. The matter is presently before the high court. We will continue our struggle for it.” Bommai told the gathering that the government is making complete engineering course available in Kannada language..There were programmes held across the state with people from all sections of society taking the pledge and singing pro-Kannada songs.Recently, the absence of Kannada during the Namma Metro inauguration and the event at NIMHANS had seen the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ducking for cover as criticism grew from opposition and pro-Kannada groups over what they call “Hindi imposition” by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led union government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-over-absence-of-kannada-banners-at-karnataka-govt-conference-101635447948888.html
29-10-2021||India||Karnataka high court restrains police action against Dream 11 founders||The Karnataka high court on Thursday directed the state government not to take any coercive action against the founders of Dream 11 who were charged with operating the gaming platform despite a new legislation that bans online gambling apps.Bhavit Sheth and Harsh Jain were named in a complaint filed by a private individual in Bengaluru’s Annapoorneshwari Nagar police station on October 7 for continuing to operate their app despite the ban on online gambling.Justice Sreenivas Harish Kumar asked the Karnataka government not to take any coercive steps like arresting the duo till November 9 or the next date of hearing in the case.“Since the matter is sub judice, we are unable to comment,” a spokesperson from Dream 11 told Hindustan Times on Thursday. The directions come almost three weeks after a private complainant, Manjunath, filed a complaint with the Annapoorneshwari Nagar police station for violating the new law that was notified on October 5 by the state government.The Basavaraj Bommai-led government had tabled and passed the Bill despite opposition during the monsoon session of the legislature held between September 13 to 24.Home minister Araga Jnanendra has defended the Bill despite concerns being raised over the financial impact of the same on the state as well as the dent of Bengaluru’s image as the tech and startup capital of the country.The Karnataka Police (Amendment) Bill, 2021 which among other changes, has banned “any act or risking money, or otherwise on the unknown result of an event including on a game of skill,” which has added to apprehensions as it proposes to include skill in what was earlier only on a game of chance.Police in Bengaluru and other places continue to crackdown on such companies and service providers especially during the recently concluded Indian Premiere League (IPL).The police have booked 20 cases against 27 persons during the 2021 IPL season with most of them with the old laws that bans gambling.There has been at least one case filed for violation of the new legislation, people aware of the developments said.The online gaming industry, which gained significant traction during the Covid-19 pandemic-induced lockdown, is slated to grow from 360 million gamers to 510 million by 2022, according to a 2021 report by All India Gaming Federation (AIGF) and EY.The report adds that 85% of these are mobile gamers.It also estimates that online real money game players are expected to grow from 80 million in 2020 to 150 million by 2023.Estimates indicate that Karnataka, known for its prowess in technology, accounts for around 15% of the country’s market. According to the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IMAI) there are 92 gaming companies registered in Bengaluru which employ over 4,000 people and have, in the last three years alone, attracted ₹3000 crores in investments.Forums like AIGF and others have approached the court for securing a stay on the ban itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-high-court-restrains-police-action-against-dream-11-founders-101635447889575.html
29-10-2021||India||Influential politicians linked to bitcoin scam: Congress accuses BJP of cover-up||An Enforcement Directorate (ED) probe into an 11-month-old case in Bengaluru involving a cryptocurrency hacker is snowballing into a political controversy with the Opposition accusing the ruling BJP of a cover-up. Opposition leader Siddaramaiah told the media that two influential politicians were involved and there was an attempt to cover up their role in the case. “There is information about the involvement of influential politicians of Karnataka in drugs and bitcoin scam. It is concerning that the investigating officers are trying to close the case to help those politicians,” tweeted Siddaramaiah on Thursday.Talking to reporters on Thursday, he said: “If they had to refer it to ED, what were they doing till now. If it has to be referred to ED, it means there is something. If they have stayed quiet all these days and now saying that they have referred it to ED, it means that protection was given till now,” Siddaramaiah, the former chief minister and Congress leader of the opposition said. Responding to the allegation, Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said that it was the state government that referred the investigation to the ED. “All investigations have been done at the state level and then we referred it to ED and CBI. The investigations will continue and there is no scope for any interference in it by anyone,” Bommai said on Thursday. On charges made by Siddaramaiah, Bommai said, “If there are any specific allegations, let them tell us; and we will investigate”. Karnataka home minister Jnanendra, however, contradicted Bommai’s statement and said that that the case is being probed by the state Criminal Investigation Department (CID). “Investigation is underway. The CID is doing it. So, whatever statement I make may come in the way of the investigation. Our police have taken it seriously. They’re going to the root, and they’ll bring it out soon,” he said. “Whoever is involved, be it, politicians, from any of the three parties here or non-politicians, will be brought to book. The inquiry is going on well. CID officers are experts. They’re on top of this,” he said, adding that nobody will be saved or protected. “It’s a very serious case and investigation is on,” he added. The case involving influential politicians in Karnataka continues to get murkier with allegations of misappropriation of around 15,000 bitcoins, valued at roughly ₹2,600 crore, said one person aware of the developments, requesting anonymity. On November 18, 2020, the Central Crime Branch (CCB) sleuths had seized bitcoins worth ₹9 crore from a Bengaluru-based hacker Srikrishna alias Sriki. He was also accused of breaking into government portals and of sourcing drugs through the darknet while paying for it. He is also accused of hacking into some bitcoin exchanges and was also involved in money laundering by converting Indian currency to bitcoins. Officers in Karnataka Police, who didn’t want to be named said that the suspect despite having cases of serious financial crimes against him is out of bail. It is alleged that while the official records show that 33 bitcoins were recovered from him, in fact, that seizure was much bigger. “A tip-off from an international intelligence, which was tracking the hacker’s activity, had tipped off India’s central agencies. From the information available to us, a probe is being conducted into whether there was a coverup and bribe paid in the form of cryptocurrency,” said the officer. The allegations come at a time even though there is at least three serious growing discontentment over portfolio distribution, lack of funds being released for development works and rumblings over the projection of the incumbent as the next chief ministerial candidate within the BJP ranks against Basavaraj Bommai, who was chosen by overlooking several seniors within the party. There have been talks of a change in leadership and the allegations may fuel it, said another person aware of the developments. The BJP had forced BS Yediyurappa to step down from the top post over allegations of corruption by him and his family members and hoped to make a smooth transition of power in order to suffer the least number of damages before the 2023 assembly elections. The Congress has spared no opportunity to corner the BJP on charges of corruption that could further dent the saffron outfits’ chances in Karnataka which it is its strongest base in southern India and its gateway to the other regions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/influential-politicians-linked-to-bitcoin-scam-congress-accuses-bjp-of-coverup-101635447888269.html
29-10-2021||India||Karnataka HC grants bail to Bineesh Kodiyeri in money Laundering case||The Karnataka high court on Thursday granted bail to Bineesh Kodiyeri, son of senior CPI(M) leader Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) under money laundering charges linked to a drug haul in Bengaluru last year. The single judge bench of Justice M G Uma granted bail to Kodiyeri under several conditions overruling objections of additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi who appeared for the ED. The counsel for the accused Guru Krishnakumar contended that the Narcotics Control Bureau after its detailed investigation failed to find any involvement of Kodiyeri in drug trade and his transaction with some of the accused were through banks. He also said his client was not aware of the alleged drug dealings of his business partner Mohammad Anoop. The ED’s counsel, however, said he amassed huge wealth and funding for this came through his business partner who was involved in a drug cartel in Bengaluru. But the court overruled his contentions. “The bail is allowed subject to conditions,” the judge said while granting him bail. His father, CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, had to quit last year after the case surfaced and it invited enough embarrassment to the party and government. A small-time actor and cricket player, Bineesh Kodiyeri has often been surrounded by controversy; but he managed to get away due to his high connections. He was also close to many actors and businessmen. The drug case surfaced on Aug 2020 after the arrest of Anoop Mohammad and two others in Bengaluru and Mohammad later took the name of Bineesh Kodiyeri and said he was his business partner. Later the ED took over the case and Kodiyeri was arrested and charged under Section 19 (1) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The ED said he pumped in unaccounted money into the bank account of alleged drug peddler Anoop Mohammad and took heavy returns from it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-hc-grants-bail-to-bineesh-kodiyeri-in-money-laundering-case-101635447710230.html
29-10-2021||India||Report highlights worrying rise in hate crimes in north Karnataka||With more than 100 communal incidents reported every year in the coastal Karnataka region, religious politics has always been a main issue in the elections. However, over the past decade, northern districts of the state, too, have started to report such cases, said police report. The recent murder of a 24-year-old Muslim man Arbaz Mullah, allegedly orchestrated by a Hindutva group, on September 28, and murder of a Hindu man who was in a relationship with a Muslim woman in Vijayapura district on October 24, have put the spotlight on north Karnataka’s growing communal problem. However, a local activist claimed that while the murder brought attention to the problem, communal tensions in the region have been brewing for years now, but went unnoticed. On April 22, a pastor, Sanjay Bhandari, had come to Belagavi to visit his sister-in-law after they arrived in the city for a medical check-up for his wife. While they were having tea at home, a mob of 50-60 men came there while some of them barged into the house. They accused him of indulging religious conversion and ignored the pleas of his wife’s family, paraded him around the city. They beat him and asked him to chant ‘Jai Sri Ram’, as per police compliant. These incidents that often go under the media’s radar have been reported in the region for a while, claim activists. A city-based lawyer said that the number of communal incidents in Belagavi district in north Karnataka has been on the rise for years now. “A decade earlier, the conflict in the district was over language. The Marathi and Kannada-speaking population in the district were at loggerhead over whether Belagavi should go to Maharashtra or not. Over these, the groups that were active on his issue moved to Hindutva politics. Now compared to coastal Karnataka these groups are well organized. But the biggest concern is the fact that their activities will be as well coordinated as the coastal region,” he said.“The coastal region is infamous for the moral policing and communal incident, but the biggest concern for us the syndicates like that emerging from north Karnataka. The region now has an illegal arms market. As of now, several right-wing group members are on watch after the discovery of this syndicate,” said a senior police officer, who didn’t want to be named. A fact-finding report on the murder of Arbaz by a citizen’s team that visited Belagavi too reported that the radicalization of society along religious lines has been a key factor in the rise of the BJP in the district. “The handiwork of the RSS over the last two decades, outfits like the Bajrang Dal, Sanatan Sanstha, Sri Ram Sene, and Sri Ram Sene (Hindustan) now compete with each other in showcasing their allegiance to the tenets of Hindutva,” read the report. R Mohanraj, an activist based in Belagavi, said that the biggest concern in recent years has been complacency from the government. “We did have communal tensions in this region in the past but there was a fear of the law. The police during those times cracked down on such elements as well. But in the past years, there is certain impunity these groups are enjoying since police are not actively stopping these groups,” he said. Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on October 13 had even stoked a controversy with his statements that appeared to justify incidents of moral policing and communal disharmony in the state. “There are several sentiments in the society. Those emotions should not be affected and such should be the behaviour. When such emotions are hurt there is likely to be an action and reaction,” Bommai told reporters. Another activist said that the chief minister’s statement was an open admission of what has been happening behind the scene for several years. “There are clear instructions from the government not to act against Hindutva group. Unless there is an internal squabble within these organizations or if cases get media attention, you wouldn’t hear about police taking action,” said the activist. According to the Special Investigation Team (SIT) that probed the murder of journalist turned activist Gauri Lankesh had said as many as 22 Karnataka youths got training in the use of firearms so they could carry out assassinations of intellectuals. Parashuram Waghmore, who pulled the trigger on Lankesh was one among them. The SIT investigation on the conspiracy found that the syndicate that murdered Lankesh was recruiting young men from various right-wing organizations, who had a tussle with the law in the past. Waghmore was recruited from Sri Rama Sene. The investigation also unearthed a link between the murders of four rationalists – MM Kalburgi, Govind Pansare, Narendra Dhabolkar, and Lankesh. During the initial days of the investigation, the SIT found a connection between the murders of Lankesh and professor Kalburgi, who was killed on August 30, 2015. The four bullet slugs and cartridges recovered from Lankesh’s house matched with the slugs and cartridges of the Kalburgi murder case. The forensic labs found that both bullets were fired from the same gun. The Maharashtra SIT, which is probing the murder of another rationalist, Govind Pansare, also found that the same was used in Lankesh and Pansare murders. The link between the murders of Lankesh and Narendra Dhabolkar, another Maharashtra-based rationalist, murdered on August 20, 2013, emerged during the later stages of the investigation. It was found that 50-year-old Rajesh Bangera, a second division assistant in the Education Department, who was the 10th person arrested by Karnataka SIT, provided weapons training to the killers of Dhabolkar and Lankesh in Belagavi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/report-highlights-worrying-rise-in-hate-crimes-in-north-karnataka-101635447708597.html

He must apologize to the nation now for all his forged reports about 2G and Coal block allocations done by the UPA Govt.”Rai’s report on the notional losses incurred by the exchequer in the 2G spectrum and coal block auctions -- ₹1.76 lakh crore and ₹1.86 lakh crore respectively -- caused a stir when they were released in 2011 and 2012 respectively. In 2014, the Congress-led UPA was voted out of power for corruption and misgovernance. In 2014, Vinod Rai said in multiple interviews that Nirupam was one of the MPs who pressured him to keep then PM Manmohan Singh’s name out of the CAG report on 2-G Spectrum allocation.In his affidavit he said his charges against Nirupam were factually incorrect.“I have realised that, in answer to questions posed to me by the interviewers, I had inadvertently and wrongly mentioned the name of Shri Sanjay Nirupam as one of the MPs, who pressurised me to keep the then Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh’s name out of the CAG report on 2-G Spectrum allocation during the meetings in the PAC or the sidelines of the JPC etc.”A jubilant Nirupam also put out a video where he said, “Today is a great day as former CAG Vinod Rai has provided an unconditional apology to me for his false claim that I pressured him to keep PM Singh’s name out of the 2G spectrum report.” He further remarked that Rai’s reports on the 2G spectrum and coal block allocation were “nonesense”, saying that “after several hearings spanning across seven years on the 2G report, the court also noted that there was no evidence of a scam.” “The entire report was fabricated, and Vinod Rai must also tender an apology to the entire nation for these false reports,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/excag-vinod-rai-tenders-apology-to-sanjay-nirupam-for-factually-incorrect-accusations-101635446927555.html

The two couples filed separate petitions, alleging that the families of the women were interfering in their day-to-day life.One petition was filed by Shayara Khatun and her partner of Kushi Nagar (both major and in live-in-relationship for the past more than two years) and another by Zeenat Parveen and her partner of Meerut (both major and in a live-in relationship for the past year). The partners in both the cases were unnamed in the lawsuit.It was stated that they approached the concerned police authorities, but did not get any help and consequently, their life and liberty were undermined. The court at the outset underscored that the right to life enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution was liable to be protected at all costs and further went on to observe: “Live-in relationships have become part and parcel of life and stand approved by the Hon’ble apex court. Live-in relationship is required to be viewed through the lens of personal autonomy arising out of the right to live guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, rather than notions of social morality.” The court said that police authorities were obligated to protect the rights of the petitioners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/livein-relationships-part-of-life-hc-101635446627459.html
29-10-2021||India||HT Tourism Conclave: Covid led to digital surge among travellers, says Thomas Cook MD||The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the rollout of technologies in the travel sector, thereby easing ways in which people access hospitality services, Madhavan Menon, managing director, Thomas Cook (India) Limited, said on Thursday. Swifter adoption of technology and shift in priorities of domestic travellers were some of the changes that the pandemic brought to the fore, he added. Speaking at the Hindustan Times Tourism Conclave here, Menon said, “Application of technology was an expensive proposition years ago. Until a few years ago, we decided the options that we gave to customers. Today, in the outbound business, the customer seeks details on the manner in which they want to interact with us in a medium comfortable to them. Our ways of working have changed and now, the customer gets to decide how they want to interact with us. They can make transactions remotely through video if they don’t want to visit our stores.” Another change that the sector witnessed was a rise in road travel on the domestic front and increased focus on hygiene and comfort, Menon said. “We have witnessed a new aspect of people driving to destinations. Earlier, people drove to a destination four-five hours away but now, they are covering a much longer distance. Hygiene has become a very important element too,” he said.The Thomas Cook (India) Limited MD said that revival of both inbound and outbound tourism was expected in the coming months as borders open up. “This season will look very different when it comes to inbound tourism. From November 15, the government will issue visas for foreigners. We need to open our borders and bilateral flights are not good enough. The inbound business in its true form will only come back in 2022. By 2023, there will be a full-blown impact,” he said.Menon also said that Indians would eagerly opt for outbound travel but were only kept away by the limited number of destinations and the requirements of RT-PCR tests and the fear of getting infected. “The outbound travel also looks positive,” he said. He added that while high flight rates were a deterrent, they were expected to stabilise soon. “There are not enough routes for airlines to fly. Airlines are waiting for borders to open. Airfares will start settling down from November 1 as the US opens. The fares should settle down soon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-tourism-conclave-covid-led-to-digital-surge-among-travellers-says-thomas-cook-md-101635446568434.html
29-10-2021||India||Incredible India 3.0 need of the hour to revive industry: Expert||Promotion of brand India, a re-energized and well-marketed Incredible India campaign, focus on experiential travel and increased budgetary allocation for tourism are some of the key factors necessary for revival of tourism in the post-pandemic world, say industry experts.Dipak Deva, co-chairman, FICCI Travel, Tourism and Hospitality Committee, on Thursday said there were ample opportunities to revive the travel industry but it is necessary to begin work now.“Every country is standing on the same starting line today. All of them want to open up after the pandemic and are waiting for customers. There is a huge opportunity for incredible India. The government needs to grab the opportunity and bring tourists back in a sustainable manner. It needs to bring a fantastic Incredible India 3.0 campaign that instills trust in India,” Deva, who is also the chairman of FICCI Inbound Tourism Committee and Managing Director, SITA, TCI and Distant Frontier, said.Speaking at the Hindustan Times Tourism Conclave here, Deva said the revival of tourism in a post-pandemic world would require good promotion and marketing to send out a message that the country is safe for travel and tourism.“We should go back to four or five key markets such as the UK, France, Germany, Russia and Japan. Through a digital campaign that is popular on social media, we need to drive home the message that India is open for tourism. The most important thing is to have smart marketing companies aboard who can carry the message that India is safe and secure across geographies,” Deva said.The recovery of inbound tourists into India is expected from January next year, he said. “Once recovery starts, we can expect a steady growth by 2023-24. The aim is to bring growth back to 2019 levels, the best year ever for tourism, by 2024,” he added.Deva said that while the government has taken steps such as reduction of GST and visa fee and issued 500,000 free tourist visas, it was crucial to grant export status to tourism and increase budget allocation for it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/httourism-conclave-incredible-india-3-0-need-of-the-hour-for-tourism-revival-says-expert-101635446388450.html
29-10-2021||India||‘Traditional itinerary must change to meet new demands’, says IRCTC official||There is a need to move out of the traditional itinerary and adopt new ways of travel amid a change in pattern in the tourism sector, Indian Rail Catering Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) official Rajni Hasjia said on Thursday, citing Covid-19 pandemic.Speaking at the Hindustan Times Tourism Conclave in Delhi, Hasjia, who is the tourism and marketing director of IRCTC, said the travel sector is set to undergo a transition from multi-destination tours to offbeat and slow-paced destinations.“The hospitality and the tourism industry are still finding it difficult to come to terms after being hit badly during the pandemic. IRCTC has a pan-India presence and has products ranging from ₹800 to 800 dollars a day. Mass tourism is gradually coming back to normal. However, we cannot forget that there is a certain transition from the multi-destination and fast pace tours to the offbeat destinations and the slow-paced tours. We need to explore and move out of the traditional itinerary and come to the adventure itineraries. The time has come to think of adopting new ways and methods on dealing with tourism,” she said.The official said that IRCTC has already introduced river cruise tourism, biking and caravan tours to meet the changing needs of travellers and will soon introduce wellness tours in the country.Amid a spurt in domestic tourism, IRCTC has been working on the deluxe luxury segment and has also received a good response from consumers, Hasjia said.“IRCTC is blessed with the strength of railways that we carry along. We are an extended arm of Indian Railways. We were anticipating that due to visa restrictions, luxury tourism is not going to happen... We have done a lot of work for domestic tourism as well and launched several products in the deluxe segment, for example Char Dham, Padharo Rajasthan and the Ramayana Express. To our surprise, we got a very good response and were able to sell the full inventory,” she said.The railways-owned body is hoping to get back its foreign tourism with India gradually opening its economy. People are waiting for India to open and we are likely to have a good number of bookings from the UK and USA market, she said.Speaking on the public private partnership (PPP) with the hospitality and travel agents sector, Hasjia said IRCTC believes that showcasing the infrastructure of the states through virtual mode would help promote digital marketing.“When infrastructure comes up, tourism activity gets facilitated. When services are improved, there is a direct impact on tourism. At this time, focus is directed on tourism and the ministry of tourism is going its way,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/httourism-conclave-traditional-itinerary-must-change-to-meet-new-demands-says-irctc-official-101635446268532.html

In those areas where Covid cases are low, we saw this concept of ‘revenge tourism’ because people want to step out and travel to places they have not gone to. It may be isolated villas, or staycation or boating. I am highly optimistic and see a V-shaped recovery for this sector in the coming few months,” he said. “In the post-Covid world, this sector will be our sponge industry which will absorb the highest number of employment growth, highest revenue for the state, and it will have a ripple effect on the country’s economy,” he added.The state tourism minister also said there has been a change in the pattern of tourists since the onset of Covid-19. People have turned to forests, farms, open areas and isolated properties instead of the usual tourist spots, he said.“The two-three day vacations have changed to three-four day vacations within the city. People book hotels and stay there. Another trend that we have seen in Karjat, Mahabaleshwar, Matheran and even in Konkan is that people are visiting these areas for five to six weeks and during their stay here, they are working from home. The forest sector is picking up and people want to go into the wild and explore. Caravan tourism has picked up,” he said.“Agritourism is doing really well in Maharashtra as we have seen in Tuscany. Wineries in Nashik, strawberry farms in Mahabaleshwar, mango farms in Konkan, just staying on a farm is an experience because they are safe and being in nature, as opposed to being in a crowd in a hotel. The Agritourism concept is catching on like wildfire. Wherever we have space and where farmers can expand their homes, agritourism is developing,” he added.The minister described the last one-and-a-half-years of Covid-19 pandemic as a time for reflection and reformation for his department, which came up with several policies and also eased processes of granting clearances.Thackeray acknowledged that the Maharashtra government has been slow in relaxing Covid-19 restrictions but said it will continue to go forward cautiously.“We are one of the few sub-national governments that have been painfully slow and staggered, and we will continue to be so. For us, healthcare is a priority. We do not want people to visit hospitals but we want them to safely visit tourist spots. We have been hard on the double-vaccination protocol, masking and the overall reopening. We will cautiously follow this,” he said.The minister also spoke about the environment and climate crisis mitigation, and adaptation measures, saying a combined effort by states will help India lead the way.Making a pitch for sustainable development, Thackeray said: “Sustainable development is needed today. The development where we cut trees for roads, highways or trains is having an impact on climate. We need development that will lead to climate crisis mitigation or adaptation. Only Maharashtra or Delhi or Tamil Nadu doing something will leave us in isolation. We need to meet and ideate to adopt what has worked elsewhere. This will have a huge impact and India can lead the world.”Recently, Thackeray had written to environment ministers of other states on the “climate emergency” that the world is facing. “Just like Covid has hit us without any barriers, the climate crisis too will hit all the countries without barriers. The greatest inequality of the climate crisis is that it hits the worst to the ones who are least responsible for it. Landslides, rising sea levels, drought, famines, unseasonal rainfall… we need to think about these issues when we think about India,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tourism-on-road-to-recovery-in-maharashtra-says-aaditya-thackeray-101635445939503.html

The greatest inequality of the climate crisis is that it hits the worst to the ones who are least responsible for it. Landslides, rising sea levels, drought, famines, unseasonal rainfall… we need to think about these issues when we think about India,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-tourism-conclave-tourism-on-road-to-recovery-in-maharashtra-says-aaditya-thackeray-101635446028614.html

29-10-2021||India||Opposition to meet in November to discuss key issues ahead of winter session||Top leaders from more than 18 opposition parties will meet in the last week of November, a few days before the winter session of Parliament, to discuss farmers’ issues, developments in the Pegasus spyware controversy and floor strategy for the session, a senior leader told HT. The winter session is likely to start on November 29.Congress president Sonia Gandhi had earlier presided over the first such meeting on August 21 and appealed to India’s top opposition leaders to rise above individual compulsions “in the interest of the nation” and start planning “systematically” as the “ultimate goal is the 2024 Lok Sabha elections”.The next meeting assumes significance as the undercurrent of tension between the Congress and the Trinamool Congress has resurfaced after key Congress leaders switched over to the West Bengal’s ruling party in recent times. “There was an earlier proposal to hold a meeting in October, but some Congress leaders suggested more time should be given before the meeting,” said a senior Congress leader requesting anonymity.This group of 18 parties holds the promise of a united fight against the formidable Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA in the 2024 polls. But the parties also face internal challenges of accommodating the political ambitions and interests of one another. While the United Progressive Alliance (2005-2014) and National Democratic Alliance (1998-2004; 2014-now) have been successful examples of coalition politics in the history of India, the failure of the United Front government (1996-98) and National Front (1989-90) are stark reminders of the collapse of such political dreams.Political analyst Nilanjan Sircar said in a tweet, “Despite the rhetoric, the main states in which TMC is pushing so far (Goa, Tripura, WB) are not particularly critical to Cong’s seat share. Until we see more, this is not obviously a threat to Opposition outcomes/unity in 2024.”The Congress, however, questioned Trinamool’s intention of fighting the Goa election. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala remarked that “election is not tourism”. “But they (TMC) should ask themselves what is the objective? Are they strengthening the cause of BJP or are they really in the contest for their own place in the polity of Goa?”Trinamool brushed aside the allegations and one of its senior leaders argued that both the Congress and the BJP have lost the support of the people.A senior leader said that while CPI(Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury will be coordinating with some parties, Congress leaders will coordinate with TMC for the meeting. A section of the Congress, however, remains sceptical. “If things go like this, we can’t see how to work with TMC,” said a Congress strategist who didn’t want to be identified.In this situation, the next meeting, leaders suggest, might just focus on immediate issues such as Pegasus, farmers, and the Parliament session and not the larger 2024 election for now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-to-meet-in-november-to-discuss-farmers-issue-pegasus-floor-strategy-101635445548175.html

The summit will allow the leaders to exchange ideas on how G20 can be an engine for “strengthening economic resilience and building back inclusively” from the pandemic, he added.India has been pushing developed countries to share more finances and technology to cope with climate change. On the other hand, the developed countries want India to frame updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) or targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.Shringla told a news briefing ahead of Modi’s departure for the G20 Summit and COP26 that India has been “one of the best performers” in G20 as far as meeting the commitments of COP26 is concerned.“We are well on our way to meeting our NDC commitments and even doing better than that,” he said. In addition to commitments under the Paris Accord, India has made unilateral announcements that set much higher benchmarks.With developed countries announcing this week that they will miss by three years their promise of $100 billion a year as funding to developing countries to manage the climate crisis, Shringla said India wants clearly defined commitments in this regard. The means of delivering “green financing and green technology” is key to enabling developing countries to meet their climate action commitments, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-expecting-concrete-outcomes-at-cop26-shringla-101635445191760.html
29-10-2021||India||Aryan Khan's ordeal opens legal debate||The 25-day ordeal of Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan in a drug consumption case has thrown open a legal debate on whether the Supreme Court should lay down guidelines to distinguish betw-een small consumers or those found in the company of small consumers and the carriers, who are part of drug syndicates.Legal experts feel that traditionally, the stringent Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) was used to check traffickers, drug peddlers and people procuring and transporting a large quantity of narcotic drugs.Such investigations, therefore, warranted the trial courts to exercise their discretion in granting bail with utmost caution. But since the Act makes consumption or possession of even small quantity of drugs an offence, the line of distinction has faded.Senior advocate KV Vishwanathan said: “There is a need to categorise and distinguish small consumers of drugs from carriers who are part of international drug mafia. How can all categories of offenders under the broad rubric of NDPS be put in the same boat? There is a need for a graded mechanism for adjudicating bail applications in NDPS cases. The Supreme Court should step in and lay down guidelines so that this area of discretion exercised by courts below is guided by certain principles in matters of grant of bail.”He lamented that the principle of ‘bail and not jail’ is reversed to ‘jail and not bail’. “One must also see it from the perspective of whether keeping such persons in jail will reform them as they are victim themselves,” said Vishwanathan.Aryan Khan is not alone in suffering he rigours of the law and the procedure that it entails. Although the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) did not recover contraband from his possession, based on WhatsApp chats, he was sought to be linked to a drug syndicate and accused of consuming charas at a rave party onboard a Goa-bound cruise ship. Similar charges were pressed against Bollywood actor Rhea Chakraborty who was accused of procuring and financing drugs for her boyfriend and film actor Sushant Singh Rajput. A month after her arrest, she secured bail from the Bombay High Court on October 7, 2020.Kannada film actress Ragini Nayak had to suffer the same fate after the Karnataka police alleged she was part of a drug syndicate responsible for supplying and transporting drugs. She was arrested on September 4, 2020 and had to wage a protracted legal battle to secure bail from the Supreme Court on January 21 this year.Former Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Maninder Singh seconded the view for framing guidelines on bail under NDPS cases. “When it comes to liberty of citizens, the Supreme Court has stood up and exercised its extraordinary powers to cut discretion of police and law enforcement agencies to arrest a person.” “If the quantity of narcotic drug involved is of small quantity and is meant for personal consumption, the Union Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, while reviewing the NDPS Act, issued a circular last week to end punishment for offences under this category, treating them to be victims who require compulsory treatment and not jail,” he said.Senior advocate Rebecca John said that Aryan should have been given bail two weeks ago by the trial court. “From a young man who had no possession and you have some artificial story relating to international conspiracy…Basically, NCB was snubbed by the high court today as they were not even allowed to complete their arguments. You can see how muddied this investigation has become with all the drama.”Senior lawyer Vikas Pahwa said he is pained to see how a premier agency like NCB is focusing all its energies only on issues of consumption of small quantities by young individuals, instead of focusing on illicit traffickers of drugs in the country.“The arrest, police remands and subsequent judicial remands of Aryan Khan in my view were completely illegal and beyond the provisions of code of criminal procedure. No offences under NDPS Act were made out against Aryan, since nothing was recovered from his person and there was no evidence of consumption by him. The allegations of conspiracy and illicit trafficking of drugs made against him for opposing his bail, look completely misplaced and without any evidence,” said Pahwa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aryans-ordeal-opens-legal-debate-101635445188345.html

Wankhede’s sister, Yasmeen, has filed a police complaint seeking registration of a first information report (FIR) against Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik for allegedly defaming her, a senior official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-wankhede-arrest-without-notice-maharashtra-govt-to-high-court-101635445130296.html
29-10-2021||India||‘India to push for climate finance at global summit’, says Bhupender Yadav||India will pursue ways to mitigate the climate crisis beyond its present nationally determined contribution (NDC), and will act constructively to combat the problem, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav told Jayashree Nandi in an interview before leaving for the Glasgow climate change conference (COP 26). Yadav said India is considering several options ahead of COP 26 but it will argue for a “common level playing field” for developed and developing nations so that their climate ambitions can be comparable. Climate finance and technology access provided by developed countries will be instrumental in determining actions that India will take. Excerpts:Excerpts:What will India’s stance at COP 26 be?Under the leadership of PM Modi, India has almost achieved its present NDCs that it declared in 2015. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its sixth assessment report informed humanity that global warming will pose a danger to each and every one of us. So, we believe that individual effort by each country will resolve this global crisis. How India is pursuing its present NDCs should set an example for all countries. India has also initiated some new forums like the International Solar Alliance, Coalition of Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, Leadership Group for Industry Transition. Apart from dialogues with other countries, such forums also provide avenues to innovate and cooperate. At COP 26 too, India will push for a common level playing field for all countries by pushing for climate finance and technology transfer. India will act to solve the problem.What are key issues for India at COP 26?Like I said, for a common level playing field for both developed and developing countries, finance mobilisation and technology transfer is a must. Countries with historic responsibility for high carbon emissions should have a commensurate role in mitigation of the climate crisis. It’s the duty of developed nations.In this COP following the IPCC report, a transparency framework (review of mitigation actions taken by countries), climate finance, and mitigation will be very important. India will play a constructive role during negotiations on these issues.Will India’s goal of 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030 be announced as part of its NDC?We have nearly achieved our present NDCs and we have already made our goals more ambitious. We can do more than what is in our NDC. Whether the 450 GW goal is in our NDC or not India will do more than what it has promised.Have you rejected the idea of a net zero goal for India?No. We haven’t said anything like that. Options are open for us. We are a solution provider. We haven’t claimed anything like rejecting net zero goal. Our leadership will announce our climate goal at an appropriate time and appropriate forum.How will India argue for equity and common but differentiated responsibility in climate crisis mitigation?Climate crisis mitigation is a common goal for all countries but every country’s social, economic, and geographic circumstances are different. We are not on the same level playing field. I think our mitigation targets can be similar only when technological innovation and finance is made available to all. Vulnerable countries need to be supported on priority. Negotiations are not about competing; they are for everyone’s well-being and benefit. We need a consensus on saving the planet.What will India’s view on carbon markets be?Under the Kyoto protocol, we had market mechanisms. Some developed countries moved away from them. That mechanism needs to be considered. When we talk about carbon credits under Article 6 (of the Paris agreement), we should also consider historical wrongs and contribution to climate change. There should be a provision of green credits also which can contribute to climate finance. The new market mechanism shouldn’t be an approach where one part of the planet becomes a dump yard and another cleans up its emissions at the cost of the other side. That should not happen. There should be a balancing act and green contribution to climate finance which can support developing nations. Article 6 is a matter of negotiation. It’s important to us.Chinese President Xi Jinping may not be attending COP 26. In the recent past China has occupied a very large share of carbon space. How do you see their role?Carbon space will be a matter of negotiation. There should be consensus that whoever occupies carbon space has an impact on the world by contributing to global warming. The impacts will also be felt across their boundary wall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhupender-yadav-interview-india-to-push-for-climate-finance-technology-transfer-at-cop26-101635444408129.html
29-10-2021||India||Why Aryan’s case highlights aberrations||The first lesson taught in law college when dealing with the topic of personal liberty under Article 21, is that bail is a rule and jail an exception.While this principle was honoured for long, in the past three decades this declared judicial principle, though ceaselessly repeated and reiterated, has become an elusive goal, and we have witnessed a transition from a liberal attitude towards bail to judicial conservatism. Add to this the trend of imposing additional legislative restrictions that obligate an accused to first show that he is not guilty of the offence before bail can even be considered.The post-Emergency era till the early 1990s was liberty oriented. However, economic liberalisation led to an increased incursion of the reach of criminal law to almost every aspect of life accompanied by restrictive approach in matters of bail. Compounding the problem is the oppressive twin conditions of bail, ie, proving your innocence and that you will not commit any such offence, applied rampantly across statutes such as PMLA (money laundering), UAPA (terror cases), and Companies Act.The extinguishment of the presumption of innocence, the reversal of the burden of proving innocence on the accused and the consequent circumventing of the protections under the Indian Constitution (Article 14, 21, 22) has led to a divorce between the Constitution and these special statutes, especially in matters of bail.Even after the Supreme Court struck down the restrictive twin conditions stipulated in PMLA in Nikesh Tarachand Shah [2017], Parliament has brought them back through an amendment to PMLA. Although the twin conditions are presently under challenge before the Supreme Court, these conditions ensured that the presumption of innocence (part of our constitutionally protected rights) is rendered otiose. Such restrictive bail conditions have adversely impacted discretion in matters of bail and individuals are now left at the mercy of the investigating agencies.Till about three decades ago, the high court was the last court in matters of bail. That position has changed and the approach even at the high court level is based on the individual philosophy of individual judge. The consequence of all these factors is that with a restrictive exercise of discretion at the magisterial court, sessions court and often at the high court level, the Supreme Court is overwhelmed with challenges to orders cancelling bail as also seeking bail under Article 136 of the Constitution of India.Repeated challenges to the grant of bail by high courts and trial courts have resulted into an adverse impact in the exercise of discretion.Aggravating the problem is incessant 24x7 electronic media debate and social media discourse. Such media trials often question exercise of discretion in matters of bail amid an incessant attack dehors appreciation of facts or of the law.Power of arrest vests both with state police agencies and the central agencies, some of which have co-ordinate investigative powers in the states.Though the Narcotics Control Bureau has to look at fundamental issues such as eradicating illicit drug crops, implementing domestic and international trade control and assisting states in their drug law enforcement efforts, yet it is witnessed that of late it has chosen to exercise its investigating power in the states, despite the fact that the state police is fully empowered to investigate cases under the NDPS Act.The difficulty that arises is when police seek to justify their existence by using their authority to target cases of individual allegations and then hype them up to justify such arrests and detention.In 2020, there have been cases in Karnataka and Chhattisgarh where a similar pattern was followed with arbitrary arrests even of those who had no narcotics in their possession and such persons have languished in jail for as long as six months or more, till bail was finally granted by the Supreme Court.Under the NDPS Act where there is no recovery of drugs, the reverse burden of proving one’s innocence is not attracted and nor can the presumption of guilt in NDPS be drawn. Yet, bail is refused at the first instance as agencies vehemently oppose bail irrespective of lack of evidence. Whether such cases will ever reach trial is ignored. Aryan Khan’s case has highlighted these aberrations in the criminal justice system.Meanwhile, there are countless many who continue to languish in custody without trial and conviction, waiting for their bail pleas to be heard while investigations and trials are delayed inordinately.(Sidharth Luthra is a senior advocate and former additional solicitor general of India.

29-10-2021||India||ASEAN meet: PM Modi stresses need for open Indo-Pacific region||India and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) on Thursday agreed to build on convergences in their vision of the Indo-Pacific to work for a free, open, inclusive, and rules-based region against the backdrop of China’s assertiveness.Leaders of the two sides welcomed the adoption of the “Asean-India joint statement on cooperation on the Asean outlook on the Indo-Pacific for peace, stability and prosperity in the region” at their virtual summit. Prime Minister Narendra Modi stressed the importance of strengthening convergences between India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI) and Asean’s outlook on Indo-Pacific to ensure freedom of navigation and overflight in line with international laws.Modi also called for an early review of the Asean-India Trade in Goods Agreement, which has been pending for long, and this was backed by the 10-member grouping. Brunei’s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, the current chair of Asean, said the review should make the pact more business-friendly to support economic recovery efforts.“This special role of Asean, India’s Act East policy which is contained in our Security and Growth for All in the Region, ie SAGAR policy, India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative and Asean’s outlook for the Indo-Pacific are the framework for our shared vision and mutual cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region,” Modi said in his opening remarks at the summit.Riva Ganguly Das, secretary (East) in the external affairs ministry, said the joint statement on the Indo-Pacific was “one of the very major highlights of this summit”. The statement “charts a way forward for practical implementation of the convergences in our vision of the Indo-Pacific” to ensure peace, prosperity, and stability in the region, she said.Modi also asked Asean leaders to join any of the seven pillars of IPOI. Indonesia is currently a member of the marine resources pillar.The joint statement seeks to build on maritime connectivity between India and Asean states and work done by the two sides since they became summit-level partners in 2002 and strategic partners in 2012. It embraces Asean centrality, openness, transparency, a rules-based framework, respect for sovereignty, non-intervention, and respect for international laws, including the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).According to the joint statement, the two sides will support Asean community building and strengthen the bilateral strategic partnership in politics, security, economic matters, and development cooperation by using existing Asean-led mechanisms such as the East Asia Summit, and Asean Regional Forum.The two sides will reinforce the Asean-centred regional architecture to deal with challenges and to focus on opportunities “arising from current and future regional and global environments with a focus on the open, inclusive and rules-based regional architecture”. They will explore potential cooperation between in the four areas outlined in the Asean Outlook on the Indo-Pacific — maritime cooperation, connectivity, sustainable development goals (SDGs) and economic cooperation.In addition, the two sides will also explore possible cooperation in areas such as capacity building, scholarships and training courses, enhancing trade facilitation, social infrastructure development, enhanced capacities for response to pandemics and public health emergencies and for vaccine and pharmaceutical research, prevention and management of zoonoses, and maritime transport cooperation.While exchanging views on the Covid-19 crisis, Modi assured Asean of India’s support as exemplified by the provision of medical supplies worth $200,000 for a humanitarian initiative for Myanmar and $1 million for the Asean Covid-19 Response Fund.Hassanal Bolkiah said Asean and India should work on sustainable economic recovery by exploring new opportunities under the “Blue Economy”, including developing key industries that can generate jobs and enhance connectivity, such as fisheries and maritime transport.The two sides also highlighted the importance of greater physical and digital connectivity, and cooperation on digital inclusion to ensure a comprehensive post-pandemic recovery. In the realm of connectivity, secretary (East) Ganguly Das described the eastward expansion of the India-Myanmar-Thailand highway as an important proposal. A report on this is ready and India is waiting for the Asean response on how to proceed, she said.The situation in Myanmar following the military coup in February also figured in the India-Asean Summit and Ganguly Das said the Indian side remains engaged on providing humanitarian aid, including vaccines and medicines, to the neighbouring country.“As a close neighbour of Myanmar, India will continue to support restoration of peace and democratic process in Myanmar for it to emerge as a stable, democratic federal union,” she said.The two sides also declared 2022 as the India-Asean Friendship Year to mark 30 years of the partnership and decided to hold a series of events round the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/asean-meet-modi-stresses-need-for-open-indo-pacific-region-101635443989577.html

This has heightened the need to build comprehensive national capabilities and bio-defence, bio-safety, and bio-security,” he said.He said the Covid-19 pandemic has reinforced the need to predict threats and while biological research has legitimate scientific purposes, its dual-use application can be misused.Doval said new areas of warfare have shifted from territorial frontiers to civil societies, adding that factors like people’s health, sense of wellbeing and security, and their perception of government impact the will of a nation.Pointing at the changes taking place in global security landscape, he said, “Wars are increasingly becoming cost-ineffective instruments of achieving the nation’s political and military objectives. The new areas of warfare have shifted from merely territorial frontiers to the civil societies. The common people’s thinking, health, sense of well-being and their perception of their government have assumed new importance.”All these elements, Doval said, impact the will of the nation.Protecting people from false and motivated propaganda also becomes “absolutely necessary” in the age of information revolution, the NSA said. National security planning needs to factor in all these challenges and strategies to maximum international cooperation, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deliberate-weaponisation-of-pathogens-big-concern-need-to-develop-bio-defence-nsa-ajit-doval-101635443929268.html

In all the 11 districts, the positivity was over 90%. This shows that a huge proportion of the people in Delhi have had the infection and many others have been vaccinated. This report is very positive,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain.
29-10-2021||India||Cricket and patriotism: What links them in India||Pakistan’s victory over India in the ongoing T20 cricket World Cup match on October 24 has kicked up a political storm in India. First there was uproar over online trolling which targeted India’s pace bowler Mohammad Shami along religious lines. Many Opposition leaders came out in Shami’s support, and several cricketers and the Board of Control for Cricket in India also spoke up for him. Meanwhile, reports of Muslims celebrating Pakistan’s victory started doing the rounds. Those who did so will be booked under sedition charges, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said in a tweet on October 28.Politics around India-Pakistan matches is not new in India. But what drives such politics? Is it just social media noise, or does it have widespread resonance in the country ? Do most Indians see supporting India’s cricket team as the litmus test of patriotism? Is there a difference in how Hindus and Muslims think about this question? What about political rhetoric which tries to portray Indian Muslims as pro-Pakistan? Is jingoism around cricket the most dangerous communal threat in India?A survey conducted by the Pew Research Centre, a Washington based “nonpartisan fact tank” provides some answers. The survey, Religion in India: Tolerance and Segregation, is based on 30,000 interviews conducted between November 2019 and March 2020.1. Supporting the Indian cricket team is not the biggest test of being Indian, but the idea has large tractionOne of the questions the survey asked was what one has to do in order to be considered “truly Indian”. 56% of the respondents listed supporting the Indian cricket team as an answer. While this was not the most popular answer to this question ( 70% cited having Indian ancestry and 69% said having knowledge of India’s freedom struggle matters), it is still significant.As it to be expected, the response to what makes someone truly Indian varies significantly across religion and region. Cricket nationalism is more prevalent in the northern and eastern regions of the country and among Hindus and Jains. India’s non-Muslim religious minorities (Sikhs and Christians) are less receptive to the idea of supporting the Indian cricket team being sacrosanct to one’s Indian identity than Muslims.

I was dealing with it in the past. Every export of NSO or [such companies] needs an export licence of the Israeli government. We grant this export licence only [for] exporting to governments,” the envoy said in response to questions on the Pegasus issue at his first news briefing after presenting his credentials.“This is the only main requirement that... under the requirements, they cannot sell it to non-governmental actors. What’s happening here in India is an internal thing for India and I [would] rather not go into your internal matters,” he said.The Supreme Court on Wednesday said that the technical committee will go into issues related to the right to privacy, procedure followed for interception, and involvement of foreign agencies in conducting surveillance on Indian citizens.The Pegasus row erupted on July 18 after an international consortium of media outlets and investigative journalists reported that the phones of Indian ministers, politicians, activists, businessmen and journalists were among the 50,000 that were potentially targeted by Pegasus, NSO’s phone hacking software.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pegasus-spyware-issue-is-india-s-internal-matter-says-israel-s-envoy-naor-gilon-101635407445263.html

The focus will be on the rebel group of 23 senior Congress leaders, dubbed G23, who came together last year to openly seek a rejig of the party structure, as the Congress gears up for the 2022 organisational elections.The elections will start at the block level, then go up to the state level, before culminating into polls for the overall party president, the Congress working committee (CWC) and the central election committee (CEC).In mid-October, the Congress party finalised the election schedule that will start on April 16 next year, kicking off with polls for the block-level committees.The district-level committees will be elected by July 20, while the state-level bodies, known as Pradesh Congress Committees, will be picked by August 20.The much awaited election for overall party president will take place by September 20 next year.The G23 leaders will need support from the party’s state units to push their luck in the elections for the CWC and the CEC.Nearly the entire Congress working committee wanted Rahul Gandhi to take over as the next president. Rahul Gandhi, the previous Congress president, resigned after the party’s debacle in the 2019 general elections.The party elections are significant as the G23 leaders wrote to Congress president Sonia Gandhi last year, demanding a major reshuffle within the organisation. They also sought more say in the decision-making process.The party’s last organisational polls before the 2024 general elections also give the Congress scope to get battle-ready and find ways to settle issues with the G23 leaders.“To win any election, be it assembly or the Congress party’s internal polls, one needs popular votes. And that would be the biggest impediment for the senior leaders. All state units barring one or two are firmly with the ruling dispensation,” said a senior Congress leader.The leader said Ghulam Nabi Azad is likely to remain in the party’s apex executive body, but at least two other seniors, both Rajya Sabha members, face an uncertain future.“The G23 could have flexed some muscles in Punjab, but with the exit of Captain Amarinder Singh from the party and the appointment of Charanjit Singh Channi as CM and Navjot Singh Sidhu as PCC chief, things are firmly in control of the Congress high command,” said another Congress leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spotlight-on-g23-leaders-as-congress-gears-up-for-2022-organisational-polls-101635400845735.html

Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra threatened legal action leading to Dabur’s apology for “hurting people’s sentiments”.

All of Facebook’s products — the eponymous social media service, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, will continue under a new corporate parent. The move mirrors what Google did in 2015 when it set up Alphabet as the umbrella entity. Mr Zuckerberg said Meta represents the next stages of Facebook’s evolution into a “metaverse” company. Zuckerberg demonstrated use cases, depicted by computer-generated imagery (CGI), of how it will bring people together in virtual reality to “play, work, shop, create” and more. He announced some projects and products, most of which appeared centred around improvements to the Oculus Quest, a virtual reality (VR) headset, and its ecosystem that Facebook has developed.
